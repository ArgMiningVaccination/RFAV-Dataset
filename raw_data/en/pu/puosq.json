Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Mar 2011 Last Revised: Jul 2018 Review Date: Jul 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Kevin Merkel Contact Title: Senior Director-Payroll and Total Rewards Contact Email: Kevin.Merkel@ohr.gatech.edu Policy Statement: Georgia Tech is committed to providing a competitive staff compensation program that will attract, retain, motivate, and reward a qualified, diverse workforce at all levels. This Policy is not intended to be a contract of employment, express or implied, between any employee and the Institute. Scope: In Scope This salary administration plan covers all staff employees across the Institute. Out of Scope This salary administration plan does not cover faculty, research faculty, affiliates, or temporary employees. Procedures: Georgia Tech strives to ensure that compensation decisions are made as objectively as possible without consideration of a person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability or genetic information. Our compensation system will be supported by reliable market data, internal equity reviews, and performance evaluations. Implementation of policies and procedures pertaining to payment of salaries is contingent upon funds being available. AVP-HR Responsible for design and oversight of all Human Resources programs, including compensation. Ensure all hiring managers are aware of the policy. Provide guidance management on appropriate application of the policy. Ensure that an appropriate process or institutional level policy is in place to facilitate fair and equitable evaluations of requests to extend offers above the minimum of a salary range. Ensure requests are properly evaluated and administered in accordance with policy and applicable federal and state laws. Ensure appropriate documentation is maintained when necessary. Georgia Tech Human Resources (GTHR) Compensation Department 5 / 217Employment GTHR's Compensation team provides consultation services regarding interpretation and use of market data, compensation program design, and salary/equity studies. To ensure consistency of application, only market data reviewed and incorporated into GTHR databases will be used in making market determinations. Responsible for monitoring consistent application and interpretation of compensation policy and procedures covering staff positions. The Office of Human Resources will conduct an independent analysis of salary survey data, internal equity considerations, recruitment, retention, and turnover statistics; and compile and analyze any additional information considered beneficial in determining whether there is sufficient justification for approval of the request. 1.Application of the job evaluation system in determining value of each staff position in the organization relative to all other staff positions; 2.Developing, recommending, and revising structures and ranges to adapt to markets where Georgia Tech competes for talent; 3.Monitoring and reporting on external markets relative to internal compensation practices; 4.Maintaining job titles, job descriptions, and job families in alignment with GT career and pay philosophy; 5.Providing management with guidelines regarding the administration of compensation at the department/school level, and; 6.Ensuring compliance with Federal, State and local regulations. Departmental Human Resources Representatives Responsible for local administration of this policy within unit(s) supported. Supervisors and Managers Responsible for implementing and supporting the Institute's compensation program and policy. Supervisors/managers are responsible for the following: 1.Differentiating levels of performance demonstrated by employees, and recognizing differences through performance evaluations. 2.Maintaining accurate, up-to-date documentation on employee performance to support the performance review cycle and possible merit increases. 3.Communicating the following information to their subordinate employees: The performance management process, The relationship of performance to pay, Salary potential for the employee's position, Eligibility to receive overtime payments based on exempt or non-exempt status under the FLSA designation determined by job evaluation, Job descriptions and the employee's strategic objectives supporting the organization. General Considerations for All Pay Actions Salary and wage adjustments will generally be awarded to employees at the Institute upon promotion to a higher level position, upon reclassification to a higher level position, when an equity or administrative adjustment is deemed necessary, and on an annual basis provided performance warrants the adjustment. The annual increase will be in the form of a merit increase and developed in conjunction with the budget development process. Equity adjustments may also be developed in conjunction with the budget development process. All adjustments are contingent upon available 6 / 217Employment funding. For all pay and grade transactions, the local Human Resources representative and department manager will collaborate to develop an appropriate salary recommendation within the new grade, based on factors such as an employee's skill, knowledge, experience, and performance, criticality of the role, budget, and market data. GTHR Compensation will work with the local Human Resources representative and department to facilitate a pay action reflective of other employees in the unit, as well as across campus for similarly classified jobs. The effective dates of the pay action will be aligned with a future pay period begin date corresponding with the individuals pay frequency. All market adjustments and equity adjustments are subject to Georgia Tech Human Resources approval as well as budget constraints. Additional guidelines are available for hiring managers to assist in determining the appropriate pay for employees within the market reference ranges. Collaboration with Human Resource Business Partners and Compensation Team is recommended when establishing pay. Maximum Salary Administration Each year, the University System Office of Fiscal Affairs issues a salary administration statement that provides guidelines for awarding salary increases for that fiscal year. Salary increases which result in a cumulative fiscal year adjustment equal to or exceeding ten percent above the USG's annual salary and wage guidance percentage, and do not require the Chancellor's approval, must be approved by the President or his/her designee. Cumulative fiscal year adjustments include all pay actions such as merit adjustments, promotions, position reclassification, counter-offers, in-range adjustments, temporary pay. USG employees shall be paid exclusively by the USG institution(s) from state appropriations and/or other appropriate fund sources held by the institution for work performed on behalf of their USG position. Incentive Programs The Institution may establish incentive compensation programs consistent with state law, Board Policy, and applicable procedures, however, institutional incentive compensation programs must be reviewed and approved by the USG Offices of Fiscal Affairs and Georgia Tech Human Resources. Starting Pay To ensure internal equity, starting salaries for external hires are determined based on the applicant's prior experience, skills or education directly related to the position. For starting pay purposes, external hires includes transfers from other USG schools. Temporary and student workers transitioning to a regular staff or faculty role will be subject to salary increase administration rules for current employees. Starting pay must not be communicated to the candidate prior to gaining required approvals. New employees must start at no less than the minimum of the salary range for the position into which they have been hired. Starting pay that is above the midpoint of the salary range must gain prior approval from GT Human Resources. 7 / 217Employment Job Evaluations Georgia Tech Human Resources determines market rate, pay grade, title, and exemption status for each job by conducting a job evaluation. A job evaluation determines the level of a new or existing job and may be requested by a unit manager/supervisor and Human Resources representative when circumstances warrant. Refer to the Compensation Section of the GTHR website for the process related to job evaluations: http://www.ohr.gatech.edu/compensation When a Human Resources representative and manager agree a job evaluation is warranted, they must complete a job (re)evaluation request form ( Job Evaluation Tool ) and obtain necessary departmental and budget approvals. The request is forwarded to the GTHR Compensation team for review. The salary change tool helps management think through how to appropriately set an employee's salary taking into account various criteria. After plotting each of the criteria, a pattern will develop which pattern will help in developing an appropriate increase recommendation. Salary and Career Growth Opportunities The compensation program is designed to reward staff members for developing skills and competencies in their current jobs. It also supports career development by giving a staff member the opportunity to move into a different job within a career path. Many who join the Institute enjoy long and successful careers. The staff compensation program helps to make this possible by providing opportunities including the following: Salary growth\u2014rewarding staff monetarily for significant contributions and increased skills/competencies while working in their current job\u2014based on changes related to the individual Career growth\u2014recognizing and promoting staff for meaningful or significant job changes with increasing job responsibilities\u2014based on changes related to the job Promotion A promotion is the shift of an employee from one job title or position to another having an increased level of responsibilities associated with a different pay grade with a higher minimum rate of pay. To be promoted, the employee must meet the minimum job qualifications or minimum hiring standards required by the new job title. Departments will adhere to the Maximum Salary Administration guideline. Definitions Promotion : A shift of an employee from one role to another having an increased level of responsibility associated with a higher pay grade or if across salary structures, associated with a range with at least a 10% higher minimum rate of pay. Minimum Hiring Standard : The minimum threshold of education and experience required to perform a given 8 / 217Employment job. Reclassification : A change in a role that results in the employee and/or position being assigned to a different job title and job code. For the purposes of this policy, a reclassification that results in the employee being assigned to a classification level that is assigned to a higher pay grade or if across salary structures, assigned to a range with at least a 10% higher minimum than the former role is considered a promotion. Reorganization : The restructuring of an organizational unit, which may result in one or more of the following: addition or elimination of responsibilities that impact the structure and scope of the unit, change(s) in reporting relationships within the unit that impact occupied positions, a significant increase in the number of positions, or a reduction in force. As part of a reorganization, a result may be a position assumes additional responsibilities such that the position is reclassified to a higher level or movement of an employee to a higher level position in accordance with reorganization plan. Promotional Increases When an employee is promoted or reclassified to a position in a higher classification, the employee will normally be awarded a promotional/reclassification increase. Determinations of the actual increase should consider relevant factors such as internal pay relationships and the individual's qualifications and experience for the position. Promotional and reclassification increases are subject to availability of funding. Each employee situation is unique, so it is important to consider multiple factors when making pay decisions related to promotions. The Human Resources representative and department manager will collaborate to develop an appropriate salary recommendation within the new grade, based on factors such as an employee's skill, knowledge, experience, performance, criticality of the role, budget, and market data. Not all promotions will result in a pay increase. Promotions may come in the form of reclassification, reorganization, or through competitive recruitment. Departments will adhere to the Maximum Salary Administration guideline. Promotional increases above 9.9% percent, or the minimum of the new pay range, will require additional justification and review and approval by HR. Increases will be capped at the pay range maximum and are subject to management review and approval, department budget and Human Resources. Newly promoted or hired employees are generally ineligible for a subsequent promotion or a lateral move (unless within their own unit) until completion of one year of continuous service in that position. Newly promoted individuals' salaries should align within Tier 1 of their corresponding salary structure. Exceptions to this policy are as follows: 1.The individual's current work is to be curtailed. 2.All available employees with at least one year of service have been considered and rejected for the position. 3.Situations in which the unit leadership of two groups mutually agree to a transition to the benefit of the Institute. Equity and Market-Based Salary Adjustments Market Adjustment - Market adjustments are salary adjustments for an employee or group of employees that have fallen behind in base salary as compared to similar positions on campus and/or in the market. Market adjustments do not occur in conjunction with a change in title, grade, or FLSA status. Rationales for considering an equity adjustment are: 9 / 217Employment Consideration of a more appropriate alignment between the salaries of similarly situated employees performing work at the same family, sub-family, career stream and career level, with similar levels of experience, background, and performance. OR: Consideration of a more appropriate alignment between the salaries of a supervisor and their direct reports. OR: Consideration of a more appropriate relationship between the salaries of existing employees and the relevant market. Any adjustment that is given to bring employees in line with the external market is subject to internal equity. Adjustments will not be made if differences are explainable based on qualifications, type or length of experience (both internal and external to the Institute), the work itself, and/or performance and productivity. All market adjustments are subject to Human Resources approval as well as budget constraints. Additional guidelines are available for hiring managers to assist in determining the appropriate pay for employees within the market reference ranges. Collaboration with Human Resource Business Partners and Compensation Team is recommended when establishing hiring pay.When this occurs, engage a GTHR Compensation Consultant for guidance. Departments will adhere to the Maximum Salary Administration guideline.The recommended salary is subject to HR review. Official Institution sanctioned salary survey data and the employee's personnel record, experience and credentials will be evaluated. Increases will be capped at the pay range maximum and are subject to management review and approval, department budget and Human Resources. Administrative Adjustments In order to correct an administrative oversight, and subject to funding availability, the Director of Human Resources or his/her designee may approve a corrective adjustment to an employee's rate of pay. Retention Internal: Employees may seek employment offers within the Institute. The Institute discourages employees from seeking employment offers with the specific goal of obtaining a counteroffer from the Institute. Counteroffers from Georgia Tech should be rare and unusual, and in all cases, will require approval of the Vice Provost, Vice President, Dean, similar level title, or higher (depending upon circumstance) and the AVP of Human Resources or designee. If approved, the employee's current department may make a counteroffer up to the hiring department's salary offer for a similar level role, with prior approval at the organization level. Neither the employee's current department nor the hiring department can offer more than the hiring department's original salary offer. The employee then determines if they want to accept the hiring department's offer or accept the counteroffer to remain in current position and department. External: Current department is provided a signed offer letter or e-mail from an authorized representative of the competing external employer. Employee's current organization and department determine if a counteroffer will be made. Approvals will follow the salary approval matrix. No counteroffer may exceed the amount of the external offer. The department can negotiate with the individual, offering up to amount approved by GTHR. 10 / 217Employment Employee determines if they want to accept external offer or internal counteroffer. If external offer changes, the same process for approval of salary rate (described above) will still apply. Departments will adhere to the Maximum Salary Administration guideline. Temporary Pay and Interim Appointments The Institute recognizes the need to assign additional responsibilities of another position to an employee on a temporary basis and to make interim appointments. Reassignments as described in this policy shall normally be for no less than one month and no more than twelve months and shall only occur when the responsibilities being undertaken by the employee are those of another position that is vacant or because of temporary sufficient change in the duties and responsibilities of a filled position. Interim appointees are accountable for effective performance of the full scope of a leadership interim role identified by their manager at the time of the appointment. The interim assignment includes moving to a new title and position. When filling a role in this manner, the date exiting the interim assignment is to be determined at the onset of appointment and entered into the HR system via PSF by the local Human Resources representative. At the end of assignment, the unit may elect to remove the interim status of the individual and replace with another sourced candidate. If the employee is chosen through the recruiting process for the role on an on-going basis, transitioning from interim status requires removing the interim increase and then processing a promotional increase. If such a transition should occur, a GTHR Compensation Consultant should be engaged for guidance. If a non-exempt employee is chosen for an exempt interim assignment, we will not change their pay frequency or exemption status for the best outcome for the employee. We will use temporary pay instead of interim assignment in this instance. A temporary pay increase does not include a change in position or title and may be made when a significant change in duties and responsibilities occurs. Such pay increases may only be made if funding is available. The pay increase should be consistent with additional responsibilities assigned and with institutional salary guidelines; and should be approved by GTHR. Temporary pay increases will require justification and review and approval by HR. Department managers/supervisors initiating temporary duties or an interim appointment in their area of responsibility must submit a written proposal to the local Human Resources representative explaining the reason for the additional duties or appointment, the expected duration, resources required, method for evaluating successful performance, and criteria for selecting the employee. Departments will adhere to the Maximum Salary Administration guideline. Duration of reassignments as described in this policy shall normally be for no less than one month and no more than 12 months. Reassignment shall only occur when responsibilities undertaken by the employee are those of another position that is vacant or because of temporary, sufficient change in the duties and responsibilities of a filled position. A temporary pay increase may be made when a significant change in duties and responsibilities occurs. Such pay increases may only be made if funding is available. The pay increase should be consistent with additional responsibilities assigned and Institute salary guidelines. The pay increase should generally be at least the minimum of the salary range for the position for which the interim appointment is made. The former rate of pay will be re-assigned when the interim appointment or temporary duties are completed. 11 / 217Employment Demotions On occasion, an employee may be reassigned to a position in a lower grade. Demotions can occur for several reasons, but typically fall into two categories: voluntary or involuntary . A demotion may also occur for developmental reasons (e.g., gaining experience in another area), or can be as a result of performance in the current job. Voluntary: If the downgrade is voluntary (e.g., bidding on a lower level job), and the employee's current salary is within the new salary range, no change is necessary. If the current salary of an employee bidding on the job is above the new salary range maximum, their salary will be decreased to no more than the maximum salary rate for the new job on the effective date of the new job. Regardless of where the individual is in the new salary range, responsibilities, internal equity, and budgetary considerations will be considered and may result in a salary placed lower in the new salary range. No pay increases are allowed with a demotion. Involuntary: Performance-related demotions occur when employees demonstrate inability to perform their existing job duties at an acceptable level, and management determines the employee's skills may be more effectively used in a lower level job. On such occasions, if the employee's salary is above the salary range, the salary shall immediately be reduced to a level within the salary range of the new grade. Additionally, responsibilities, internal equity, and budgetary considerations will be considered and may result in a salary placed lower in the new salary range for any demotion. No pay increases are allowed with a demotion. Engage a GTHR Compensation consultant for guidance for demotions Same Structure Demotions : A demotion within a structure is a movement to a lower grade within the structure, (e.g., A6 to A4). Demotions between structures : When a demotion results in movement between salary structures (e.g., A7-I2), a decrease may be necessary to align pay within the new grade. When this occurs, engage a GTHR Compensation consultant for guidance. Salary will be capped at the pay range maximum and are subject to management review and approval, department budget and Human Resources. Reorganizations and Job Reclassifications Involuntary downgrades can also occur when a job is reassigned to a new grade due to reorganization or restructuring. The individual's salary may initially remain the same, but will be managed to the new grade salary range of the new job within a period of 1 year. Responsibilities, internal equity, and budgetary considerations will be considered and may result in a salary placed lower in the new salary range. No pay increases are allowed with a demotion. The local Human Resources representative and department manager will collaborate to develop an appropriate salary recommendation within the new grade based on factors such as: an employee's skill, knowledge, experience, and performance, criticality of the role, budget, and market data. The salary change tool outlines these factors and is to be used to formulate a recommendation. Transfers The Institute supports an environment that values the pursuit of career mobility and encourages employees who express an interest, and have the abilities, to pursue appropriate vacancies to foster their career development. To that end, employees' efforts to transfer from one position to another will be supported. 12 / 217Employment Transferring to another position is an opportunity for an employee to expand their depth of knowledge and increase their career development opportunities. Individuals asked to transfer for career development or business need purposes may be eligible for an increase. An employee may apply for a posted position in another department, at another University System of Georgia (USG) institution, at the USG office, or be identified for transfer when appropriate. Institutions shall have the discretion to transfer an employee when deemed appropriate. The employee will normally be awarded a promotional/reclassification increase when promoted or reclassified to a higher classification subject to the availability of funds. Considerations may be provided to remedy salary issues such as external market salary pressure in high demand skills, internal equity or salary compression, and/or countering an external offer. Justification must accompany a department's request for such adjustments, including specific outside salary offers in cases of retention, or a specific analysis of salary relationships in cases of correcting salary inequities.The increase request should consider relevant factors such as internal pay relationships and the individual's qualifications and experience. The recommended salary is subject to HR review. Official Institution sanctioned salary survey data and the employee's personnel record, experience and credentials will be evaluated. Increases will be capped at the pay range maximum and are subject to management review and approval, department budget and Human Resources. For the purposes of this policy, there shall be two types of transfers as follows: Internal Transfer The shift of an employee from one position to another within the same institution. For internal transfers to a position of the same grade or similar grade level across structures. External Transfer The movement of an employee from a position at one institution within USG to a position at another USG institution or to or from the University System Office is an external transfer. Since institutional compensation practices may differ due to market conditions, the transfer may be to a position at a different pay range. For compensation purposes, the external transfer is considered an external hire. For benefits, vacation and sick accruals, see employment policies. Merit Adjustments Each year, the University System of Georgia's Office of Fiscal Affairs issues a salary administration statement providing guidelines for awarding possible salary increases for that fiscal year. Merit is contingent upon available funding. Merit increases are typically authorized at the beginning of a fiscal year and are subject to salary limitations and guidelines established each fiscal year. Annual salary increases are merit-based, reflecting each employee's performance as evaluated by their supervisor. Merit increases will generally be distributed on a percentage basis around the average percentage increase as provided for by state appropriations. Merit salary increases that exceed the range established by the salary administration statement must be documented on an individual basis and must be approved according to the guidelines for that year's merit process. The Institute's compensation programs are designed to recognize and reward staff members based on individual performance. Most salary actions, including merit increases, salary adjustments and position reviews, will typically 13 / 217Employment occur on a coordinated basis during the annual Salary and Performance Management Review Process. Funds available for merit increases vary from year to year depending upon budgetary considerations, salaries paid in the identified marketplace, and economic conditions. The Institute develops merit increase guidelines which establish ranges for individual increases based on several factors: Individual performance during the most recently completed calendar year Individual's current salary compared to the salary range for the job or place in range (PIR) Consideration of salaries and qualifications of peers in comparable positions Available Budget Merit increases are normally awarded on an annual basis during the Salary and Performance Management Review Process. Merit increases are recommended by supervisors based on their evaluation of performance and other salary considerations. Staff members hired within the 6 months prior to the merit effective date will normally not receive a merit increase that year. Increases will be capped at the pay range maximum and are subject to management review and approval, department budget and Human Resources. Timing of Pay Adjustments Retroactive pay adjustments impose significant risk and costs within the Institute and University System of Georgia Health Care System in terms of money, employee relations and administrative time. Therefore; the following types of transactions are not permitted: Retroactive adjustments to hourly or monthly rates of pay Retroactive effective date changes for position reclassification Retroactive transfers of employees between positions or departments Retroactive transfers of employees between the faculty/staff and biweekly payrolls as well as the faculty/staff and non-compensatory payrolls It is imperative that no commitments regarding the effective date for pay adjustments be made to employees until written authorization is received from the appropriate budgetary and human resource offices. All appropriate paperwork should be completed and processed in advance of the effective hire or status change date. In all cases, the required adjustment should be effective with the beginning of the next pay period after written authorization has been received. Retroactive adjustments in funding sources (which do not impact pay rates or classifications) are not impacted by this change. Rare exceptions to policy will be handled on an individual basis, and will require the approval of GTHR. Approved pay adjustments of this rare occurrence type will be made in the following on-cycle pay period. Advanced Salary Increase Requests Institutions may adjust employee compensation as a result of multiple factors to include merit adjustments, promotions, 14 / 217Employment position reclassification, counter-offers, in-range adjustments, etc. Employee compensation adjustments are an institutional decision and should be consistent with the approved institutional compensation plan. However, cumulative fiscal year adjustments greater than or equal to ten percent above the USG's annual salary and wage guidance require advanced approval by the Chancellor other than the instances indicated below. The following salary increases greater than or equal to ten percent above the USG's annual salary and wage guidance do not require the Chancellor's approval: Results in a salary below $100,000. A promotional increase at or below the mid-point of the salary grade for the new job classification. Salary increases which result in a cumulative fiscal year adjustment equal to or exceeding ten percent above the USG's annual salary and wage guidance percentage, and do not require the Chancellor's approval, must be approved by the President or his/her designee. Each institution must have policies and procedures in place for the analysis and approval of all salary increases. Documentation must include justification that explains in detail the purpose and amount of the increase requested and approval signatures. The Office of Human Resources will conduct an independent analysis of salary survey data, internal equity considerations, recruitment, retention, and turnover statistics; and compile and analyze any additional information considered beneficial in determining whether there is sufficient justification for approval of the request. All cumulative fiscal year adjustments approved at the institution which are greater than or equal to ten percent above the USG's authorized annual salary percentage increase wage guidance must be reported on a quarterly basis to the USG Office of Human Resources. Communicating Pay Adjustments Supervisors or managers should not commit to any change in salary or compensation of an employee without concurrence of GTHR and the appropriate departmental, Institute, or USG level approval. The Institute is not bound to any agreement made by a supervisor who has not obtained proper approvals. Exceptions to this policy may be approved in unusual circumstances by the head of GTHR Total Rewards and the AVP of Human Resources, with the support of the appropriate EVP, or Office of the President where the approval is given in writing and such exception does not violate other policy within Georgia Tech, the University System of Georgia, or related laws. Background Checks Any existing employee being transferred, reassigned, reclassified or promoted is subject to a background screening unless a background investigation conforming to this procedure has been performed within the past year. Employee Relations will be engaged to address background searches resulting in an adverse condition. 15 / 217Employment Forms: JobEvaluationTool.doc Salary Change Tool.pdf Form Links: Georgia Tech Human Resources Forms and Guides Responsibilities: Related Information: Job Structures and with related Market Reference Points: BCAT Job Classification BCAT Job Classification Human Resources Administrative Practice Manual Classification, Compensation, and Payroll: Promotions Human Resources Administrative Practice Manual Classification, Compensation, and Payroll: Wage and Salary Administration Policy USG JOB CATEGORIES (\"B-CATS\") Compensation Program Review & Approval Policy No: 4.2 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Feb 2008 Review Date: Dec 2018 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Kevin Merkel Contact Title: Senior Director-Payroll and Total Rewards Contact Email: Kevin.Merkel@ohr.gatech.edu Policy Statement: The Compensation Program Review & Approval process provides a means of periodic internal management assessment of the Institute's policies, procedures and practices covering its compensation programs thus ensuring that those programs are properly designed and administered. Compensation programs consist of those covering academic faculty, research faculty and professional/administrative and other staff. Procedures: Annually, the Office of Human Resource will coordinate the production of a written report on the condition of the Institute's compensation program to include those covering research faculty and classified personnel. The OHR Compensation staff will compile and report on comparisons of actual pay practice (salaries being paid) for research faculty management and professional level personnel as well as various levels of classified management and staff to appropriate external markets. The report may also include comparison of additional elements of compensation such as supplemental pay and benefits. This report will be completed in March of each year and cover current conditions as well as those of the previous twelve months. The report will include an executive summary and be addressed to the President, the Provost & Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Executive Vice President for Administration & Finance. 16 / 217Employment The report will include: 1.Background materials on what policies and procedures are currently in place for monitoring and controlling academic faculty, research faculty and classified staff compensation including Board of Regents policies and Board of Regents reporting requirements. 2.Comparative data to include compensation survey data covering faculty and staff practices of peer institutions and general industry. 3.Analysis and recommendations for adjustments and modifications to existing practices to maintain or improve competitive posture relative to applicable markets. With regard to compensation paid to academic faculty personnel, the Institute Research and Planning Office will prepare and analyze comparative data on external pay practices for academics which will then be reviewed by Deans and School Chairs. Upon review, the President in consultation with the Provost & Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Executive Vice President for Administration & Finance and others that may be designed by the President, will assess the status of compensation programs currently in place and take whatever action deemed appropriate to correct, maintain or improve those programs. Additionally, compensation programs will be subject to review and reporting by the Institute's Internal Audit organization. Responsibilities: The Office of the President provides oversight and guidance to the Compensation Program Review & Approval Process. Specifically, the President assisted by the Provost & Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Executive Vice President for Administration & Finance periodically review all existing and proposed compensation policies, authorize corrective actions and approve new programs as appropriate. Additionally, the Office of the President may appoint other senior level administrators and faculty to review and advise on programs related directly to their areas. Extra Compensation Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Dec 2016 Last Revised: Aug 2018 Review Date: Dec 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Kevin Merkel Contact Title: Sr. Director-Payroll & Total Rewards Contact Email: kevin.merkel@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: Institute personnel, to include staff, academic faculty, and research faculty, may be paid extra compensation for performing certain duties in addition to their normal job responsibilities. This Policy is intended to augment applicable Board of Regents (BOR) Policy and Procedures and 1) describes when extra compensation from Georgia Tech may be allowable, 2) establishes a consistent approach to setting compensation for additional duties, and 3) sets limits so such activities do not interfere with the normal work of the employee. Policy Statement: Extra compensation for certain activities may be paid in accordance with the criteria described in the BOR Business Procedures Manual, Section 5.3.2, Extra Compensation. 17 / 217Employment In accordance with Board of Regents policy, and absent special program approval granted by the BOR, extra compensation may be paid to employees for tasks performed (services rendered) outside their normal business hours for duties not included in the employee's normal job responsibilities, provided the following three criteria are met: 1.The task(s) must be outside of the employee's regular department. See FAQ section. 2.The Extra Compensation Departmental Agreement Form must be completed and routed for signatures by the appropriate department heads prior to commencement of activities of the employee. 3.The employee must meet at least one of the following criteria (from the Official Code of Georgia Annotated Section 45-10-25): Chaplain Firefighter Dentist Certified Oral or Manual Interpreter for Deaf Persons Registered Nurse Licensed Practical Nurse Licensed Physician Psychologist Teacher or Instructor of an evening or night course or program (see additional rules applicable to Professional Education Courses included below) Professional holding a doctoral or master's degree from an accredited college or university Part-time employee An employee meeting all three criteria listed above may be paid extra compensation for a task providing: The task is not part of their normal job responsibilities; The task is outside their department; The task is not during their normal job hours or if the task is during their normal job hours and the employee takes annual leave for the portion of time being used for the task receiving extra compensation. Also, an employee meeting all three criteria listed above may be paid extra compensation for a task for another department during normal job hours if the task is not part of the employee's normal job responsibilities, and the employee takes annual leave for the portion of time that is being used for the task receiving extra compensation. Employees that have been determined by the institution to be non-exempt, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and are performing extra duties qualify for overtime pay. Please consult the SSC regarding clarification of overtime pay requirements. Non-exempt employees should be paid at least the overtime rate or more. Under no circumstances should an employee receive extra compensation for a task while receiving normal compensation for the same time period. Extra compensation does not add to earnings used for retirement calculations, and no retirement deductions are taken from extra compensation pay . Classified staff and employees who accrue annual leave are not permitted to take consulting leave. Only faculty who do not accrue annual leave may report their leave as consulting for time spent on approved outside professional activities. For more information on Consulting, refer to Georgia Tech Policy 5.6.5 Consulting and 5.4 Conflict of Interest Employees receiving extra compensation shall be paid said extra compensation through the institutional payroll. Such compensation shall be subject to existing federal and state regulations as to taxability and/or withholding taxes. No compensation, as defined above and paid to employees who are on the institutional payroll, shall be paid as per diem 18 / 217Employment and fees or as stipends. Cross-school instruction and work for research centers/institutes, when outside one's home department, typically involves tasks considered part of an individual's normal job responsibilities and therefore would not qualify for extra compensation. Based on the criteria above, instances where extra compensation for staff is allowable for performing different tasks are not common. Whenever there is uncertainty by the providing department as to whether tasks qualify for extra compensation, the supervisor should seek guidance from their School/unit's leadership, appropriate Vice President/Provost, Faculty Affairs, or Georgia Tech Human Resources' Payroll and Total Rewards Department. Extra compensation does not add to earnings used for retirement calculations, and no retirement deductions are taken from extra compensation pay. Employees receiving extra compensation are paid through the Institute's payroll. Such compensation is subject to existing IRS regulations as to taxability and/or withholding taxes. No compensation, as defined above and paid to employees who are on the institutional payroll, shall be paid as per diem and fees or as stipends. University System of Georgia (USG) Dual Employment Agreements are subject to the same general rules governing extra compensation. In these agreements, extra compensation is paid by the providing institution (employee home) to the employee and reimbursed to the providing institution by the institution requiring the service (the host institution). Payment for the performance of an employee's normal job duties is typically reimbursed to the home institution by the host institution using the employee's standard base rate of pay plus applicable fringe benefits. Not all Dual Employment agreements involve extra compensation. Compensation Rates In order to ensure additional duties do not interfere with the performance of normal job responsibilities, total extra compensation for both sponsored and non-sponsored activities shall typically not exceed 30% of the employee's expected regular annualized compensation. In unusual cases when extra compensation is anticipated to exceed the 30% threshold in a fiscal year, additional justification and advance approval by the Provost or appropriate Executive Vice President depending upon the employee's home department/unit is required. Compensation paid for sponsored activities must be consistent with applicable external rules, regulations, and award terms and conditions. Additional Requirements - Professional Education Courses Professional education activities should be in compliance with the Faculty Handbook: Section 4.6, Georgia Tech Professional Education . GTPE is the Requesting Department for all professional education activities, and compensation paid for professional education activities shall be established based on the following criteria: Compensation paid for a sponsored activity must be consistent with the terms and conditions of the award and Federal or other rules applicable to the sponsoring agency or organization. Absent sponsor restrictions, compensation rates should be in line with salaries paid to faculty in the discipline being taught. Rates may be adjusted based on the type of course (e.g., non-credit courses vs. professional masters). Rates should be expressed as a lump-sum payment for the course being taught rather than as an hourly rate. Extra compensation may neither be contingent on a program's revenues nor based on a percentage of income generated by the activity. Prior to extra compensation being paid, the appropriate department head must complete, sign, and return the Departmental Agreement Form (DAF) to GTPE. See the Flow Chart for DAF process guidelines. The department head is responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy in terms of allowableness, individual amounts, and rates. Scope: This policy applies to Institute personnel to include staff, academic faculty, and research faculty, who, by virtue of their 19 / 217Employment education, training or experience are selected to perform additional duties and in accordance with other BOR applicable policies. This policy does not address additional or specific policies related to Summer Salary Arrangements, External Consulting by Faculty, Dual Appointments (formerly Joint Staffing), Moonlighting, Temporary Assignments, or Acting/Interim Title pay adjustments. For purposes of this policy, prizes and awards received are not considered extra compensation and are not considered part of an individual's regular annual salary. Those matters are governed by separate policies and rules. See Section 10 - Related Information. This policy does not apply to Overloads for Academic Faculty. Board of Regents Academic and Student Affairs Handbook: Section 4.10 Faculty Overloads and Instructional Staff Responsibilities discourages the payment of extra compensation for overloads. The policy advises that when possible, workload adjustments should be made to encompass the additional duties. If the school and college determine that a workload adjustment cannot be made, a request to pay overload compensation should be submitted to the Office of Faculty Affairs. Full-time faculty members with academic status, who are budgeted at 100% time for the full year may qualify for overload compensation. Approval must be obtained from the School Chair, Dean, Provost, and President prior to the start of the assignment Definitions Normal Job Responsibilities The duties outlined in the job description or work statement of a position currently held by an individual (employee). Professional Education Activities The instruction, laboratory supervision, design, marketing, coordination, evaluation, and other effort that faculty and administrators participate in to conduct Professional Education (GTPE) programs. Requesting Department The academic department or non-academic unit desiring to obtain or facilitate the services of an individual. If the details of the instance are known by the requesting department, it can describe why the services of the individual are needed on the Departmental Agreement Form. The requesting department may also describe why the instance is in the best interest of the Institute on the DAF. Providing Department The academic department or non-academic unit employing the individual. When an individual initiates the instance with extra compensation, the individual/providing department should complete the part of the DAF describing the details of and the reason why the services are needed. The supervisor of the individual being requested must provide a written statement that the individual is available to provide the desired services and the performance of the services will not detract from the individual's normal job responsibilities. Moonlighting Employees may pursue a variety of endeavors for financial gain that are not directly related to the person's field or discipline. These efforts are part of the non-faculty member's private life and do not come under Institute regulation for this policy. Such endeavors may be pursued only after the primary commitment to the Institute has been fulfilled. Procedures: 20 / 217Employment Departmental Agreement Form The Departmental Agreement Form (DAF) should be completed for each instance creating the need for extra compensation by the employee's home department (Providing Department) and the department receiving the services (Requesting Department) of the employee prior to provision of any services by the employee. Providing Department typically initiates the DAF process. If additional approval is required for an instance causing an individual's total extra compensation to exceed the 30% threshold in a fiscal year (July 1 through June 30), advance approval from the Provost or appropriate Executive Vice President shall be obtained and noted by signature at the bottom of the DAF. If similar instances, creating the need for extra compensation, are expected to occur over a period of time, a DAF may be completed for a period of time, rather than each instance (up to quarterly or a three-month period). For example, multiple short courses are going to be taught. Frequently Asked Questions: May I receive extra compensation for services performed outside my normal working hours for Georgia Tech affiliates that are separate 501(c)(3) organizations, such as the Athletic Association? Yes, faculty and staff may work outside their normal working hours for Georgia Tech affiliates such as the Athletic Association and receive compensation for those services. This type of compensation is generally considered a type of \"moonlighting\", is allowable, and would not count towards the 30% threshold. Are there exceptions to the three criteria above with regards to qualifying for extra compensation? There are a few situations where extra compensation is allowable even though the three criteria above have not been met. For example, some academic programs are allowed to pay faculty for instruction even though the faculty member may be performing the additional duties for their department. Examples include the Executive MBA, Evening MBA, GTPE Professional Master's, and the Online Master's Science - Computer Science. In these cases, the program has received approval from an authoritative body for extra compensation, the work is carried out in addition to a normal full load, the program generates sufficient tuition/fees in direct support making it self-sufficient and the additional duties are not so heavy to interfere with an individual's regular duties. Can I perform work for another Georgia Tech department and receive extra compensation if the funding source is a non-Georgia Tech funding source, such as the Georgia Tech Foundation? Only if the three criteria mentioned above are met. The funding source is not typically a determining factor on whether extra compensation is allowable. Do retirees classified as \"Retired but Working\" qualify for extra compensation? Pay rates for Retired but Working (RBW) employees should be established and approved based on specific duties to be performed during the stated period. For this reason, RBW employees are not eligible for extra compensation. For additional information about RBW reemployment, please visit the Retirees reference data on the GTHR website at: http://ohr.gatech.edu/employment/hiringtalent/retirees Form Links: Departmental Agreement Form Responsibilities: 21 / 217Employment 8.1. The Providing Department is responsible for initiating and completing their part of the Departmental Agreement Form. 8.2. Working with the Georgia Tech Human Resources as necessary, the Providing Department is responsible for ensuring the employee's extra compensation does not exceed the 30% threshold defined in this policy in any single fiscal year without additional approval as indicated below, point 8.3. 8.3. The Providing Department is responsible for attaching additional justification with the DAF and seeking advance signature approval by the Provost or appropriate Executive Vice President to exceed 30% of the employee's annual, regular compensation. Enforcement: Employees who receive extra compensation contrary to this policy may be in violation of O.C.G.A. Section 45-10-23 relating to unlawful conflicts of interest. Employees authorizing or receiving extra compensation in violation of this policy may be subject to discipline as provided in the Faculty Handbook and the Administrative Policies of the Institute. The Institute's Payroll Office along with the Division of Administration and Finance will periodically monitor extra compensation activity to ensure compliance in terms of allowableness, administration, and amounts/rates.

Biweekly full-time employees are allowed to work overtime with supervisory approval. Employees described above are covered by the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act in this manual under Compensation Administration, Section 4.0, Fair Labor Standards Act (Overtime for Employees), Procedure No. 4.9 . Research Faculty Compensation Administration Policy No: 4.3 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Feb 2008 Review Date: Jan 2019 Policy Owner: Research & Graduate Programs, Vice Provost & Dean Contact Name: Alex Council Contact Title: Executive Vice President of Research Contact Email: alex.council@provost.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: The Georgia Institute of Technology is committed to a Compensation Program for research faculty employees that is externally competitive, internally equitable, promotes retention of good performers and encourages exceptional performance. To this end, the program has been designed to attract and retain the quality and quantity of research faculty personnel required to collectively meet Institute objectives. Procedures: Compensation Administration Responsibilities The Research Faculty Employment unit of the Office of Human Resources (OHR) will be responsible for: 1.Developing and administering compensation policy and procedures applicable to research faculty personnel. 2.Monitoring and reporting on external markets relative to internal compensation practices. 3.Reviewing pay related transactions for research faculty personnel to ensure consistency with published policy. 4.Researching and analyzing published compensation survey data to ensure that proposed salary offers to candidates for open research positions as well as the pay practices for current research faculty are reasonable. Starting Pay Rates Education and Job Related Direct Experience Each open research faculty position is posted with specific requirements for level of education and the number of years of direct job related experience. 23 / 217Employment Assessment of an individual's qualifications begins with a review of the resume and application to determine the appropriateness of the proposed title and to determine if job qualifications are met. The results of an assessment of an individual's education, skills and experience as well as job responsibilities ultimately determine the pay rate that will be offered upon employment. Hiring Range In determining the appropriateness of a salary offer, data from the most recent Watson Wyatt Survey Reports is referenced. These reports cover professional, middle and top management compensation paid in various markets., The data is compared to the proposed candidate's degree level, degree major, and years since first degree, experience, knowledge, and responsibilities of the position being filled. Starting pay rates for new employees as well as those being promoted to a new position are normally set between the 25th percentile, and 75th percentile of survey data reported based on that individual employee's credentials. The positioning within that range is dependent upon the amount of directly related job experience beyond the basic job requirements that the incumbent brings to the job, as well as market demand for that individual's expertise and credentials. Processing Offer Rates A candidate's proposed offer rate will be included in the hiring package when it is forwarded by the hiring department/HR Representative to OHR. The offer rate will be reviewed by OHR - Research Faculty Employment. This review will determine whether the offer is within the hiring range as defined in this policy and appropriate to the candidate's education and experience or if it exceeds those guidelines. If OHR - Research Faculty Employment determines that the offer rate is within the guidelines, the hiring package is routed to the Vice Provost for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies for approval. If not, the hiring package is forwarded to OHR - Compensation for further review. OHR - Compensation will conduct an analysis of the offer relative to guidelines and special circumstances, usually including a discussion with the hiring department. OHR - Compensation will then document the analysis and forward to OHR - Research Faculty Employment with recommendation for approval or disapproval. OHR - Research Faculty Employment notifies the hiring department that either an exception is in order or that there appears to be no justification for the rate exceeding guidelines. Any appeals from the hiring department are routed to the Associate Vice President - Human Resources for disposition with the department and the Vice President for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies. Offers should not be extended until all required approvals have been obtained. Every effort will be taken to ensure the review process occurs in a timely manner. Monitoring Competitiveness Participating in and analyzing the results of compensation surveys is the primary means of monitoring the competitiveness of pay rates for research faculty personnel. Through this process, pay rates of research faculty personnel are systematically compared to appropriate external markets on an annual basis. The purpose of these comparisons is to ensure that the Institute's pay practice is maintained at competitive levels and where this is determined not to be the case, to take corrective action as appropriate. 24 / 217Employment Job Mapping Compensation comparisons are accomplished through a process of job mapping. Research faculty employees whose job assignments in terms of discipline, educational level, work experience and work assignment are similar to or essential the same as those contained in external survey organizational models and job descriptions are matched up or mapped. This process can apply to several research faculty personnel being mapped to a single survey job description or an single employee's job duties mapped to a single survey job description. Compensation Comparison As these matches are made, the pay rates of Institute research personnel are compared to the median of the survey job match within an appropriate market and differences noted. In this process, care is taken to ensure, to the extent possible, the appropriateness of the market to which comparison is made. Given that the source for attracting new and experienced research personnel may cover multiple geographic areas and organizational types, the national market for all survey participants is generally referenced for comparison purposes. Additionally, the compensation comparison process may include supplemental analyses related to additional cash compensation and benefits values associated with research personnel relative to comparable external market data. The results of the comparison process is summarized in tabular and report form and incorporated in the written report on Institute compensation referenced in Section 4.2 - Compensation Program Review and Approval. Pay Adjustments Promotions A promotion normally occurs during the annual research faculty peer reviewed promotion process. The annual promotion process is scheduled in conjunction with the beginning of the fiscal year (July 1). In any case, an established set of hiring or promotion criteria determines the research faculty title category, i.e., research engineer/scientist/technologist/associate, and level, i.e., I/II/Senior/Principal, to which the faculty member may be elevated. Merit Adjustments A merit adjustment may occur as a result of the demonstration of performance relative to job expectations as determined through an annual evaluation. The merit adjustment funding is a result of the actions of the General Assembly and Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. Merit adjustments are awarded on an annual basis following legislative and Board of Regents approval. There are no strict guidelines regarding the amount of merit increase that should be associated with a given level of performance. However, it is strongly encouraged that significant differences in performance should yield significant differences in reward. Lateral Transfers A lateral transfer occurs when an employee is moved to a research faculty position with the same level as the one previously assigned. The reasons for such action are: 1) a simple transfer from one position to another of the same level, particularly when funding ceases to exist in the position previously assigned, 2) the employee has bid for a research faculty position of the same level they currently occupy but in a different department 3) placement in a temporary assignment. Any requests for lateral pay adjustments should be referred to the Office of Human Resources prior to completing a PSF. Normally pay adjustments are not made as a result of a lateral transfer. Only in cases of extenuating circumstances will an adjustment be considered. Other Pay Adjustments Other pay adjustments include those for market equity, increased responsibilities and interim assignments. Requests for these type adjustments should be made in memo form to the Office of Human Resources and include an explanation of why the adjustment is necessary and, in the case of market equity, comparable survey titles matching the position in question. 25 / 217Employment Processing Pay Adjustments Processing Pay Adjustments (other than annual merit) Pay adjustments other than merit adjustments include transfers to interim positions, market adjustments, or acceptance of additional responsibilities and duties, etc. For these pay adjustments a Personal Services Form (PSF) and justification letter should be completed by the individual's supervisor, approved by appropriate unit management and routed to OHR - Research Faculty Employment. OHR- Research Faculty Employment will conduct an analysis of the requested adjustment relative to job responsibilities, market and internal equity and may require review by OHR - Compensation. Approval is then sought from the Office of the President, notification sent to the Board of Regents and forwarded to Payroll for processing. For pay adjustments that do not appear to be supported by market survey data, OHR- Research Faculty Employment or Compensation will contact the unit's Human Resources Representative and discuss the proposed adjustment. This will take in to account not only the market data but also the individual's credentials and experience. Adjustments that can not be resolved at this stage require final resolution by the Associate Vice President of Human Resources and if necessary, the Vice-Provost for Research as designee for the President. Pay adjustments are not to be discussed with the employee until all necessary approvals are obtained. Processing Pay Adjustments (annual merit) Annual merit adjustments are not processed using the PSF. The Budget Office is responsible for gathering, monitoring and routing documentation associated with these adjustments to Payroll. Communicating Annual Merit Pay Adjustments The supervisor should notify the employee in writing that the adjustment is forthcoming. This should occur no later than the effective date of the increase. A copy of the memo should be sent to OHR-Records for inclusion in the employee's personnel file.

Monthly, Academic, and Bi-weekly Payroll Schedules Policy No: 10.6 Type of Policy: Administrative Last Revised: May 2018 Review Date: Sep 2019 Name: Zachary Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: The purpose of this statement is to establish the schedules for the monthly and bi-weekly payroll cycles to be used by all areas served by the Payroll Office. Procedures: General Guidelines Definitions: On-cycle Payroll processes: The regularly scheduled biweekly or monthly payroll dates. On-cycle payments result in direct deposit. Off-cycle Payroll processes: Any payments made outside of the regularly scheduled on-cycle payroll process. Off-cycle payments result in manual checks. 28 / 217Employment 1.The Payroll Office is responsible for ensuring that all University employees are paid in a timely manner. To facilitate this, a time schedule for the various payrolls has been developed for the fiscal year and is included online. http://ohr.gatech.edu/payroll/paycheck 2.It is the responsibility of each college, department, and/or office to establish procedures and controls that will ensure compliance with established time frames. 3.Personal Services Forms and Time Documents submitted after the Payroll deadlines will require special handling. 4.Off cycle checks will be handled as follows: An off-cycle payroll check is a manual payment disbursed to an employee earlier than the established pay cycle. Off- cycle disbursements are an exception to regular payroll processing and should never be substituted for the timely processing of employee pay. Off-cycle checks should only be requested when a true financial hardship exists making it necessary for the employee to receive a check before the next on-cycle payroll. Departments may request off-cycle checks by submitting a payroll request to pay.ask@gatech.edu . (Please note this is not advance pay. The Institute does not advance pay to employees under any circumstances.) Employees should be informed that adjustments and additional pay will be included on their next regularly scheduled on-cycle payroll associated with their pay frequency. If the check is not picked up timely, it will be mailed to the employee's address of record. Frequency of Payment and Timing: Off-cycle checks will be paid within 2 - 3 business days. Any payments made by paper check may be picked up at Human Resources (500 Tech Parkway) only by the employee or authorized individual for each department. A request for off-cycle disbursements should meet at least one of the following criteria: Paycheck reversal due to employee overpayment Administrative error within GTHR payroll process. The employee has received less than 50% of their wages. The employee is owed 10 hours or more. The employee submitted their hours on time, but the time approver did not approve the hours on time. The employee has been involuntarily terminated. Off-cycle disbursements should not be processed for the following reasons: Retroactive pay. The employee is owed less than 10 hours.

Regulations and Guidelines Policy No: 10.2 Type of Policy: Administrative Last Revised: May 2008 Review Date: Sep 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Zachary Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: This procedure provides information regarding Internal Revenue Service, State of Georgia, and Georgia Tech regulations. Procedures: Payment to Employees for Personal Services According to Common Law Rule: \"Every individual who performs services subject to the will and control of employer, both as to what shall be done and how it shall be done, is an employee for purposes of all federal payroll taxes. It does not matter that employer permits employee considerable discretion and freedom of action, so long as employer has legal right to control both method and result of the services.\" Refer to the Accounts Payable Procedure Consulting - Attachment C to review the 20 factors developed by the Internal Revenue Service to aid in determining whether there is an employer-employee relationship. Students receiving Fellowships that require them to perform services should be aware that this income may be taxable. To ensure compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, and laws of the State of Georgia, Georgia Tech will purchase services from employees only through the payroll system. This arrangement precludes any type of contractual agreements with any University employee for payment of services other than through established payroll procedures. Payment for personal services will be made on regularly scheduled pay dates only. State regulations prohibit advance payments. Standard Workweek The standard workweek for non-administrative classified employees at Georgia Tech is 40 hours, from 12:01 a.m. Thursday through 12:00 midnight on Wednesday. If it is necessary for an employee's workweek to exceed 40 hours, the overtime must be pre-approved by the department head. Overtime Payment for Overtime 33 / 217Employment Any non-exempt classified employee of Georgia Tech (as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act) who is required to work more than 40 hours during a workweek will be paid at one and one-half times his/her standard rate for all work in excess of 40 hours, unless compensatory time is authorized. If an employee is paid on more than one account and the combined hour for the workweek exceed 40, the total pay will be prorated to each account based on the percentage of time reported per account to total time reported each workweek. Compensatory Time The Board of Regents Personnel Policies Handbook, Section II--Classified Employment states: \"In lieu of payment for approved overtime work, compensatory time may be granted at the rate of one and one-half hour of compensatory time for each hour of overtime work. Approved compensatory time is subject to a maximum accumulation of sixty (60) hours and must be expended by the end of the succeeding calendar quarter.\" Participation in research projects (Human Subjects) Payments under $75 per participant will be considered de minimis and not reported on a W2, 1042S nor 1099 Misc. Participants must pass the Selection of Human Subjects criteria: Full or part time employee of the Institute, Full or part time undergraduate student, Full or part time graduate student, provided the graduate student's funding department agrees that the student may participate in the research. Students who are on financial aid assistance, Non-Institute affiliated individuals. Salary Overpayment Repayment Process Policy No: 10.11 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Jun 2008 Review Date: Jan 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Zachary Contact Title: Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: A Salary overpayment condition arises when an employee has been compensated for more than their approved salary. This can occur due to late receipt of or late processing of the Personal Services Form (PSF). The causes for the overpayment include, but are not limited to: Termination Change in Percent Time Change of Pay Rate Change in Leave Status Policy Statement: Any salary overpayment paid to an individual must be refunded to the Institute immediately. If not, the following procedure will be initiated. Scope: Individuals Affected By This Policy Employees paid through the Institute payroll department, active or terminated. 34 / 217Employment Procedures: When PSF's are received in the Payroll Department, the effective date of the action is reviewed by payroll staff. If the action date has passed, a further review of payroll processing is initiated to determine if an overpayment appears to exist. The Payroll Department then calculates the salary overpayment and validates the existence with the department. Once acknowledged, a journal entry noting the employee name will be processed to establish the salary overpayment receivable. The debit entry will posted GT/FUND10010/129120/ and credit entry will be posted to the department project and account originally charged. If the overpayment was made to a student employee, the Bursar's Office will be notified and a \"financial hold\" will be placed on the student's account. The hold will prohibit the student from registering for future terms, receiving transcripts and receiving a diploma. Payroll will send a certified letter to the employee requesting immediate repayment (all communications to the employee will be copied to the department). When received, the repayment will debit the cash account GT/FUND/10010/118000 and credit the salary overpayment receivable account GT/FUND10010/129120. If the overpayment was made to an active employee, the next pay check will be decreased by the amount of the overpayment. If the overpayment was made to a terminated employee, a check will be immediately forwarded to the Payroll Department. If the repayment from the next available pay check would create a financial hardship, and there is no indication of fraud, Payroll may establish a repayment plan not to exceed 60 days. To maintain compliance with the Federal and State Department of Labor laws, Payroll will not pay an employee less than the current minimum wage, even if it extends the repayment period past the stated 60 days. If the overpayment was made to a terminated employee who has an Annual Leave Balance, the overpayment amount will be deducted from the employee's annual leave payout. The remaining leave balance will be paid to the terminated employee with the next available payroll process for their pay group. If the employee does not respond to the first communication, a second certified letter will be mailed in 30 days. If there is no response to the second letter, a third certified letter will be mailed at the 60 day mark. If at the end of 90 days, there is still no response, the employee name and salary overpayment amount will be sent to the Bursar's Office to be placed with a collection agency. The Bursar will debit the Salary Overpayment Bursar AR account GT/FUND10010/128001 and credit the Payroll salary overpayment account GT/FUND10010/129120. If the overpayment is for an employee in the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) or Auxiliary Services, the debit entry to the receivable (account 128001) will be posted in the corresponding fund code for that unit (i.e. FUND11021, FUND12210, FUND12250, etc.). At the time the account is placed with collections, the financial reporting Division for the unit with the overpayment (College or Major Administrative Division) will receive a decrease to their general operations budget for the same amount. If collection efforts are successful, the Division may seek additional budget authorization through the standard budget process for the net amount collected by GT if material. In lieu of a decrease to their general operations budget, GTRI and Auxiliary Services will be charged a bad debt expense once the uncollectible receivable is written off by the Bursar's Office. Contacts All questions concerning the Salary Overpayment Reimbursement policy should be directed to the Office of Human Resources Director of Payroll.ll Social Security Coverage Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Mar 1998 35 / 217Employment Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Policy Statement: All regular employees of Georgia Tech, except those specifically excluded under an agreement with the Social Security Administration, are covered by the Federal Social Security Act. Payroll deductions are made for the employee's share of the cost of this insurance, with the Institute paying a matching share. Eligibility Social Security coverage has been extended to the following classes of employees: 1.All employees eligible for the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia. 2.All employees eligible for the Regents Retirement Plan (ORP). 3.All full-time regular custodial and maintenance personnel. The following employees are not covered by Social Security: 1.All students -- undergraduate, graduate, graduate teaching, and graduate research. 2.All temporary, seasonal and hourly, employees. Note: These employees do pay the Medicare Insurance Portion of Social Security. 3.Non-immigrant aliens are exempt in accordance with the provisions of their visas. Student Pay Group Policy No: 10.4 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Apr 2008 Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Zachary Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: In order to comply with federal Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) regulations, no Georgia Tech employee, student or non- student, shall be hired concurrently in both a monthly paid exempt status plus a bi-weekly paid non-exempt status. Policy Statement: The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, record keeping, and child labor standards affecting full-time and part-time workers in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments. Covered nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage of not less than $5.85 per hour effective July 24, 2007; $6.55 per hour effective July 24, 2008; and $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Overtime pay at a rate of not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay is required after 40 hours of work in a workweek. In order to comply with federal Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) regulations, no Georgia Tech employee, student or non- student, shall be hired concurrently in both a monthly paid exempt status plus a bi-weekly paid non-exempt status. The Institute will derive the weighted-average pay rate based upon these concurrent hourly rates of pay and pay any overtime accordingly. If the student is paid as a monthly exempt employee, the percentage distribution will be utilized to 36 / 217Employment allocate their time worked to the hiring department and the associated account number. Policy Terms: Exempt employees (student or non-student, full time or part time) are paid monthly and are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and therefore not subject to overtime payments. Non-Exempt employees (student or non-student, full time or part time) are paid bi-weekly and are not exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and therefore are subject to overtime payments for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per work week. Our workweek is Thursday through Wednesday. Time worked does not include Holiday, Vacation or Sick pay. Procedures: All employees must be paid in only one pay group, either monthly or bi-weekly. For example: if a student is paid monthly and is hired into a concurrent job in a department that will pay them hourly on the bi-weekly payroll, the originating department will be notified by Payroll that the situation exists and the student will not be hired into the concurrent position until there is an agreement to make the student in one pay group, most likely hourly. When agreed upon, the Payroll Department will correct the PSF and process the transaction. Time Reporting Policy No: 10.8 Type of Policy: Administrative Last Revised: Apr 2007 Review Date: Sep 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Zachary Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: This procedure explains the process of reporting time worked. Procedures: Bi-weekly Time Document A preprinted form is used for time reporting for all bi-weekly paid employees. The Bi-weekly Time Document reports hours worked and other compensated time such as vacation, sick leave, jury duty, and holidays. A document is issued for each bi-weekly pay cycle, which ends midnight Wednesday . The top half of the form, the \"Time Report,\" is used by the employee and supervisor for recording the employee's time. The bottom half of the form, the \"Time Distribution,\" distributes hours to the appropriate accounts. Time Document Distribution The work department prints the time documents for their area and distributes to the employees. The original document is processed and maintained as a permanent record in the Work Department. 37 / 217Employment Forms A copy of the Time Document is available as a reference for the following instructions. This sample form has numbers written on it which correspond to the numbers in the instructions below. Preparation of the Time Document The following information is preprinted on the time document: 1.Employee's Name - last, first, middle initial 2.Employee's PeopleSoft ID# 3.Pay Period End Date - (MM/DD/YY, always Wednesday) 4.Work Department - department in which work was performed 5.Home Department - department that administers the employee and to which the employee is responsible. 6.Pay Group Description (i.e., Bi-weekly, Staff-Benefits) 7.Project Number 8.Hours Worked - standard hours worked for regular employees will be preprinted. If an account is to be added, hours redistributed, or other types of compensated hours reported, cross out the preprinted hours and write in the new distribution. 9.Days and Dates of each Week Errors and Omissions If any preprinted information is incorrect, draw a line through the incorrect data and write the correct information in the same space. If a preprinted time document is not available, use a blank form. Information to be Recorded by the Employee The employee must record the number of hours worked and/or compensated in the appropriate blocks as follows: Hours Worked - actual number of hours worked; partial hours should be entered to the nearest tenth of an hour, expressed as a decimal equivalent: .1 = 6 minutes .2 = 12 minutes .3 = 18 minutes .4 = 24 minutes .5 = 30 minutes .6 = 36 minutes .7 = 42 minutes .8 = 48 minutes .9 = 54 minutes Compensated Hours - vacation or sick hours Other Hours - time reported other than vacation hours, sick hours, or hours worked such as holiday, jury duty, or campus closed hours Other Hour Codes - codes for \"other hours\" paid are as follows: Hol = Holiday 38 / 217Employment Jry = Jury Duty CCD = Campus Closed CLL = Call Back Mil = Military Duty UNC = Uncompensated (Hours recorded in excess of vacation/sick balance(s) Totals - hours are totaled under each column and for each week in the first block Signatures - Manual Reporting Employee's Signature - must be signed by employee; an unsigned time document may result in a delay in receiving a paycheck. Time documents not signed by the employee are acceptable only when an employee is on an excused absence or is being paid in conjunction with termination of employment and is not available to sign the the report. For either exception, the supervisor should note the reason for non-signature in the signature space. Supervisor's Signature - the report must be signed by the Supervisor Electronic Signatures Employee's Signature - For those using time clocks or online entry, the use of the Buzz Card swipe and the logging into the secured system, capturing the login, date and time stamp, are considered as legal signatures. Supervisor's Signature - The supervisor's electronic signature is considered as a legal signature. This is in compliance with the Georgia General Assembly Code 10-12-4 (d), when a rule of law requires a signature, an electronic record satisfies that rule of law. Time Distribution The Time Distribution half of the form must be approved as preprinted; updated to reflect any differences in preprinted expense accounts and actual. In the case of a temporary employee, all time distribution must be recorded. Any expense accounts to be charged should be written in if they have not been preprinted. The total number of hours in the Time Distribution must agree with the total hours in the Time report. Authorization The department head or an authorized representative must sign the Bi-weekly Time Document. Space for a second department signature may be used at the discretion of the department head, if the guidelines of the department require it. Time Document Submission Departments will enter the Time Documents for the two weeks of the bi-weekly pay period no later than 5:00 p.m. on Friday following the bi-weekly period which ends on Wednesday at midnight. The ORIGINAL should be maintained in the Work Department. The Home Department copy should be forwarded to the employee's Home Department if different from the Work Department. Questions regarding completion of the Bi-weekly Time Document should be addressed to the Payroll representative responsible for bi-weekly payroll processing for your department. 39 / 217Employment Types of Payrolls Policy No: 10.5 Type of Policy: Administrative Last Revised: Feb 2007 Review Date: Sep 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Zachary Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: This procedure explains the various pay cycles and pay calculations. Procedures: Monthly Payroll Faculty, administrative personnel, salaried Graduate Assistants, Graduate Teaching Assistants, and Graduate Research Assistants, and employees exempt from coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act (Wage and Hour Law) are paid on the monthly payroll. Employees compensated on the monthly payroll are paid on the last workday or banking day of each month. If the last workday is an Institute or bank holiday, payment is made on the day before the holiday. Payroll Calculations Full Month Compensation (other than those on an Academic Contract) The amount of monthly compensation is equivalent to one-twelfth of the fiscal year annual salary. Partial Month Pay Calculation The number of days worked in a month is divided by the total number of workdays to determine a percentage of compensation for that month. Partial pay is calculated by multiplying the monthly rate by the percentage of compensation. Vacation Pay Upon Termination Terminating vacation pay is calculated by multiplying the daily rate by the total days of accrued vacation leave. The daily rate is computed by dividing the annual salary by 2,080 hours x 8. The maximum accrued leave that can be paid upon termination is 45 days. Academic Pay Cycle under the Semester System Under Georgia Tech's semester system, individuals paid on the academic pay cycle receive 10 monthly payments during the regular academic year. The academic year salary is paid out over the 10 months of the academic contract year: 1/18 of academic year salary in August, 1/9 of academic year salary from September through April, and 1/18 of the academic year salary in May. In other words, the employee receives 1/2 of a months pay in May and August, and a full months pay the other 8 months. The summer session is handled separately during the four months from May through August, with the May and August summer salary payments being added to the employee's regular academic year monthly salary, if any. AMN, AMG, RWA will follow proration rule, effective 08/01/02. 40 / 217Employment While the above describes the general rule of pay for the academic pay cycle, other job events do have a bearing on a particular individual's pay: pay increases for the new Fiscal Year, terminations, retirements, and leave all affect pay. The following describes in detail the pay rules for August and May under Georgia Tech's semester pay system. August Payment Rules August Pay for 9-Month (Academic Cycle) Instructional and/or Research Faculty, Post Docs, and Graduate Students will be paid in compliance with the 10-payment plan described above. The August Pay will reflect the Last Payment for the Summer Session and First Payment for the Fall Semester. Payment rules that will be applied are: 9 MONTH FACULTY: Instructional and/or Research Faculty with hired in August will be paid 1/2 of their monthly rate. Instructional and/or Research Faculty that are terminating, retiring, or on leave without pay effective the 1st day of the fall semester will be paid only the Summer Pay entered into the Summer Pay Panel or via pay.ask. If no Summer Pay has been entered or submitted via pay.ask, these employees will not be paid. GRADUATE STUDENTS PAID ON ACADEMIC PAY SCHEDULE : Graduate Students pay is prorated according to the number of days worked. The formula to calculate partial pay for August is: ____ # Days worked divided by Total # work Days in August = ____ % days worked ____ % Days worked times ____ Monthly Rate of Pay = _____August Partial Pay EX: Jamie Dollar's appointment date is effective 8/21/2006 and the monthly rate of pay is $1500.00. As a result, he will be paid 9 of 23 workdays in August. 9 divided by 23 = .313182 times $1500.00 = $586.96 Please forward all questions to pay.ask@business.gatech.edu Bi-weekly Staff and Student Payroll Employees, including students, covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and hourly appointments for employees exempt from the FLSA are paid bi-weekly. Hourly appointments of non-exempt staff assigned to a line budget position or a group budget position and hourly exempt staff are paid bi-weekly. Hourly appointments of Graduate Research Assistants, and Student Assistants also are paid bi-weekly. The annual salary is determined by multiplying the hourly rate x 2,080 hours. The gross amount of each check is determined by multiplying the hourly rate of pay by the number of hours reported on the bi-weekly time document. Pay dates are normally 7 work days after the pay period ends. If the pay date falls on a holiday, including bank holidays, payment will be made on the preceding workday. 41 / 217Employment Unclaimed Salary/Wage Checks and Advices Policy No: 10.10 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Oct 2005 Review Date: Jan 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Zachary Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: This documents the procedure followed by Payroll when unclaimed employee salary/wage checks are returned to the Payroll Department.

Provided services include, but are not limited to: psychosocial assessment for mental health problems such as depression, nervous or emotional disorders, and substance abuse; life transition assistance (divorce, retirement, marital distress, etc.); counseling; referral; case management; and follow-up. FSAP services also include supervisory and management consultation on work-life situations which may impair the functioning of a team or departmental staff. Although FSAP does not provide direct medical, financial, or legal services, it may be of assistance in obtaining referrals to appropriate professional provider(s). An employee's voluntary decision to seek assistance from FSAP will not be used as the basis for disciplinary action, and will not be a defense to the imposition of disciplinary action where facts proving a violation of university policy are obtained outside of FSAP. FSAP is staffed by an Employee Assistance Professional (EAP) counselor who is a licensed provider of mental health services in the state of Georgia. Procedures: Eligible Participants Eligible participants include all non-student faculty and staff of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia Tech Research Institute, their family members, and immediate significant others. Employees concerned about a problem are encouraged to contact FSAP. Supervisors are encouraged to contact FSAP regarding employees who may show substandard performance or unusual behavior on the job. Employees will be seen individually for problem assessment. If the problem should require additional professional services beyond the scope of FSAP - such as psychological or medical testing, and/or extended counseling - the Employee Assistance Counselor may recommend qualified clinicians, treatment facilities and/or agencies that the employee may access.

All employees on the Institute's payroll are protected under this plan, and benefits are paid to cover injuries resulting from work, whether that injury occurred on or away from the employee's normal work site. The three areas of responsibility, as they pertain to Workers' Compensation, are Human Resources, Environmental Safety, and Department of Administrative Services (DOAS)-Risk Management. Workers' Compensation information, forms and instructions on completing forms may be obtained by accessing the Benefits website at www.ohr.gatech.edu or by contacting the Office of Human Resources (OHR) at 500 Tech Parkway, Atlanta, GA 30332, (404) 894-3925. The Office of Human Resources assists campus units in complying with state and Institute policies and serves as official repository for all records pertaining to a given claim. OHR acts as liaison between the Georgia Department of Administrative Services and campus units to ensure immediate needs of injured worker are fulfilled. Finally, OHR assists employees who need to forward medical invoices and out-of-pocket expense receipts to the Georgia Department of Administrative Services for reimbursement. The Environmental Science, Health, and Safety Department will chart trends for the causes of work-related injuries and will develop and conduct remedial training programs where appropriate. Also, this department will conduct certain investigations relating to environmental causes or effects. DOAS--Risk Management will investigate all claims involving litigation or when third parties are involved. This department also reviews questionable claims, decisions to controvert, and requests for referrals to physicians not on the Institute's currently approved panel. The assignment of private investigators will be made at the sole discretion of this department. Finally, this department will have oversight on all claim expenditures. Procedures: If you are injured on the job, you must report the injury to your departmental supervisor immediately. Your departmental supervisor should report your injury to DOAS by calling 877-656-7475. Then call AmeriSys at 678-781-2848 or 800-900-1582 to talk to a case manager who will assist you in selecting a physician, scheduling an appointment and obtaining follow-up care. Emergency Care Procedure If, as a result of a work-related injury or illness, you require immediate medical attention, you should proceed to the nearest emergency medical care facility, or call 911 for assistance. Following your emergency admission, service or procedure you or your departmental supervisor must notify AmeriSys Managed Care of your injury by calling (678) 781-2848 or (800) 900-1582. If you require additional care, contact AmeriSys Managed Care at (678) 781-2848 or (800) 900-1582 and speak to a case manager who will assist you in selecting an authorized treating physician. Your authorized treating physician will then evaluate your treatment plan and make further recommendations. The week following your injury, your departmental supervisor should call DOAS at (877) 656-7475 to verify that the claim has been properly set-up. 47 / 217Employment TeleClaim Reporting Instructions Departmental supervisors should call DOAS TeleClaim (toll free (877) 656-7475, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) to report injuries within 24 hours of an accident.

Box Georgia 30334 (404) 656-6245 Flexwork Arrangements Policy No: 8.65 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Aug 2007 Last Revised: Jun 2015 Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources 48 / 217Employment Contact Name: Kim Harrington Contact Title: Associate Vice President-Human Resources Contact Email: kim.harrington@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: The Georgia Institute of Technology provides a variety of flexible working arrangements, at the discretion of department, to enable employees to serve customers, meet Institute and departmental goals, and balance personal and professional responsibilities. Participating in a flexible working arrangement is a privilege and not a right. Policy Statement: Flexible working arrangements are optional work arrangements that may be discontinued at any time. After consultation with the employee, managers determine the employee's work schedule and the employee must maintain the agreed upon schedule. The employee and / or the department may end the arrangement by providing written notice a minimum of 14 calendar days in advance. Flexible Working Agreements should be reviewed on an annual basis, and telecommuting agreements shall be limited to periods of no more than 12 months, and after review, may be extended annually in 12-month increments. Flexible schedules should not cause a non-exempt employee to work overtime or cause any employee to work on existing holidays or conflict with leave allocation practices. Exceptions should be approved in advance by the Chief Human Resources Officer. Occasionally, an adjustment in an employee's work schedule may be required on a short term basis and such adjustments would not be apart of the Flexible Working Agreement. Telecommuting is limited to Tech Temps and regular employees, who have completed the provisional employment period. One exception is that any Tech Temp or regular employee seeking accommodation under the American Disabilities Act may be considered for telecommuting if it provides a means of reasonable accommodation for the employee's needs. Such requests shall be made through the unit's HR Representative using the appropriate procedures for requesting reasonable accommodation (see Procedure 8.15, Campus Disability Compliance) and must be approved by the appropriate unit head or his / her designee. Policy Terms: Compressed Workweek A compressed workweek is the scheduling of a traditional 40-hour week into fewer than five full days by adjusting the number of hours worked per day. Two examples of compressed schedules are working four ten-hour days with one full day off each week or working 80 hours in nine days with one full day off during a two-week period. Flextime A work schedule with variable arrival, departure and / or lunch times. It is typically designed to enable employees to come in earlier or leave later than the organization's normal hours of operation. This approach enables the department to ensure necessary office coverage, customer service and staff interactions are maintained during the core hours. Job Sharing When multiple people share the responsibilities of one regular full-time position within a unit by each working part time. Telecommuting The performance of normal work duties at a location away from the conventional or main office. This off-site location is most often the employee's home, but can also be a satellite office or, if traveling, a virtual office. Telecommuting is a privilege and not a right for employees and should be reserved for those with proven expertise. Procedures: For any flexwork arrangement: 1.The employee should first schedule a time to meet with his / her supervisor to discuss the feasibility of a 49 / 217Employment Flexible Working Arrangement. 2.Based on the outcome of the discussion, the employee must complete the Flexible Working Arrangements Agreement and submit it to their supervisor. If the flexible working arrangement being requested is telecommuting, the employee must also complete the Telecommuting Agreement . The department's Human Resources Representative (HR Rep) is available for questions or to provide assistance in preparing the form(s). 3.The supervisor, in consultation with the department's HR Rep, may approve or deny the Flexible Working Arrangements Agreement and, if applicable, the Telecommuting Agreement proposed by the employee, or may recommend an alternate flexible working arrangement. In determining whether to approve or deny the proposed arrangement, the supervisor must consider the organization's goals and should approve the Agreement(s) only if the arrangement permits those goals to be achieved. If the employee and the supervisor do not agree on a flexible working arrangement, the employee will continue to work standard hours. 4.If an arrangement is agreed upon, the supervisor must submit the completed and signed Flexible Working Arrangements Agreement form and, if applicable, the Telecommuting Agreement, to the unit head for final approval. The unit head approving the agreement(s) may wish to consult with the department's HR Rep before making the final decision. Again, if a flexible working arrangement is not approved, the employee will continue to work standard hours. 5.If the arrangement is approved, the supervisor must send the completed and signed Flexible Working Arrangements Agreement form and, if applicable, the Telecommuting Agreement, to the department's HR Rep who will retain the original. The supervisor and the employee should retain copies. Retention of Agreement Forms HR Reps / HR Contacts should retain the Flexible Working Arrangements and Telecommuting Agreement Forms until superseded or obsolete. The last agreement(s) and related documents should be maintained by the department for two years after the agreement has concluded.

Policy Statement: Service to the Institute is valued and encouraged by Georgia Tech. Service to the Institute includes participation in Institute service programs or activities that are separate and in addition to the employee's ordinary job duties. Some examples include institutional governance, service as an advisor to one or more recognized student organizations, or participation in any other Institute service program. All such authorized activities shall be considered within the scope of the employee's employment. Policy Terms: Exempt and non-exempt employees are defined in accordance with prevailing employment law. An exempt employee is generally salaried and not employed on an hourly basis. Service to the Institute Although employees usually contribute to the Institute primarily through their job responsibilities in their home and work 51 / 217Employment departments, they may also contribute significantly to the development of Georgia Tech by offering appropriate services to the Institute in other parts of campus life. In the context of this policy, service to the Institute includes properly authorized activities outside one's home and work departments as documented in the records of the Institute. Procedures: Faculty members who provide services to the Institute may refer to the Faculty Handbook for applicable policies and guidelines. Information regarding serving as an advisor to a student organization may be found at www.involvement.gatech.edu Responsibilities: Party Responsibility Student Involvement Director Ensure compliance with policy Student Affairs Offer assistance with policy interpretation Related Information: Student Involvement Faculty Handbook Student Affairs Training and Development STRAP Policy No: 13.9 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Jan 2004 Last Revised: Nov 2018 Review Date: Nov 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Kevin Merkel Contact Title: Senior Director-Payroll and Total Rewards Contact Email: Kevin.Merkel@ohr.gatech.edu Policy Statement: The Staff Tuition Reimbursement Assistance Program (STRAP) provides employees with an opportunity to acquire skills and knowledge needed for career development and advancement. This program supports the Institute's commitment to foster professional growth and development of its eligible employees. Course work must be applicable to a career at Georgia Tech. STRAP tuition reimbursement funds are limited. Applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis and are subject to the approval of GTHR. Eligibility Regular, full-time (1.0 FTE), classified employees (professional, administrative, and staff personnel) who have a minimum of one full year of employment with Georgia Tech by the STRAP application deadline date may apply for tuition reimbursement. Eligibility ends upon termination of employment at Georgia Tech. STRAP participants must be employed at Georgia Tech through the exam date and completion of the course in order to receive reimbursement. Eligible employees must submit a new application for consideration and approval by the deadline for each academic 52 / 217Employment term. The deadline dates can be found at: http://ohr.gatech.edu/staff-tuition-reimbursement-assistance-program . Work Schedule Arrangements To the extent possible, employees should not take courses that would require them to be absent from work during regularly scheduled work hours. If attendance in an approved STRAP course requires that an employee be absent from his/her assigned workstation during normal work hours, various accommodations may be possible, depending upon the needs of the unit/department and of the employee. Supervisors are encouraged to make a reasonable effort to find an appropriate work schedule accommodation; however, alternate work arrangements are within the sole discretion of the immediate supervisor. The supervisor must ensure that the employee's participation in STRAP will not adversely affect departmental services, or, result in undue hardship for other employees. Acceptable Courses and Schools Employees are encouraged to use the University System of Georgia's (USG) Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) whenever possible. Employees ineligible for USG TAP programs or pursuing accredited programs not offered within the USG may be reimbursed through STRAP for course work taken from accredited private educational institutions or Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) vocational / technical colleges. Employees attending USG institutions must use the USG TAP unless approved in advance by Georgia Tech Human Resources (GTHR). Distance learning courses may be eligible for reimbursement. Employees not living in the State of Georgia Institute employees who reside outside the State of Georgia who are pursuing accredited degree programs not offered within the USG as distance learning may be eligible for reimbursement when enrolled in either private or public accredited universities or technical colleges. Employees hired by the Institute and are in the process of relocating to the State of Georgia while currently enrolled in a program may be eligible to complete their program with STRAP reimbursement provided the employee and their accredited classes are not transferrable within the University System of Georgia. Course work Course work must be taken for academic credit toward completion of a certificate, diploma, or degree and must be related to a career field at Georgia Tech. Each employee must meet the admission requirements of the educational institution, acquire approval from his/her immediate supervisor and department head, submit application by the deadline date, and receive approval from GTHR for each course to be reimbursed. Non-credit continuing education courses, non-credit certificate programs, and Executive Programs are not eligible for reimbursement. If there are any questions, please contact GTHR at (404) 894-4847. Reimbursement Approved applicants may be reimbursed for their complete or partial tuition cost up to six (6) credit hours per semester. Upon completion of course work with a grade of C or better, the Institute will reimburse tuition costs up to a maximum of six (6) credit hours per semester. Note: Reimbursement amounts are based on the in-state Georgia Tech matriculation rate as defined by the Bursar's Office . The original tuition receipt and official transcript / grade report must be submitted to GTHR for reimbursement. Expenses for fees, books, and other costs will not be reimbursed. Procedures: Application STRAP Program applications may be obtained at: http://ohr.gatech.edu/staff-tuition-reimbursement-assistance- program.

Policy History: Revision Date Author Description November 2018 Human Resources Updated Policy TAP Policy No: 13.10 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: May 1998 Last Revised: Mar 2016 Review Date: Mar 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Kevin Merkel Contact Title: Senior Director-Payroll and Total Rewards Contact Email: Kevin.Merkel@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: The University System of Georgia (USG) is committed to \"the recruitment, hiring, and retention of the best possible faculty, staff and administration.\" The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia is committed to creating a more educated Georgia. As part of its desire to meet employees' evolving needs, the USG has established the Tuition 54 / 217Employment Assistance Program (TAP). The purpose of TAP is to foster the professional growth and development of eligible employees. Policy Statement: Program Guidelines The program is available to all regular University System employees who have been employed full-time for the most recent six months immediately preceding application and who are eligible for University System benefits. The program provides for a full waiver of tuition and fees for employees who register for classes at the University System institution where they are employed. Full reimbursement of tuition and fees is provided to employees who register for classes at other University System institutions. The waiver or reimbursement can be provided for up to 10 credit hours per Quarter or 9 credit hours per semester. All tuition and mandatory fees will be covered. Employees participating in the program must: 1.Receive formal departmental approval 2.Register during the employee registration period 3.Pass the course(s) with a grade of C or better to receive the waiver or reimbursement 4.Assume any tax liability which may accrue under this program Georgia Tech supports the system-wide program guidelines which can be found at: http://www.usg.edu/hr/benefits/tuition_assistance_program_policy Forms, FAQ's, Registration Dates, and University System of Georgia TAP Coordinators can be found at: http://www.usg.edu/hr/benefits/tuition_assistance_program_tap/ Georgia Tech TAP Student Registration Dates as well as and other, specific Georgia Tech -related guidance can be found at: http://ohr.gatech.edu/board-regents-tuition-assistance-program . Procedures: Application Procedures Note: Employees must already be admitted students at the institution of attendance. Obtain and complete the Tuition Remission Plan Request Form (TR-01) from the department supervisor or from the Department of Human Resource Development no later than 30 days prior to the start of classes for the Quarter or Semester. After the Department of Human Resource Development verifies the employee's eligibility, the employee will receive a signed copy of the second page of the TR-01 Form. The employee may then register for classes under this program at his/her desired University System institution during the employee registration period. It is the employee's responsibility to ensure that registration occurs during this period. Registration during any other period places the entire financial burden for those courses on the employee. The employee should obtain certification of enrollment during the employee registration period at the Registrar's Office of the institution where he/she has registered for courses utilizing the \"Certification of Enrollment During Employee Registration Period\" form. Note: This certification is not necessary for Georgia Tech employees attending courses at Georgia Tech. The \"employee registration period\" at Georgia Tech is the same as the students' \"late registration 55 / 217Employment period\". Reimbursement/Remission Procedures Georgia Tech employees attending classes at Georgia Tech under this program will receive an automatic waiver of tuition and fees upon registration during the employee registration period. Employees attending other University System institutions must pay tuition and fees at those institutions under the guidelines set by those institutions. A receipt verifying the date and amount of payment will be required to obtain reimbursement. Within three weeks after the end of the Quarter or Semester of attendance, employees participating in this program must submit the following documentation to the Office of Human Resource Development to obtain reimbursement: 1.Verification of registration during the employee registration period (form available). 2.A receipt certifying the date and amount of payment. 3.A transcript or grade report certifying that the course was passed with a grade of \"C\" or better. No reimbursement can be provided without these documents. Reimbursement may be expected within two weeks of submission. Georgia Tech employees attending classes at Georgia Tech need only to present a transcript certifying that the course was passed with a \"C\" or better. Failure to present this document will result in a reversal of the employee's waiver, causing the employee to become liable for payment of all tuition and fees related to the classes attended under the program. What If? 1.What if I want to take classes during my regularly scheduled work hours? Employees are expected to register for classes which occur outside of the regular work day whenever possible. Under rare circumstances, this may not be possible. Should such an instance occur, the employee's supervisor may approve or disapprove the employee's attendance at those classes. If approved, it will be the employee's responsibility to make up the missed hours during the same workweek or to charge vacation time, at the supervisor's discretion. 1.What if my supervisor does not approve my request for participation in this program? Approval or disapproval is at the supervisor's discretion. The employee may appeal a disapproval only when the permission has been denied on the basis of current job/career relatedness. The employee should appeal the decision first to his/her unit or department head. If that individual upholds the decision of the employee's supervisor, the employee may then appeal the decision to the Appeals Committee (STRAP Committee) through the Human Resource Development Department. All appeals must be completed prior to the first day of class. No other appeals are permitted under the program, and the Appeals Committee is the final avenue of appeal. Under this program, courses approved must be \"of direct and significant assistance to the employee in carrying out present duties and responsibilities or in his or her professional development\" or must \"form part of a job-related degree program\" that relates to an employee's current career in the University System. 1.What if I fail to complete the course with a grade of \"C\" or better? Failure to complete the course with a \"Pass\" or letter grade of \"C\" or better prevents the employee from receiving the benefit of remission or reimbursement under this program. Employees may not request reimbursement, and employees taking courses here at Tech will be responsible for paying the tuition and fees due for the applicable course(s). Repayment should be made at the Bursar's Office. 56 / 217Employment In addition, employees who fail to complete the course with a grade of \"C\" or better will be prohibited from further participation in the program for a period of 6 months from the date of withdrawal or the date the grade is sent to the Registrar's Office, whichever is earlier. After 6 months, the employee may again request participation in the program upon submission of a transcript certifying an average GPA of \"C\" or better. This transcript should be attached to the employee's Form TR-01. 1.What if my employment with the University System ends prior to my completion of the course? If an employee discontinues employment within the University System for any reason at any time prior to the end of the course period, no reimbursement or remission can be provided. Employees may not request reimbursement, and employees taking courses here at Tech will be responsible for paying the tuition and fees for the applicable course(s). Repayment should be made at the Bursar's Office. 1.What if the course I want to attend is not available at a University System institution? Courses may be taken without special exception at accredited University System institutions including Department of Technical and Adult Education institutions. All courses must be taken for credit. Any employee who wishes to take a course at another institution must substantiate in his/her application that the course is not available at a University System institution within 70 miles from Georgia Tech. The Georgia Tech Registrar's Office will be the final authority regarding course availability. If approved for reimbursement under such a provision, reimbursement will be limited to the in-state rate for an equivalent number of credit hours at Georgia Tech. In other words, the full cost of the course(s) may not be reimbursable. 1.What if I have financial aid to cover a portion of my course costs? Reimbursement or remission will be provided to cover only the portion of the course costs not covered by an employee's financial aid. Any approved financial aid should be noted by the employee on Form TR-01. Differences from Current Programs The Institute currently maintains two other educational support programs, the STRAP program and the GTRC Education Assistance Program for Faculty. Employees are encouraged to utilize the new Tuition Remission/Reimbursement program whenever it is possible for them to register during the \"employee registration period\" and when the course or degree program in which they are seeking participation is directly related to their current University System employment, as this new program generally provides a more generous benefit. The specific differences are as follows: 1.Under STRAP, the employee may request reimbursement for any course applicable to a career he/she intends to pursue at Tech, whereas the Tuition Remission/Reimbursement program applies only in cases where the coursework relates to the employee's current position. 2.STRAP also reimburses for approved courses at any accredited institution, while the new program is largely restricted to courses at University System institutions. 3.On the other hand, the new program requires only six months of full-time employment prior to participation, while STRAP requires 12 months. 4.The new program provides remission for employees attending Georgia Tech, while STRAP is strictly a reimbursement program. 5.The new program covers all mandatory tuition and fees, while the STRAP program covers only tuition. 6.Lastly, STRAP will reimburse for only 6 credit hours per quarter or 4 credit hours per semester, while the new program will reimburse for up to 10 credit hours per quarter or 6 credit hours per semester. 57 / 217Employment The GTRC Education Assistance Program for Faculty is largely restricted to research-titled employees and reimburses only for a maximum of 6 credit hours per quarter plus the student activity and health fees. There is no remission provision under this program. Courses may be taken at any approved college or university. For employees who cannot wait to register during the \"employee registration period\" or who wish to register for classes unrelated to their current program, STRAP or the GTRC Education Assistance Program for Faculty may prove more advantageous. For advice on the best alternative in a particular circumstance, the employee should consult the Human Resource Development Department in the Office of Human Resources at (404) 894-2249 or 894-3850. Training Programs Policy No: 13.7 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Apr 2004 Review Date: Jan 2015 Contact Name: TBD Contact Title: Manager- Workplace Learning Policy Statement: The Office of Organizational Development schedules job related training programs for regular employees during regular working hours (8:00 a.m. -5:00 p.m.). Eligible employees must obtain prior approval from their supervisors/department heads and submit a registration form through our on-line system. Registration is on a first- come, first-serve basis. A training program schedule is available to all full-time employees via the web. Employees may attend training programs during regular working hours with no reduction in pay, and there is no need to make up time spent in class. For staff employees, time spent in training programs is considered time worked. Employees Working Shifts Staff employees whose normal working schedules are not 8:00 to 5:00 p.m. are eligible to attend training programs providing they meet the same requirements and follow the same registration procedures as employees working regular hours. Such employees must be compensated for the time spent in class or may be granted compensatory time off within the same pay period, at the discretion of the immediate supervisor. Procedures: An employee who registers and is confirmed for any training program must notify the Office of Organizational Development of a cancellation no later than 5 working days prior to the program. The registration fee will not be refunded or credited for any cancellation after that time. Substitution of employees is encouraged in lieu of a cancellation. If 3 or more employees from a department cancel the same class, there must be at least 10 working days notice. Without 10 working days notice, the department will be charged the full fee. Training fees are charged to the employee's department for expenses incurred in the program (note the exception below). If a supervisor or department head will not approve attendance in a training program, an employee may pay the course fee by personal check. If the class is scheduled during the employee's normal working hours, the employee will need supervisory approval to take vacation leave. 58 / 217Employment Employee Relations Discipline Appeals Policy Demotion Appeal Policy Policy No: 7.5 Type of Policy: Administrative Last Revised: Oct 2011 Review Date: Mar 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Adrienne Richardson Contact Title: Employee Relations Consultant Contact Email: adrienne.richardson@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: The policy is intended to outline the process to follow when filing an appeal due to a demotion Policy Statement: This process may be used only in cases dealing with demotions. Policy Terms: Provisional Status An employee hired to fill a regular position shall serve the first six (6) months of employment in the University System on a provisional basis. An employee may be terminated at any time during the provisional period without a right of appeal. Temporary Status Employees who are not employed as \"regular\" employees are \"temporary\" employees. Institutions may hire temporary employees directly or may elect to obtain the services of temporary employees through outside organizations that provide temporary services. Temporary employees generally shall be employed for a period no longer than six (6) calendar months. Demotion A decrease in the duties and responsibilities assigned to an employee and a downward change in his/her salary grade and range. Procedures: Overview According to the University System of Georgia's grievance policy , the following types of grievances are prohibited: Investigations or decisions reached under the Institute's Harassment Policy They have been adversely affected by a reorganization, program modification or financial exigency (such employees may apply to the Board of Regents for review) The issue underlying the grievance is a charge of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, disability or religion (see the Equal Opportunity Complaint Policy for more details). The issues being grieved have been previously heard by an administrative panel at the institution. 59 / 217Employment Request for Hearing The grievant must first seek an acceptable administrative resolution in writing within five (5) working days of the incident through one administrative level above the level of the supervisor who took the original employment action. If a satisfactory resolution of the grievance is not achieved, the grievant, within five (5) working days of notification by next level management, may request an appeal. Georgia Tech has partnered with EthicsPoint, Inc. to provide an enterprise- wide solution by which members of the Georgia Tech community may make such requests. The request must be made by completing an online form or by calling 1.866.294.5565 and having a neutral third party from EthicsPoint, Inc. transcribe the information. After submitting the information, you can then upload the documented proof of the denial and other attachments. Failure to follow these steps will constitute a waiver of the grievant's right to appeal. Mediation of the issue may be attempted by the Office of Performance and Talent Management (PTM) in order to resolve the dispute. If a resolution cannot be effected, PTM will move forward with the grievant's appeal. Should the grievant allege any form of race, age, sex, color, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability discrimination as a basis for the grievance the case will be immediately referred to an investigator within PTM for review. Upon written notification of a \"no finding\" disposition, PTM will automatically proceed with scheduling a hearing. PTM will make every effort to schedule a hearing date within thirty (30) to forty-five (45) working days from the time that a grievant officially appeals to their office. Should extenuating circumstances exist for the grievant, s/he may submit a written request for the hearing to be scheduled beyond this period; however, no hearing for any reason will be scheduled later than sixty (60) working days from the time the grievant submits a written appeal to PTM. The grievant's failure to appear for a scheduled hearing within that time constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal. A grievant shall not be harassed, intimidated, or otherwise penalized for utilization of the appeal process. Hearing Committee Selection Hearing committee members are selected to hear only a single grievance. The committee will consist only of classified employees with at least six (6) months of service. The following employees may not serve on the committee: Members of the Office of the President (including both direct and indirect reports) Members of the staff of OHR Members of the staff of the Office of Legal Affairs Managers/Human Resources Representatives in the grievant's unit who may have a conflict of interest The committee is composed of three (3) Georgia Tech employees. Two (2) employees are selected by PTM from a random computer generated pool of employees, similar in classification to the grievant. One (1) Human Resources Representative (HRR) is also selected by PTM. The HRR will serve as the Hearing Officer for the assigned case. The Chief Human Resources Officer will notify, in writing, the committee members who have been selected to serve and provide the hearing date, time, and place. Committee members may be excused from serving only if their request is sent to the PTM from the employee or the employee's supervisor and it is accompanied by a written statement of necessity of a bona fide illness or personal hardship. Witnesses and Evidence Evidence shall be limited to witness testimony and documentation that is directly relevant to the employment action in dispute. The committee is not bound by the strict legal rules of evidence and may receive any evidence of probative value in order to determine the issues involved; however, every effort is made to obtain the most reliable evidence available. All substantive matters related to the admissibility of evidence or procedural matters are decided by the presiding Hearing Officer. 60 / 217Employment Witnesses for the hearing must be current employees of Georgia Tech, regular or temporary in good standing. Former employees, students, and others may submit a relevant affidavit subject to the approval of the Hearing Officer.

Witnesses shall not be harassed, intimidated, or otherwise penalized for appearing at a hearing. The grievant and management representatives must obtain their own witnesses. Witnesses may elect not to participate. A list of witnesses and a copy of any documentation must be submitted to PTM at least one (1) week in advance of the hearing date or at the Hearing Officer's briefing of the parties, whichever is later. Copies of the documentation are required at the hearing. Both parties are expected to provide copies of any approved documentation they intend to use at the hearing. Advisors The grievant may have an advisor present at the hearing who can communicate only with the grievant during the hearing. The advisor must be a current Georgia Tech employee, regular or temporary in good standing. This advisor cannot be an attorney, a student, a member of the Office of the President, a member of the staff of OHR, or a member of the staff of the Office of Legal Affairs. Management ordinarily may not have an advisor during the hearing. Attorneys The grievant cannot have an attorney present during the hearing unless the grievant is being charged with a crime. If the grievant receives approval to have an attorney present because of pending criminal charges, then Georgia Tech will also have a legal representative at the hearing. Confidentiality Public statements and publicity about the complaint shall be avoided and the confidentiality of the hearing shall be preserved to the greatest extent permitted by law. Hearing Process The parties involved will be required to attend a briefing no later than one (1) week prior to the hearing. The purpose of the briefing is to review the hearing protocol and answer any questions about the process. Failure to attend the briefing or any other scheduled meeting in support of the grievance process may result in immediate loss of appeal rights. The grievant may present any relevant evidence upon approval by the Hearing Officer, including up to three (3) witnesses. The committee may request any other evidence, as well as interview any other employee, at its discretion. Report of the Committee The committee, after considering all relevant evidence, will make a recommendation in the form of a written report to the Chief Human Resources Officer for a final decision. The committee's report shall be based on evidence brought forth at the hearing and all information in the grievant's official personnel file to the date of the incident or event which brought about the grievance.

Accordingly, the Institute will appoint an Impartial Board of Review (\"IBR\") to hear termination appeals from regular employees, excluding those employed in provisional or temporary status, to ensure the proper processes and procedures have been followed in the event an employee has been terminated for cause. Policy Statement: The Impartial Board of Review process described herein may be used only in cases dealing with terminations for discipline or cause. Scope: Entities Affected By This Policy All classified employees of the Georgia Institute of Technology are covered by this policy. Who Should Read This Policy All classified employees within the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Policy Terms: Provisional Status An employee hired to fill a regular position shall serve the first six (6) months of employment in the University System on a provisional basis. An employee may be terminated at any time during the provisional period without a right of appeal. Temporary Status Employees who are not employed as \"regular\" employees are \"temporary\" employees. Institutions may hire temporary employees directly or may elect to obtain the services of temporary employees through outside organizations that provide temporary services. Temporary employees generally shall be employed for a period no longer than six (6) 62 / 217Employment calendar months. Termination for Cause The termination of employment for misconduct or other serious offense. Procedures: Overview The policy is intended to explain the Impartial Board of Review and the appeal process when disputes cannot be resolved through normal administrative channels of the Institute. According to the University System of Georgia's grievance policy, the following types of grievances are prohibited: Terminations or layoffs because of lack of work or elimination of position Investigations or decisions reached under the Institute's Harassment Policy Terminations that occurred during the six (6)-month provisional period Terminations due to a reorganization, program modification, or financial exigency (such employees may apply to the Board of Regents for review) The issue underlying the grievance is a charge of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, disability or religion (see the Equal Opportunity Complaint Policy for more details). The issues being grieved have been previously heard by an administrative panel at the institution. Request for Hearing The grievant must follow the steps listed in their letter of termination if they wish to file an appeal. Failure to do so will constitute a waiver of the grievant's right to appeal. The first level of appeal will be to the manager of the person who signed the termination letter. The grievant shall submit their appeal in writing indicating specifically why they believe the decision to terminate was improper and should be reversed. The manager may also meet with the employee if they believe it would be beneficial in their review of the matter. If the manager decides to uphold the termination, they will provide written notification of that decision to the grievant to include information on who to contact in the event they wish to appeal to the Impartial Board of Review. Should the grievant allege any form of race, age, sex, color, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability discrimination as a basis for the grievance, the case will be immediately referred to an investigator within OWS for review. Upon written notification of a \"no finding\" disposition, OWS will automatically proceed with scheduling a hearing. OWS will make every effort to schedule a hearing date within thirty (30) to forty-five (45) working days from the time that a grievant officially appeals to the IBR. Should extenuating circumstances exist for the grievant, s/he may submit a written request for the hearing to be scheduled beyond this period; however, no hearing for any reason will be scheduled later than sixty (60) working days from the time the grievant submits a written appeal. The grievant's failure to appear for a scheduled hearing will constitute a waiver of the right to appeal. A grievant shall not be harassed, intimidated, or otherwise penalized for filing an appeal. Hearing Officer OWS will provide the Hearing Officer with a copy of the grievant's hearing request and will notify both parties of the date, time, and place of the Hearing Officer's briefing and of the hearing. 63 / 217Employment IBR Board Member Selection The Board will consist of three panel members selected from a standing committee of employees who will receive training on the hearing process. Members of the standing committee will serve a three year term. OHR will select the committee members to serve on the panel and will ensure that members of the committee who are in the same department as the grievant or may have a conflict of interest are not chosen as panel members for that case. Additionally, the grievant and management representative may object to any panel member who they believe, with reasonable cause, may be incapable of remaining impartial throughout the process. These concerns must be shared with the hearing officer prior to the hearing so that he/she can make a decision on the matter. Witnesses and Evidence Evidence shall be limited to witness testimony and documentation that is directly relevant to the employment action in dispute. The Board is not bound by the strict legal rules of evidence and may receive any evidence of probative value in order to determine the issues involved; however, every effort is made to obtain the most reliable evidence available.

Each party shall have the opportunity to present approved documentation or other evidence which they deem appropriate and relevant to the grievance. Advisors The grievant may have an advisor present at the hearing who can communicate only with the grievant during the hearing. The advisor must be a current Georgia Tech employee, regular or temporary in good standing.

Related Information: Human Resources Administrative Practice Manual: Employee Relations Grievance Policy Employee Dispute Resolution Policy No: 7.7 Type of Policy: Administrative Last Revised: Feb 2014 Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Derrick Morse Contact Title: Employee Relations Consultant Contact Email: derrick.morse@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: The purpose of the Employee Dispute Resolution policy is to increase employee options in addressing Institute-related 68 / 217Employment disputes and to encourage voluntary resolution of problems at the earliest opportunity. Georgia Tech supports the goals of the Board of Regent's Policy on Dispute Resolution . Faculty, classified staff, and student employees are encouraged to seek equitable and satisfactory resolution of any conflict within the Institute through discussion with the persons and departments involved, preferably at the first indication of a problem. Employees are also encouraged to seek guidance from their department's Human Resources Business Partner or Human Resources Representative concerning any workplace dispute. Faculty members may contact the Faculty Ombuds Office, and classified staff may contact the Classified Staff Ombuds, for confidential assistance with resolving conflict. Employees may also seek to resolve the dispute through the informal process described in this policy. Policy Statement: The Institute recognizes the benefits of resolving disputes through informal means that are designed to decrease the reliance on adversarial processes. All employees and departments are encouraged to resolve disputes effectively and fairly at the lowest possible level. It is the policy of Georgia Tech that work-related disputes be addressed in a manner that encourages constructive resolution of conflict and provides the opportunity for productive learning and work relationships. The Institute encourages administrators, faculty, and staff to consider resolving their disputes through alternative, non-adversarial processes with the assistance of a neutral third party prior to filing formal grievances. Dispute resolution processes are not intended to and may not be used as an appeal mechanism after decisions have been resolved through more formal proceedings. Scope: Entities Affected By This Policy All faculty and staff at Georgia Tech are covered by this policy. Who Should Read This Policy All faculty and staff at Georgia Tech should be aware of this policy. Policy Terms: Neutral An individual who is trained or experienced in providing dispute resolution services. This individual has no stake in the dispute or controversy other than to assist the parties in reaching an agreement or resolution. Dispute Resolution Processes Any structured process in which a neutral assists parties to a dispute in reaching a voluntary settlement or resolution, such as mediation, facilitation, or negotiation. Procedures: To resolve conflicts at the earliest possible stage and to address problems with the least damage to future learning and working relationships, assistance through dispute resolution processes is available to all employees. Examples of disputes that may be appropriate for these processes include: Disputes between colleagues stemming from differing personality types or work styles; Disputes related to perceived lack of clarity or consistency regarding work assignments, goals, or expectations; A belief that Institute policies, practices, rules, regulations, or procedures have been applied inconsistently; Conflicts related to conditions of employment such as scheduling, vacation, fringe benefits, holidays, performance reviews, salary, or seniority; and General communication breakdowns/barriers. Participation in a dispute resolution process is voluntary. All parties to a dispute must agree to participate in such a 69 / 217Employment process before arrangements will be made for a session. No presumption of fault is drawn from a party's decision to proceed with or to forego the opportunity to engage in a dispute resolution process. Participants in dispute resolution processes do not forfeit the right or opportunity to participate in other appropriate procedures. Likewise, participants in other available procedures do not forfeit the right to participate in dispute resolution processes; however, participants may not use dispute resolution processes to revisit issues already resolved in a final decision or ruling on a grievance or complaint. Time spent engaged in dispute resolution processes is considered part of an employee's normal working time, and supervisors must make reasonable efforts to allow employees to participate in such processes. Employees are not required to take annual or other leave to participate in dispute resolution processes. Supervisors may authorize the use of overtime for such purposes only under extraordinary circumstances. Both the neutral and the parties are to keep the statements made during the dispute resolution process confidential. However, all participants, including the neutral, are required to report statements that reveal conduct that is criminal or that poses a clear threat to the safety of others or the proper operation of the Institute. The parties are encouraged to memorialize the resolution of their workplace dispute in writing whenever possible. The purpose of such a written document is to ensure that everyone involved in the dispute has a common understanding concerning the resolution of the dispute. Dispute Resolution Limitations The Dispute Resolution program is not available for: Disputes that have been the subject of a final ruling or decision according to other policies and procedures. For example, if someone's employment has already been terminated, that person may not utilize dispute resolution processes to appeal or negotiate the termination decision; Disputes involving criminal charges or serious threats to persons or property; Disputes involving claims of sexual harassment or alleged discrimination because of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or veteran status; and Disputes that do not concern the official business of the Institute. On-Campus Resources Georgia Tech's Dispute Resolution Program is administered by OHR's Talent Management Team who shall act as a first point of contact for any member of the Georgia Tech community who wishes to use this program. If the Talent Management Team determines that use of this program is appropriate given the specific nature of the dispute, the Talent Management Team will refer the parties to a designated neutral who will meet with the parties to the dispute and assist with appropriate dispute resolution processes. In addition, members of the Talent Management Team are available to work with employees, supervisors, and departments to facilitate informal discussions to clarify issues, improve communication, and repair working relationships. The Faculty Ombuds Office is a confidential resource for all faculty members on campus. The Faculty Ombuds is a neutral that advocates not for a specific individual, but for the equitable resolution of work-related problems and concerns. http://www.policylibrary.gatech.edu/faculty-handbook/3.1.8-concerns-complaints-and-ombuds-office Off-Campus Neutrals At times, the Talent Management Team may deem it appropriate to obtain a neutral from off-campus. In these instances, the Talent Management Team will contact and retain an experienced neutral from outside of Georgia Tech 70 / 217Employment to assist parties through dispute resolution processes. The Classified Staff Ombuds is a neutral and confidential third-party resource who can assist staff in determining options to resolve conflicts and problematic concerns. http://www.ohr.gatech.edu/staffombuds .

Any employee, student, student organization, or person privileged to work or to study at the Georgia Institute of Technology who violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action: for employees, up to and including termination; and for others, up to and including permanent exclusion from the Institute. This policy applies to every member of the Institute community. Faculty, students, and staff at all levels are responsible for maintaining an appropriate environment for study and work. This includes conducting themselves in a professional manner. Toward this end, the Georgia Institute of Technology supports the principle that harassment represents a failure in professional and ethical behavior that will not be condoned. This policy and procedure is intended to facilitate an atmosphere in which, faculty staff, and students have the right to raise the issue of discriminatory harassment without fear of retaliation and to ensure that violations are fully remedied. No member of the Georgia Tech Community will be retaliated against for making a good faith report of alleged harassment or for participating in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing. Georgia Tech is committed to providing its staff, faculty, and students the opportunity to pursue excellence in their academic and professional endeavors. This opportunity can exist only when each member of our community is assured an atmosphere of mutual respect. The free and open exchange of ideas is fundamental to the Institute's purpose. It is not the Institute's intent in promulgating this policy to inhibit free speech or the free communication of ideas by members of the academic community. Policy Terms: Discriminatory harassment - unwelcome verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct directed against any person or 71 / 217Employment group, based upon race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or veteran status that has the purpose or effect of creating an objectively hostile working or academic environment. A hostile environment is created when harassment is so severe, pervasive, or persistent as to unreasonably interfere with or limit an individual's employment or educational opportunities. Harassment must be distinguished from behavior which, even though unpleasant or disconcerting, is appropriate to the carrying out of certain instructional, advisory, or supervisory responsibilities. Sexual harassment - Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when: 1.Submission to such conduct is made either implicitly or explicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment or status in a course, program, or activity; 2.Submission or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for condition of an individual's employment or status in a course, program, or activity; 3.Such conduct has the purpose or effect: a. of unreasonably interfering with the individual's work or education performance; b. of creating an objectively intimidating, hostile, or offensive working and/or learning environment; or c. of unreasonably interfering with or limiting one's ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity. Both men and women, as well as, persons of the same gender may be either the initiators or victims of sexual harassment. Procedures: Complaints of Sexual Misconduct Complaints of Sexual Misconduct (which includes, but is not limited to, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, and stalking) are addressed pursuant to the policies and procedures of the Board of Regents Sexual Misconduct Policy. Additional procedures for complaints of sexual misconduct by students are contained in the Student Sexual Misconduct Policy. Complaints of Discriminatory Harassment 1. Any member of the Institute community who believes that he or she has been the victim of discriminatory harassment other than sexual misconduct (the Complainant) should promptly report the matter to the appropriate institute officials within the offices designated to handle such complaints. The complaint should be brought within 60 calendar days of the most recent alleged harassing act. 2. For incidents involving faculty and staff, the Office of Human Resources - Performance and Talent Management team should be contacted. The Dean of Students Office should be contacted for incidents involving students or student claims. 3. The initial discussion between the Complainant and the Appropriate Institute Official will be handled with sensitivity and discretion. The Appropriate Institute Official will inquire into all reports of alleged sexual harassment brought to his or her attention. 4. During the initial meeting with the Appropriate Institute Official, a written summary of the complaint will be made and should be signed by the Complainant. 72 / 217Employment 5.

Policy Statement: The Office of Human Resources Performance and Talent Management (PTM) team facilitates compliance of the Institute with federal, state, and Board of Regents Equal Opportunity (EO) laws and guidelines. This office has the full support of the Institute to identify and initiate resolution of EO policy violations. This policy sets forth the procedure by which employees and faculty of the Institute may file a complaint of discrimination or an appeal. PTM also facilitates compliance of the Institute with Title IX, which prohibits gender discrimination in education programs or activities. In addition, PTM investigates student discrimination complaints involving faculty or staff of the Institute. The Institute will use this complaint process whenever it becomes aware of a possible violation of the laws or guidelines referenced herein. However, if an alleged violation is under review in another office/forum, or has already been reviewed in a different forum, PTM may reject a new complaint regarding the same allegations or elect to temporarily set the complaint aside until processing in the other forum is complete. 73 / 217Employment Scope: Entities Affected By This Policy All employees, students, and contractors of Georgia Tech are covered by this policy. Who Should Read This Policy All employees, students, and contractors within Georgia Tech should be aware of this policy. Policy Terms: Retaliation/Non-Reprisal Seeking revenge, evening the score, or striking back at a perceived wrong. In an employment law context, examples of retaliation could include termination, suspension, disciplinary action, denial of promotion, benefits, or refusal to hire an individual. Federal and state laws prohibit retaliation against persons who file complaints of discrimination or who participate in an employment discrimination proceeding. For Appeals, an employee will be free from restraint, interference, coercion, or reprisal in bringing an appeal, serving as a representative of an appealing party, appearing as a witness, or in seeking information about the Appeal policy. Abuse of Process Adverse employment action may be taken against persons who knowingly file false complaints of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment. Such actions may include dismissal of the complaint and/or disciplinary actions against the employee, up to and including discharge or dismissal. Withdrawal Either the complainant, the appealing party, or the respondent may submit a voluntary complaint resolution or proposal for resolution prior to or during an investigation. The complainant or the appealing party may also, at any time, withdraw a complaint or appeal through the complaint and appeal line . PTM may have a business responsibility to continue investigating certain types of complaints, even if the complaint is withdrawn, and where applicable will do so. Procedures: If an employee is not able to resolve the complaint informally and wishes to pursue the matter further, Georgia Tech has partnered with EthicsPoint, Inc. to provide an enterprise-wide solution by which members of the Georgia Tech community may file a formal complaint. Such complaints must be filed by completing an online form or by calling 1.866.294.5565 and having a neutral third party from EthicsPoint, Inc. transcribe the information. There are two types of formal procedures: (1) Discrimination Complaints and (2) Appeals. Faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to communicate effectively, treat each other with respect, and to resolve conflicts as quickly as possible without having to use these formal procedures. However, any employee or student who believes he or she has been subjected to discriminatory and/or harassing behavior from individuals covered by the same policies may have their complaints addressed by the Institute's official complaint process. Lawyers are prohibited unless the hearing involves a criminal indictment. Alternatively, individuals may elect to file their discrimination complaints with an external civil rights agency or court of law and subject to the processes of those forums. Discrimination Complaints Employees who believe that they have been subjected to illegal discrimination or workplace harassment based on race, color, religion, sex/gender, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status or retaliation may file their complaint within 60 days of the alleged harm. All such complaints will be referred to PTM for investigation and resolution. Please refer to the 4-Step Discrimination Complaint Process and the 60-Day Timeline for PTM Discrimination Complaint Process d ocuments for more details. 74 / 217Employment Appeals Employees who have been terminated, suspended, or demoted may appeal management's decision. If a satisfactory resolution of an appeal is not achieved by appealing to one administrative level above the level of the supervisor who took the original employment action, then the employee has up to 5 days of notification by next level management to file an Appeal. A PTM Rep. will initiate the formal grievance process. Please refer to the 4-Step Appeal Process and the 60-Day Timeline for PTM Appeal Process documents for more details. According to the University System of Georgia's Grievance Policy, a grievance will not be available to dispute: promotion and tenure decisions, performance evaluations, hiring decisions, classification appeals, challenges to grades or assessments, challenges to salary decisions, challenges to transfers or reassignments, termination or layoff because of lack of work or elimination of position, investigations or decisions reached under the institutions Harassment Policy, and normal supervisory counseling. A classified employee may file a grievance only if: The employee has been suspended; or The employee has been discharged; or The employee has been demoted, or their salary has been reduced. An employee may not file a grievance, even in the above circumstances, if: The discharge occurred during the six (6)-month provisional period; They have been adversely affected by a reorganization, program modification or financial exigency (such employees may apply to the Board of Regents for review); The issue underlying the grievance is a charge of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, disability or religion. The issues being grieved have been previously heard by an administrative panel at the institution. Faculty members who appeal may also seek the assistance of the Faculty Status and Grievance Committee (FSGC).

The normal dress code will be relaxed during the summer to provide a more practical and comfortable clothing standard. This policy will be in effect at the beginning of the summer semester and ending after the Labor Day holiday. Fridays throughout the year will be designated as Business Casual Dress Day. It is the intent that each employee may choose to wear less formal attire as long as clothing is in good taste and will not negatively affect the Institute's image. Procedures: Acceptable personal appearance is an ongoing responsibility of each employee. Specifically, \"common sense\" should be the basic guideline and employees should not wear suggestive attire, athletic clothing, shorts, T-shirts, novelty buttons, baseball hats, and similar items of casual attire that do not present a businesslike image. As always, supervisors are responsible for determining appropriate dress for each specific work situation or environment. Radical departures from conventional dress or personal grooming standards will not be permitted. When dealing with customers and the public, your attire should be consistent with a positive business image. Exception Employees whose jobs require them to wear uniforms and/or whose attire must meet prescribed safety standards are not covered by this policy. Business Ethics Policy No: 5.1 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Dec 1998 Review Date: Dec 2018 Policy Owner: Internal Auditing Contact Name: Phil Hurd Contact Title: Director-Internal Auditing Contact Email: phillip.hurd@gatech.edu Policy Statement: Georgia Tech policy is that the practice of accepting gifts or gratuities is unnecessary, undesirable, and contrary to the interest of the Institute. Procedures: The purpose of this policy is to recognize the Institute's responsibility to maintain good relations with its suppliers and 79 / 217Employment others with whom Georgia Tech may have business dealings, and to prevent gift-bearing businesses from interfering with and/or influencing employees. Exactly what constitutes a conflict of interest or an unethical business practice is both a moral and a legal question. Georgia Tech recognizes and respects the individual employee's right to engage in activities outside of his or her employment which are private in nature and do not in any way conflict with or reflect poorly on the Institute. Management reserves the right, however, to determine when an employee's activities represent a conflict with the Institute's interests and to take whatever action is necessary to resolve the situation - including termination of employment. It isn't possible in a general policy statement of this sort to define all the various circumstances and relationships that would be considered \"unethical.\" The list below suggests some of the types of activity that would reflect in a negative way on the employee's personal integrity or that would limit his or her ability to discharge job duties and responsibilities in an ethical manner: 1.Simultaneous employment by another business/organization, particularly if the other is a competitor. 2.Carrying on Institute business with a firm in which the employee, or a close relative of the employee, has a substantial ownership or interest. 3.Holding a substantial interest in, or participating in the management of, a firm to which the Institute does business with or makes purchases. 4.Borrowing money from customers or firms, other than recognized loan institutions, from which our Institute buys services, materials, equipment, or supplies. 5.Accepting substantial gifts or excessive entertainment from an outside organization or agency. 6.Speculating or dealing in materials, equipment, supplies, services, or property purchased by the Institute. 7.Participating in civic or professional organization activities in a manner whereby confidential Institute information is divulged. 8.Misusing privileged information or revealing confidential data to outsiders. 9.Using one's position in the Institute or knowledge of its affairs for outside personal gains. 10.Engaging in practices or procedures that violate Board of Regents, Institute, or other state and federal laws regulating the conduct of the Institute. REMEMBER: Employment by the Institute carries with it a responsibility to be constantly aware of the importance of ethical conduct. Employees must refrain from taking part in, or exerting influence in, any transaction in which their own interests may conflict with the best interests of the Institute.

(GTRC) Contact Name: Jeff Steltzer Title: Dir. Mgt. Contact Email: jeff.steltzer@gtrc.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: The purpose of this policy is: To set forth acceptable parameters relating to possible conflicts of interest which may arise from the outside professional activities of an Institute employee; To define and establish a mechanism to reduce, eliminate, or manage a situation that may pose a real or potential Conflict of Interest; To ensure the integrity of research, education or business transactions of the Institute and to identify real or potential Conflicts of Interest; To ensure that sponsored research at the Institute is conducted in compliance with regulations promulgated by the sponsor thereof including but not limited to the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health as appropriate [Ref. NSF - Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy: October 7, 1996 http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/stis1996/iin117/iin117.txt, and NIH Guide - Objectivity in Research http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-08-25/pdf/2011-21633.pdf]; and To articulate activities that would be prohibited. Policy Statement: State laws governing ethics and conflicts of interest are based on the premise that public employees are acting on behalf of government for the benefit of the public. As public employees of an institute serving the educational and public purposes of teaching, research, and professional service, there is an obligation to conduct research and official duties on behalf of the Institute in such a manner consistent with statutes and regulations. The avoidance of conflict of interest is vital to ensuring the integrity and objectivity in conducting and reporting research. Overview Based on State and federal law and regulations, the following two rules will be followed as a matter of Institute policy: 1.Activities which constitute a Conflict of Interest where there is Significant Financial Interest are prohibited unless a plan to reduce, eliminate or manage the Conflict of Interest has been expressly approved in accordance with the provisions of this policy; and 2.Activities which constitute a Conflict of Interest where there is a Substantial Interest are unlawful. 81 / 217Employment If you are a faculty member, you are governed by Policy 5.6 Conflict of Interest and Outside Professional Activity as defined in the Faculty Handbook. If you are an employee conducting research, you are governed by Policy 5.6.4 Disclosure of Real or Potential Conflicts of Interest as defined in the Faculty Handbook. Only faculty who do not accrue annual leave may report consulting days for time spent consulting, as described in Section 5.6.5 of the Faculty Handbook . Scope: All staff at the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Policy Terms: 1.Agency any agency, authority, department, board, bureau, commission, committee, office or instrumentality of the State of Georgia. 2.Business any corporation, partnership, proprietorship, firm, enterprise, franchise, association, organization, self-employed individual, trust or other legal entity. 3.Conflict of Commitment occurs when an Employee undertakes external commitments which burden or interfere with the Employee's primary obligations to the Institute. Conflicts of Commitment may arise out of consulting arrangements or with an entrepreneurial interest when a faculty member is involved in a startup company. 4.Conflict of interest Illustrative examples of such situations include, without limitation, the following situations: 1.It reasonably appears that a significant financial interest could affect the design, conduct, or reporting of activities funded or proposed for funding by a sponsor; or 2.The personal interest of an Employee or his or her Family may prevent or appear to prevent the Employee from making an unbiased decision with respect to the Employee's employment with the Institute. The Employee, or a member of his or her Family, has a significant financial interest in a business which transacts business with the Institute. The Employee, or a member of his or her Family, has a significant financial interest in an entity that competes or may compete with the Institute for sponsored activities. 5.Conflict of Interest Review Committee shall mean an advisory committee to the Executive Vice-President for Research that shall be composed of the Chief Legal Counsel, the Vice-President for Research, a representative for the student body, and a member of the general faculty appointed by the Executive Board of the Institute. In absence of a standing Committee the Executive Vice-President for Research shall appoint an ad hoc committee as dictated by the circumstance. 6.Conflict of Interest Management Office (COI Office) shall mean the central office designated by the Institute to review all disclosures that present actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The COI Office works with the COI Review Committee and the Responsible Unit Official to ensure that any conflicts of interest are reduced, managed, or eliminated in conjunction with federal, state, and local regulations and Institute policy. 7.Consulting any professional activity related to the person's field or discipline (e.g. consulting, speaking, scientific advisory boards, paid attendance at company meetings, expert witness services, etc), where a fee-for-service or equivalent relationship with a third party exists. Consulting includes organizing or operating any educational program outside Georgia Institute of Technology. 8.Employee all Institute personnel who receive salary or wages from the Institute. Students and trainees are included if they 82 / 217Employment receive pay from the Institute.

The financial gain may be derived from owning stock in a company that is sponsoring research, from ownership interest or employment in a company that may benefit as a licensee of an invention, or from the existence or expectation of entering into a consulting arrangement with a company sponsoring research. 12.Institute/Institution the Georgia Institute of Technology. 13.Institutional Conflicts occur when the Institute, or one of its affiliated entities such as the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation, Georgia Tech Foundation or Georgia Advanced Technology Ventures, has a financial stake in the outcome of its research programs or licensed technology. The conflict may arise out of an equity interest in a start-up that licenses technology from the Institute or in the nature of royalties to be earned from licensing such technology. 14.Institutional Responsibilities/Institutional Obligations Investigator's professional responsibilities on behalf of the Institution, including for example, activities such as research, research consultation, teaching, professional practice, Institutional committee memberships, and service on panels such as Institutional Review Boards or Data and Safety Monitoring Boards. 15.Investigator the project director or principal investigator and any other person, regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of research, which may include, for example, collaborators or consultants.

For purposes of this Policy, the Responsible Representative of the Institution is the Vice-President for Research or his/her designee(s). 19.Responsible Unit Official the supervisor of the school, laboratory, or department of the person making a disclosure. For such supervisors, the Responsible Unit Official will be the person he or she reports to at the next supervisory level. For any other cases, it will be an individual designated by the Executive Vice-President for Research. 20.Significant Financial Interest 83 / 217Employment as defined in current Federal Regulations, means: 1.A financial interest consisting of one or more of the following interests of the Investigator (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) that reasonably appears to be related to the Investigator's institutional responsibilities: 1.With regard to any publicly traded entity, a significant financial interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure and the value of any equity interest in the entity as of the date of disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000. For purposes of this definition, remuneration includes salary and any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary (e.g., consulting fees, honoraria, paid authorship); equity interest includes any stock, stock option, or other ownership interest, as determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value; 2.With regard to any non-publicly traded entity, a significant financial interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, or when the Investigator (or the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) holds any equity interest (e.g., stock, stock option, or other ownership interest); or 3.Intellectual property rights and interests (e.g., patents, copyrights), upon receipt of income related to such rights and interests. 2.The term significant financial interest does NOT include the following types of financial interests: 1.salary, royalties, or other remuneration paid by the Institution to the Investigator if the Investigator is currently employed or otherwise appointed by the Institution; 2.intellectual property rights assigned to the Institution and agreements to share in royalties related to such rights 3.income from investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, as long as the Investigator does not directly control the investment decisions made in these vehicles; 4.income from seminars, lectures, or teaching engagements sponsored by a federal, state, or local government agency, an Institution of higher education as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an institution of higher education; 5.income from service on advisory committees or review panels for a federal, state, or local government agency, or an Institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an institution of higher education. 3.Investigators who receive US Public Health Service funding (e.g. NIH) or a subcontract from another entity that receives funds from a US Public Health Service funding agency, also must disclose the occurrence of any reimbursed or sponsored travel, related to their institutional responsibilities; provided, however, that this disclosure requirement does not apply to travel that is reimbursed or sponsored by a federal, state, or local government agency, an Institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital, a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an Institution of higher education. The disclosure must include the purpose of the trip, the identity of the sponsor/organizer, the destination, and the duration. Please refer to http://coi.research.gatech.edu/ for answers to frequently asked questions. 21.Sponsored travel travel expenses that are paid on behalf of the Investigator and not reimbursed to the Investigator so that the exact monetary value may not be readily available. 22.Substantial Interest is \"the direct or indirect ownership of more than 25 percent of the assets or stock of any business.\" [Official Code of Georgia 45-10-20]. An Employee, alone or in combination with Family, may not have an ownership interest of more than 25% of the assets or stock in any business which Transacts Business with the State of Georgia including the Institute. Therefore caps of 24.9% are placed on the percentage of ownership an Employee, alone or in combination with Family, may have in any business which Transacts Business with the 84 / 217Employment Institute. Ownership interests below this cap may be managed as provided in this policy. 23.Transact Business or Transact any Business to sell or lease any personal property, real property, or services on behalf of oneself or on behalf of any third party as an agent, broker, dealer, or representative and means to purchase surplus real or personal property on behalf of oneself or on behalf of any third party as an agent, broker, dealer, or representative.. Procedures: Activities Not Considered \"Consulting\" 1.Publication Scholarly communications in the form of books, movies, television productions, art works, etc. though frequently earning financial profit for a non-faculty member and for another party (e.g., publisher), are not viewed as consultation. 2.Professional Service Service on national commissions, advisory bodies for governmental agencies and boards, granting agency peer review panels, visiting committees or advisory groups to other universities, and on analogous bodies is not considered to be Consulting. The fundamental distinction between these activities and consulting is that they are public or Institute service. Although participants may receive an honorarium or equivalent, these professional service activities are not undertaken for personal financial gain. 3.\"Moonlighting\" Employee may pursue a variety of endeavors for financial profit that are not directly related to the person's field or discipline. These efforts are part of the non-faculty member's private life and do not come under Institute regulation for this consulting policy. Such endeavors may be pursued only after the primary commitment to the Institute has been fulfilled and upon prior approval from a Responsible Unit Official of the Institute. Use of Georgia Institute of Technology Facilities In competing for consulting, employees are not to take advantage of their access to Institute facilities. State law precludes Institute employees from using State facilities or property for personal gain or benefit. The facilities and services of the Institute may not be used in connection with compensated outside work, except in a purely incidental way. This is not envisioned to exclude contracts with the Institute for the use of facilities or services such as the Computer Center or the Library or other facilities for which cost centers have been established. Consulting Services for Other State Offices As a general rule employees of the Institute may not receive compensation for services performed for other state offices. [Official Code of Georgia 45-10-20] Employees of one State agency may teach or work as consultants for another state agency provided the work falls within one of the following classifications and provided the conditions stated below are met. Employees of one state agency may teach or work as consultants for another state agency if the transaction involves part-time employment by the state agency seeking consulting services of a chaplain, fireman, any person holding a doctorate or master's degree from an accredited college or university, a licensed physician, dentist, psychologist, registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse, or veterinarian. The chief executive officer of the department or agency desiring to obtain the services of a person falling within the class of exceptions shall certify in writing the need for the services and shall set forth why the best interest of the state will be served by obtaining the part-time services of such a person in lieu of obtaining such services from a person not 85 / 217Employment presently employed by the State. The chief executive officer of the department or agency employing the person in the class of exceptions shall certify in writing that the person whose services are desired is available to perform such services, that the performances of such services will not detract nor have a detrimental effect on the performance of the person's employment, and, where appropriate, that the part-time employment of this person will be in the best interest of the State. The two departments or agencies involved will then agree on the procedures under which the employee shall perform the additional services. The agreement shall specify the means of employment, whether as a part-time employee or as a consultant, the compensation, and other pertinent details and conditions of the employment relationship. The agreement may be terminated at any time by either of the parties to the agreement. Prohibited Activities No employee shall undertake any activity which constitutes a conflict of interest except as may be expressly approved and/or managed pursuant to the provisions of this policy. It shall be unlawful for any full-time employee, for himself or herself, or on behalf of any business, or for any business in which such employee or member of his or her family has a substantial interest to transact any business with the agency by which such employee is employed; provided, however, that neither this section nor any other provision of law shall prevent full-time employees of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia from serving as members of governing boards of private, nonprofit, educational, athletic, or research related foundations and associations which are organized for the purpose of supporting institutions of higher education in this state and which in furtherance of this purpose may transact business with such institutions or with the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. Except as expressly permitted by law, it shall be unlawful for any part-time employee, for himself or herself, or on behalf of any business, or for any business in which such employee or member of his or her family has a substantial interest to transact any business with the agency by which such employee is employed. See Official Code of Georgia Annotated Section 45-10-20 et seq. Disclosure to the State of Georgia Except as provided in subsection (b) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated Section 45-10-26, any Public Official or Employee whether for himself or herself, or on behalf of any Business, or any Business in which such Public Official or Employee or any member of his Family has a Substantial Interest who transacts business with the state or any agency thereof, shall disclose such transactions.

Such disclosure statements shall be public records. [Official Code of Georgia 45-10-26] Disclosure to the Institute Every employee of the Institute, including all who participate in outside professional activities and/or sponsored research must complete an annual disclosure using the online Conflict of Interest system. In answering the questions, if an employee has indicated an actual or potential conflict, the system will notify the COI Office for review. Employees must update their disclosures on an ongoing basis when circumstances change. Disclosure to Sponsors Any person involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of research (technical and financial) or educational activities 86 / 217Employment proposed for funding by a sponsor must complete the Investigator Financial Interest In Research Report via the online Conflict of Interest System disclosing any potential or actual Significant or Substantial Financial interests of the employee (including those of the Employee's Family). (See http://coi.research.gatech.edu/ for this system.) Disclosures should include, but is not limited to: 1.Performance or business transactions related to the sponsored activity; 2.Equity interests in or fees from either the sponsor of the research or a subcontractor; 3.Intellectual property rights. Each such Disclosure needs to be updated via the online system by the employee during the life of any award, as new Significant or Substantial Financial Interests are recognized. In completing a disclosure on the Conflict of Interest Online System, the employee is certifying to the following: \"In submitting this form I affirm that the above information is true to the best of my knowledge and I certify that I have read and understood the Conflict of Interest and Outside Professional Activity Policy as set forth in the Georgia Institute of Technology Faculty Handbook, that I have made all required disclosures, and that I will comply with any conditions or restrictions imposed by the Institute to manage, reduce or eliminate conflicts of interest.\" In any proposal submitted to a potential sponsor, the Office of Sponsored Programs is responsible for certifying that the Institute has implemented a written and enforced conflict of interest policy that is consistent with the provisions of Grant Policy Manual Section 510 of the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health Guide for Objectivity in Research and other applicable sponsor regulations. In submitting the proposal, the Office of Sponsored Programs certifies that to the best of their knowledge all financial disclosures required by such conflict of interest policy have been made and that all identified conflicts of interest will have been satisfactorily managed, reduced or eliminated prior to the Institute's expenditure of any funds under the award, in accordance with the Institute's Conflict of Interest and Outside Professional Activity Policy. Disclosure to the Institutional Review Board Investigators submitting protocols to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the use of human subjects in research or other activities shall disclose any and all Significant Financial Interests that may appear to affect the design, conduct or reporting of such research. It is imperative that Investigators fully disclose to the IRB an ownership interest in any Business proposing to test any drug, device or other technology with human subjects or any potential financial interest in such technology that the Investigators, or the Investigators Family might have. The IRB, in collaboration with the COI Office, shall conduct an independent review and may or may not impose restrictions, including denial of approval for the protocol, as it deems is in the best interest of the subjects and the Institute. Disclosure to Students Special care needs to be taken when dealing with students involved in research so that a potential or actual Conflict of Interest does not adversely affect their education, i.e. their ability to graduate or publish. Prior to retaining students on research projects that may involve a potential or actual Conflict of Interest, the Investigator and senior personnel will disclose to the student as well as to the COI Office and Responsible Unit Official, any interests in outside companies that may be perceived to benefit from the student's research. Should a conflict of interest exist, the COI Office, the Responsible Unit Official, the conflicted Investigator, and the Conflict of Interest Review Committee, will design a conflict management plan to manage, reduce or eliminate the conflict prior to the student's involvement in the project pursuant to the procedure provided for in Section 5.6.4 . Review of Financial Disclosures and Resolution of Conflicts of Interest 87 / 217Employment When a financial disclosure or report of a conflict of interest is made via the online Conflict of Interest module and forwarded to the COI Office, the COI Office reviews the disclosure per the COI Office Procedures. Should an actual or apparent conflict of interest exist, the COI Office and the Conflict of Interest Review Committee will design a conflict management plan to manage, reduce or eliminate the conflict prior to the Institute's expenditure of any such funds. In developing a management plan, the COI Office and the Conflict of Interest Review Committee will work with the conflicted employee and with the Responsible Unit Official and will consider the relationships between the employee and the Institute to ensure adequate conditions or restrictions are in place to manage, reduce or eliminate the conflict(s). Such conditions may include, without limitation: 1.Public disclosure of significant financial interests; 2.Monitoring of research by independent reviewers; 3.Modification of the research plan; 4.Disqualification from participation in the portion of the sponsor funded research that would be affected by the Significant or Substantial Financial Interests; 5.Divestiture of Significant or Substantial Financial Interests; and/or 6.Severance of relationships that create actual or potential conflicts. Conflict management plans and/or restrictions must be in writing and forwarded to the conflicted employee and the Responsible Unit Official(s). The COI Office and the Responsible Unit Officials will monitor compliance with the plan. A copy of the plan and relevant documentation will be maintained in the COI Office. Upon recommendation by a Responsible Unit Official, the Conflict of Interest Review Committee may determine a) that imposing conditions or restrictions would be ineffective or b) that any potential negative impacts which may arise from a Significant or Substantial Financial Interest is outweighed by interests of scientific progress, technology transfer, or the public health and welfare. In such cases, the Responsible Unit Official and the Conflict of Interest Review Committee may recommend to the Provost that the Institute allow research to go forward provided that any conflict management plan includes ongoing monthly review by the Responsible Unit Official and the Conflict of Interest Review Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall permit the Institute to authorize an activity that is contrary to the laws of the State of Georgia, federal regulations, or other restrictions imposed by regulation or contract by research sponsors. Furthermore, no activity involving human subjects may be authorized that has not been approved by the Institutional Review Board which in compliance with 45CFR46 may, in its sole discretion, deny such approval. Should the Responsible Representative of the Institution find that the Institute is unable to satisfactorily manage a conflict of interest prior to the Institute's expenditure of any such funds, the Responsible Representative of the Institution shall immediately notify the COI Office and the Office of Sponsored Programs. All determinations made or actions taken by the COI Office, and/or the Conflict of Interest Review Committee shall be in writing and together with all financial disclosures made hereunder, be maintained until at least three years after the later of the termination or completion of the award to which they relate, or the resolution of any government action involving those records. If the Investigator is engaged in any research or other sponsored activity supported by the Department of Health and Human Services including but not limited to the National Institutes of Health, the Responsible Representative of the Institution shall forward this information to the sponsor in compliance with regulation. Written management plans must be reviewed annually or upon a change in circumstances affecting the plan and 88 / 217Employment appropriate disclosures should continue during the ongoing management of any conflict. Conflict of Interest Training Requirements Conflict of interest training is required for all Investigators before engaging in funded research and every four years thereafter. Penalties Any employee who violates this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. There are also sanctions under State law [Official Code of Georgia Section 45-10-28] as described in the following paragraphs. Any appointed public official or employee who violates Official Code of Georgia Annotated Section 45-10-23 (\"Full-time employees prohibited from transacting business with own state agency; exception to prohibition for Board of Regents employees\"), Section 45-10-24 (\"Part-time public officials with state-wide powers prohibited from transacting business with any state agency; part-time employees prohibited from transacting business with own state agency; exceptions to prohibitions\"), or Section 45-10-26 (\"Public officials and employees to file yearly disclosure statements concerning business transactions with state; statements to be public records\") shall be subject to: Removal from office or employment; A civil fine not to exceed $10,000.00; and Restitution to the state of any pecuniary benefit received as a result of such violation.

As opportunities increase for internationally based instruction and research, Georgia Tech seeks to clarify responsibilities, and ensure equitable and fair practices while minimizing Institute and individual risk. Policy Statement: This policy provides requirements for supporting US-based Institute employees assigned to work outside of the United States for 90 days to five years. Policy objectives include: Providing direction to faculty and staff on employment practices and responsibilities relating to overseas assignments. Establishing compensation and benefits requirements that ensure equitable treatment of overseas assignees. Ensuring that an employee is not materially advantaged or disadvantaged while on assignment. Clarifying the Institute's and assignees' respective roles in complying with tax and local law obligations Overseas assignments are defined by the duration of the assignment (see definitions section below.) This policy sets out the key terms and conditions by which the Institute manages and supports both short-term and long-term assignments. This policy does not constitute a contractual obligation, and the specific terms and conditions may be modified on an individual case basis. Scope: This policy applies to any US-based employee of the Institute who accepts an overseas assignment at the Institute's request. Faculty and staff on assignment to a GT affiliated program (whether earning full or partial pay or on unpaid leave) will still be covered by this policy. (This policy will not apply in cases when employees have accepted an international private consulting assignment and are on leave from GT.) 91 / 217Employment Defenitions Institute employee Any employee, whether temporary or permanent, who is paid through Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) US payroll< Overseas Assignment Working in a capacity at the request of GT, for a period of 90 days to fewer than 5 years, while located outside the United States. Work is related to instruction, research, development, or support of those activities. Short-Term: 90 days to one year Long-Term: One year but fewer than 5 years Overseas Assignment AgreementA document outlining the specifics of the assignment. Topics include location of the assignment, length of the assignment, costs paid by GT, employee responsibilities, and repatriation. International Business TravelFewer than 90 days.

Any individual required overseas for more than five years must be terminated by GT, and hired by an overseas entity. GT Program The GT office or department that is the lead for the overseas assignment, whether using internal or sponsored funds. Host Country The country where the international assignee is located and performing services. Efforts should be made to keep this simple (e.g., assignees should live in the same country where they perform the majority of their services) when possible. Home Country The United States is considered the home country for all Institute employees on temporary overseas assignments. Base Salary The employee's GT regular annual or academic salary excluding bonuses and allowances, if any. Note: For employees on unpaid leave, the GT fringe benefit rate may also be considered when calculating base pay. Family Accompanying Family: Spouse and/or dependent children relocating with the assignee to the host country. Immediate Family: Spouse, children, siblings, parents. Procedures: 5.1 Pre-Assignment Requirements Selection & Approval Process for Overseas Assignment - Prior to DeparturepSelection and approval of an employee for an overseas assignment requires the input of multiple GT departments. In most cases, these are the responsible parties and steps: 92 / 217Employment 1.GT Program Director : Identifies and communicates the need for overseas assignee(s) as well as the assignment duration and specific dates. Usually responsible for initial selection, and vetting of interested candidate(s). 2.Home Department/ Department Chair : Assesses candidate's academic (or research) skills for assignment; reviews potential department impact. If candidate has department approval, initiates the formal faculty assignment approval process (using GT-TRACS software application.) 3.Global HR: Assesses candidate's overseas work eligibility. Review assignee citizenship and visa issues with regard to working in host country Review Institute's and assignee's tax and other legal obligations in host country Determine eligibility for Certificate of Coverage/ dual taxation agreement (if needed) 4.A. Faculty Affairs : Final review and approval of teaching and research faculty assignees for specific detailed overseas assignment. B. Director, Global HR : Final review and approval of terms and conditions for staff assignments. Preparation for Overseas Assignment Overseas Assignment Agreement. The program and home department staff are responsible for compiling this document. It will be shared with, and signed by, the assignee. This written agreement will communicate agreed upon compensation, benefits, and tax-related implications (to include assignee's responsibility for personal tax obligations in the host country.) Visas and permits. The program staff will assist the assignee in securing the appropriate work visas and residence permits for the overseas assignment. The GT Program will cover all related expenses. Note: It is important that the assignment duration and dates are agreed upon before any visas or permits are requested, since the host country may not allow flexibility to change or extend the dates. Certificate of Coverage /Totalization Agreement . If applicable, Global HR will request a Certificate of Coverage from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to certify that the assignee is paying social security taxes in the US and is therefore exempt from paying social security/social taxes in the host 93 / 217Employment country. Note: This may be a work visa requirement in the host country. Adjustment of medical/dental insurance. If needed, GTHR Benefits staff can answer questions and assist assignees with adding or changing health insurance coverage. Note: the overseas assignment is considered a \"life event\" that allows for changes to medical coverage. Purchase of travel insurance. The selection and purchase of travel insurance will be influenced by type of program, duration of assignment, and host country requirements. The GT Program will cover at minimum the cost of basic ERS (evacuation, repatriation and security evacuation) travel insurance for the employee. Travel insurance for family members is highly recommended and the cost will be paid by the employee or the program contingent upon budget availability. Safety & security review. Assignees should research health risks and security concerns in the host county, register their overseas assignment with the US State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), and be familiar with the host program and Institute's emergency procedures. Additionally, the assignee should confirm family member emergency contact information is correct in Techworks. Pre-departure foreign location briefings are available from GTRI Security. Immunizations. The GT Program will pay for recommended immunizations for the overseas assignee and accompanying family members, if not covered by employee's insurance. Contact Stamps Health to determine if immunizations are recommended for travel to the host country. Arrangements for immunizations should be made six to eight weeks prior to departure. Completion of Travel Authority Request (TAR) form. As with any other official GT business trip, the assignee is required to complete a travel authorization prior to departure. Tax services consultation . Assignees should understand their personal tax ramifications of the overseas assignment. Assignees are encouraged to discuss their specific situation with tax professionals. For long-term assignees, GT Program Directors are encouraged to reimburse assignees for pre-departure tax consultation. 5.2 Compensation During Assignment Base Salary Employees on foreign assignments are subject to 94 / 217Employment the same compensation policies and procedures as US-based employees. There is no change to their base pay. They remain on the Institute's US payroll and continue to be paid in US dollars. Salary reviews and merit increases will be conducted pursuant to the Institute's US salary administration guidelines. Upon return to the US, assignees will retain earned merit increases, but any exchange rate differential (ERD) pay will be cancelled. See ERD section below. Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) The Institute does not provide assignees a cost of living adjustment due to their foreign work location. Exchange Rate Differential (ERD) Pay For long-term overseas assignments only : Beginning in the second year of assignment, the exchange rate differential (ERD) (between US dollars (USD) and host country currency) will be reviewed by Global HR for possible supplemental pay. If the value of the USD has declined since the \"set year\" when the employee accepted the assignment, a supplemental pay percentage will be calculated. ERD supplemental pay will be paid to the assignee monthly starting with the anniversary of the assignment start date. Global HR will review the ERD twice per year, in January and July, for possible percentage adjustment to, or cancellation of, the supplemental pay. Any ERD supplemental pay paid to long-term assignees must comply with BOR rules and restrictions. All ERD supplemental pay will be cancelled upon return to the US. Hardship Pay The GT Program pays a hardship allowance to those employees assigned to locations designated hardship areas by the US State Department. The purpose of the allowance is to recognize unusually difficult living conditions. The allowance will be paid as a percentage of base salary, as determined by the US State Department based on the severity of the host location. Taxable expenses Per IRS tax code, the taxability of certain benefits (business travel, housing, local car rental, etc.) may change due to the length of stay. Please refer to the Taxable Benefits Chart in the Forms section. Social Security/Social Taxes Overseas assignees will continue to participate in 95 / 217Employment their US-based retirement plans and the US social security system. Employee contributions will continue to be calculated on the US base salary. If participation in a local host country social tax system is also required, the GT program will pay the employer's share of any mandated social taxes; the employee will pay the employee's share. Method of Payment Unless prohibited by host country law, all compensation will be included in the assignee's regular pay. The standard policy is to deliver pay in US dollars from the home location unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. 5.3 Assignment Allowances & Benefits Relocation Allowance / Assistance with Moving ExpensesPer Program Director established dollar limits, and subject to export control rules, the GT Program will: Ship work-related materials to the host country Cover the cost of shipping personal and household goods to the host country. (See Taxable Benefits Chart in section 10.) Transportation to Host Country: Employee The GT Program will provide airfare for assignee from home country city of record to host country. Note: State regulations and Board of Regents policy require travel by economy class airfare with few exceptions. Employee airfare can be direct billed to the Institute through Travel Inc. Flights can be booked via the Concur web booking tool or by telephone. Transportation to Host Country: Family The GT Program will reimburse, with appropriate receipts, economy-class airfare for the employee's accompanying family members from home country city of record to host country to begin foreign assignment. Spouse and dependent airfare may be purchased through Travel Inc. with a personal credit card. Transporting of pets and their welfare are the responsibility of the employee. Transportation during assignment The GT Program will reimburse certain ground transportation costs incurred for work during overseas assignment. This may be in the form of car rental, car lease, car service or public transportation. The program will set a monthly allowance based on reasonable local practices. The Institute does not ship or store personal automobiles. When renting cars, employees should always request the full package of car insurance. 96 / 217Employment Tax Preparation Assistance For Long Term Overseas Assignments , the GT Program will pay a designated tax services provider for annual filing of personal income taxes in both the US and the host country for the assignee. Home Leave (annually after 12 months)After the first 12 months in a host country, both the employee and their accompanying family members are eligible for an annual economy-class roundtrip to the employee's home country city of record. Employee airfare can be direct billed to the Institute through Travel Inc. Family airfare will be reimbursed, after submission of appropriate receipts, and is considered a taxable benefit. No cash allowances will be provided if home leave trips are not taken and frequency of reimbursed travel to home country city cannot average more than once every twelve months. Housing - Host Country The GT Program will provide housing or a housing stipend for an employee on overseas assignment. The housing arrangements may be based on availability in the host country. Therefore, the size, location and furnished housing options may vary. Only one allowance will be provided per family regardless of the number of family members. Basic utility expenses (i.e., electricity, gas, Internet access) will be covered b y the GT Program. The GT Program will pay all security deposits and key money directly or through reimbursement. Host country home ownership is strongly discouraged and all resulting costs will be at the employee's expense. The Institute will not provide any assistance for home purchase or provide a host housing allowance if a home is purchased in the host location. Renter's Insurance - Host country The Institute strongly encourages the purchase of Renter's Insurance for personal property in the host country. In some countries, this insurance is mandatory. Housing - US As it is intended for the overseas assignee to return to the United States at the completion of the assignment, the Institute does not provide home sale assistance should an assignee decide to sell their US home. This is a personal decision and an assignee should keep in mind that fluctuation in property values or interest rates may adversely affect them while on assignment. If the US home is rented or left vacant, the Institute does not provide property management assistance. 97 / 217Employment As the employee is provided sufficient lead time before starting the assignment, the Institute will not reimburse fees associated with lease cancellation penalties, legal fees involved in negotiating lease termination and/or loss of security deposit. Education Expenses for Children The Institute will not provide or reimburse for dependent education expenses incurred during overseas assignment. Retirement Plans When overseas assignees are paid from US payroll, they will continue to participate in their US- based Institute retirement plans with no interruption. Employees who are on a leave of absence while assigned to a GT affiliated organization will have their retirement contributions suspended during the assignment, per Board of Regents' rules. Working hours and holidays While on assignment, the employee's work schedule will be in accordance with local laws and customs and follow the public holiday calendar in the host county. This may require not complying with the Institute's standard US-based holidays while on overseas assignment Leave Balances An employee's annual vacation and/or sick leave accruals will not be adversely affected by overseas assignment. Vacation and sick leave taken while abroad will continue to be recorded with GTHR. USG Furloughs The Board of Regents has granted the GT President the authority to implement a mandatory furlough program. In the event that this authority is exercised, employee furloughs will be implemented in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Office of the Chancellor. Furlough practices and procedures will apply to employees on international assignments. Spousal Income Employees will not be compensated for any loss of spousal income resulting from the spouse's relocation abroad. Whether a spouse will be eligible for employment abroad will be subject to the labor laws of the host country. If the spouse is able to secure employment abroad, the Institute will not reimburse the employee for any domestic or foreign taxes associated with the spouse's income. The Institute will not provide individual tax assistance to the spouse. Emergency Trip Home The GT program will provide up to $5,000 per household per year to cover costs of roundtrip economy airfare to employee's home country city of record due to an acute health crisis or death in 98 / 217Employment employee's immediate family. 5.4 End of Assignment/ Return to US Policies Assignment Extension If an overseas assignment is extended beyond the original expected completion date, the assignment terms and benefits will be reviewed and modified if needed. In no case will an overseas assignment extend beyond five years. Note: At the five-year assignment anniversary date the employee is considered an expatriate, is not covered by this policy, and should be removed from GT US payroll. Termination of Employment If the Institute terminates the employee or the employee resigns during an overseas assignment, the Institute will pay actual, reasonable moving and transportation expenses for the employee, accompanying family and household goods to the point of origin within 30 days of termination. Return Travel Expenses The GT Program will provide specific air travel expenses incurred while returning from an overseas assignment. Economy-class airfare for employee to employee's home city of record from host country may be direct billed. Reimbursement of economy-class airfare for assignee's accompanying family members to home country city of record from host country. Return Baggage Expenses The GT Program will reimburse the employee for those reasonable shipping expenses for which the employee provides documentation. Although arranging shipment of personal/household goods is generally the responsibility of the employee, the GT Program may provide assistance in making appropriate arrangements with an authorized moving company. Transportation of pets and their welfare are the responsibility of the employee. Reassignment on Return to US Upon completion of a foreign assignment, tenure and tenure-track faculty are assured continued employment with the Institute. The Institute cannot guarantee continued employment for non-tenure track faculty or staff returning from foreign assignment opportunities; however, a reasonable effort will be made to identify a similar position. 5.5 Related Issues Host Country Issues Assignment terms and conditions for all employees assigned outside the United States shall adhere to the guidelines outlined in this policy; except where specific host country laws are in conflict. Due to 99 / 217Employment many variables involved in foreign assignments, the Institute reserves the right to modify these requirements on a case-by-case basis when the Institute deems it appropriate. Additional Benefits Issues Established study abroad and overseas campus (GTL, GTSI) programs may offer additional assignment allowances and benefits as their budgets allow. Sponsored Programs Sponsored Programs often have travel requirements that differ from GT policies.

Policy Statement: The FLSA establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in federal, state, and local governments. Georgia Tech will provide compensation for the established workweek for employees covered by the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Georgia Tech also reserves the right to institute any processes and procedures necessary for complying with relevant state law(s). Scope: The policy applies to all departments, all faculty, staff, and student employees. Procedures: Exempt/Non-Exempt Status Federal and state laws require that overtime must be paid for certain, but not all, jobs. The federal law is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The term \"exempt\" refers to jobs that are excluded from these overtime requirements. This means that employees are not entitled to (or exempt from) overtime pay, regardless of how many hours are worked. The term \"non-exempt\" refers to jobs that are not exempt from legal overtime requirements. This means that employees in non-exempt jobs are entitled to overtime pay for all time worked beyond forty (40) hours in a work week. In accordance with the FLSA, whether a job is classified as exempt or non-exempt depends on the content of the job. It does not depend on how the employee (or the manager) wants the job classified. Human Resources, with advice from the Office of Legal Affairs, makes the final determination as to whether a job is exempt or non-exempt, based on an evaluation of the job as compared to federal regulations. Overtime Compensation The overtime rate of compensation is 1.5 times the regular hourly rate for each hour worked over forty (40) hours in a \"work week\" or Regular Rate (RR) X 1.5 X Overtime hours (OT) = Overtime pay due. (Example: a non-exempt employee's regular rate of pay is $10.00 per hour. He or she worked 10 hours of overtime in a regular work week. Thus, $10.00 x 1.5 x 10 = $150.00 (overtime pay due).) Georgia Tech defines the \"work week\" as beginning on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. and ending at midnight on the following Wednesday. Departments at the Institute may grant compensatory time in lieu of payment for overtime, if the employee agrees to 101 / 217Employment accept compensatory time. See the section below titled \"Compensatory Time\" for additional procedures in using this payment option. Based on the needs of the department, some overtime may be a condition of employment or continued employment. It is to be expected that some departments may engage in temporary periods of mandatory overtime as a result of workload and in order to meet expected outcomes. In other situations, a job's work schedule may be different from the typical Institution workweek so that evening and weekend coverage can be provided without the Institution having to incur the expense of overtime pay. Managers are responsible for informing employees about the needs of the unit and each employee's expected schedule in a timely fashion. Breaks and Meal Times Both exempt and non-exempt employees are encouraged to take occasional breaks or a meal period as reasonable. Managers and supervisors will generally designate any authorized breaks and meal times for each employee's position and schedule. Non-exempt employees are encouraged to take a daily meal period of thirty (30) minutes or more and are encouraged to use this time as personal time where work for the Institute is not expected. Time spent working should be recorded as such even if worked during a designated meal time. Time spent not working for a period of approximately twenty (20) minutes or more, i.e., a \"break\" period, should not be recorded as time worked. Note that state law varies as to meal and break time requirements and to the extent it is in conflict with the above, the Institute complies with state law. Calculating Overtime For purposes of calculating overtime, only hours actually worked will be considered. Vacation, holiday, sick, compensatory time and other leave times granted by the Institute will not factor into the overtime calculation. Timekeeping Employees in non-exempt jobs are required to submit daily time records. Any employee or supervisor who falsifies any time record, application for leave, and the like, is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Travel Time When a non-exempt employee is traveling, managers should meet with them to review and approve the travel itinerary (including, but not limited to, meeting schedule, route, and mode of transportation) and confirm what are considered working hours in accordance with University System of Georgia (USG) and Institute policies and Department of Labor (DOL) regulations. All compensable hours worked during the travel period must be recorded and reported to ensure an accurate calculation for payroll purposes. For additional guidance, please see Compensation for Travel Time Guide for Overtime-Eligible Employees [Include Link]. Approvals Supervisors and managers are expected to monitor the use and impact of overtime on their department to ensure employees are consistently completing work in a reasonable amount of time, as well as ensure that employees are not working unauthorized overtime. 102 / 217Employment Overtime-eligible employees must obtain approval from their direct supervisor for overtime before it is actually worked. Non-exempt employees must be compensated for all overtime hours worked regardless of whether such time was requested in advance. Employees who work overtime without supervisor authorization or fail to report accurately all hours of work are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Compensatory Time Compensatory time, or \"comp time,\" is an alternate way of paying for overtime worked. Instead of paying an employee overtime for work done over the time allotted in the normal work week, an employee's department can allow one hour and a half of time off for each hour of overtime worked. This time may be used in emergencies, or scheduled and approved for personal use. Comp time should not be confused with flexible working arrangements (including \"flextime\") that allow employees to work a schedule with variable arrival, departure and/or lunch times (see Flexwork Arrangements, Policy 8.65) . Flexible working arrangements (or \"flexwork arrangements\"), if approved, allow the Institute to enable employees to serve customers, meet Institute and departmental goals, and balance personal and professional responsibilities. Comp time strictly refers to compensation for overtime worked. Supervisors, with departmental approval, may grant comp time instead of overtime pay to non-exempt employees. The choice of comp time must be made in advance and documented by an agreement between the supervisor and employee. (LINK to FORM.) Approved comp time is subject to a two hundred and forty (240)-hour maximum accumulation. Employees are required to use accrued comp time prior to using other earned/accrued leave. Employees who have reached the comp time maximum must receive a cash payment for any additional overtime. Additionally, all comp time balances on record as of the last full pay period of the fiscal year must be paid out as well. Such payment shall be at the employee's regular earnings rate at the time the payment is made. Employees terminating from the Institution or transferring to a new department or other USG institution will receive a comp time payoff from the department in which they earned the compensatory time. The payoff will be calculated based on the employee's current rate of pay. An employee's request to use their comp time earned is approved utilizing the same process used for vacation. Pay for All Time Worked Institute policy and practice is to accurately compensate employees in compliance with state and federal laws. If an overtime eligible employee works more than forty (40) hours in a workweek, he or she will receive additional pay (or comp time as previously agreed upon with his or her supervisor). To ensure that employees are paid properly for all time worked, an overtime eligible employee must record correctly all work time and review his or her pay records to promptly identify and report errors. Employees also must not engage in off-the-clock or unrecorded work. To Report Violations of This Policy, Communicate Concerns, or Obtain More Information It is a violation of Institute policy for any employee, including management, to falsify a time record. It is also a serious violation of Institute policy for any employee or manager to instruct another employee to incorrectly or falsely report hours worked or alter another employee's time record to under- or over-report hours worked. Employees are prohibited from committing the following actions: (1) incorrectly or falsely under- or over- reporting hours worked, (2) altering another employee's time record(s) to inaccurately or falsely reporting that employee's hours worked, or (3) concealing any falsification of time records. If any employee is instructed or encouraged to violate this policy, he or she should report it immediately to the Sr. Director, HRBPs and 103 / 217Employment Employee Relations or may submit his or her concern on an anonymous (or otherwise) basis through the Ethicspoint system at http://www.ethicspoint.com or call 1.866.294.5565. Non-exempt employees should not work any hours outside of their scheduled work day unless their supervisor has authorized the unscheduled work in advance. Employees should not start work early, finish work late, work during a meal break or perform any other extra or overtime work unless authorized to do so and that time is recorded. Employees are prohibited from performing any \"off-the-clock\" work. \"Off-the-clock\" work means work performed but not recorded as time worked. Any employee who fails to report or inaccurately reports any hours worked will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. An employee with questions about pay deductions or the accuracy of his or her pay record should contact his or her supervisor immediately. If the employee's supervisor is not available or the employee believes it would be inappropriate to contact that person (or if the employee has not received a prompt and fully acceptable reply within three business days), the employee should contact the Sr. Director, HRBPs and Employee Relations or may submit his or her concern on an anonymous (or otherwise) basis through the Ethicspoint system at http://www.ethicspoint.com or call 1.866.294.5565. Every report will be fully investigated and corrective action will be taken, up to and including discharge of any employee(s) who violates this policy. In addition, the Institute will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report alleged violations of this policy or who cooperate in the Institute's investigation of such reports. Any form of retaliation in violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Minimum Wage Effective July 24, 2009, the FLSA requires a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour to be paid to all employees covered under the Act. Child Labor The FLSA prohibits the employment of children of certain ages and in certain hazardous occupations. It also establishes certain hours during which children may or may not work. Exceptions to Policy The policy outlined above applies to all units of the Institute. Any exceptions to policy must be approved by the AVP of Human Resources.

Classified Personnel Policy No: 8.7 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Feb 2005 Last Revised: Feb 2014 Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Charvette Webb Contact Title: Talent Acquisition Manager Contact Email: charvette.webb@ohr.gatech.edu Policy Statement: When a new position is created or when an authorized position becomes vacant, a Job Requisition Form must be completed by the appropriate department and sent to the Compensation or Talent Acquisition, respectively, when ready to fill. The Job Requisition Form is also accessible through the OHR website: www.ohr.gatech.edu in the 'Downloaded Forms' section. Procedures: Job Requisition Departments who wish to fill a vacant position must complete and submit to OHR/Compensation a Job Requisition Form. The Job Requisition Form should be filled out completely. The hiring range (minimum to midpoint) should be documented and any unusual hours should be noted such as overtime or shift work. You must document on the job announcement if applicant testing (drug, background, credit or skills test) is required. The description of duties and requirements must be stated in specific terms, not in the broad sense such as those in the Board of Regents 107 / 217Employment description. A careful distinction should be made between basic qualifications (an absolute necessity to adequately perform the job) and preferred qualifications (that which would enhance ones job performance beyond the minimum). Compensation will write a brief summary of the vacant position (to include duties, education, experience and hiring range). When the announcement has been advertised, Compensation should be informed immediately if editing is required. Physical Requirements Under the Physical Requirements section of the Job Requisition Form, the essential job functions must be listed, such as prolonged standing, bending, reaching, walking, weight lifting, etc. Job Bulletin For new positions, after the job requisition has been reviewed, edited and approved by Compensation, it is sent to the department for submision to Talent Acquisition and assigned to a Recruiting Consultant. The advertising process then begins. The job bulletin is updated daily and may be accessed in the Office of Human Resources receptionist area or on the OHR website:www.ohr.gatech.edu. Jobs may be added and deleted from the job bulletin daily. The Bulletin Process The posting date is not restricted to Monday through Friday. It may begin any day of the week. A position can be posted one of three ways: External Requires the job to be posted on the Georgia Tech website for a minimum of five business days (external and internal applicants may apply). Internal Requires the job to be posted on the Georgia Tech website for a minimum of five business days (only internal applicants may apply). Departmental Must be placed in a conspicuous place within the hiring department for a minimum of five days (only employees within the department may apply, including students and Tech Temps). Normally, a job is first posted internal to the department unless another posting option is requested or if a position is underutilized. If a position is underutilized for females or minorities it is required to be posted external a minimum of five business days. The hiring manager may request an exception, by separate correspondence, through the Talent Acquisition, to the Employee Relations Services (ERS) Director. Talent Acquisition will communicate to the hiring manager, the status of the exception ASAP. Exceptions should include bonafide job related reasons. If you are considering a minority for the vacant position an exception may be given. If the position is underutilized Talent Acquisition will advise the hiring manager to make a good faith effort to ensure a diverse pool of applicants. Talent Acquisition will discuss outreach activities with the hiring manager. Talent Acquisition will contact Employee Relations Services and advise of the underutilization and recruiting strategy. 108 / 217Employment During this period, no resumes will be referred to the hiring manager. ERS will review the applicant pool weekly and determine within the second week of posting, if the applicant pool is diverse. If the applicant pool is not approved, Talent Acquisition will notify the hiring manager that resumes cannot be referred until additional good faith efforts are made. This process continues until a diverse applicant pool is established or a reasonable effort has been made to attract a diverse applicant pool. When ERS approves a diverse pool of applicants Talent Acquisition is given permission to proceed with forwarding all qualified resumes to the hiring manager. The hiring manager is also encouraged to utilize a diverse selection team or committee (2 or more employees, preferably including women and/or minorities) in the hiring process. Newspaper Advertising OHR assists in the preparation/composition of ads. The hiring manager may write the ad; however, Talent Acquisition must review the copy for ERS and University policy compliance. Advertisements should always include the phrase \"GT is an EEO/AA Employer\". All ads must be consistent, specifically the requirements and education with the verbiage listed on the Georgia Tech job bulletin. Billing information is required so that the cost of the ad is billed to the requesting department. Talent Acquisition will provide the hiring manager a draft of the ad to include the estimated cost for review and approval. All ads are billed to the specific department therefore a Project Number is required. Some publications will accept credit cards. Applications Each individual who wishes to be considered for employment with Georgia Tech must submit an application online. The address for the online application is http://www.careers.gatech.edu/. The responsibility of ensuring that an application is submitted is that of the applicant. Georgia Tech Employees must remain in their position for one year. Should an exception be requested the employee must receive permission from their supervisor and the Office of Human Resources. An employee is eligible to apply for a vacant position within their department at any time. Recruiting Efforts Many people of their own initiative apply for positions, including current employees seeking transfers and/or promotions. In addition, OHR makes every effort to recruit qualified applicants. Recruiting takes many forms - advertising, visiting high schools, technical/trade schools, business colleges and other universities, job fairs, internet recruiting, websites, and contacting various government agencies such as the Department of Labor and Vocational Rehabilitation. A concerted effort is made to follow-up on persons referred through recruiting endeavors. As an equal opportunity employer, special efforts are made to invite minorities, female, and disabled individuals to apply. The recruitment process is automated through our web-based system. The hiring process takes place online for applicants, departments and OHR. Applicants search and apply for jobs online. They may also track the status of jobs applied for as well as receive email notification after applying for jobs. All profiles are kept active for one year and can be updated as needed. Applicants are encouraged to review the job bulletin frequently and reapply for new openings. Department Contact A web-based system allows Talent Acquisition and the Hiring department to complete the classified hiring process via 109 / 217Employment the internet. Managers are provided a user-name and password to retrieve resumes. You may contact a Recruiting Consultant if user-name/password is lost or misplaced. The Office of Human Resources makes a concerted and conscientious effort to give each job opening personal attention. Open lines of communication are encouraged between OHR and each department on campus. During the interview process, the Recruiting Consultant appreciates \"feedback\" on the quality of the applicants referred so that future screening will reflect better applicants. All applicants who meet the minimum requirements are referred to the hiring manager. Hiring managers are encouraged to screen applicants regarding preferred skills. Resumes reviewed by the Recruiting Consultant The Recruiting Consultant will review your job every other day and daily when feasible. The hiring manager may at any time review the \"Referred Applicants\" list to see if additional resumes have been referred. Each applicant status may be updated by indicating if the applicant will be interviewed. It may be more applicable to view all applicants first and then make a decision on who you will interview when the position has been placed on hold. Please keep in mind when a decision has been made it can only be revised by your HR Representative. The hiring manager must provide job related reasons for selection/non-selection in the comment section provided for all referred applicants. When the final candidate is chosen, you should immediately request approval for the position. Your request is forward to your HR Rep for review and approval and then forward to the Consultant for final approval. A written email will be forwarded to the hiring manager when the position has been approved by Talent Acquisition. If there are concerns regarding the selection process the Human Resources Representative (HR Rep) will be notified. Note: If the recommended salary exceeds the midpoint you must submit an exception letter to the Director, Compensation, and Administrator for review and approval. An official offer should not be made until approval is received from OHR. References References are required for external applicants only. We request that you submit at least two written references in the database or via mail. Drug Testing Applicants who are chosen for positions that require drug testing for safety sensitive positions will be informed by the appropriate hiring manager. Offers should not be made until drug testing results have been provided to the hiring manager(s).

Any existing employee who is transferred, reassigned, reclassified or promoted into a position requiring a Purchase Card ('P-Card'), when they have not been assigned a P-Card previously, must submit to a credit check. It is the policy of the Institute to check the credit history of any individual applying for a position with access to, or responsibility for, financial resources, including, but not limited to, cash handling and P-Cards. Petition for Waiver of a Background Investigation The hiring department may submit a formal request for a waiver of a Background Investigation. Instances where a waiver may be considered include, but are not limited to; a foreign national applicant's first time entry into the United States with no record of being issued a U.S. social security number and/or demonstration of recently passing screening conducted by an appropriate authority other than Georgia Tech's CRA (for example a valid U.S. government security clearance). All petitions for waiver of a Background Investigation must be submitted on departmental letterhead specifically describing the facts justifying the waiver. Waiver requests will not be considered unless they are approved by the appropriate hiring department official and Talent Acquisition/Office of Human Resources ('OHR'). Hiring departments requesting a waiver are responsible for providing and/or maintaining documentation supporting such a request. All approved petitions will become part of the applicant's permanent personnel file in OHR. Guidelines for Determining Employment Eligibility for Applicants with Criminal History Only criminal convictions may be considered when determining an applicant's eligibility for a specific position or employment as a whole. Detention and/or arrest without conviction do not constitute valid grounds for adverse employment decisions and do not play a part in the decision-making process. If an individual has a criminal case pending, his or her suitability for employment will be reviewed upon disposition of the case. Nevertheless, it may be necessary for the Institute to move forward in the hiring process to satisfy its employment needs. The Institute will make this determination on a case-by-case basis. 1.Conviction of a criminal drug offense shall disqualify an individual for employment with the Institute. A.The first conviction shall disqualify a person for not less than two (2) years. B.Any person who has been convicted of a second or subsequent criminal drug offense shall be ineligible for employment or re-employment for a period of five (5) years from the most recent date of conviction. 2.Felony convictions and convictions of crimes of moral turpitude automatically disqualify an individual for employment with the Institute in a position of trust. 3.Failing to disclose a criminal conviction history where requested in employment application materials will disqualify an applicant for employment with the Institute. 4.When determining whether an applicant with disclosed criminal convictions is eligible for employment or promotion, the BIC will consider the specific responsibilities of the position for which the applicant is being considered, the nature, number and gravity of crimes for which the applicant was convicted and the amount of time that has passed since the conviction. A determination of ineligibility for a specific position as the result of a 113 / 217Employment criminal conviction does not necessarily mean that an individual is ineligible for all employment with the Institute and each such determination will be made on a case-by-case basis. Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Employment, Procurement Card (PCard), or Continued Employment When Verifying Credit History The following are guidelines for the Institute to interpret the information obtained in the credit report for each applicant and/or existing employee. 1.Student loans currently in default and bankruptcies should be considered bad credit. However, a bankruptcy followed by good credit established after filing, indicates an attempt to rectify past credit problems and may be considered acceptable if the bankruptcy occurred more than three (3) years ago. 2.One or more unpaid collections and judgments are considered to be bad credit. Collections and judgments appear under \"Public Records.\" Collections and judgments can be paid, marked paid or satisfied but will not be removed from the credit report for seven (7) years. If collections and judgments have been paid and all other credit is satisfactory, the Institute may approve, at their discretion. 3.Mitigating factors regarding an applicant's credit report, such as hardships and disputes with creditors, will be considered by the Institute upon submission of objective written evidence, as long as the evidence presented, in the sole opinion of the Institute, represents reliable evidence beyond the applicant's control. 4.It is not the responsibility of the Institute to discover research or verify that there are possible mitigating factors. The burden of proof to present mitigating factors rests entirely with the applicant. If the applicant fails to respond in a timely manner to remove or clarify the disqualifying information the hiring manager may proceed with the hiring process and select another applicant. 5.A determination of ineligibility for a specific position based upon an individual's credit report results does not necessarily mean that the individual is ineligible for all employment with the Institute. Each such determination will be made on a case-by-case basis. Process for Conducting a Background Investigation Notice should be included in all job postings that finalists will be required to submit to a Background Investigation. No Background Investigation will be conducted without the written consent of the applicant. Talent Acquisition/OHR is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate Background Disclosure & Authorization Form ('consent form'), as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), is completed. Refusal to sign a consent form at any juncture of the application process will eliminate that applicant from further consideration for employment. Talent Acquisition/OHR shall provide the Hiring Department all required employment paperwork, including the consent form, to be given to the final applicant. If an existing employee applies for a promotion, the Institute shall obtain the employee's consent prior to initiating a Background Investigation. The employee will undergo a Background Investigation if it has been a year or more since the Institute's last Background Investigation of the employee. A conditional offer of employment/promotion may be made at this time. Important: All written contingent offers of employment must include the following statement: \"This offer of employment is contingent upon completion of a background investigation including: (1) a criminal background check demonstrating your eligibility for employment with the Georgia Institute of Technology, as determined by the Institute in its sole discretion, (2) confirmation of your credentials and (3) if applicable, other necessary employment checks.\" Upon receipt of a signed consent form and a Background Information Form from the Hiring Department's applicant and a Background Investigation Request Form from the Hiring Department, Talent Acquisition/OHR will initiate the Background Investigation. If the top applicant is not hired for the involved position (e.g., criminal conviction precludes 114 / 217Employment hiring, other criminal convictions render applicant ineligible for the specific position, applicant does not accept the job offer, etc.), the Hiring Department may select another applicant for the position. Once the appropriate forms for the next selected applicant are received by Talent Acquisition/OHR, Talent Acquisition/OHR will initiate the Background Investigation. Discovery, at any time, of false, incomplete, or misleading information on a resume, application, or any other official document or in statements made during an interview, will result in disqualification for and/or termination of employment. Conviction of a criminal drug offense shall disqualify an applicant for not less than two (2) years. Any applicant who has been convicted of a second or subsequent criminal drug offense shall be ineligible for employment or re-employment for a period of five (5) years from the most recent date of conviction. If an applicant is a current employee and the background investigation report reveals adverse information which constitutes grounds for termination, OHR will initiate the appropriate termination procedure. OHR's Employee Relations unit will draft a formal letter to the employee notifying him/her of the circumstances. The formal letter will include the rationale for the actions taken and information regarding the employee's option to contest the accuracy of his/her background investigation report. The employee will be given an appropriate and reasonable amount of time to contest the accuracy of his/her background investigation report before formal termination is initiated. How Criminal Background Investigation Information is Processed: Background Investigation reports are submitted directly to Talent Acquisition/OHR by the CRA conducting the investigation. The BIC is responsible for determining the eligibility of the selected applicant for employment with the Institute. Talent Acquisition/OHR should notify the Hiring Department of this determination. The BIC makes its decision about the selected applicant's eligibility as follows: 1.The Background Investigation report shows no convictions : the selected applicant is eligible for employment. 2.The Background Investigation report shows one or more felony convictions or conviction of one or more crimes of moral turpitude and the applicant is applying for a position of trust: the selected applicant is ineligible for employment with the Institute in a position of trust. Prior to making this final determination, Talent Acquisition/OHR must give a pre-adverse action disclosure to the applicant. This pre-adverse action disclosure must include a copy of the applicant's Background Investigation report, together with the name, address and telephone number of the CRA that conducted the Background Investigation, and information on how to dispute information in the report. A copy of \"A Summary of Your Rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act\" must also be provided to the applicant. The applicant must be given an opportunity (a minimum of three business days) to provide an explanation in writing of the circumstances surrounding the results of the background investigation, including any mitigating factors, and have this explanation considered prior to the finalization of the hiring decision. It is not the responsibility of the Institute to discover research or verify that there are possible mitigating factors. The burden of presenting mitigating factors rests entirely with the applicant. If the applicant fails to respond in a timely manner to remove or clarify the disqualifying information, the hiring manager may proceed with the hiring process and select another applicant. If the applicant successfully shows that s/he has no felony convictions or convictions of crimes of moral turpitude, then the applicant shall be eligible for employment in a position of trust. Talent Acquisition/OHR will notify the Hiring Department of this determination. If the applicant is unsuccessful in showing no felony convictions or convictions of crimes of moral turpitude, then the applicant is ineligible for employment in a position of trust. An adverse action notice must then be sent to the applicant. This notice must include: a.the name, address and telephone number of the CRA that supplied the Background 115 / 217Employment Investigation report; b.a statement that the CRA that supplied the Background Investigation report did not make the decision to take the adverse action and cannot give specific reasons for it; and c.a notice of the individual's right to dispute the accuracy and completeness of any information the CRA furnished in the Background Investigation report and the right of the individual to obtain an additional free report from the CRA upon request within sixty days. 3.The Background Investigation report shows one or more criminal convictions or conviction of one or more crimes of moral turpitude and the applicant is not applying for a position of trust: a.If the criminal convictions were all disclosed by the selected applicant in the application materials , the BIC will determine whether the applicant is eligible for the involved position based on the job description and the nature of the crimes of which the applicant was convicted. i.If the BIC determines the applicant is eligible, Talent Acquisition/OHR will so notify the Hiring Department. ii.If the BIC determines the applicant is not eligible, then prior to making this final determination, Talent Acquisition/OHR must give a pre-adverse action disclosure to the applicant. This pre-adverse action disclosure must include a copy of the applicant's Background Investigation report, together with the name, address and telephone number of the CRA that conducted the Background Investigation, and information on how to dispute information in the report. A copy of \"A Summary of Your Rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act\" must also be provided to the applicant.

It is not the responsibility of the Institute to discover research or verify that there are possible mitigating factors. The burden of proof to present mitigating factors rests entirely with the applicant. If the applicant fails to respond in a timely manner to remove or clarify the disqualifying information the hiring manager may proceed with the hiring process and select another applicant. If the applicant successfully shows that s/he does not have the criminal convictions that led the BIC to determine that the applicant was ineligible for employment, then the applicant shall be eligible for employment. Talent Acquisition/OHR will notify the Hiring Department of this determination. If the applicant is unsuccessful in showing that s/he does not have the criminal convictions that led the BIC to determine that the applicant was ineligible for employment, then the applicant is ineligible for employment. An adverse action notice must then be sent to the applicant. This notice must include: a.the name, address and telephone number of the CRA that supplied the Background Investigation report; b.a statement that the CRA that supplied the Background Investigation report did not make the decision to take the adverse action and cannot give specific reasons for it; and c.a notice of the individual's right to dispute the accuracy and completeness of any information the CRA furnished in the Background Investigation report and the right of the individual to obtain an additional free report from the CRA upon request within sixty days. b.If the criminal convictions were not disclosed by the selected applicant in the application materials, Talent Acquisition/OHR will notify the applicant in writing that the Background Investigation 116 / 217Employment revealed criminal convictions not disclosed in his/her application materials and that s/he will be removed from consideration for the involved position due to misrepresentation and falsifying application materials unless s/he contacts Talent Acquisition/OHR and corrects any inaccuracies contained in the report within a minimum of three (3) business days. This notification will be accompanied by a pre-adverse action disclosure. i.The pre-adverse disclosure must include a copy of the applicant's Background Investigation report, together with the name, address and telephone number of the CRA that conducted the Background Investigation, and information on how to dispute the information in the report. A copy of \"A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act\" must also be provided to the applicant. ii.The applicant must be given an opportunity (a minimum of three business days) to provide an explanation in writing of the circumstances surrounding the results of the background investigation, including any mitigating factors, and have this explanation considered prior to the finalization of the hiring decision.

An adverse action notice must then be sent to the applicant. This notice must include: a.the name, address and telephone number of the CRA that supplied the Background Investigation report; b.a statement that the CRA that supplied the Background Investigation report did not make the decision to take the adverse action and cannot give specific reasons for it; and c.a notice of the individual's right to dispute the accuracy and completeness of any information the CRA furnished in the Background Investigation report and the right of the individual to obtain an additional free report from the CRA upon request within sixty days. Credit Checks If the BIC determines that the applicant or employee fails to meet credit screening criteria, Talent Acquisition/OHR must give a pre-adverse action disclosure notice to the applicant. The notification must include the following: 1.The name, address and telephone number of the CRA (including a toll-free telephone number, if it is a nationwide CRA) that provided the report. 2.A statement that the CRA did not make the adverse decision and is not able to explain why the decision was made. 3.A statement setting forth the applicant's right to obtain a free disclosure of the applicant's file from the CRA if the applicant makes a request within sixty (60) days. 4.A statement setting forth the applicant's right to dispute directly with the CRA the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by the CRA. Maintenance of Background Investigation Reports Background investigation reports obtained on new or existing employees shall be delivered directly to Talent 117 / 217Employment Acquisition/OHR by the CRA performing the investigation. The report will remain with Talent Acquisition/OHR until the determination on employment or promotion eligibility has been made and then stored separate from the employee's OHR personnel file. Talent Acquisition/OHR shall place a certification in the employee's personnel file stating the date the report was obtained, the name of the person who reviewed the report and a statement that the report showed that the employee was or was not eligible for employment or promotion. Reports on all non-successful applicants for employment and applicants for promotion must be destroyed in accordance with the University System of Georgia ('USG') record retention guidelines. The background report itself is not provided to nor maintained by the Hiring Unit. Except as may be required by law, Talent Acquisition/OHR shall not release the background reports to any person or entity except to members of the BIC for purposes of determining employment eligibility. Consent forms for Background Investigations shall be placed in the personnel file of the employee and maintained in accordance with USG Record Retention Guidelines.

Testing - Classified Personnel Policy No: 8.63 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Jun 2005 Last Revised: Feb 2014 Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Charvette Webb Contact Title: Talent Acquisition Manager Contact Email: charvette.webb@ohr.gatech.edu Policy Statement: Georgia Tech provides equal opportunity with respect to all employment practices including employment testing. The Office of Human Resources is the sole authority in administering software skills tests to measure a candidate's ability to perform certain essential functions of a position. Procedures: General Testing Candidates may be asked to demonstrate job-related skills or provide work examples to assist hiring supervisors in their evaluation of a candidate's qualifications. All similarly qualified candidates for a position must be given the same opportunity. All selected tests must be job-related and supported by the position description. Testing for specific positions must be included in the job announcement. Disabled Candidates An individual with a known disability, which prevents him/her from taking the test or performing the demonstration of a 118 / 217Employment skill, may request an accommodation. Reasonable accommodations may include, but are not limited to, modification of the methods for providing testing, use of adaptive equipment or aids, etc. Hiring supervisors who know of a candidate's disability or receive a request for accommodation in testing should contact the Office of Human Resources/Disability Services at (404) 894-3344. Job Openings Subject to Testing Tests currently administered by OHR consist of office automation software, clerical skills, data entry skills and speed typing. Job openings that necessitate applicant testing are those positions requiring the use of personal computer skills in word processing, database, spreadsheet and/or presentation graphics applications and/or the demonstration of certain office support skills. Such positions include all secretarial, clerical and administrative assistant classifications as well as many accounting and technical positions. Cost for Test Administration The current cost for each software test administered by OHR is $25.00. OHR will use the P. O. # listed on the Applicant Testing Request to transfer funds from the requesting department. Applicant Testing Request The hiring manager will specify the test(s) to be administered when the Job Requisition is submitted to the OHR/Compensation Administration Office. A copy of the web based Qwiz Online Assessment tests is included in this policy. Upon reviewing the assessment list, complete the Applicant Testing Request Form . The Applicant Testing Request form must accompany the Job Requisition submitted to Compensation Administration to initiate the hiring process. The basis for test selection will be the software a successful candidate will be expected to use on an ongoing basis as an essential job function or the clerical skills that must be demonstrated. Selection of Applicants for Testing Following review of applications and/or resumes, the hiring contact will select those candidates whose qualifications appear best matched to the job requirements. The Employment Specialist assigned to the position will coordinate with the hiring contact to make arrangements to schedule testing. The average time frame for each test is 20-30 minutes. Test Administration At the scheduled time, the Testing Administrator (OHR second floor) will greet the candidate(s), introduce him or her to the testing process, and bring up applicable software test on the PC in the testing station. Once testing is completed, the system will automatically send the test results via email to the appropriate Employment Specialist. The Employment Specialist will then forward scores to the hiring contact. OHR will maintain files on all tests administered. Test Score Standards Several factors are involved in the selection process. In those cases where testing is applicable, the resulting test scores would certainly be one of the factors. However, test scores alone should not indicate whether or not an applicant should be hired. Other factors such as length of service, type of experience, interpersonal skills, etc. should also be considered. During evaluation of a candidate's test scores, it is often helpful to have a point of reference for purposes of comparison. When the hiring contact receives test scores, also included will be the Qwiz campus average for those who have taken the same test; and, the national average from Qwiz. 119 / 217Employment Related Documents: Application Testing Request Form.doc Quiz Assessment Tests.doc Immigration Employment of Foreign Nationals Policy No: 8.3 Last Revised: Mar 2016 Review Date: Mar 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Lori Jones Contact Title: Global HR Supervisor Contact Email: lori.jones@gatech.edu Reason for Policy: This policy provides departments with general guidelines for inviting Exchange Visitors, processing petitions for the most common non-immigrant employment classifications, and for permanent residence for foreign nationals employed at the Institute. Policy Statement: This policy addresses the hiring of foreign nationals in academic and research positions, not the employment of enrolled students. In accordance with federal regulations defining the employment of foreign nationals, the Institute has delegated to the Office of International Education (OIE) sole authority to administer the Department of State's J-1 Exchange Visitor Program. The Institute has delegated to Human Resources (Global HR) sole authority to work with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Department of Labor to petition for the B-1, E-3, H-1B, O-1, TN and U.S. permanent residency based on Institute employment in support of the teaching and research mission of Georgia Tech. Per Georgia state law, these petitions cannot be filed by private attorneys on behalf of Georgia Tech. Therefore no Institute representative may sign a G-28 (Notice of Appearance) allowing an attorney to represent Georgia Tech. Procedures: Overview Immigration regulations, legislation, and interpretations are constantly changing. More detailed, up-to-date information on immigration matters can be obtained from Global Human Resources (Global HR) and the Office of International Education (OIE). Hiring foreign nationals and bringing them to Georgia Tech in a timely manner requires specialized attention and advice. Department of Labor regulations prevent employers from allowing foreign nationals to volunteer in positions that are usually compensated. Foreign nationals who are awaiting the necessary employment authorization or whose work authorization has expired are not allowed to serve as volunteers. Note: Foreign nationals who are financially supported by a source other than the Institute are not considered volunteers. Federal law restricts the export of goods and technology pursuant to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). An export includes the release or disclosure, including verbal disclosures or visual inspections, of covered technology, software or technical data to any foreign national whether in the U.S. or abroad. 120 / 217Employment Thus, when research or educational activities involve providing information or a transfer of technology to foreign nationals, it is important to know whether the goods, services, data, or technology are covered by the export control laws and regulations. Non-Academic, Non-Research Staff and Others Georgia Tech does not sponsor the following individuals for employment based visas nor for exchange visitor visas: technical, administrative, library, or support staff members; individuals with inadequate funding, insurance, or credentials; those whose particular visa history precludes sponsorship. Additionally, Georgia Tech does not provide visa sponsorship to recent graduates and practicing professionals for internship training, practical experiences, or other non-teaching, non-research affiliations. Orientation/Registration The arrival and departure of scholars must be reported to either Global HR or OIE in order to comply with federal regulations and maintain accurate records. All new scholars in the J-1 status should \"check in\" at OIE upon their arrival at Georgia Tech. Scholars should bring their passports and other visa documents to complete the required registration process. Additionally, OIE offers regularly scheduled orientation sessions for international scholars in the J-1 status and their family members. Information about the next orientation session will be given to the scholar when checking in. The orientation includes information helpful in the \"settling-in\" process and important information on visa requirements and Georgia Tech resources. If a scholar cannot attend orientation, OIE should be notified immediately. New scholars in the other nonimmigrant or immigrant categories must check in with Global HR upon arrival at Georgia Tech. Visiting Scholars who are not employees of Georgia Tech, i.e. all B-1 business visitors and some J-1 Exchange Visitors, must sign a \"Visiting Scholars Agreement\" with the Office of Legal Affairs. OIE or Global HR notify Departments, Laboratories, and Center headquarters four to six months in advance of the scholar's appointment or visa status end date, whichever comes first. If a sponsoring department indicates that a scholar's stay will be extended, OIE or Global HR provides relevant instructions for extension of immigration status. Program Completion Departments, Laboratories, and Centers are required to notify OIE or Global HR when a scholar completes his/her appointment earlier than expected, in order for OIE or Global HR to notify the appropriate government agency. Nonimmigrant Visa Categories Per Chapter 8 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, individuals in the following nonimmigrant categories, among others, are not eligible for Georgia Tech appointment, employment, or payment under any circumstances. Georgia Tech appointment, employment, or payment is not permitted unless/until the individual obtains an immigration status permitting such affiliation under the law. There may also be restrictions on access to some areas or facilities. Please see the Visitor's Policy for these restrictions. B-2 (or VWT) Visitor for Pleasure (Tourist) F-2 Spouse or Children of F-1 students H-4 Spouse or Children of H-1B, H-2, or H-3 TD Spouse or Children of TN O-3 Spouse or Children of O-1 The nonimmigrant visa categories most commonly used for GT research and teaching activities are discussed briefly below: 121 / 217Employment J-1 Exchange Visitor (Professor, Research Scholar, Short-term Scholar) H-1B Visa for Temporary Workers in Specialty Occupations B-1 (or VWB) Visitor for Business TN Visa for Professionals who are nationals of Canada and Mexico O-1 Visa for Individuals of \"Extraordinary\" Ability E-3 visa for Australian nationals who are Temporary Workers in Specialty Occupations Immigrant Visas (Permanent Residence) In order to be sponsored, faculty members must meet the criteria for the first preference classification, \"Outstanding Professor/Researcher;\" or for the second preference classification under the \"special handling\" provisions for college teachers. Researchers must meet criteria for a first preference classification, \"Outstanding Professor/Researcher.\" Labor certification will not be pursued for research positions. Information about these categories, including qualifications, application procedures, limitations, and payment options for scholars, is available at the Global HR website.

Procedures: General Guidelines The faculty member, or other personnel, should receive full contract pay from the base institution. The employee thus should continue in \"fully employed\" status at the base institution. Each institution sharing the employee's time should budget its share of the employee's time (EFT) and dollars. Care should be taken to see that the EFT and dollars do not exceed the employee's contract. Upon making distributions of salary and wage costs from routine payroll records, the base institution would enter the personal service expenditures on its records in accordance with established procedures. Settlement of accounts may be effected by arrangements of several fiscal officers of the institutions involved. The timing and method shall be at the discretion of said officers. Staff Benefits related to the Personnel Service dollars involved may be transferred if the amount is deemed material by the fiscal officers involved. In instances where Sponsored Operations are involved, the overhead allowance in any given contract shall remain at the institution where the Sponsored Project is located. Exceptions to this rule may be made if the amount is material. An amount shall be considered material if it exceeds 50% of the total overhead allowance for that project. This statement shall not apply to situations where Sponsored Projects are awarded jointly to two or more institutions. The arrangement as stipulated in the contract shall prevail in such instances. 123 / 217Employment Non-Retaliation Policy Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Mar 2018 Review Date: Mar 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Julie Joyce Contact Title: Sr Dir-HRBP & Empl Relations Contact Email: julie.joyce@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: Georgia Tech has a responsibility to protect its employees from unlawful retaliation, and retaliation will not be tolerated at Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech has a strong interest in encouraging the reporting of misconduct and employees must be free from fear of retaliation to support that interest. Policy Statement: Retaliation against any employee, who, in good faith, files a complaint or grievance; seeks the aid of Human Resources; testifies or participates in investigations, compliance reviews, proceedings or hearings; or opposes actual or perceived violations of policy or unlawful acts is strictly forbidden. This policy does not protect an employee who provides information that she or he knows is false, files a bad faith retaliation claim, or participates in any illegal conduct. Georgia Tech will take timely and appropriate action, up to and including dismissal, against any employee who violates this non-retaliation policy. Scope: This policy applies to all Georgia Tech employees, including student employees. Definitions Retaliation Retaliation is any materially adverse action taken or threatened against an employee because the employee has, in good faith, filed a complaint or grievance; sought the aid of Human Resources; testified or participated in investigations, compliance reviews, proceedings or hearings; or opposed actual or perceived violations of policy or unlawful acts. Good Faith Reporting A reasonable and sincere belief that the information provided is true. Bad Faith Reporting Knowingly or recklessly providing false information. Reporting If an employee believes that she or he has been retaliated against, the employee should contact one of the following resources to make a retaliation claim: Georgia Tech Office of Human Resources (Staff Complaints)hr.ask@ohr.gatech.edu or 404-894-4847 124 / 217Employment Georgia Tech Office of the Provost (Faculty Complaints)vpgefd@gatech.edu or 404-385-5726 EthicsPoint (Faculty EthicsPoint is a third-party vendor available 24/7 that allows for confidential or anonymous reporting.

A comprehensive performance management system empowers employees to have greater input to their personal career progression and will enable managers to better identify, recognize, and reward individuals based upon an agreed set of criteria. 125 / 217Employment Policy Statement: Georgia Tech strives to provide an environment where all employees understand the impact their contributions have on the achievement of Institute goals and are provided the opportunity for ongoing personal growth. One way we can accomplish this goal is through a strong performance based management program that culminates in an annual performance review. The performance management process is continuous as we plan, manage, review, and reward performance. Scope: Entities Affected By This Policy All classified employees at the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Who Should Read This Policy All classified employees at the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Contacts Policy Terms: Performance Goals Help to define what is expected of you in your current position in relation to the department and/or unit's overall goals. Career Development Goals Outline opportunities for professional development and/or career growth Competencies Competencies are the key capabilities, characteristics, and behaviors that all Georgia Tech employees need to develop and demonstrate in order to drive superior work performance. Procedures: The Georgia Tech Performance Management Process consists of a four-phase cycle: planning, managing, reviewing, and rewarding performance. The planning phase is the foundation of the entire Performance Management process. In this phase, individual goals and objectives are set for the performance period. Goals that are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time based) increase employee motivation and commitment to goal attainment, leading to greater performance and productivity. Regular communication between the manager and employee is critical during the managing phase of the performance management cycle. Through formal and informal conversations, both parties are kept abreast of progress towards the successful completion of goals and expectations. These discussions also enable the manager to provide timely feedback and coaching as the year unfolds. Because the performance cycle spans several months, it is important for managers and employees to keep track of key performance highlights and challenges that occur during the year. These notes will help immensely when it's time to prepare the annual review. At the conclusion of the evaluation cycle, the manager meets with the employee to conduct the annual performance review. If SMART goals have been set (planning phase) and ongoing communication/feedback has taken place (managing phase), the overall outcome of the annual review should come as no surprise to the employee. 126 / 217Employment When merit increases are available, employees may receive an increase to their annual base pay as a reward for meritorious performance. It is important to remember that performance increases should be differentiated between employees based upon their overall performance ratings and, in general, top performers should receive higher pay increases. Additional resources are available on the Human Resources website at www.ohr.gatech.edu/performance . The University System of Georgia prohibits employees grieving performance reviews (refer to the University System of Georgia's Grievance Policy for more details). Goal Setting At least two performance goals are required for all employees with the recommended average being two to four goals. Competencies All Georgia Tech employees will be rated on the following seven competencies: Decision Making Able to analyze situations fully and accurately and reach productive decisions. Consults appropriate parties when necessary and identifies the key concerns and/or issues that need to be addressed in order to make the best decision possible. Effective Communications Able to express ideas in a clear, concise, and effective manner, whether speaking or in writing. Uses correct grammar and sentence structure in communications.

Additionally, it provides the opportunity for the supervisor to review the employee's developmental needs and formulate and communicate a development plan designed to improve performance. Policy Statement: Board of Regents and Institute policy requires that all classified employees serve the first six months of employment on a provisional basis, which is designated as the employee's probationary period. If the employee completes this period, the supervisor should review the employee's performance from that period and advise the employee of his/her progress in meeting assigned job duties and responsibilities. Scope: Entities Affected By This Policy All classified employees of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Who Should Read This Policy All employees of the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Procedures: With the exception of certain public safety personnel, all classified employees are required to serve the first six months of employment with the Institute on a provisional basis. During this period, the new employee should receive an on-the- job orientation relative to the work environment and job expectations so that he or she can begin fulfilling job duties on a regular basis. The supervisor should monitor the new employee's performance in the job and take appropriate action as necessary to make sure that expectations are being met, such as providing on-going feedback to the new employee regarding his or her performance relative to job expectations. Immediately following the completion of the probationary period, and if the services of the employee are still needed, then the employee's performance should be formally reviewed and documented. Should performance problems occur during the first six months of employment, the supervisor should contact the Performance and Talent Management unit of the Office of Human Resources. Public safety employees are subject to the same provisional employment requirements as other classified employees, except that the six month provisional period will not begin until any training mandated by the State of Georgia for certification as a police officer has been completed (if such training occurs after employment with the Institute begins). The probationary review process involves assessing the employee's work performance during the first six months of 129 / 217Employment employment relative to specific indicators and an overall rating. The following rating categories are employed: Meeting Expectations Needs Improvement The University System of Georgia prohibits employees grieving performance reviews (refer to the University System of Georgia's Grievance Policy for more details). Completing the Performance Review Form The Performance Review Form should be completed by the employee's immediate supervisor within two weeks following completion of the first six months of employment. The supervisor should first complete the identifying information required in the heading (name, job title, unit, dates, etc.). Next, the supervisor should assign a rating for each indicator by checking the appropriate block and entering comments as appropriate in the space provided at the end of the form. For any indicators rated as \"Needs Improvement\", the supervisor must enter in the Comments section specifically what causes justify the rating. Entries in the Comments section for \"Meeting Expectations\" are optional. Following the rating of each indicator, the supervisor should formulate an overall rating reflective of those individual ratings and enter that information on the 3rd page of the form. The Comments on Ratings section has been provided for noting clarifications or explanations regarding any aspects of the review. This section is intended to provide an opportunity for the supervisor to support the individual and overall ratings with narrative comments related to actual performance during the probationary period. Explanations should include references to actual incidences that support a given rating. Additional pages may be added to the form if needed. Communicating Results of the Probationary Period Performance Review Supervisors must inform employees through face-to-face communication as well as documentation of how their performance has been rated. Prior to this meeting the supervisor should have: Completed and signed the Performance Review form. Reviewed the results with his or her immediate supervisor and obtained approval. Developed a discussion outline to follow during the interview. Reserved a location where the interview can be conducted in private without interruption. The meeting should be structured as a two-way means of communication between the supervisor and employee. The employee should be encouraged throughout the meeting to participate in the discussion. During the meeting, each performance indicator should be covered by reviewing the indicator and the rating that was assigned. Actual occurrences that influenced the rating should be offered. At the conclusion of the meeting, the employee should sign the form in the space provided. The employee's signature verifies only that the employee and supervisor have participated in a formal review of performance. It should not be construed as either agreement with or objection to the results of the review. Should the employee refuse to sign, the supervisor should make a note on the Performance Review Form and notify the Performance and Talent Management 130 / 217Employment unit of the Office of Human Resources. The employee should be provided with a copy of the completed and signed Performance Review Form at the end of the meeting. The supervisor is encouraged to keep a copy of the form for his or her records. The reviewer should sign the form in the space provided and obtain the signatures of the next level supervisor. The completed form should be routed to the Office of Human Resources- 0685 for further processing and filing. Probationary Period Review Notification Each month the Performance and Talent Management unit of the Office of Human Resources will compile a list of classified employees by unit who are about to complete their first six months of employment. The list will be sorted on an organizational basis and notifications sent to the appropriate Human Resources Representative. The Human Resources Representative will then be accountable for coordinating the probationary review process within his or her organization including review and return of completed forms to OHR.

Progressive Discipline Policy No: 5.13 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Jul 2015 Last Revised: Jul 2015 Review Date: Jul 2018 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Sylvie Callier-Moses Contact Title: Employee Relations Consultant Contact Email: sylvie.callier-moses@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: To improve performance, attendance, and/or behavior by coaching employees and encouraging ownership of their job and career Policy Statement: Progressive Discipline is a constructive and corrective approach to solving work related performance, attendance, and/or behavior concerns. Through this process, employees are provided with the information needed to understand what aspect of their work performance, attendance, and/or behavior is unacceptable and what improvements are needed to demonstrate success. Scope: Entities Affected By This Policy All staff at the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Who Should Read This Policy All staff at the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Procedures: Overview 135 / 217Employment It is the responsibility of all employees to adhere to the expectations outlined by their supervisor and to the standard of conduct at Georgia Tech. When employees fail to uphold these standards, the progressive disciplinary process may be utilized. However, there is no required number or sequence of warnings or reprimands that must take place before an employee is terminated. Further, some circumstances may warrant immediate termination. If the progressive discipline process is used, managers must document the steps of the process as they occur. The steps involved in the process may include: verbal warning, written warning, final written warning, suspension, and termination. Performance and Talent Management (PTM) will review all supervisory recommendations involving disciplinary suspension, investigative suspension, demotion, or discharge and approve or deny such recommendations prior to actions being taken. As part of that process, PTM will review all disciplinary actions that have occurred to ensure they have been fairly administered and are consistent with policy and past practice. Process/Procedures For less severe infractions, the initial disciplinary action may be a verbal warning. The discussion between the employee and manager should be serious and professional in manner to ensure that the employee clearly understands the established standards and expectations with regard to his/her unacceptable performance or behavior. A written record of the date and content of the discussion should be maintained in the appropriate file. A written warning may be issued if the unacceptable behavior is more severe or frequent in nature and/or a verbal warning has already been issued. The written warning should outline the undesirable behavior, state expectations, and indicate the consequences that will occur if there is no improvement in performance. Written warnings should be forwarded to the Office of Human Resources for placement in the employee's official personnel file. Suspension without pay may follow a verbal or written warning or may be the first disciplinary action taken if warranted by the circumstances. Prior to suspending an employee, managers must obtain approval from PTM in the Office of Human Resources and supply appropriate supporting documentation. The length of the suspension will depend on the facts of each case such as type and severity of the behavior, previous work performance of the employee, and prior disciplinary actions. The suspension letter should outline the undesirable behavior, state expectations, and indicate the consequences that will occur if there is not any improvement. A copy of the letter should be forwarded to the Office of Human Resources for placement in the employee's official personnel file. An employee may be suspended without pay for serious infractions of workplace conduct rules, including, but not limited to, rules prohibiting sexual harassment, workplace violence or drug or alcohol use, or for violations of state or federal laws. Exempt employees may be suspended without pay for serious misconduct, but may not be suspended for performance or attendance issues. Deductions from the pay of an exempt employee may be made for suspensions of one or more full days imposed for disciplinary reasons for infractions of workplace conduct rules, and such disciplinary deductions may only be made in full day increments. An employee may be placed on an investigative suspension because of alleged serious misconduct. In these cases, the employee is removed from the workplace while the Office of Human Resources investigates the matter. Normally investigative suspension is leave with pay. The Office of Human Resources must approve any investigative suspension. Termination may be advised when an employee has engaged in serious misconduct or has not corrected performance and/or behavior. Prior to dismissing an employee, managers must obtain approval from PTM in the Office of Human Resources and supply appropriate supporting documentation. If approved, the written letter of termination includes the reason for termination, effective date, and information regarding the appeal process. Please refer to Progressive Discipline Procedures for additional information on documentation, counseling, and 136 / 217Employment responsibilities for managers.

This includes items given to employees and their families as expressions of sympathy. This policy pertains to purchases made with any Institute funding source, including state, GTF, GTRC, and sponsored funds. The policy establishes consistent, equitable treatment and prudent judgment for gift purchases. The policy also ensures compliance with university funding restrictions, state purchasing guidelines, IRS tax implications, and other applicable regulations. The policy also provides parameters for what constitutes a reasonable amount and type of gift. Policy Statement: Georgia Tech policy generally prohibits giving gifts to individual employees or students from Institute funding sources except for the following cases: length of service recognition gifts, retiring or separating employees, formal and announced employee recognition awards, sympathy gifts recognizing the loss of a close family member, gifts of support following significant illness of employee gifts given to groups of employees to recognize team performance gifts and prizes for participation in university events or activities. Even in the cases above, which are allowable instances for gifts, Georgia Tech policy prohibits the use of most funding sources for gifts to employees except for GTF funds. No gift should ever be given to an employee under the premise that it is related to a specific performance event. It is not appropriate to use Institute funds for door prizes unless de minimis in nature (not to exceed $50). Gifts of technology and alcohol are generally not appropriate for purchase with Institute resources (of any type). Gifts should generally be personal memorabilia. In most cases, gifts to employees or students of technology or alcohol are not appropriate for purchase with Institute resources (of any type). Gifts and Events for Personal Events The recognition of faculty, staff, or students for milestones not related to work or education, such as weddings, birthdays, and baby showers, should be paid for from personal funds. Non- work related events and gifts should not involve Georgia Tech business procedures for payment processing, even when personal contributions are collected for such an event or gift. Length of Service Recognition Gifts can be given to employees to recognize length of service if they are given to the employee as part of a meaningful ceremony, the employee has at least 10 years of service and, the employee has not received a similar gift in the past five years. Length of service awards and awards recognizing employee safety milestones/goals, are not subject to tax withholding as long as it is tangible property. 138 / 217Employment Retirement or Separation Gifts Gifts given to a retiring or separating employee should be given as part of a meaningful ceremony/reception and the value of the gift(s) should correspond to the length of service, but generally should not exceed $400. Gifts in excess of $400 should be approved through a Foundation Expenditure Exception Request Form, for GTF funds, or by e-mail to the GTRC Controller with an explanation, for GTRC Funds. Employee Recognition Awards Gifts may also be given to employees as part of an approved and established employee award program and based on announced objective criteria. Such awards should be presented to employees on a basis that does not discriminate and amounts of the awards should correspond to the rigor of receiving the award. Please see the \"Awards and Recognition\" site noted in the Related Information section of this policy for examples and amounts. Awards of cash that are given to recognize outstanding service, contributions to the Institute, or other criteria are taxable and should be processed through Georgia Tech Payroll Services. A gift of tangible property is generally not taxable. Sympathy Gifts Sympathy gifts are appropriate in cases of serious illness or death of an employee or immediate family member. Such sympathy acknowledgements are allowable because Georgia Tech recognizes the value of employees to the Institute and the working relationships developed during employment enrich the lives of all Institute employees. Gifts of sympathy generally should be tangible property such as flowers, fruit baskets, and meals generally under $100. Monetary contributions to charitable organizations in lieu of personal property may be given if consistent with the value of a traditional commemoration. These gifts are not taxable due to their nature and nominal value. Recognition of Team Performance Gifts may be given to groups of employees to show appreciation for their participation as part of a team, department, or Institute event. Gifts of this nature are typically one of a number of identical items (t-shirts, scarves, Georgia Tech spirit memorabilia, etc.). Gifts in this category should be de minimis (trivial), not occur frequently, and should not exceed $50. Gifts and Prizes Gifts and Prizes (non-cash) may be awarded to individuals for participation in games of chance or contests. Games of chance include raffles and door prize events. Raffles and games of chance should be approved in advance by the office of the EVPA&F. The amount of a prize should be limited to $100 in value. The department or unit sponsoring prizes must maintain detailed records of all receipts and expenditures associated with the event, including the names of winners and the value of the prize awarded. These gifts typically do not have tax consequences due to their nominal value and infrequent nature. Scope: This policy applies to all Georgia Tech staff, faculty, researchers, and students. This policy does not preclude individuals from giving personal gifts to colleagues, students, and other individuals purchased with personal funds (i.e., no GT, GTRC, GTRI, GTF, or other Institute funding source is used). While this policy applies to GIT, any benefits provided to a GIT employee by an affiliated organization is subject to this policy and the same tax evaluation as if the benefit were provided by GIT. This policy does not apply to incentive gifts for survey participation or research participation, or to awards in student competitions paid as stipends to the recipients. Definitions de minimis In general, a de minimis benefit is one for which considering its value and frequency with which it is provided, is so small as to make accounting for it unreasonable or impractical. De minimis benefits are excluded under the Internal Revenue Code section 132(a) (4) and include items which are not specifically excluded 139 / 217Employment under other sections of the Code.

Relocation Expenses (Intrastate) Type of Policy: Administrative Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Name: Zachary Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) 45-7-22 through 45-7-24 authorize the reimbursement of relocation expenses to State employees and State of Georgia, Office of Planning and Budget. Policy Memorandum, No. 2 Revision 6 sets forth the rules, regulations and policies for the reimbursement program. The regulations limit reimbursement of expenses incurred which are related to moves made within the State of Georgia at the request of a state agency. The move must be in the best interest of the State of Georgia. The regulations as revised, went into effect December 1, 1989. They are summarized below: Policy Statement: 143 / 217Employment Eligibility In order to be eligible for relocation expense reimbursement, the state employee must satisfy the following criteria: 1.He or she must have been employed by the department ordering the transfer for at least six months prior to the date of transfer and must generally remain at his or her new duty station for at least one year following the effective date of move. 2.The transfer must be the result of an action by a state department requiring the relocation and must be in the department's best interest. 3.The relocation must be within the State of Georgia. 4.The distance between old and new duty stations must exceed 50 miles and, the transfer must result in the employee having to drive at least 35 miles farther from his or her old residence to his or her new duty station than was driven from the old residence to the old duty station. 5.The department must have sufficient operating expense funds within its budget to pay the reimbursement cost. 6.No other member of the employee's family may be reimbursed for the same move. 7.The move must be made within one calendar year of the employee's transfer. 8.The costs to be reimbursed are reasonable and proper as determined by Accounts Payable. The employee shall have no right to any review or further appeal from the determination made by Accounts Payable. Approval of Relocation Reimbursement The employee being transferred must complete and submit to his or her school or laboratory director an Employee Application for Intrastate Relocation Expense Reimbursement. Cost estimates from three different firms must be submitted along with the application form. (The employee selects a firm which will provide a quality move within a reasonable time frame for a reasonable cost. The lowest bid does not have to be selected, but written justification must be given.) The application must be reviewed and approved by the employee's supervisor. The employee's department head must sign the application, certifying that the transfer is in the best interest of the Institute. The department's fiscal officer must sign the application, certifying that sufficient funds are available within the department's budget to cover the relocation expenses estimated. Expenses Authorized for Reimbursement \"Reasonable and proper\" costs \"incurred for transportation of household goods\" or \"incident to change of residence\" are reimbursable, as follows: 1.Looking for a New Residence - If the move to the new residence is greater than 100 miles, the statutory mileage rate for up to three trips to the new location, plus food and lodging for up to a total of three days and nights may be reimbursable (sum of all three trips cannot exceed three days and nights). Travel regulations are applicable with the exception that double occupancy rate for one room may be paid. If the move to a new residence is less than 100 miles, only mileage for up to three days spent at the location looking for a new residence may be reimbursed. No reimbursement of food or lodging expenses will be paid since a visit to the new location should not require any overnight trips. 2.Transporting Household Goods - The cost of moving household furnishings, equipment and appliances, furniture, clothing, books and similar property may be reimbursable. Actual costs associated with moving up to 11,000 lbs. of the afore-noted types of household goods by (i) commercial moving van, (ii) employee-owned or 144 / 217Employment rented vehicle, and (iii) within an employee-owned mobile home will be reimbursed. The regulations include a breakdown of limitations on reimbursable amounts relating to insurance costs, fuel and labor. (The parameters of what constitutes reasonable includable and excludable expenses are listed in the regulations for each method of moving employed.) 3.Transporting Family to a New Location - Actual food and lodging expenses may be paid up to two days and nights for one room at the multiple occupancy rate, applying the maximum daily amounts established in the statewide travel regulations. Meals for children under 12 are reimbursable up to one half the adult maximum. 4.Utility Reconnection - Reimbursement is limited to the costs associated with establishing utility accounts and initiating basic service. Employee Liability The transferred employee must sign an agreement that he or she will remain at the new location for at least one year from date of move except for reasons beyond the control of the employee and acceptable to the department, or be liable to the state for the amount of expenses reimbursed. Payment of Reimbursement Payment will be made on the basis of the Employee Intrastate Relocation Expense Vouchers which have been approved by the Manager of Accounts Payable, Georgia Institute of Technology. All relevant receipts, invoices and bills of lading must be presented with the relocation expense voucher. Payments may be made either following each trip or in one lump sum upon the completion of the move at the discretion of the Institute. Internal Revenue Service Reporting Reimbursements that are not deductible are reported to the IRS as \"wages, tips and other compensation\". However, there is no withholding made on these amounts. (See Regs. Sections 2.10 for details.) Inter-departmental Transfers Employee transfers between state departments are not reimbursable under the subject regulations, and if made within one year from a reimbursed relocation, will result in employee liability for paying back any amounts received under these regulations. Contact Person It should be noted that specific questions relating to allowability of expenses or particular procedures in processing relocation applications, should be directed to the Manager of Accounts Payable at (404) 894-0348. Prior to filling out any relocation expense application, specific limitations set forth in Policy Memorandum No. 2, Revision 6 should be reviewed. Copies are available from Accounts Payable.

A student employee is considered a temporary employee and is not eligible for benefits. It is allowable to hire enrolled students within the University System of Georgia; however, contact the Office of Human Resources for more information. Procedures: There are three categories in which a student can be classified; Graduate, Undergraduate, and Co-op described below: 1.Graduate: Graduate Students can be classified as Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs), Graduate Student Assistants (GSAs) and Graduate Assistants. GRAs, GTAs and GSAs are typically hired by the graduate schools to perform assistantships that are related with the student's degree. Graduate Assistants can be hired to perform tasks within a department such as clerical support, web development, etc. Please refer to the policy on Hour Loads for Graduate Students . In addition, contact the Graduate Studies Office and the Office of Academic Affairs for more information regarding appointment of and approvals for hiring GRAs, GTAs, and GSAs. 2.Undergraduate: Undergraduate students are considered Student Assistants. They can perform many jobs within an office such as clerical support, web development, etc. Undergraduate students may qualify for Federal Work Study. 3.Co-op: Co-op students are those students who are currently in a Co-op work semester. For more information regarding the Co-op program, contact the Undergraduate or Graduate Co-op offices. Funding Funding for student positions is allocated within each department each fiscal year. Departments pay 100% of the student's salary unless the student has been approved for a Federal Work-Study Award. Federal Work-Study The Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP) is a federally funded financial aid program offered to students that have a demonstrated financial need. If a student qualifies for the Federal Work-Study Program, a department can hire the student as a FWS Student Assistant. The FWSP will pay a portion of the student's salary up to the allocated award and the department pays the remainder. For more information regarding the FWS Program, refer to policy on Federal Work-Study Program . International Students 146 / 217Employment International students that have an F-1 or J-1 student visa are eligible to work anywhere on campus as a student employee. The following conditions must be met: F-1 and J-1 students must maintain a full course load of study in the Fall or Spring unless authorized by OIE to be less than full-time. F-1s must have a Georgia Tech I-20; J-1s must have a Georgia Tech DS-2019. The international student can work no more than 20 hours per week during the Fall and Spring semesters, but can work more than 20 hours per week during the Summer semester and breaks between the semesters provided that s/he intends to enroll in the next term. However, students who are transferring to a new school may work on-campus until the date that their I-20 is released to the new school. Allowable Work Hours Generally, during an enrolled semester or summer, students should work no more than 20 hours per week or 50% time. There are exceptions to this rule, especially during break or summer periods (if not enrolled for the summer). Students cannot be appointed greater than a total of 100% time. International students holding an F-1 or J-1 visa cannot work more than 20 hours per week, or 50% time. Please refer to the ISSP office for questions regarding changes in F-1 or J-1 status and how it may affect employment. International students holding an F-1 or J-1 visa cannot work more than 20 hours per week, or 50% time during the Fall and Spring semesters. F-1 and J-1 students can work more than 20 hours in the summer or during semester breaks. Please refer to the Office of International Education for questions regarding changes in F-1 or J-1 status and how it may affect employment. For graduate students, refer to policy 11.5 on Hour Loads for Graduate Students. Breaks/Vacation (including summer) Students can work full time as Student Assistants or Graduate Assistants during break and summer session (if not enrolled), provided that s/he was enrolled in the previous term of the break period and will be enrolled in the following term of the break period. Hour Loads for Graduate Students Policy No: 11.5 Type of Policy: Administrative Effective Date: Oct 2005 Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Contact Title: Director-Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Policy Statement: The following general policies are provided to serve as guidelines for determining the hourly workloads of students who are pursuing graduate degrees: 1.Full-time graduate students are expected to give primary attention to the pursuit of their degrees. 2.Graduate students are expected to take semester workloads which will contribute to substantial progress toward a degree. 147 / 217Employment 3.Graduate students shall register for a number of hours of research which is consistent with a realistic appraisal of the amount of work to be done on a project, thesis, or dissertation, and the amount of faculty involvement and use of Institute facilities required. 4.Realistic accounting for graduate student credit hours helps support a quality graduate program. Procedures: Transcript Recognition of Teaching and Research Activity Students holding graduate teaching or graduate research assistantships may register for courses in recognition of teaching (8997) and research (8998) activities if these courses are available for their school. The 8997 and 8998 courses are audit-base courses. A student may not register for more than a total of 9 hours of 8997 and 8998 during any semester. Course Load Requirements The following regulations shall govern the semester registration requirements for students who are pursuing graduate degrees: 1.Full-time students must be enrolled for at least 12 credit hours on a letter grade or pass-fail basis. As an exception, the advisor and school chair may allow up to 3 hours out of the 12 minimum to be taken on an audit basis in Fall and Spring semesters; in Summer semesters the advisor and school chair may allow up to 6 hours out of the 12 minimum to be taken on an audit basis. Hours in excess of the required 12 may be taken on any basis. Full-time students working exclusively on thesis research should be registered for 18 or more hours of 7000 or 9000 (Master's or Doctoral Thesis) in Fall and Spring semesters, and for up to 16 hours during Summer semesters. 2.The following students must register on a full-time basis as defined above: 1.graduate research and teaching assistants 2.students supported by fellowships, traineeships, or individual grants 3.students with out-of-state tuition waivers 4.students assigned to the Institute by the Armed Forces for the purpose of pursuing a degree 5.students on student visas 6.graduate co-op students on non-work semesters. 3.Students involved in thesis research must register for an appropriate number of 7000 or 9000 hours. 4.The minimum load for part-time students is 3 credit hours. 5.A student may register for only one hour of Master's or Doctoral Thesis (7000 or 9000) during the semester of graduation. This exception may be used once for each degree. 6.The maximum allowable semester load for employed students other than graduate assistants is reduced as a function of the number of hours employed per week as follows: Workload per week Maximum semester hour load Full time (40 hours) 6 3/4 of full time (30 hours) 9 2/3 of full time (27 hours) 10 1/2 of full time (20 hours) 12 1/3 of full time (13 hours) 15 1/4 of full time (10 hours) 18 (16 for Summer semesters) The minimum load for these students is three hours, except as described in Course Load Requirement #5 above, but such students should be encouraged to take the maximum load they can handle in order to progress toward completion of the degree. 148 / 217Employment Course Selection Full-time students are expected to enroll for a letter grade in regular courses and thesis hours whenever possible. Registration loads should reflect, as much as possible, the student and faculty efforts involved in the program of study. Registration loads each semester should be comprised of various hours from the areas listed below: n Regular courses: letter-grade, pass-fail and in special cases, audit; n 7000 or 9000 courses for thesis students; n Special problem or research project courses; n Specific courses for teaching or research education; n GTA/GRA courses 8997/8998 (up to a maximum of 9) if available in the student's major school and the student has an assistantship. Guidelines for Registration of Doctoral Dissertation Hours 1.Beginning full-time doctoral students, especially those who are research assistants, are encouraged to register for at least 3 hours of 9000. This would allow, and encourage, such students to maintain a lighter academic load to begin laying the groundwork for Ph.D. research. 2.Advanced full-time doctoral students who are working primarily on their dissertation research should register for 18 or more hours of 9000 in Fall and Spring semesters, and for up to 16 hours of 9000 for Summer semesters. If they are taking other coursework, the number of 9000 hours would be reduced by the number of formal coursework hours. Students who are required by their school to register for 8997 or 8998 would further reduce the number of 9000 hours, so that the total number of hours is at least 18 (no more than 16 in the Summer). The advisor and/or school determines whether the total is above 18 for Fall and Spring semesters. 3.Part-time doctoral students engaged in their research phase for the Ph.D. should register for 9000 consistent with their and their faculty member's activity on the dissertation research. 4.All full-time students coded as Master's students but involved in preparation for the Ph.D. are encouraged to register for 9000 consistent with the amount of work involved. Academic units are encouraged to remove any in-school restrictions on registering for 9000. For example, some schools will not allow a graduate student to register for 9000 until after the student has become a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. The reasoning behind this restriction is not clear unless one takes a very restrictive interpretation of what registering for 9000 means. Academic units are encouraged to adopt a broader interpretation, so that dissertation hours reflect all stages of the doctoral dissertation--literature research, topic selection, experimental/theoretical preparation, research performance, writing, and presentation. All of these stages require Institute facilities and faculty involvement. Responsibilities: The responsibility for advising graduate students properly, not only in regard to programs of study, but also in regard to minimum and maximum semester course loads, rests solely within the chain from advisor/graduate coordinator to school chair to college dean. Although each graduate student is responsible for knowing the requirements for his or her degree and for insuring the appropriate, steady progress is being made toward that degree, each graduate student must have access to fair and equitable advisement. Responsibility for scheduling the proper requirements for a particular program of study and an appropriate course load per semester rests with the student and advisor alike. 149 / 217Employment Tech Temp Tech Temp Employment Procedures Policy No: 8.64 Type of Policy: Academic Effective Date: Mar 2009 Last Revised: Feb 2014 Review Date: Feb 2019 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Charvette Webb Contact Title: Talent Acquisition Manager Contact Email: charvette.webb@ohr.gatech.edu Policy Statement: The Tech Temp Office will prepare PSFs for all Tech Temp employees.

Temporary employees shall be employed for a period no longer than six calendar months; however, such temporary employment may be extended up to an additional six months if the appropriate employing supervisor needs the services of that individual, subject to the approval of the Associate Vice President for Human Resources or his/her designated representative. Once an individual has served as a \"temporary\" employee for a twelve month period, he/she shall not thereafter be employed as a \"temporary\" employee until a period of thirty (30) calendar days has elapsed. Temporary employees are not eligible to participate in any of the benefits programs offered by the Institute. All assignments are temporary and the Office of Human Resources (OHR) cannot guarantee continuous work assignments. OHR will make every effort to send current Tech Temps on assignments when they become available. 151 / 217Employment Tech Temp recruitment through the Office of Human Resources is facilitated by use of the Georgia Tech online application system. However, departments may hire applicants (who can present a resume proving their qualification for a position) via personal referral. Hiring managers also have the option to hire a temporary employee through a currently approved and contracted temporary employment vendor (vendor temporary workers are not considered to be Georgia Tech employees and are not paid through Georgia Tech payroll). Information regarding currently approved vendors can be obtained by contacting the Georgia Tech HR/Tech Temp office. Procedures: Requirements for Eligibility Before the start of any assignment, Tech Temp applicants who are hired as campus employees (whether through referral or OHR recruitment) must provide the Office of Human Resources with the following; an authorized Pre- Employment Screening Request Form, an updated resume documenting their qualification for the open position, proper identification proving their eligibility to work in the United States, and a Tech Temp Job Order Request (signed and dated by the hiring department). The cost of pre-employment screening is the responsibility of the hiring department. See OHR online Policy No. 5.6 for a list of safety sensitive positions. Benefits Eligibility Tech Temp employees are not eligible to participate in any of the benefits programs offered by the Institute except for the mandatory Georgia Defined Contribution Plan and the optional 403(b) retirement plan. Criminal Background Investigations Georgia Tech requires a criminal background investigation for all Tech Temps. Board of Regents policy prohibits employment of applicants with certain convictions. Applicants with a history of these convictions will be refused employment with Georgia Tech. Before the start of any assignment, a Tech Temp must present a departmentally authorized Pre-Employment Screening Request Form. A hiring manager must receive confirmation of a passed background check from the HR/Tech Temp office before any Tech Temp begins work. Pre-employment and Substance Abuse Screening Georgia Tech requires alcohol and drug screening tests for individuals working in selected safety-sensitive positions. The notification requiring pre-employment alcohol and drug tests is included in all advertised (regular and temporary) safety-sensitive positions included in the program. Applicants testing positive for alcohol and/or drug abuse will not be considered for employment at Georgia Tech for a period of two years. Candidates are not allowed to start working until the Tech Temp Office calls a department by phone or e-mail to officially give the hiring status. Timeliness regarding notification of test results can vary depending on applicant's date of specimen submittal, results of test, and administration of Medical Review Officer Rules regarding confidentiality. Complete information regarding this policy can be located at Pre-Employment and Substance Abuse Screening . Dress Tech Temps should dress in a professional manner appropriate to their work assignment and/or department. Complete guidelines regarding dress for classified staff can be found, online, in the Business Casual Dress Policy for Summer and Fridays . Punctuality 152 / 217Employment It is the responsibility of each temporary employee to be on time for all assignments. If a situation occurs where the Tech Temp is unable to be on time, or must cancel the assignment, the Tech Temp must call the immediate supervisor. If problems such as absenteeism or tardiness persist, the Tech Temp will be terminated. Evaluation and Performance Expectations Tech Temps sent out on assignments will be evaluated by the department. The evaluation will be returned to the Office of Human Resources and become part of the employment records. Unsatisfactory evaluations will result in the Temp being denied future referrals as a Tech Temp. Departments may terminate the assignment at any time based on performance, change in needs, or budget considerations. It is the Temp's responsibility to clear all departments at the end of each assignment (turn in keys, Georgia Tech I.D., etc.). Parking For information concerning parking permits please see the Office of Parking and Transportation for further information. Pay Period Pay periods end every other Wednesday, and checks are issued the following week on Friday. Overtime Tech Temps on assignment do not normally work overtime (more than 40 hours in one workweek) unless written approval is first received from the current supervisor. Transfers Tech Temps on long term assignments will not be transferred to another assignment unless they have been on the current assignment at least one month; made a request in writing to be reassigned; and, received a favorable evaluation from their current assignment. Regular Employment Hiring for regular positions is coordinated by the Office of Human Resources. Temporary employees may apply for internal campus-wide (and departmental postings within their department) positions listed on the OHR online application Job Bulletin. Distinction Between Tech Temp and Temporary Researcher Applicants who are being considered for positions conducting scientific research (and generally requiring an advanced degree) on a temporary basis should be classified in an appropriate research faculty position. These research faculty positions require additional credential verification (transcripts, reference letters, BOR approval, etc.) beyond what is required to become a Tech Temp. Any Tech Temp job order request that is submitted with primary duties of conducting scientific research will be evaluated by the HR/Research Faculty office for proper classification.

Policy Terms: Reorganization The restructuring of an organizational unit, which may result in one or more of the following: addition or elimination of responsibilities that impact the structure and scope of the unit, change(s) in reporting relationships within the unit that impact occupied positions, and significant increase or decrease in the number of positions. Procedures: The policy is intended to explain the process to follow should it become necessary to reorganize an organizational unit, which may result in one or more of the following: addition or elimination of responsibilities that impact the structure and scope of the unit, change(s) in reporting relationships within the unit that impact occupied positions, and significant increase or decrease in number of positions. The requesting unit must prepare a reorganization plan detailing the reasons for action and the positions to be affected. The information should be prepared in the form of a memorandum directed to the AVP-OHR. The recommended format for the memorandum is: 1.Describe actions the unit has taken to this point, if any, to respond to budget reductions (i.e. services, programs or events eliminated, unfilled positions in unit, reductions in travel, etc.) 2.Describe the current business operations and the role of the affected positions within the operation of the unit. Attach a current organization chart with employee titles. 3.Describe the new/different business operations and the impact on positions within the unit. If positions are being reclassified or new positions are being created, include the proposed new job titles; if jobs are being eliminated or an employee's percentage of time is being changed, elaborate on the rationale for doing so. Factors to consider include, but are not limited to: employee tenure with the Institute or department, job performance, and job competencies. Attach a proposed organization chart reflecting the new organization along with relevant job classification questionnaires. 4.Summarize the changes including the number of jobs eliminated, the number of jobs to be changed or created, and any salary savings or adjustments. Include the dates the actions are to be implemented. 5.Include an approval signature block for the AVP-OHR. Within the Office of Human Resources, the plan will be reviewed by HR Consultancy, Employee Relations, and Compensation (referred to collectively as the \"OHR Group\").

Except when authorized by the department-head/manager, all visitors including relatives of employees, who do not have official business with the department may be restricted from prolonged visits to the workplace. Time spent attending to a personal visitor, especially a child, detracts from work production of not only the employee, but also co- workers. In no case should the work site become a substitute for a day care center. Work areas, laboratories, closed stacks, trade shops, machine rooms, and other Institute work areas should be off limits to anyone but employees authorized access to minimize physical risk to the individual as well as risk to the Institute. However, if visitors must visit risk associated areas, they should be accompanied by an authorized employee.

Anyone with a follow-up assignment will update the team members involved via email, telephone, or in person. Personally identifiable information should be kept to a minimum on email (i.e., use initials or refer to \"the person we discussed\"). After the plan is implemented, the facilitator will be responsible for coordinating follow-up to insure that the threat has been appropriately managed. Team members must recognize and respect that there are members of the campus community and visitors who will have legal and ethical limitations on information that may be shared when discussing a concern. It is the responsibility of each team member to exercise his or her best professional judgment in determining what information may be shared with the team. 5.1 Training and Resources Supervisory Training Employees who have supervisory responsibilities should receive training in the identification of and how to deal with workplace violence. This training may include, but will not be limited to, conflict resolution, counseling and stress management.

Each employee is expected to report to work promptly at the beginning of the day and after lunch. If an employee finds it necessary to be absent from work, such absence should be immediately reported to the supervisor. A record of tardiness and inexcusable absence may interfere with promotion and may result in loss of pay or disciplinary action. See Sick Leave Policy--Procedure No. 2.13 and Vacation Policy--Procedure No. 2.15. Policy Statement: In regard to attendance and lateness, employees are expected to: 1.Maintain good personal health standards which will allow them to perform their work in a competent manner on a regular basis. 2.Avoid letting minor ailments keep them from performing their jobs. At the same time, good judgment should be used with respect to contagious ailments which might have an adverse effect on other employees. 3.Attend to personal affairs during nonworking hours. Minor Rule Violations The following are considered as minor rule violations: 1.Excessive tardiness or absenteeism. 2.Failure to notify the supervisor within the first two hours after start of shift on the first day of absence. Procedures: The department supervisor is responsible for maintaining the lowest practical level of absence. The most effective way for the supervisor to do this is to talk with the employee returning from an absence. This will place emphasis on attendance and set the climate in the unit. At the same time the supervisor can ascertain if there is a reason behind the absenteeism. Although it is the employee's responsibility to correct problems and prevent absenteeism, the supervisor can counsel the employee on the importance of maintaining good attendance. In order to accomplish this the supervisor should: Receive the call concerning absence personally (if possible). 189 / 217Employment 1.Speak directly to the employee rather than a relative or friend. 2.If the employee appears to be suffering only minor ailments, encourage the employee to come to work. 3.Inquire whether the employee has taken steps to improve the condition causing the absence. 4.Determine when the employee expects to return to work. By following the pattern outlined above, the supervisor should be able to detect poor attendance habits and take corrective action. There is no substitute for working closely with an employee and determining the validity of each absence as it occurs. The supervisor might also bear in mind the following: 1.Frequency of absence. Frequent short-term absences often indicate the formation of poor attendance habits. 2.Patterns of absence. A pattern of Monday or Friday absences, or absences on the day before or after a holiday or long weekend, will indicate an unsatisfactory attendance pattern. 3.Causes of absence. Absences of a questionable nature or those absences which could have been avoided by proper advance planning should be monitored closely. 4.Lateness record. Lateness should be considered with absenteeism in determining unsatisfactory attendance patterns. 5.Length of service. An employee with long service and an attendance record which in previous years has been good would be given a little more latitude in any particular year when there is a noticeable change in attendance. Supervisory Counseling-- Chronic Absenteeism or Lateness Early steps toward correcting chronic absenteeism should take the form of private, individual counseling between supervisor and employee. This counseling session should cover the following: 1.A review with the employee of his personal attendance record. 2.A statement of why the record is unsatisfactory, and that it must be corrected. 3.A discussion of the reasons for absence and for not calling in, if applicable. Here the supervisor should listen closely to the employee's stated reasons and try to assess their validity. 4.An inquiry to the employee as to whether he thinks his personal attendance record is satisfactory. Let him be his own judge. 5.An inquiry to see if the Office of Human Resources may assist the employee with problems causing absence. This may include solving transportation difficulties, a medical assessment by a doctor, or referral to the Faculty/Staff Assistance Program (see Procedure No. 6.3). While the supervisor should not become deeply involved in personal problems of employees, he/she may be able to suggest ways to solve absence-causing problems. 6.Emphasizing to the employee that he/she is expected to: be at work, on time, all the time. notify the supervisor of absences. let the supervisor know in advance of impending absences, whenever possible. come in late rather than not report at all. call in every other day, if absent for an extended period (if requested). bring in a doctor's release to work, if absent over 5 days or sooner if requested by the supervisor, especially in cases of chronic absenteeism. 7.Finally, the supervisor should emphasize (if the absences are considered excessive) that the employee is jeopardizing his/her own future with Georgia Tech, his merit increases, his vacation earnings, and his potential for promotion. The threat of discipline should be avoided at this point, as it may undermine the positive impact of the face-to-face meeting. At this stage the supervisor should try to be helpful. If discipline actually becomes necessary, the employee can be told that he is in danger of losing his job (see Corrective Action and Disciplinary Procedures, No. 5.13). 190 / 217Employment Campus Closed - Inclement Weather and Other Emergencies Policy No: 2.10 Type of Policy: Academic Last Revised: Jan 2017 Review Date: Jan 2020 Policy Owner: Human Resources Contact Name: Zachary Rogers Contact Title: Director Payroll Contact Email: zachary.rogers@ohr.gatech.edu Reason for Policy: The purpose of this policy is to provide consistent guidance regarding emergency and/or inclement weather closing. As with all policies, not every situation can be anticipated or covered. Any situation that is not specifically addressed in this policy will be handled on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the President or Institutional Leader. Policy Statement: Emergency conditions like the weather, declared state of emergency, safety, or other situations may require the Institute to declare the campus closed. When the Institute is declared closed, all academic classes, administrative offices or other functional areas are suspended and only essential services are maintained. In accordance with Board of Regents Policy (Section 8.2.7.7), in the event of inclement weather or any emergency which requires the absence of employees, the President or Institutional Leader of a unit in the System may declare leave with or without pay. Employees whose job responsibilities require that they work during hazardous or emergency weather conditions in order to maintain critical institutional functions, e.g. public safety or facility employees, information technology or employees with critical health and safety responsibilities, may be designated as 'essential personnel' by their organization. Essential personnel will be expected to maintain a normal work schedule unless specifically excused. Essential Personnel who are required to report to work during inclement weather or other emergency closings may receive Campus Closed Pay for their regularly scheduled hours. Designated Essential Personnel refusing to report to work may be subject to the Institute's Progressive Discipline Policy 5.13. Scope: Entities Affected By This Policy All U.S. based campuses of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Who Should Read This Policy All U.S. based campuses of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Notification : Faculty and staff can find out about campus closures and Tech's weather response in several ways: An alert will be sent via the Georgia Tech Emergency Notification System (GTENS). Updates will be shared on the Georgia Tech homepage, www.gatech.edu . A pre-recorded message will be placed on the main campus information line, 404-894-2000, noting the status of the campus. 191 / 217Employment Information will be shared via social media. Updates will be posted to Twitter at @gtpdalerts and @georgiatech , and and www.facebook.com/georgiatech . Policy Terms: CCD: The payroll code entered on a timecard to represent Campus Closed time for employees not working during the closure. CCE: The payroll code entered on a timecard to represent Campus Closed time worked by essential personnel during the closure . Non-Exempt Employees : bi-weekly paid (hourly time reporters). Exempt Employees : Monthly paid employees who do not report hours worked, no special procedures or time reports are necessary as a result of closure. Essential Services or Personnel : Departments should create and maintain a list of services and employees who are considered essential to running critical functions within their operations in the event of a declared emergency. This list is to be updated on at least an annual basis, employees should be notified that they are on the list. The list of essential personnel should be housed in the Georgia Tech Police Department Office of Emergency Preparedness. If a supervisor decides an employee must remain on campus between work shifts (e.g., sleeping or resting in designated areas), the employee will be compensated for the total hours spent on campus during the closure. Non-exempt employees who are designated as essential and required to work during scheduled campus closings may be paid at the straight-time rate and Campus Closed Essential (CCE) for all hours actually worked during the inclement weather or other emergency closing. Students : Certain designated student workers' services are relied upon during campus closure periods. Students working during campus closure times will receive pay at the special events rate. GTRI Employees : GTRI employees should refer to directions from the GTRI News Source. GT Satellite Campuses : Campuses that are geographically located outside the greater Atlanta Metro Area. Please refer to communications and directions from these sites. Procedures: The decision to close the Institute will generally be made on a workday by workday basis. Once there is a decision to close the Institute, only those employees previously designated by the Institute as \"essential personnel\" to oversee the critical functions during an institutional emergency are required to report to work if notified. All other employees are to either stay home/away or to leave their work area as soon as practicable after the notice is made. Non-essential employees who report to work during unscheduled closings, without authorization, pose an unnecessary liability risk to the institution. If the President or Institutional Leader designates the emergency and/or inclement weather closing as paid, then the following guidelines may apply to \"essential\" bi-weekly employees required to work during the closing. The decision to close a campus will generally be made on a workday by workday basis. Campus closure decisions are made on a workday by effective period basis. The use of Campus Closed time worked ( CCE) will only be applicable through the end of the period a campus is closed. 192 / 217Employment Nonessential Non-exempt employees: Will use campus closed time (code CCD) to list time that would have been worked had the campus been open for business. The CCD code is used on timesheets when campus is closed and time is paid. Unscheduled leave (Campus Closed Time) is not counted as hours worked in the calculation of overtime pay. Non -exempt employees will be compensated in compliance with FLSA regulations and the Georgia Tech workweek and overtime policy for all hours actually worked over 40 in a work week. Campus closed time is pro-rated for part time employees. Essential Non-exempt employees: Each department should have a list of employees designated as \"essential\" during a campus closed event. These employees should contact their supervisor for work instruction during an event. Essential employees may record regular shift hours not worked during the campus closure as CCD (Campus Closed) . If required to work, they will report their regular hours worked as well as CCE (Campus Closed Essential) for the same number of hours worked during the campus closed period. When an employee, who has not been previously designated as an essential employee, is asked to report to work or to the office during a campus closure, that employee will be paid as an essential employee for all hours worked. In accordance with FLSA, travel time from the home location to the primary work site is not compensable. Georgia Tech is a continuous operation and personnel work various hours throughout the 24-hour day. Employees' shifts may not align with the start or end of a campus closure. Examples are provided below that provide guidance on reporting hours during the closure period. Note: Some situations may be unique. Members of our payroll team are available to assist with more specific questions. Faculty, staff, and student employees may direct questions to pay.ask@ohr.gatech.edu . For those employees that are not designated by the Institute as essential personnel; the amount of time to be paid during a campus closure is not to exceed the employee's regular shift hours in a day (regular and unscheduled closing time combined). Campus Closing Leave is equivalent to the employee's normal shift. Employees working compressed workweek schedules during periods of unscheduled closings will not be required to take additional leave. If an employee does not report to work on the day the institution is declared closed for a partial day/delayed opening, the employee should record campus closed time (CCD) for the hours the campus is closed during the employee's normal work schedule. The employee may be permitted to make up work time lost within the same pay period or charge the absence period to accrued leave (vacation or sick) for the hours the campus is open during the employee's normal work schedule. A non-exempt employee who is on an approved accrued leave (vacation or sick) on a day the campus is declared closed may charge time as campus closed time (CCD timecode for non-exempts). An exempt employee that had previously requested an accrued leave (vacation or sick) on a day the campus is declared closed may change the request in Timeout so as not to lose the accrued leave. If an employee is absent from duty because of severe weather conditions or other emergencies, during which the institution does not close, may be permitted to make up work time lost within the same pay period or charge the absence period to accrued leave (vacation or sick). If the employee does not have enough vacation or sick time accrued, the employee will not be paid for the balance of that time and may be placed on leave without pay for the period of absence. Compensatory time, in lieu of campus closed time, cannot be used for non-exempt (bi-weekly) employees. When an employee, who has not been previously designated as an essential employee, is asked to report to work or to the office during a campus closure, that employee will be paid as an essential employee for all hours worked. 193 / 217Employment Since campus closures are made on a workday by workday basis, the use of campus closed time will only be applicable through the end of the day a campus is closed. As a reminder, the official work day at the Institute is defined as 12:00am-11:59pm. For those instances when an essential employee's shift carries over from one workday into another, the employee will only receive campus closed time for hours worked while the campus was declared closed until the end of the workday. Pay Treatment for Bi-weekly Employees Situation Employee Group How to Code Time Campus is closed all day Department Designated - Essential Employees who report to work for the full day.Record actual hours worked (8) hours as REG - Regular and (8) hours as CCE (Campus Closed Essential) Does time of decision of closing matter?

Policy Statement: This policy addresses a donation program whereby accrued sick leave may be donated to a sick leave pool for sharing with benefits-eligible employees in certain circumstances. Scope: All faculty and staff who are eligible to accrue and use paid sick leave and who have been continuously employed as a benefits eligible employee for at least 12 months by Georgia Institute of Technology. The department of the recipient receiving donated leave is responsible for funding as the expense has been allocated in the employees' salary. If you have any questions, please contact your assigned budget analyst. Policy Terms: Family Member As defined by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA): Spouse The employee's legal husband or wife as defined or recognized under State Law for purposes of marriage in the State where the employee resides. Parent A biological parent of the employee. An individual who stands or stood \"in loco parentis\" to an employee by providing primary day-to-day care and financial support when the employee was a child. Coverage does not include parents-in-law. Child The employee's biological son or daughter under the age of 18. A legally adopted son or daughter under the age of 18. A foster child, stepchild or ward under the age of 18, legally 195 / 217Employment placed with the employee. Any such child over the age of 18 if the child is incapable of self-care due to a mental or physical disability. Incapable of self-care Requiring active assistance or supervision to provide daily self-care in three or more basic or instrumental \"activities of daily living,\" such as grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing, eating, cooking, taking public transportation, etc. Physical or mental disability One that substantially limits one or more major life functions as defined under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). Serious medical condition A serious medical condition is a health condition involving a serious illness, injury, impairment, or condition that is likely to require the employee's absence from work for an extended period of time longer than the amount of sick and vacation leave available to the employee, and the health condition is such that it is not medically appropriate for the employee to delay the absence in order to accrue additional sick or vacation leave prior to the absence. Some examples of such conditions include: advanced or rapidly growing cancers, acute serious illnesses, chronic life threatening conditions involving failure of bodily organs or systems (e.g., heart attack) or chronic conditions requiring extended rehabilitation such as back surgery. The absence may be continuous, as in hospitalization following surgery or an accident, or intermittent, as in period absences for chemotherapy or other procedures. Procedures: This program shall be a donation program whereby accrued sick leave may be donated to a sick leave pool for sharing with benefits-eligible employees in certain circumstances. Donation Program Becoming a member of the Donated Sick Leave Pool 1.A minimum donation of eight (8) sick leave hours (Pro-rated for part time employees) is required to become a leave pool member. A member must have a minimum of forty (40) sick leave hours (pro- rated for part-time employees) remaining after their donation at the time of enrollment. 2.The donation of sick leave is strictly voluntary and is irrevocable. 3.An employee may donate sick leave to a pool for use by eligible recipients. Any unused sick leave so donated will revert to the donor pool and will not be 196 / 217Employment Donation Program returned to the donating employee. 4.The donation of sick leave is on an hour-by-hour basis, without regard to the dollar value of the donated or used leave. 5.The minimum number of sick leave hours that a benefits-eligible employee may donate is 8 hours. All donations will be in increments of whole hours. 6.The maximum number of sick leave hours a benefits-eligible employee may donate in one calendar year is 80 hours. 7.No employee may donate sick leave if, after that donation, his or her balance of sick leave is less than 40 hours. 8.Employees will be given the opportunity to donate sick leave annually during benefits open enrollment. The donated sick leave will be transferred from the donor to the leave pool on December 31st. 9.Should the Donated Sick Leave pool reserve drop to less than 120 hours, the pool will be considered depleted. In this situation only, all donors will be notified of the depleted pool status and automatically charged eight (8) hours per donor, unless the donor wishes to withdraw from the program. Leave requests will be honored in the order in which they were placed when the pool is replenished. The automatic charge to replenish the pool may occur only once per calendar year. At that time an institution may initiate a special open enrollment period to accept additional program participants. Should the pool be depleted a second time in a given calendar year, no further requests for Donated Sick Leave will be accepted. Recipient Eligibility Members may utilize donated leave when they have exhausted all available accrued vacation and sick leave. The employee or immediate family member must: 1.Provide certification from a licensed physician of a serious medical condition; or 2.Be in quarantine due to exposure to contagious disease. Conditions or Circumstances That Do Not Qualify for Receipt of Donated LeaveEmployees may not receive donated leave in the following circumstances: 1.Any occupationally-related accident or illness which is compensable under Workers' Compensation benefits; 2.Disability incurred in the course of the commission of a crime does not qualify. 3.An employee may not utilize donated leave: 197 / 217Employment Donation Program During the period of any disciplinary suspension; While receiving disability insurance/Social Security Income (SSI) benefits; or After the termination of employment. An employee employed less than one year is ineligible to receive donated leave. Application Process to Utilize Donated Leave An eligible employee may request donated leave by submitting a written request through the Donated Sick Leave Form and the physician's certification form to the Donated Leave Certification Committee. 1.The minimum number of hours that a benefits- eligible employee may request is 40 hours. 2.If the employee does not use the entire 40 hours within twelve months, the remainder will revert back to the leave pool. 3.In the event of a chronic illness or injury requiring episodic treatment (dialysis, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and physical therapy), the recipient may use donated leave in non-consecutive increments. 4.No individual employee may receive donated leave in excess of 320 hours (eight weeks) during the course of one consecutive 12 month period. 5.Donated leave will be granted in blocks of up to 160 hours. Employee may receive additional time up to the 12 month maximum by providing additional documentation. Donated Leave Certification Committee Committee Appointment and Membership A committee shall be appointed by the AVP of Human Resources or his/her designee to review requests for donated leave and to make the final determination of granting the requested leave. This committee shall consist of a representative from the Office of Human Resources, a member of the Faculty Benefits Committee, and a classified staff member. Review Process The Donated Leave Certification Committee will review the request for donated leave within 5 business days of receiving the request. The Committee's decision to approve or deny a request will be by simple majority vote and may be the result of communication by email or phone or other means in lieu of meeting.

Policy Statement: Georgia Tech complies with the provisions of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. FMLA allows employees to 199 / 217Employment balance their work and family life by the use of paid and unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. FMLA is a complex policy. Readers should refer to the related documents/resources cited in this policy as well as consult Human Resources for additional information. Scope: All faculty and staff within the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Policy Terms: Eligibility To be eligible for federal FMLA leave, an employee must have at least 12 months of total service and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months immediately preceding the beginning of the requested leave. (\"Hours worked\" does not include time spent on paid leave- sick, vacation, personal, administrative, or unpaid leave). Health Care Provider Department of Labor regulations for the FMLA define a health care provider as a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, podiatrist, dentist, chiropractor (limited to treatment consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist), clinical psychologist, optometrist, nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife, or clinical social worker who is authorized to practice by the State and performing within the scope of their practice as defined by State law, or a Christian Scientist practitioner listed with the First Church of Christ Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts.

Permanent long-term conditions (i.e. Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, terminal states of a disease) Multiple treatments of non-chronic conditions (i.e. cancer and kidney disease) Injury or Illness in the line of duty In the case of a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard and Reserves, this means an injury or illness incurred in the line of duty while on active duty, or which existed prior to active duty but was aggravated by service in line of duty while on active duty, that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's office, grade, rank, or rating. In the case of a veteran of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, this means an injury or illness incurred in the line of duty while on active duty, or which existed prior to active duty but was aggravated by service in line of duty while on active duty, and that manifested itself either before or after the covered service member became a veteran. Procedures: Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) FMLA Request Procedures The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job protected leave each year. The employee must be employed for at least one year and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months. Employees may request FMLA for the following reasons: Birth of a child Adoption of a child Serious health condition of the employee, the employee's child, spouse, or parent Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient hospital care, hospice, or residential medical care facility Any period of incapacity, sporadic absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by a health care provider, or Continuing treatment by a health care provider for a chronic or long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that if not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity; and for prenatal care Military Caregiver Leave-An eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entitled to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period to care for the service member. This provision became effective immediately upon enactment. Military caregiver leave is available during a single 12-month period during which an eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks of FMLA leave. A single 12-month period begins on the 1st day the employee takes military leave and ends 12 months later. A covered service member is a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard and Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness, OR a veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness and who was a member of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserves, at any time during the five-year period preceding the date on which the veteran undergoes medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy. 201 / 217Employment Active Duty Leave- Eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status in the Armed Forces in a foreign country. Qualifying exigencies may include: short-notice deployment (7 days notice or less and only available for 7 days total), military events and related activities (such as ceremonies and briefings), child care and school activities (for non-routine matters), financial and legal arrangements, counseling, rest and relaxation (up to 5 days), post- deployment activities (including debriefings or funeral services for up to 90 days following the termination of the covered military member's active duty status), and any additional activities agreed upon by the Institute and employee. Benefits and Protections During FMLA leave, the Institute maintains the employee's health coverage under any group health plan on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work, provided the employee continues to pay his/her portion of the premium. Use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an employee leave. If an employee has short term disability insurance, he/she may be eligible to receive these benefits while on leave. An employee generally has a right to return to the same position or an equivalent position in terms of pay, benefits, and working conditions. Certain \"key employees\" may be denied job restoration if they are among the highest-paid 10% of employees and if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous injury to the operations of the employer. Adverse action or discrimination is prohibited against an employee or prospective employee who has taken FMLA leave and interference with any rights provided by FMLA will not be tolerated, including: Refusing to authorize FMLA leave Discouraging an employee from using FMLA leave Changing the essential functions of the employee's job to preclude the taking of FMLA leave Reducing hours of work to avoid employee eligibility The Institute uses a \"rolling\" 12-month period (rather than a fixed calendar, fiscal, or academic year) to determine eligibility for, and availability of, leave time under FMLA. The 12-month period during which twelve weeks of family leave may be taken shall begin on the first day such family leave is taken. Eligibility for FMLA leave at any given time is determined by reviewing the twelve months of employment prior to the date that the employee requests FMLA leave to begin. If the employee has not utilized the equivalent of 12 weeks of FMLA-qualifying leave during the 12 months prior to the designated date, then the employee is eligible to take leave on that date, provided that all other eligibility criteria are met. FMLA leave is unpaid and the Institute requires that employees use their accrued paid sick leave and/or vacation concurrently with FMLA leave before they go into unpaid status. If your FMLA leave is a result of an on-the-job injury however, you have the option of taking unpaid leave even if you have sick leave and/or vacation available. Similarly, an employee on FMLA leave who has short term disability (STD) insurance may go into an unpaid leave status at any point once they begin receiving STD benefits, reserving any remaining sick leave and/or vacation for use after the employee returns from leave. Please note that an employee must use their available accrued sick leave and/or vacation during the STD waiting period. (View Examples) Accrued sick leave may not be used to make adoption arrangements or to \"bond\" with a healthy newborn or newly- adopted or placed child therefore, the employee must use accrued vacation time or take time off without pay if no vacation time is available for such a purpose. This time must be taken within the 12 months immediately following the birth, adoption, or placement. Georgia Tech requires that such \"bonding\" time off be taken as a single continuous period rather than as intermittent. 202 / 217Employment Leave Administration An employee is not required to use his or her leave entitlement in one continuous block except when leave is used for \"bonding\" purposes. The Institute has designated that leave for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement must be for a continuous period and cannot be taken intermittently. Leave can be taken intermittently when medically necessary. The Institute may assign the employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that better accommodates the employee's intermittent leave or reduced work schedule. Assignment of such an alternative position must be coordinated through the Consultancy unit of the Office of Human Resources. If an employee is on intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave and would otherwise be required to work overtime hours, any overtime hours not worked during the leave period count as FMLA leave. Although intermittent and reduced schedule leave are available for qualifying exigencies, qualifying exigency leave counts against the employee's total allotment of FMLA leave. The Institute may also request documentation of the need for qualifying exigency leave. Employees who accept light duty positions in lieu of taking time off from work under FMLA leave cannot have the time spent on light duty counted against their FMLA entitlement. It is presumed that employees on FMLA for their own serious health conditions are not working outside of the Institute while on FMLA leave. Consulting or outside activity agreements may still apply. The protections of the FMLA will not, however, cover situations where the reason for the leave no longer exists, where the employee has not provided required notices or certifications, or the employee has misrepresented the reason for leave. Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave for planned medical treatments so as not to unduly disrupt the Institute's operations. Employees are expected to consult with their supervisors prior to scheduling treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule that best suits the needs of the employee and the Institute. For purposes of determining the amount of leave used by an employee, the fact that a holiday may occur within the week taken as FMLA leave has no effect; the week is counted as a week of FMLA leave. However, if an employee is using FMLA leave in increments of less than one week, the holiday will not count against the employee's FMLA entitlement unless the employee was otherwise scheduled and expected to work during the holiday. Similarly, if the Institute's business operations have ceased and the employees are generally not expected to report for work for one or more weeks (i.e. during winter holiday break), then those days do not count against the employee's FMLA entitlement. If both the employee and the employee's spouse work for the University System of Georgia and are eligible for FMLA, then they are limited to a combined total of: 12 workweeks of FMLA leave during any 12-month period for the birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care; or to care for an employee's parent with a serious health condition; however, each employee may use up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave during any 12-month period if the leave is for the care of the employee's spouse or child with a serious health condition or the employee's own serious health condition 26 workweeks during the single 12-month period if the leave is Military Caregiver Leave or a combination of Military Caregiver Leave and Family Medical Leave, Employee Medical Leave, or Active Duty Leave Advance Notice and Medical Documentation Requirements An employee who foresees the need for leave due to a planned medical treatment or other planned FMLA-qualifying reason (i.e. anticipated birth, adoption, or surgery) for herself/himself or for an applicable family member, must notify his/her supervisor in writing as early as possible so that the absence can be scheduled at a time least disruptive to the 203 / 217Employment Institute's operations. Such notice must be at least 30 calendar days in advance of the start of leave, unless impracticable, in which case the employee must provide written notice as early as circumstances permit. When the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must comply with the Institute's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, which includes call-in procedures established by the employee's department, absent unusual circumstances. When an employee seeks leave due to a qualifying reason for which the Institute has previously provided the employee FMLA-protected leave, the employee must specifically reference the qualifying reason for leave. Calling in \"sick\" without providing more information will not be considered sufficient notice to trigger the Institute's obligations under FMLA. In the case of medical conditions, the Institute may find it necessary to inquire further to determine if the leave is because of a serious health condition and may request medical certification to support the need for such leave. The Institute may also request certification to support the need for leave for a qualifying exigency or for military caregiver leave. Employees must provide the requested certification to the Institute within the time frame requested, unless it is not practicable to do so despite the employee's diligent, good-faith efforts. The Institute may request recertification at some later date if there is reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration. Failure to provide the needed documentation may result in disapproval of the leave or a delay in its commencement. If the validity of the medical certification is in doubt, a second opinion may be required with a health care provider chosen by the department and/or Human Resources at the Institute's expense. If the two opinions conflict, the department may request and pay for a third option. The third opinion will be final and binding. Georgia Tech has the right to designate as FMLA leave any time off that qualifies as such, even if the time is not specifically requested as FMLA leave per se by the eligible employee. Recertification The Institute may request recertification documentation no more often than every 30 days (except as indicated below) and only in connection with an absence by the employee, unless the medical certification indicates that the minimum duration of the condition is more than 30 days, in which case the Institute must wait until that minimum duration expires before requesting recertification. For example, if the medical certification states that an employee will be unable to work, whether continuously or on an intermittent basis, for 40 days, the employer must wait 40 days before requesting recertification. The Institute may request recertification in less than 30 days if: 1.The employee requests an extension of leave. 2.Circumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly (i.e. the duration or frequency of the absence, the nature or severity of the illness, complications). 3.The Institute receives information that casts doubt upon the employee's stated reason for the absence or the continuing validity of the certification. Georgia Tech FMLA Process Subject 1.Employee completes FMLA request paperwork and submits to supervisor or Human Resources mails FMLA paperwork to employee after 3rd full day of consecutive absence. 2.HR Representative issues Eligibility and Rights & Responsibilities Notice and appropriate certification form to employee within 5 business days after FMLA request notification. Employee must return the certification form to OHR within 15 calendar days. 204 / 217Employment 3.Supervisor should confer with HR Representative to ensure (1) that the employee's absence qualifies for FMLA, and (2) that required paperwork is complete. The employee must correct, complete and return all required paperwork within seven calendar days after being notified of any deficiencies in the required documentation. 4.OHR issues Designation Notice to employee within 5 business days after receiving FMLA certification. 5.OHR-Benefits maintains FMLA paperwork in a file (separate from employee's personnel file) which is kept under lock and key. 6.Department tracks FMLA time taken by employee. Employee must report all time taken for the qualifying FMLA event. Return to Work Employees must periodically report to the supervisor regarding their status and intent to return to work if requested to do so by their supervisors. The employee may be required to furnish periodic medical updates to OHR. Employees are expected to return to work by the end of the approved FMLA leave. If the employee does not return, and if failure to return is not due to a continued or new documented qualifying serious health condition, then the employee may be required to reimburse the Institute for the employer portion of the health coverage premiums it paid on the employee's behalf during the leave. If the employee is not able to return to work by the end of the approved FMLA leave, he or she still may be eligible to request additional sick or personal leave under those policies. The granting of such additional leave is at the discretion of the Institute. In no case may all leaves combined exceed 12 months. If an employee does not return and is not granted additional leave, employment ends on the last day of the approved FMLA leave. Employees are required to present a fitness-for-duty certification from their healthcare provider before being reinstated to active duty upon completion of FMLA leave for their own serious health condition. The Institute may require that the certification specifically address the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the employee's job. If reasonable job safety concerns exist, the Institute may require a fitness-for-duty certification before an employee may return to work when the employee takes intermittent leave.

Paid holidays and vacations are generally a matter of agreement between an employer and an employee. Paid holidays shall be awarded in addition to earned vacation time, and shall be observed in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the respective institutions. In order to receive pay for the holidays, an employee must be in active pay status the day before and the day after the holiday. Active pay status is defined as working regularly scheduled hours immediately preceding and following the holiday. Employees receiving excused absences prior to and following the holiday will be eligible to receive the holiday pay provided. Excused absences include approved sick, vacation, bereavement, jury duty, and other FMLA related absences. The Institute observes 12 official paid holidays each calendar year. A schedule of holidays is published each year by the Institute and can be found at http://ohr.gatech.edu/additional-benefits#node-145 . Holidays are not carried into another calendar year. If the holiday time is not taken by the end of the year, it must be forfeited. Scope: Regular employees and faculty working one-half time or more Process: Non-Exempt full- and part-time employees: If a holiday falls on a regularly scheduled workday, the employee will be paid for their standard hours as holiday pay. Should an employee's normal work schedule not include a holiday, that employee's supervisor should schedule an alternate \"holiday\" to ensure the employee receives the \"benefited\" holiday time allowed by the University System of Georgia. When determining eligibility for overtime pay, holiday hours are not counted as hours worked. Exempt part-time employees: If a holiday falls on a regularly scheduled workday, the employee will observe that holiday. Should an employee's normal work schedule not include a holiday, that employee's supervisor should schedule an alternate \"holiday\" to ensure the employee receives the \"benefited\" holiday time allowed by the University System of Georgia. Exempt employees are not paid hourly and their monthly salary will remain the same as though there were no holiday hours. Special conditions Termination : A terminating employee shall not be paid for any official holidays occurring after the last working day of employment. Retirement or inter-institutional transfer : Employees will receive pay for holidays occurring at the end of their final month of employment if they are in a paid status (work time, annual leave, sick leave, or other paid leave) on the last scheduled work day of the month. Compressed Work Week Schedules : Holidays count as eight hours; therefore, if an employee is on a 10-hour a day 206 / 217Employment schedule and one of his or her work days falls on an Institute holiday, the employee must work an additional two hours another day of the work week. Otherwise, regular policies regarding holiday pay should be followed. Remote Units & Police Department : Operating units that are physically remote from the main campus in Atlanta, the Police Department and staff supporting affiliated organizations may be permitted to observe a holiday schedule more consistent with that of the host organization. This schedule is not to exceed the number of holidays per year allowed for the University by the Board of Regents. Partial Year Employees : Partial-year employees are not eligible for holiday pay for those holidays occurring during the designated leave period, nor are they eligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits during this period. Part-time benefited employees : Employees who work part-time and receive benefits are eligible for holiday pay on a pro-rated basis. Non-benefited employees : Regular employees and faculty working less than one-half time are not eligible for holiday pay. Religious Observance We consider each individual's decision to either engage in or refrain from religious worship to be worthy of respect and consideration, therefore, we encourage reasonable accommodations be provided for observance of religious holidays. Employees should inform their supervisor in advance, specifically requesting an adjusted work schedule related to religious purposes. Depending upon business needs, you may be able to work on a day that is normally observed as a holiday and then take time off for another religious day. Also, planned absences for such requests may be taken as paid vacation leave (if applicable); as time off without pay; or be permitted as alternative work hours at a time and manner agreed upon by the employee and the responsible supervisor or manager. The hours worked in lieu of the normal work schedule may be scheduled before or after the religious observance within the workweek, so as not to create any entitlement to premium pay (including overtime pay). An employee's request for time off should not be granted without simultaneously scheduling the hours the employee will work to make up the time, in order to provide a clear record of the employee's adjusted work schedule. If an employee is absent when he or she is scheduled to perform work to make up for a planned absence for a religious observance, the employee must take paid leave, request leave without pay, or be charged absent without leave, if appropriate. These are the same options that apply to any other absence from an employee's basic work schedule. Alternative holidays for essential work : At times, the operating demands of a department make it necessary for all or a portion of the staff to work on a scheduled/official Institute holiday. If a non-exempt employee is designated as essential and is required to work on an official Institute holiday, the employee's supervisor may choose one of the following holiday pay options: 1.Grant the employee another work day off with pay by designating that day as the employee's paid holiday. 2.Pay the employee his or her holiday pay, plus pay the employee at his/her regular rate of pay for the additional time actually worked on the holiday. Under this option, the employee does not receive another day off with pay for having worked an official holiday. Responsibilities: The responsibilities each party has in connection with the Campus Holiday Policy are: Party Responsibility Institution Chief Human Resources Officers Ensure compliance with policy.

Policy Statement: This policy outlines the process for the granting and the use of a Leave of Absence at Georgia Tech. Scope: All regular part-time or full-time classified or faculty employees within the Georgia Institute of Technology. Policy Terms: Personal Leaves of Absence without Pay Due to unforeseen events or special circumstances, an employee may need time off for personal reasons. Such approved leaves shall allow the employee the right to elect to continue their group insurance benefits by making arrangements through the Office of Human Resources Benefits Department and paying the total amount of all premiums due. All other benefits for which the employee is eligible would not accrue during the unpaid leave. Employees requesting a personal leave of absence of more than 30 days must first exhaust accrued vacation before going into an unpaid status. Failure to return to work at the conclusion of the leave period constitutes grounds for termination of employment. Every effort will be made to place an employee in the same position or another of equal status upon return from an approved leave of absence. Temporary personnel may be employed to fill the vacancy during the approved leave period. Educational Leave with and without Pay Please refer to the USG Time Away from Work Educational Leave Policy for additional information. Military Leave Please refer to the USG Time Away from Work Military Leave Policy . A Military Leave Reporting Form should be completed and submitted along with the supporting orders to the Benefits Department in the Office of Human Resources prior to start of the military leave. Employees should also contact the Office of Human Resources Benefits Department prior to the start of an extended military leave to make arrangements with regards to their benefits. Maternity Leave Appropriate sick leave provisions shall apply. See 2.13 Sick Leave Policy and 2.12 Family and Medical Leave Policy for more details. Family Leave See 2.12 Family and Medical Leave Policy for more details. Miscellaneous Leave 208 / 217Employment Bereavement Employees may take up to five accrued sick days due to the death of an employee's immediate family member (employee's spouse, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, children, brothers, sisters, and members of the employee's household). Employees must notify his/her supervisor immediately if he/she needs to take time off due to the death of an immediate family member. If an employee does not have adequate sick days to cover the absence, then he/she must use vacation time. Court Duty Any employee summoned for court duty as a juror or witness must notify his/her immediate supervisor as soon as official orders are received and provide a copy of the orders. Employees called for jury duty or witness duty will be paid at the normal rate of pay for any regularly scheduled time lost from the job. If the court duty is completed prior to the end of the employee's normal work schedule, the employee must report to work for the remainder of his/her shift. Voting Employees are encouraged to exercise their constitutional right to vote in all federal, state, and location elections. If election polls are not open at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after an employee's normally scheduled work shift, sufficient leave time must be granted to permit the employee to vote. In this instance, an employee should be granted a two-hour block of time in which to vote, if needed. Selective Service and Military Physical Examinations Any employee required by Federal law to take a physical examination for Selective Service must notify his/her immediate supervisor as soon as orders are received and provide a copy of such orders. The employee shall be paid for any time lost to take such an examination. Leave for Blood Donations An employee is allowed a leave of absence, without loss of pay, of not more than 8 hours in each calendar year for the purpose of donating blood with his/her supervisor's approval. This absence shall be computed as 2 hours per donation, up to 4 times per year. Any employee who donates blood platelets or granulocytes through the plasmapheresis process shall be allowed a leave of absence, without loss of pay, of not more than 16 hours in each calendar year. This leave shall be computed as four hours per donation, up to four times per year. Tracking and monitoring of Blood Donation leave shall be done by the department. Leave for Organ and Marrow Donation Each employee who serves as an organ donor for the purpose of transplantation shall receive a leave of absence, with pay, of 30 days. Each employee who serves as a bone marrow donor for the purpose of transplantation shall receive a leave of absence, with pay, of 7 days. Leave taken under this provision shall not be charged against or deducted from an employee's accrued vacation or sick leave. Such leave shall be included as service in computing any retirement or pension benefits. This provision shall apply only to an employee who actually donated an organ or marrow and who presents his/her supervisor with a statement from a licensed medical practitioner or hospital administrator that the employee is making an organ or marrow donation. Leave for the purpose of organ or marrow donation may qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act (see 2.12 Family and Medical Leave Policy for more details). Tracking and monitoring of Organ and Marrow Donation leave shall be done by the department. Procedures: Requesting Leave Personal or educational leaves must be approved by the supervisor and department/unit head via the Leave of Absence request form. Leave of Absence Request Form If the request is for a Classified employee, the form must be submitted to the AVP of Human Resources for approval. If the request is for an Academic Faculty member, the form must be submitted to the Office of the Provost for approval. 209 / 217Employment If the request is for a Research Faculty member, the form must be submitted to the Office of the Executive Vice President- Research for approval. Requests for military leave and supporting orders must be submitted to the Benefits Department in the Office of Human Resources via the Military Leave Reporting Form. After receiving approval for any of the above requests, the originating department would then submit an ePersonal Services Form (ePSF) when the person begins his/her leave. Reporting Leaves of Absence Time granted for leaves of absence without pay will not be reported on time sheets/documents, etc. Court duty and military leave with pay will be reported. Exempt Employees with Insufficient Accrued Leave When an exempt employee is absent from work for less than one scheduled workday and his/her accumulated leave is insufficient to cover the partial day of absence, the employer will deduct the cost for such leave in hourly increments from an exempt employee's salary.

The Institute recognizes that employees may experience catastrophic life events. Policy Statement: For all regular full-time exempt employees, sick leave shall be accumulated at the rate of one working day per calendar month of service. Regular part-time employees working one-half time or more will accumulate sick leave in an equivalent ratio to their percentage of time employed. Non exempt employees will accrue vacation based on a percentage of the time worked during the pay period. Scope: Entities Affected By This Policy All faculty and staff within the Georgia Institute of Technology Who Should Read This Policy All faculty and staff within the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Procedures: Classified Employees Regular full-time exempt classified employees accrue twelve sick leave days per year at the rate of one working day per month. Regular full-time non-exempt classified employees accrue twelve sick days per year based upon the number of compensable hours recorded each pay period. In all cases, a day of sick leave for purposes of pay and time off will be computed on the basis of an employee's regular workday. For nonexempt employees, all sick leave will be earned by the compensable hour and will be credited to each employee's record at the end of each pay period. Accruals for a pay period will not be posted to an employee's record until the pay period has ended, which will prohibit charging sick leave against accruals earned in the same period in which the leave is taken. Accrual will be based on factors which were computed by dividing the number of sick leave hours accrued per year by the number of working hours in the year (2080). Non-exempt employees will accrue sick leave at the rate of .046154 per compensable hour. (12x8 = 96 / 2080 =.046154) For regular full-time exempt employees, all sick leave is accrued on a monthly basis at a rate of one day per month. During the first month of employment, the employee must be on the payroll on or before the 15th of the month and work (or be in a paid status) through the end of the month in order to accrue sick leave. No time will accrue for a month in which employment begins on or after the 16th day. Regular part-time employees working one-half time or more will accrue sick leave in an equivalent ratio to their percentage of time worked. For nonexempt employees, all sick leave will be earned by the compensable hour and will be credited to each employee's record at the end of each pay period. Accruals for a pay period will not be posted to an employee's record until the pay period has ended, which will prohibit charging sick leave against accruals earned in the same period in which the leave is taken. Accrual will be based on factors which were computed by dividing the number of sick leave hours accrued per year by the number of working hours in the year (2080). Non-exempt employees will accrue sick 211 / 217Employment leave at the rate of .046154 per compensable hour. (12x8 = 96 / 2080 =.046154) For regular full-time exempt employees, all sick leave is accrued on a monthly basis at a rate of one day per month. During the first month of employment, the employee must be on the payroll on or before the 15th of the month and work (or be in a paid status) through the end of the month in order to accrue sick leave. No time will accrue for a month in which employment begins on or after the 16th day. Regular part-time employees working one-half time or more will accrue sick leave in an equivalent ratio to their percentage of time worked. Faculty Employees General faculty employees accrue sick leave at the rate of one day (8 hours) per month. Nine-month faculty members accrue nine days of sick leave each academic year and an additional three days if they teach in the summer session, which will be prorated based on the number of months worked. This accrual is based on continuous employment at one-half (.50 EFT) time or more and earned in a ratio equivalent to the percentage of time worked. For example, a regular faculty member working one-half time earns four hours of sick leave per month. Faculty members working less than one-half time and temporary faculty members do not accrue sick leave. Faculty Sick Leave Reporting The following provisions for the reporting of sick leave shall apply to all faculty who serve primarily in assignments defined by faculty roles in instruction, research and scholarly activity, and service. 1.Faculty is responsible for informing their unit head of any illness that prohibits them from meeting their assigned responsibilities in instruction, research, and service. 2.In reporting sick leave, academic year faculty will report leave based on the number of whole hours sick (see BOR Policy Manual regarding Leave Policy), with a full day being eight (8) hours, a half day being four (4) hours, and less than a half day based on whole hours missed, with a full week being the equivalent of a forty (40) hour workweek. 3.Nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to indicate or require that faculty work on a standardized schedule. 4.Each month, faculty members must also report if they did not take any sick leave. All Employees There is no limit as to the total amount of sick leave which may be accrued. Sick leave may be granted at the discretion of the Institute and upon approval of the employee's immediate supervisor for any of the following reasons: 1.Illness or injury of the employee 2.Medical or dental treatment or consultation 3.Quarantine due to a contagious illness in the employee's household 4.Illness, injury, or death (See Bereavement leave under 2.11 Leave of Absence) in the employee's immediate family requiring the employee's presence. Immediate family is defined as the employee's spouse, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, children, brothers, sisters, and members of the employee's household. 5.Inability to report to work due to pregnancy or other disability Accrued sick leave may not be used to make adoption arrangements or to \"bond\" with a healthy newborn or newly- adopted or placed child. However, either parent may use accrued vacation time or take time off without pay if no vacation time is available for such a purpose. Please refer to Policy 2.12 Family and Medical Leave for more 212 / 217Employment information. Sick leave in excess of five consecutive work days requested or taken for health reasons requires a physician's statement clarifying the need for the employee's absence from work and in order for future sick leave with pay to be taken. The statement should include: date of onset of illness, the date upon which the employee will be able to return to work, what percentage of time he/she will be able to work, and whether or not any restrictions are imposed on the employee's daily work activities. Employees should complete the GT Vacation and Sick Leave Request Form or follow his/her department's procedure for requesting sick leave. Whether or not an employee used sick leave must be reported on time sheets, time documents, or other forms provided by the department no later than the pay period following the pay period in which the sick leave was taken. Departments may establish other deadline dates for reporting sick leave. Even if no sick leave was taken, that information must be reported. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. It is the responsibility of the department to certify sick time reported and to ensure that sick leave balance(s) are accurate. When sick leave has been reported incorrectly in a prior pay period, the department's administrator must send an email to payroll's customer service desk: pay.ask@ohr.gatech.edu. The adjustments must be made to time reported and current balance(s) on the Georgia Tech Vacation & Sick Adjustment Form; a scanned copy of the form should be included with the email. Sick leave documentation must be maintained by the department for a period of five years after the last date of the leave. If an employee overdraws his/her sick leave, any accrued vacation leave will be used to pay the employee. If there is insufficient vacation, the overdrawn amount will be deducted from the employee's next check. Employees must immediately notify their supervisor if they are leaving sick from work. Please see 2.1 Absenteeism and Lateness Policy for more details. A terminating employee will not accrue sick leave or be entitled to receive paid sick leave after the last working day of employment. Workers' Compensation If sick leave is the result of an on-the-job injury, you have the option of using unpaid leave even if you have paid leave available. Under the Workers' Compensation Act, an employee injured on the job and unable to work may elect in writing not to use accrued leave. Under these conditions, the employee may be granted sick leave without pay in keeping with the provisions of the leave without pay policy (see 2.11 Leave of Absence Policy for more details). The employee is required to submit medical verification from their physician to verify inability to perform their normal job duties. Failure to return to work at the conclusion of the leave period constitutes grounds for termination of employment. Sick Leave without Pay Any regular employee who is unable to work due to his/her own injury or illness after exhausting all accrued sick leave and vacation leave may be granted sick leave without pay for a period not to exceed one year. The total amount of leave taken, including both paid and unpaid time, shall not exceed one year. Employees should complete the GT 213 / 217Employment Vacation and Sick Leave Request Form or follow his/her department's procedure for requesting unpaid sick leave. The employee's department must approve a sick leave without pay and submit the required information through an Electronic Personal Services form (ePSF). Approvals based on factors such as performance, length of service, and business needs of the department. Such approved leaves shall allow the employee the right to continue his/her group insurance benefits by making arrangements through the Office of Human Resources Benefits Department to pay his/her portion of premiums due and the Institute will continue its share of the cost for such period. All other benefits for which the employee is eligible would not accrue. Failure to return to work at the conclusion of the approved leave period constitutes grounds for termination of employment. Note: Employees should contact the Office of Human Resources Benefits Department to see if they may be eligible for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Please see 2.12 Family and Medical Leave policy for additional information.

Policy Statement: This policy addresses vacation as well as vacation transfer between Institutions. Scope: Who Should Read This Policy All faculty and staff within the Georgia Institute of Technology should be aware of this policy. Procedures: During the first month of employment, an employee must begin working on or before the 15th and must work (or be in a paid status) through the end of the month in order to accrue any vacation for the month.

Classified Non-exempt Employees Full-time regular non-exempt employees who are not members of the general faculty shall accrue vacation according to his/her length of service and they begin accruing vacation from the first day worked. Accruals for a pay period will not be posted to an employee's record until the pay period has ended, which will prohibit charging vacation against accruals earned in the same period in which the leave is taken. Accruals will be based on factors which were computed by dividing the number of vacation hours accrued per year by the number of working hours in the fiscal year (2080). Ex.15 days = 120/2080 = .057692 Years of Service Accrual Rate (per compensable hour) Vacation Days (per year) Working at 100% time Less than 5 years .057692 15 5 but less than 10 years .069231 18 10 or more years .080769 21 Classified Exempt Employees Full-time regular exempt employees who are not members of the general faculty shall accrue vacation as follows, according to his/her length of service. 215 / 217Employment Years of Service Accrual Rate (hours per month) Vacation Days (per year) Working at 100% time Less than 5 years 10 15 5 but less than 10 years 12 18 10 or more years 14 21 Research Faculty, Academic Faculty, General Faculty, and Post Doctoral Fellows Full-time, regular fiscal year employees who are members of the research and general faculty, as well as post-doctoral fellows, shall earn 21 working days vacation per year, accrued at the rate of 14 hours per month.
