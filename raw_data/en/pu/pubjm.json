Posted by Sinead Duffy on sandalwood essential oil, frankincense essential oil, lavender oil, vetiver oil... what are the best essential oils to help you to meditate? fragrance has been used to enhance meditation practice, relieve stress and anxiety and promote relaxation since meditation began (at least since records began) in yoga texts it is referred to as gandha. gandha is sanskrit for fragrance and the use of fragrance for meditation and spiritual practice.

I prefer a blend. i worked with combining different essential oils - all those mentioned above (I wasn't prepared to lose out on the magic of any one of them) as well as other essential oils - to create [yogandha ground](http://trk.klclick.com/ls/click?upn=x2Mfj9wvSlPPnlg8oSaNXCQECwHZqG8eP96nnAzPSUI2Px7FWMBK43tTT0Wbs34UzdLXQiW8qBXGlX-2F-2FUy4Ph9oZkMKY4v7IV96ieRCMSo6O1ZCbjlhYEvmCgf9mBwIGvt11FPUZdY8N6ncAHA9Vqk8oHSrThb48Bt8miHe152xDV3VfSDpSHBfhH3EDxdQCdNCF-2BoFsP170i99k9FPiGxO2EKe-2B8mCd3S6oP2YiLfDD6lzdVVpeY6InbOsd5DAHtMyH96W8oAF6X6G3RSoE2wUGREo2HOlaFEez-2BgiO4DUnh-2BEvBoIHDM3btUlMJ0Invq8GH43FMFAHWe1jfvlw2hc5cXL2wI-2BszHq04vAC0KBFbvOM3v2NHnHzG94ryhxWfsGm_Wjandn0VeM6cS84FGlomNVfrbfbn7w8Jp1LNGEkWHM6xh2bIjgMI-2FfQhxblgXAS6xHcTST6ehor442xJYEVBxMC4kwdbBdYAecRz4fj9B1E26ZZny9Vx3d33H68hdPWyGgktb6LEe87vJvRkKhROBEmPmVz2bu-2BD1mexXrnYuIFtrmYJWWr8qN30WDYFuXYcxR-2B4T9QGlyhP7-2Bq2G7uTSO1lDJlw-2BtCQcKDBxT1-2FP3IFcJfJMW1u4zK6DdiICbvz-2BgudbAOR6TwHkAEu52D0yh3IiYYpOOn8MOC-2FZ3aqueuhcEMWPE8VBYm-2Bmr5OxDrv2svwGPVsTAehvMZEglJ4yzXCxm97DBiK1SrUcfU3gXIw4Xg3jfuYSakx2hStdwziIcgaPKs1L8alfI9mY-2BRa-2BA-3D-3D). the other essential oils it contains are lavender - that beautifully soothing spirit that is lavender, myrrh - so transformational and transcendent and finally black pepper - traditionally used by monks to stay awake during meditation! I created ground to be the perfect essential oil blend for meditation and yoga because it provides a spiritual and pranic symphony that engages mind, body and spirit.
