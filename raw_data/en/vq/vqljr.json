The review was specifically targeted at health competencies within the social insurance system; for this reason, other forms of care covered by Federal and L\u00e4nder governments, were only examined where directly applicable. The review can be broken into four interconnected components, each led by a separate organisation. Further details on each of the se components and their aligning report are provided in the table below.

Contrast Ernst&Young Management Consulting GmbH 26 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options This report represents Volume 1 - International Comparisons and Policy Options . The report drew upon information collected in volumes 2 to 4, as well as further analysis of reports completed by Austrian organisations and experts, and international experiences . Using this information, a range of policy options desig ned to improve efficiency within the Austrian social insurance system were developed. Overview Our analysis of the Austrian social health insurance system revealed that the system is both complex, as a result of its multi -level gover nance structure, and fragmented, given the dual nature of financing. Specifically, outpatient care is financed by social health insurance, whereas inpatient care falls under the joint responsibility of federal and L\u00e4nder governments , with SHI paying a fixed share of contributions . Such an arrangement fosters various inefficiencies including cost -shifting, and discourages continuity of care, which leads to higher overall costs. This finding is not new, and has been highlighted by various research institutions, as well as policy -makers, as a key barrier to improving healthcare system efficiency. As a result, in recent years, many efforts have been made to improve coordination and align incentives. Ultimately, the problem of dual financing can only be overcome with majo r constitutional reform to create joint budgets . However, we recognise the extreme legal difficulty implementation of joint budgets presents given a two -thirds majority within Parliament is required. In response, the policy options within this report prese nt pragmatic approaches to enhance coordination and improve efficiency within the current system. Another key issue that has been raised, is that concerning the number of social health insurance carriers. Multiple purchasers of healthcare is not uncommon, for this reason, the total number of carriers, in our opinion, is not viewed as the most important barrier to achieving efficiency. Rather, it is how Austria differs in terms of the types of services procured by purchasers, and secondly, by the al location of funds to purchasers which represent key challenges. In regard to the former challenge, Austria is unique in that healthcare purchasers operate in silos (i.e. insurance carriers versus L \u00e4nder), that is, purchasing care for a portion, as opposed to all h ealthcare services. Concerning the latter challenge, only a small proportion of health insurance carrier funds are risk -adjusted, which results in inequities. This is also the case with other resource allocation mechanisms in Austria (i.e. federal governme nt to the L \u00e4nder or from social health insurance to the L \u00e4nder), which are mostly based on political negotiations and historical allocation patterns . 27 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Limited risk -adjustment has meant that, despite mostly uniform contribution rates, differences in benef its for specific services may occur. Such an arrangement is inequitable and goes against international trends. However, it is worth highlighting that self -reported unmet medical need in Austria is one of the lowest in Europe . Ensuring high -quality care ha s also been a key agenda for policy -makers in recent years. Despite this, the types of quality indicators measured, in addition to the uses of information collected in Austria, could be enhanced. More robust information on quality within the system will ul timately improve patient outcomes via the development of evidence -based policies. Finally, it is evident that Austrian policy -makers have recognised primary care and public health as a key area for enhancement, for example, with the development of the diabetes disease management program. Nevertheless, discussions with stakeholders, in addition to findings within the policy and academic literature, reveal that relative to other advanced European countries, Austria's primary care and public health sectors c ould be significantly improved. This is evidenced by, for example, low rates of vaccinations and lower than average life -expectancy projections, as well as high inpatient admissions rates . Such findings reiterate the need for further investment in primary care and public health, while being cognisant that, in the short -term, cost -savings are unlikely, given the presence of fixed hospitals costs . Summary of policy options Based on the findings outlined above, a range of policy options to improve efficiency within Austria's social health insurance system have been proposed. Policy options have not been ranked given, ultimately, it is the responsibility of Austrian policy makers and stakeholders to make decisions regarding the direction of the healthcare syst em. In reviewing these policies, we offer policy -makers and stakeholders the fo llowing recommendations: first, to view policy options outlined in this report, as well those by various Austrian research institutions and organisations (including stakeholder submissions - Volume 3 of this review); sec ond, to ensure future discussions and implementation of policy options be done in a transparent and inclusive manner so that key stakeholders do not view change a s a 'zero -sum game'; and third , to keep in mind th at no healthcare system is perfect, and that any future efforts should build upon current successes, which in the case of Austria, include high -levels of population satisfaction as a result of ease of access to healthcare services, and low levels of unmet need. 28 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options It is important to highlight that the remit of this review was limited, given it was restricted to the social insurance system. However, as previously outlined, given the complex nature of the healthcare system, where directly applicable, considerat ion was given to healthcare under the jurisdiction of federal and L\u00e4nder governments. Policy options: Structure of the social insurance system Four alternative models have been proposed to improve efficiency and equity within the system. Models 1 -3 involve structural change to the social insurance system through an amalgamation of carriers. Amalgamation, in the short -run, can lead to cost increases given expenses associated with structural change and implementation. However, in the medium - to long -term, if implem ented correctly, these models c ould lead to efficiency gains, for example, through economies of scale and scope, and enhanced knowledge transfers. It is important to note that sub -options for models 1 -3 have also been developed, however, they have not been included in this summary. Model 4 would increase efficiency and equity by extending risk -adjustment and enhancing coordination within the current structural model. Model 1 (partial amalgamation): one national accident insurance carrier, one national pension insurance carrier, one employed health insurance carrier (GKKs, BVA, VAEB, BKKs and KFAs) and one insurance carrier (i.e. SVA and SVB) . Model 2 (limited amalgamation): one national pension insurance carrier, one self -employed health insurance carrier, one employed health insurance carrier (excluding civil servants, i.e. BVA, VAEB and KFAs), one accident insurance carrier (excluding civil servants), and one joint accident and health insur ance carrier for civil servants. Model 3 (health and accident amalgamation): one national pension insurance carrier, one health and accident insurance carrier div ided by each of the nine states. Model 4 (insurance coordination): model 4 aims to improve the current social insurance syst em by enhancing risk -adjustment between health insurance carriers, as well as improving coordination between carriers through Joint Specialists Centres. Joint Specialist Centre 'themes' would be defined by a joint Working Group (including HVSV, and both th e Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, and the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection), however, it will be the responsibility of carriers who takes on each theme. Although not compulsory, carriers will be incentivised to actively pa rticipate in the scheme to minimise duplication. 29 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: Risk -adjustment Given model 4, as outlined above, is introduced, the following five risk -adjustment options have been proposed to improve equity and efficiency within the system. RA1 and RA2 are considered the most comprehensive and thus mutually exclusive, RA3 -5, however , could be implemented in unison. RA1: All funds received by social health insurance carriers to be risk -adjusted through a central agency (i.e. HVSV) . Alternatively, a step -wise approach could also be considered, whereby the proportion of funds risk -adjusted are increased over time until it is felt there is an equitable distribution of funds . RA2: This option would involve a simultaneous reduction to contribution rates and the implementation of an earmarked levy dedicated to risk -adjustment across socia l health insurance carriers. RA3: RA3 would amalgamate existing risk -equalisation schemes into one pool of funds to be used for risk -adjustment purposes. Using the most recent data, risk -equalisation schemes amount to \u20ac3 billion annually (including the He bes\u00e4tze, or \u20ac1.4 billion, excluding the Hebes\u00e4tze). RA4: Under this option, social health insurance carriers would subsume responsibility for hospital outpatient departments using an appropriate level of funds from State Health Funds. A central agency (i .e. HVSV) would be responsible for redistributing funds to carriers based on a range of risk - adjustment factors. Funds could be used, for example, to enhance primary care and hospital outpatient departments. RA5: Finally, RA5 would pool a proportion of co ntributions into a central fund (managed by the HVSV), which would then be used to reimburse GPs on a capitated risk -adjusted basis. Given the significant cultural change associated with this policy (i.e. by registering with one GP), this policy is should only be considered in the long -term. Policy options: Collection of contributions The following policy options relating to the collection of contributions are provided below: Collection of contributions Base SVB contributions on actual income : a shift in taxation base towards actual income promotes an alignment between BSVG and ASVG funds in regards to the collection mechanism of contributions, and improves equity in the financing system. 30 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Introduction of a proportional fiscal system with maximum contrib utions in the SVB : a shift from the regressive to a more proportional fiscal system in conjunction with the introduction of a maximum contribution amount could promote a more equitable collection of contributions, which can be rendered fiscally neutral. Aligning the BVA contribution base with that of regional carriers : lower BVA's employee contributions, whilst raising employer contributions to harmonise the collection of contributions across funds, which could be rendered fiscally neutral. Gradually lower user charges for BVA insured to the regional fund level (GKK) to foster equity in the collection of contributions across funds. Multiple insured persons in Austria Single collection of contri butions without a choice of carrier : introduce a single locatio n for the collection of contributions, in addition to keeping maximum contribution bases in place. This can either be in the form of an independent entity or by nominating regional funds to collect contributions on behalf of all funds, in order to simplify the administration process. As such, the refund for excess contributions could be automatically calculated through an official channel, without the need for manual applications. An absolute hierarchy, or a hierarchy based on the main income source of an i ndividual could be introduced to determine the carrier membership of an individual. Further studies on the financial impact on carriers need to be conducted prior to application of this option. Single collection of con tributions with a choice of carrier : similar to the option presented above, with the main difference that insured persons could choose their carrier of preference, based on their professions. While this option does not entirely eliminate inequity in the system, it may reduce the former , as insured could only switch carriers on an, for example, yearly basis, rather than intermittently charging different carriers. Multiple collections of contri butions without a choice of carrier : insured individuals c ontinue to pay to multiple carriers , howev er, the insured would be automati cally assigned to a default carrier. This constitutes the carrier for which the insured pays the largest share of contributions and the insured is only entitled to benefits of the default carrier . All carriers receiving con tributions for the insured would re -direct these contribution s to the respective default carrier . In addition, the refund process for excess contributions could be automated, in order to reduce the administrative burden of manual applications and to elimin ate inconveniences to the insured. 31 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Multiple collections of con tributions with a choice of carrier : similar rationale to the option presented above, with the main difference that individuals have the option to choose a default fund to access services from, while the second carrier will conduct transfers of funds to the former. However, this would only lead to partial improvements in equity. Retr ospective payments between carriers : one of the carriers conducts retrospective payments to the second insurance ca rrier, which was predominantly used by the insured person to access services. This system constitutes a modification of the current mechanism in that it adds a compensatory mechanism to ensure the financial stability of funds. However, it must be noted tha t this option may be more difficult to implement and does not render the system more equitable. Policy options: Defining and harmonising benefits The following the policy options to define benefits within the healthcare system are proposed. Outpatient drugs : disclosure of outpatient drug assessments would render the current process more transparent. Inpatient drugs: enhance and strengthen coordination and procurement policies across regions and introduction of a transparent decision -making process for inpatient pharmaceuticals. Establishment of an independent, arm's length HTA body : transition into an independent, arm's length HTA body that undertakes HTA for different types of tech nology and provides advice to relevant decision -makers in order to increase transparency. Promote a full HTA for a subset of technologies , particularly those that have important resource implications (high cost/high volume) . Formal evaluations should be i ntroduced across costly technologies and a threshold for this purpose should be established. Establish clear parameters regarding the conduct of HTA , such as type of evidence requirements and the types of evidence that can be admitted into assessment and appraisal. Provide guidance on methods of assessment and criteria (beyond costs and effects); the role of stakeholder involvement; the appeals process and associated timelines; timelines for assessment and re -assessment for rapid reviews, full HTAs and mu ltiple HTAs; and, the monitoring and implementation of decisions. Provide information on the structure and composition of the relevant committee (technology Appraisal Committee - TAC), which needs to reflect the stakeholder complexity in the context of 32 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options each technology type and the national -regional -local trade -offs that exist in different circumstances. The following policy options to harmonise benefits within the healthcare system are proposed. Estimated cost of harmonising a specific set of benefits : initial costs of a harmonisation for specific goods and services (i.e. medical aids and therapeutic devices; dentures; health care services including psychotherapy, physiotherapy and logopedics) were estimated by increasing the per capita expenditure levels of those funds that are (1) below the average per capita expenditures across all funds and (2) below 70% of the highest per capita expenditure across all funds. Total additional costs per year of harmonising specific benefits across all funds : o (1) \u20ac171.07 5.130 (Risk -adjustment (age and gender) for medical aids and therapeutic devices: \u20ac176.988.291). Percentage change in expenditure of SHI for these benefits: 19.4% (20.1). o (2) \u20ac390.177.440 (Risk -adjustment (age and medical aids and therapeuti c devices: \u20ac394.090.543). 42.8% (43.6). While this study provides initial cost calculations, the harmonisation of benefits is a political decision to be taken by the government and stakeholders. Even though a harmonisation of benefits is central to ensur ing equity, it is noteworthy that Austria has one of the lowest levels of unmet need in Europe. Data collection : a unified collection of high -quality data that is comparable across funds is of central importance to supporting the harmonisation of benefits. Further efforts are required to ensure uniform data storage and structure. Financing options in the case of a political decision to harmonise benefits: o (1) Partial funding could ensue through a risk -adjustment scheme, or enhanced risk - adjustment scheme o (2) Alternatively, or in addition, government funds could be directed to insurance carriers that offer a slightly less comprehensive benefits package compared to other funds. o (3) Further funds could be directed to the project by improving efficien cy in the system. For instance, a reduction in hospitalisations could lead to s ignificant savings. However, significant investments in outpatient and primary care are required in the first instance to maintain high -quality care, whilst simultaneously reduc ing hospital admissions, meaning that savings to be used for a harmonisation could be generated in the mid - to long -term. 33 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options o (4) In addition, better coordination and consolidation could also lead to efficiency gains, which could be directed in the form of sa vings to increase coverage of benefits in Austria. Policy options: User charges The following policy options to enhance efficiency and equity via user charges have been proposed. Please note, none of the policy options recommend an increase in user charges, rather a change in their composition to maximise efficiency within the system . Pharmaceutical cap: under this option, the universal 2% net income pharmaceutical c ap would be replaced by a three -tiered cap, with insurees being allocated to caps ac cording to their total income. Those in the lowest income band would be subject to a lower cap (i.e. 1.5%), middle income earners would see no change in their cap (i.e. remain at 2%), while high -income earners would see their cap increase to 2.5%. Dependin g on the success of the cap, consideration co uld be given to expanding the cap to all inpatient and outpatient healthcare services. Value -based user charges : once a robust HTA system is in place, it is advise d that rates of user charges be linked to HTA findings, with insurees paying less (or nothing) the more effective a product/service is. Ideally user charges would take into account individual circumstances, however, this is associated with high -levels of administrative burden. Therefore, it is recomm ended that value -based user charges be linked to the effectiveness of products/medical devices/services (i.e. inverse relationship between effectiveness and co -insurance/payment rate). In the interim, policy - makers could encourage 'softer' value -based user charges, following the lead of the SVA and VAEB. Convergence of user charges to the lowest level: finally, it is recommended that current trends continue by encouraging convergence of user charges across health insurance carriers to improve equity within the system. Policy options: Investment in healthcare services Three policy options to enhance investments in healthcare services are proposed. These relate to accounting practice s, reserves, and whether carriers should make or buy healthcare services. Accounting : to improve clarity, it is recommended that carriers only term liquid assets as 'reserves', that is, monies which can be used for investment purposes. Enhance use of reserves: to improve access to healthcare services for all, it is advised that the use of reserves be enhanced, for example by: a) pooling all or a part of a carrier's contributions into 34 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options one fund for investment purposes (e.g. to enhance primary healthcare), b) encou rage joint investment across carriers (without pooling reserves), or c) encouraging carriers to open up their facilities t o all individuals, not just their insured population. Make or buy : before investing in healthcare services, carriers should be encour aged to undertake a comprehensive analysis before investing , to determine whether it is most appropriate to make or buy (or concurrently source). However, to improve capacity within each health insurance carrier, it is encouraged that carriers invest, at l east partly, in their own healthcare services. Policy options: Broadening the social welfare base Austria is a strong economic performer, with a relatively high level of employment and GDP per capita. Economic growth is expected to grow over the next fe w years, however, consideration should be given to current and future challenges facing the economy including an ageing population, and a rise in self - employment, digitalisation and automation. Based on these challenges, the following policy options have b een developed to ensure sustainability of the social insurance system. Education and skills : Align education with future skills required within the workforce, and encourage lifelong learning. Retirement policies : encourage further efforts to increase the actual retirement age (i.e. encourage people to st ay in the workforce for longer). Workforce participation : continue efforts to increase the proportion of women wo rking within the formal economy. Taxation policies : after 'softer' policy options, as those outlined above, have been introduced, consider changes to the tax system if further funds are required. Specifically, by using total income as opposed to earned income as the basis for contributions, raising company contributions, and/or introducing additi onal earmarked health taxes. Policy options: Contractual agreements To improve efficiency within the healthcare system via a change to contractual agreements, the following policy options are recommended. These policy options have been broken down according to broad timelines, which reflect their relative importance. Short -term: 35 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Arbitration: to ensure a level playing field during contractual negotiations, the following option is proposed; allow the Federal Arbitration Committee to postpone the termi nation of contracts from three to six months, after six months an external arbiter would be introduced to facilitate negotiations. Given no agreement is reached, the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs would set the contractual agreement based on feedba ck from the external arbiter. Selective contracts: If certain items cannot be agreed upon in the general contract, allow social health insurance carriers to selectively contract (e.g. to fill physician vacancies). Structural plans: if current regional structural plans fail to achieve their desired objective, it is advised that an independent committee be developed to provide recommendations on the number and locations of physicians. Recommendations would form the basis of contractual negotiations, with a requirement to justify any deviations to the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs. Harmonisation among specialists: Harmonise naming of services/items across outpatient spec ialists to improve transparency. Primary and outpatient care: given the hig h number of hospital admissions, it is clear that primary care within the healthcare system requires improvement. Multiple policies could be introduced to achieve this, for example, by encouraging group practices , primary healthcare units , and extending hospital outpatient departments and disease management programs. It is important to note that efficiency gains from enhancing primary care are only realisable in the medium - to long -term given fixed supply -side costs within the inpatient sector (e.g. buildin gs, labour). Medium -term: Bundled payments: to enhance coordination and continuity of care, social health insurance and L\u00e4nder could implement joint budgets for chronically ill patients who frequently access healthcare services. Such an approach would avoid patients 'wandering' the system and ensure th at appropriate care is provided. Rural and remote GP remuneration : to increase the number of physicians working in rural and remote areas, it is recommended that GPs in these areas be paid on a risk -adjus ted capitated budgets, which takes into account the unique circumstances of working in these areas. To further incentivise physicians, flat rate payments could be introduced to complement capitated budgets, such payments should be linked to actions/service s that promote overall improvement in healthcare quality (e.g. smoking cessation programs). 36 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Long -term: GP remuneration : if the capitated system amongst rural and remote GPs is successful, consideration could be given to extending the scheme to urban GPs , who would also receive additional flat rate payments. Role of GPs : it is recommended that the role of GPs in the healthcare system be enhanced to relieve the burden placed on inpatient care, specifically, by encouraging individuals to register with a sin gle GP who would take responsibility for the individual's overall healthcare plan. Such a system would be voluntary, and only realisable once appropriate structures and pro cesses have been put in place (e.g. more advanced GP training, greater number of GPs ). Policy options: Healthcare quality Policy options to improve healthcare quality within the system have been grouped into three categories. First, changes to the role \u00d6QMed, second, changes to data availability and quality indicators, and third, changes to hospital admissions, readmissions a nd discharge management. In regard to the role of \u00d6QMed: Retain \u00d6QMed and create an additional independent quality committee responsible for monitoring the quality of care among contracte d and non -contracted physicians. Relocate \u00d6QMed to the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, and give the organisation control over monitoring the quality of care among contracte d and non -contracted physicians. Maximise the value of data collected through quality indicators through, fo r example, providing physician feed back and s haring best practice principles. In regard to data availability and quality indicators : Develop a coding system for outpatient diagnosis, this would allow outcome indicators to be implemented . Increase focus on outcome indicators, and where poss ible link them to aligning process indicators. Link quality indicators across all levels of c are to develop patient pathways. Allocate responsibility for developing and implementati ng indicators to the relevant professional group within the St\u00e4ndiger Koord inierungsausschuss. However, any new indicators should be developed in consultation with the medical community. 37 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In regard to hospital admissions, readmissions and discharge management : Research is needed to investigate the causes, as well as clinical and policy implications, of high rates of hospital discharge and readmission in Austria (outside remit of this review). In order to outbalance political benefits and costs, federal government funds to L\u00e4nder should be based on objective criteria that reflect the needs of the population . Apply additional pressure from the financial targets within the Zielsteuerung Gesundheit and the stability pact (i.e. using real values instead of nominal values) . Austrian Structural Health Plan to base its forecasts on epide miological data and best practice of service provision, rather than using current demand as a proxy for need Further integrate secondary care units in the outpatient sector with primary and hospital care In regard to payment of care, for hospitals, the L KF system could be linked to quality of care, while in the first instance, a DRG system within the outpatient sector is advised, given this would improve information on patient pathways. Finally, and as previously mentioned under 'medium term' contractual agreements, bundled payments using fund s from a joint budget (between L\u00e4nder and social insurance) could be introduced, with pilots first being run for m ulti-morbid, high cost patients . Policy options: Demand and supply of physicians Policy options to increase the availability of physicians include: Improving work -life balance for both male and female physicians, especially in regard to child and elderly care (with a specific focus on those wor king in rural and remote areas). Reduci ng incentives for physicians to emigrate , for example, by providing clarity over future work conditions, ensuring work ing conditions are compatible with those abroad in regard to hours worked and reimbursement. Reducing the 'brain drain' occurring during the transition phase between medical school and professional training, for example, by improving training programs and ensuring these programs are allocated suffi cient time. Checking if working time directive compliance necessitates prolongation of traini ng periods , especially for specialists who need also dexterity, not only knowledge. Policy options to increase the productivity of physicians include: 38 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Improving the reputation of physicians working in primary care , for example, via additional GP training requirements to fulfill their responsibilities within newly established primary healthcare units . Delineating physician roles within primary healthcare units and those performed within a hospital outpatient department . Free -up time of physicians by allocating relatively 'low -skilled' tasks t o other healthcare professionals (such an approach may require additional education training for other health care professionals). Training and motivating existing professionals to adjust to re -allocations of tasks and responsibilities given the number of physicians nearing retirement age. Policy options: Monitoring and information needs The following policy options relating to e -health are provided below: Synergy potentials in data storage : identify syner gy potentials between data storage sites, while avoiding the construction of new sites, in order to make efficient use of existing capacity. E-prescribing and recall system : introduce automated electronic prescribing and a recall system for medical adhere nce to reduce prescribing -related errors, while concurrently improving control of prescriptions, reducing time spent on prescription queries and promoting continuity of care. E-vaccination : implement an e -vaccination application with a recall system in ord er to create an optimised overview of immunisation status and vaccination schedule, whilst preventing duplicate immunisations and possible adverse events from drug -to-drug interactions. A national electronic immunisation data collection system could furthe r improve the monitoring and evaluation of immunisation rates in Austria. Digital imaging in ELGA : expand the database for digital images from different medical devices to improve site - and time -independent information sharing between medical professionals and health care enterprises to enhance operational efficiency and to prevent unnecessary repeat examinations. Standardisation of the diagnosis classification system : inclusion of outpatient diagnoses may constitute a better representation of a patient's medical history and interoperability could be improved by standardising the diagnosis classification system. 39 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Evaluation and monitoring of a patient's medical history : a tracking system with a search function to monitor the development of specific parameters, such as blood pressure, may further enhance patient treatment. Further efforts should be undertaken to implement a patient summary. Expansion of data collection : a more exten sive patient record, which, for example, includes information from the yearly medical check -up, could further improve patient -centred care, provided an insured person has expressed interest in the service. Immediate sharing of information on heal th care use : providing information on health care costs in addition to the utilisation of services through ELGA's online portal could enable year -round access to necessary information for patients and prevent billing errors. Dissemination of information o n ELGA to health care providers: develop ELGA showcases that could be presented to health care providers, such as pharmacies, to facilitate and support the roll out of ELGA across as many health care providers as possible. Policy options: Pharmaceutical expenditure and procurement The following three policies are recommended in regard to pharmaceutical expenditure: Enhance international relationships to gain a better understanding of drug transaction prices within the outpatient market. Currently, exter nal reference pricing, which draws upon list prices , is used, which doesn't necessarily reflect actual prices paid for drugs. Austria should consider modifying domestic regulations on statutory prescription drug price cuts so that they are linked to patent expiration rather than generic drug entry . Limit the risk faced by payers and promote efficient use of resources by introducing managed entry agreements. To enhance the use of generics, the following policies are sugge sted: Given the increasing demand for healthcare services, we recommend increasing the role of pharmacists within the healthcare system, which would enhance efficiency and reduce the burden placed on physicians. Incentivise physicians to prescribe more generics, where appropriate . Finally, to enhance procurement policies: Effort should be directed at improving interface management between inpatient and outpatient pharmaceutical sectors to limit cost -shifting and improve coordination of patient treatment. For 40 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options example, by developing a joint budget for all pharmaceuticals, enhancing the role of the Medikamentenkommission, and /or enhancing ELGA so that information regarding a patient's drug treatment (in both inpati ent and outpatient settings) is easily understood by prescribers. Policy options: Health literacy, disease prevention, health promotion The following policy options relating to health literacy and disease prevention are provided below: Health literacy Improving health communication between patients and doctors : Clear health communication between patients and doctors could be further improved by specifying specific criteria pertaining to the communication process (e.g. 'teach back'; avoiding jargon) in the Chamber of Physician's quality evaluation criteria of physician practices or in contracts. Expand the dissemination of health information : the national self -information portal could offer a number of additional language settings, other than German, in order to increase use of the site. A child -friendly, interactive information site could be developed as well. Increase role of different stakeholders : the role of various stakeholders in promoting health literacy should be increased. For instance, a point of contact for patients with limited health literacy levels shoul d be defined to offer training and support, such as patient ombudsperson offices, while physicians could direct the respective patients to these contact points. Pharmacists could be further trained to identify and manage patients with lower literacy levels. Module on health literacy : a module on health literacy in the education setting (e.g. primary or secondary education) could be introduced to establish a solid and uniform health literacy knowledge basis across population groups. Disease prevention Immunisation Inclusion of vaccinations in the mother -child passport : create awareness and incentivize immunisati on of children to increase low childhood immunisation rates. Coverage of cost -effective vaccines for adults : an additional coverage of adult vaccinations, where cost-effective, could potentially increase adult immunisation rates of a number of important vaccine -preventable diseases. 41 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Walk -in vaccination and injection services a t pharmacies : by introducing walk in vaccination and injection services at community pharmacies, following a prescription by a physician, the immunisation process could be rendered more flexible, time -saving and convenient to patients. E-vaccination to imp rove monitoring and re -calling of -, as well as data collection on vaccinations : implement an e -vaccination application with a recall system in order to create an optimised overview of immunisation status and vaccination schedule, whilst preventing duplicat e immunisations and possible adverse events from drug -to-drug interactions. A national electronic immunisation data collection system could further improve the monitoring and evaluation of immunisation rates in Austria. Diabetes Expansion of the diabetes d isease -management -programme (DMP) : in order to improve the equity and quality of diabetes treatment in Austria, it is suggested to further strengthen efforts in the disease management programme, which should be gradually expanded over time. Remuneration of DMP -physicians : the financial compensation of DMP -physicians should be assessed in order to ensure appropriate rewards in line with the time taken to manage diabetes patients, and to incentivise more physicians to enter the programme. Training of physicia ns: inclusion of diabetes specific -tasks in the grid certificate may further expose physicians to additional training and as such improve the management of patients with diabetes. Another option is to render further training more binding by defining explic it follow -up measures in the case that physicians fail to follow the training. Training of DMP -physicians : the introduction of a voluntary training and a confidential supervision by experiences diabetes specialists may increase physician participation in t he DMP programme. Establishment of a national diabetes registry : By extending data collection efforts, a national diabetes registry could be implemented in order to improve the collection of data to monitor and evaluate trends in diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases Comprehensive study: Undertake a comprehensive study into the underlying factors of the high CVD disease burden and mortality in Austria. Based on the findings, appropriate measures could be introduced to reduce CVD -related morbidity and mortality . 42 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: Case and care management A total of eight policy options to enhance case and care management within Austria have been proposed: Target case management and other types of coordinated care based on need Pilot new models, evaluate pilots rigorously and scale up successful ones Increase organisational and financial integration of providers Ensure comprehensiveness of the range of services covered by case management Include inter -disciplinary cooperation in education and training programs of professionals Continue strengthening the role of primary care and embed case management in primary care Provide workplace and return -to-work interventions early Embed case management in broad return -to-work interventions . Policy options: Administration costs The following policy option relating to administration costs is provide d below: Administration caps: link caps to potential economies of scale arising from more streamlined activities, as opposed to historical allocations. Alternatively, require health insurance carriers to justify higher administration costs, given such costs are often required to improv e equality (e.g. performance measurement). Policy options: Healthcare fraud Healthcare fraud leads to a significant amount of waste in healthcare systems. To combat healthcare fraud and limit waste within the system, the following two policy options are recommended: Comprehensive study: Jointly undertake a comprehensive study into the types of heal thcare fraud within the system (including associated costs). Based on these findings, implement appropriate policies to create an environment that limits the opportunity for fraud to occur . Digitalisation: enhance the sophistication of ELGA to enable health insurance carriers to better identify instance s of healthcare fraud 43 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 1 Introduction Review brief In 2016, the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE Health) was engaged by the Austrian Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection to undertake an efficiency review of the country's social insurance system (see Appendix A for the original Concept Note) . The review was specifically targeted at health competencies within the social insurance system; for this reason, consideration of accident and pension insurance, as well as other forms of care covered by Federal and L\u00e4nder governments, were only examined where directly applicable. The review can be broken into four interconnected components, each led by a separate organisation. In the first instance, a legal analysis by professors at the University of Salz burg undertook a review of relevant provisions within the law, with findings summari sed in Volume 2 - Legal Analysis . Concurrently, an exercise to map out existing arrangements within the Austrian social health insurance system was completed by Contrast Ern st&Young. Primary and secondary data were used to collect relevant information with findings provided in Volume 4 - Situational Analysis . To ensure all relevant stakeholder opinions were collected and analysed, stakeholders, in addition to roundtable discu ssions (held in February and May 2017 ), were encouraged to submit a formal statement. Volume 3 of this report - Stakeholder Submissions - combines these statements (see Appendix B for an overview of the invitation provided to stakeholders) . Finally, drawin g upon information collected in volumes 2 -4, as well as further analysis of reports completed by Austrian organisations and experts , and international experiences, a range of policy options have been recommended to improve efficiency within the system (Volume 1 - International Comparisons and Policy Options ) (see Table 1 for an outline of the review's components).

Contrast Ernst&Young Management Consulting GmbH It is important to highlight that efficiency should not be equated with cost -containment, rather the overall objective of efficiency improvements is to enhance overall health status. Using this definition, efficiency gains can be achieved by either: Containing costs through a reduction in waste, or a reduction in necessary services (e.g. non -targeted user charges). If the latter, cost -savings will only be realised in the short -term, given patient healthcare costs are likely to increase in the long -term Improving access to necessary and beneficial services, through higher expenditure, or using sa vings from reducing waste (see figure below). 45 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 1: Conceptual framework to improve efficiency within healthcare systems Sour ce: Framework developed by author. Structure of Volume 1 of the review The following outlines the structure of the remainder of Volume 1, which is based on the Concept Note developed by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consum er Protection (see Appendix A). Please note, a description of the Austrian situation for each component of the review has been provided within this report, however, for a more detailed description of arrangements within the Austrian social insurance system , please see Volume 4 - Situational Analysis . Legal considerations for each of the policy options has also been provided, in brief, in this report. Similarly, for further information, see Volume 2 - Legal Analysis. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the Austrian health care system, including current strengths and challenges Chapter 3 compares key health care indicators in Austria against those in European and OECD countries Chapter 4 outlines the current social security syst em and provides policy options for how the system could be re -structured to improve efficiency 46 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Chapter 5 examines financing mechanisms within the social insurance system including contributions and aligning benefits, user charges, investment activities an d the social welfare base Chapter 6 relates to contracts and purchasing arrangements, which covers provider reimbursement, contractual agreements, healthcare quality, the workforce (physicians, specifically), monitoring and information needs, and procurem ent of pharmaceuticals Chapter 7 relates to public health and disease management, specifically ill -health prevention, health promotion and literacy, and case management Chapter 8 explored additional efficiency potentials arising from administration, heal thcare fraud and business IT processes Chapter 9 provides an overview of the review , including all policy options recommended. Overview Our analysis of the Austrian social health insurance system revealed that the system is both complex, as a result of i ts multi -level governance structure, and fragmented given the dual nature of financing. Specifically, outpatient care (i.e. GPs, outpatient specialists and pharmaceuticals) is financed by social health insurance, whereas inpatient care (including pharmaceu ticals) falls under the joint responsibility of federal and L\u00e4nder (state) governments (with social health insurance paying a fixed share of contributions) . Such an arrangement fosters various inefficiencies including cost -shifting, and discourages continuity of care, which leads to higher overall costs (e.g. high level of unnecessary hospitalisations) . This finding is not new, and has been highlighted by various research institutions, as well as policy -makers , as a key barrier to improving healthca re system efficiency. As a result, in recent y ears, many efforts have been made to improve coordination and align incentives. For example, under the 2005 Healthcare Reform, State Health Funds were introduced to improve coordination between the intra - and e xtra-mural sectors (e.g. Reform Pool initiative). Further, under the most recent reform (2013), the concept for primary healthcare units (PHUs) was introduced; today two units are in operation with plans for 75 PHUs by 2020. Ultimately, the problem of dua l financing can only be overcome with major constitutional reform required to create joint budgets that span the entire spectrum of care (i.e. primary, outpatient, inpatient, long - term and social care). However, we reco gnise the extreme legal difficulty im plementation of joint budgets presents given a two -thirds majority within Parliament is needed . In response, the policy options within this report present pragmatic approaches to enhance coordination and improve efficiency. 47 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Another key issue that has been raised, is that concerning the number of social health insurance carriers. Multiple purchasers of healthcare is not uncommon, for example, in England, responsibility for purchasing services is devolved to over 200 Clinical Commissioning Groups. Further, i n Sweden, provision of healthcare falls under the remit of 21 county councils and regions. For this reason, the total number of carriers, in our op inion, is not viewed as the most important barrier to achieving efficiency. Nevertheless, options to enhance efficiency by amalgamating carriers and encouraging coordination have been proposed. In our opinion, the two pressing challenges facing Austria refer to the types of services procured by purchasers, and secondly, by the allocation of funds to purchasers. In regard to the former challenge , Austria is unique in that healthcare purchasers operate in silos (i.e. insurance carriers versus L \u00e4nder) , that is, purchasing care for a portion, as opposed to all healthcare services. Concerning the latter, only a small proportion of health insurance carrier funds are risk -adjuste d, which results in inequities. Thi s is also the case with other resource allocation mechanisms in Austria (i.e. federal government to the L \u00e4nder or from social health insurance to the L \u00e4nder), w hich are mostly based on political negotiations and historical allocation patterns . Limited risk -adjustment has meant that, despite uniform contribution rat es (with the exception of the BVA, which only differs by 0.015% , and the farmers (SVB) ), differen ces in benefits for specific services may occur . Such an arrangement is inequitable and goes against international trends. However, it is worth highlighting that self -reported unmet need (healthcare) in Austria is one of the lowest in Europe (see Figure 2, which outlines the three dimensions of universal health coverage) . Ensuring high -quality care has also been a key agenda for policy -makers over recent years. F or example, with the introduction of the Federal Institute for Quality in Healthcare Systems (including the Austrian Society for Quality Assurance and Quality Management in Medicine), as well as quality indicators for inpatient (Austrian in patient quality indicators, A -IQI) and outpatient care (Austrian outpatient quality indicators, A -OQI). Despite this, the types of quality indicators measured, in addition to the uses of information collected in Austria, could be enhanced. More robust info rmation on quality within the system will ultimately improve patient outcomes via the development of evidence -based policies (see Figure 2). Final ly, it is evident that more recently Austrian policy -makers have recognised public health as a key area for enhancement, for example, with the development of the diabetes disease management program . Nevertheless, through discussions with stakeholders, in a ddition to findings within the policy and 48 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options academic literature, it is clear that relative to other advanced European countries, Austria's primary care and public health sectors could be significantly improved. This is evidenced by, for example, low rates of vaccinations and lower than average life -expectancy projections, as well as high inpatient admissions rates , including those for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (e.g. diabetes and asthma) . Such findings reiterate the need for further investment in pr imary care and public health , while being cognisant that, in the short -term, cost -savings are unlikely, given the presence of fixed hospitals costs (e.g. labour and maintenance) (see Figure 2). Key findings, as described above, have been summarised in the following figure outlining the three key dimensions within universal healthcare system s. The dimension 'breadth of coverage' outlines who is covered by pooled funds, 'services and satisfaction' refers to what services are covered, while 'costs (user charges)' explains what proportion of costs for services are covered. Key findings within the Austrian system have been categorised as either positive, or requiring improvement (1). Figure 2: Dimensions of universal health coverage 49 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Summary Based on the findings outlined above, a number of policy options to improve efficiency within Austria's social health insurance system have been proposed. In reviewing this policies, we offer policy -makers and stakeholders the following recommendations: fi rstly, to view policy options outlined in this report , as well those by various Austrian research institutions and organisations (including stakeholder submi ssions - Volume 3 of this review ); secondly, to ensure future discussions and implementation of policy options be done in a transparent and inclusive manner so that key stakeholders do not view change as a 'zero -sum game'; and thirdly, to keep in mind that no healthcare system is perfect, and that any future efforts should build upon current successes, which in the case of Austria, include high -level s of population satisfaction as a result of ease of access to healthcare services, and low levels of unmet need. 50 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 2 Overview of the Austrian social security and healthcare system Chapter 2 provides an overview of the Austrian healthcare system including major stakeholders and their function. Following on from this description, an overview of key strengths and challenges facing the system are ex plored. Given the overall report is focused on improving efficiency, significant emphasis has been placed on 'challenges' as findings were used to identify efficiently potentials Organisation of the health system Austria is a federal state made up of nine states (L\u00e4nder), who in turn are comprised of municipalities, with the exception of Vienna (2,3) . Both federal and state governments are vested with legislative and executive powers. Municipalities, on the other hand, are not granted legislative powers, instead, they issue ordinances to fulfil federal state administrative tasks. In international terms , Austria's healthcare system can be classified as a social health insurance system, given, primarily, employers, employees and the self -employed pay contributions in return for access to a package of healthcare services (2,3) . The healthcare system i s characterised by its dual nature, whereby competenc ies, and thus financing arrangements, are split between federal and state governments, and social health insurance (3,4) . Specifically, outpatient care (i.e. GPs, outpatient specialists and outpatient pharmaceuticals) is financed by social health insurance, whereas inpatient care (including pharmaceuticals) falls under the joint responsibility of federal and L\u00e4nder governments (with fixed contributions from social health insurance) . As a result, the sys tem has often be en referred to as both complex and fragmented (3). For example, although most major healthcare forms fall under the legislative competency of the federal government (Article 10, 12 B -VG), they require approv al from the s tates (Bundesl\u00e4nder). T herefore, provision of hospital care often dominates the political debate (at the expense of other forms of care) (3). Various actors are involved in organis ing the Austrian health system. Each actor differs in terms of their political legitimation and inner governance mechanisms. Social health insurance carriers, as well as the professional bodies, are established on the basis of occupational and/or regional membership and operate as self -governing bodies (however, the Federal Government is responsible for social insurance legislation) (3). As a result, social insurance carriers enjoy autonomy from government intervention, for example, by appointing their own supervisory boards (3). Federal and state governments, on the other hand, are directly legitimised by the electorate. 51 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options As stipulated by constitutional law, the federal government is primaril y in charge of regulating healthcare. Within social health insurance, carriers are subject to different laws, specifically the ASVG applies to GKKs (regional health insurance carriers, Gebietskrankenkasse) , BKKs (corporate health insurance carriers) Betrie bskrankenkasse ) VAEB (railways Eisenbahnen ), Sozialversicherungsanstalt der Bauern ), and the B (civil servants carrier, Versicherungsanstalt \u00f6ffentlicher Bediensteter) . In regard to hospital care, the Federal G overnment is only responsible for setting the framework for regulation, with state governments delivering healthcare services in order to meet their constitutional obligation. As shown in the figure below, t he current legal framework has led to a high nu mber of actors involved in the organisation and governance of the health system. To improve coordination between social health insurance, and federal and state governments, several initiatives have been introduced (3,5) . For example, in 2005, State Health Funds were implemented for the purpose of pooling funds from social health insurance, and federal and state governments to finance public acute care hospitals (according to the country's DRG system).1 Their role is also to improve coordinat ion between intra - and extra -mural sectors (e.g. 'Reform pool' initiative). Further, under the 2013 Healthcare Reform, both federal and state target control commissions were established to help achieve the country's overall health target of increasing the number of healthy life years by two over the next 20 years (e.g. by enhancing population health literacy (target 3) and encouraging positive nutritional habits (target 7)). 1 State Health Funds are the primary form of financing for hospitals, however, additional funding stems from general taxes, municipalities, VAT and social insurance. 52 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 3: Organisation of the Austrian Health System, 2017 Source: Ostermann, H. 'Organisation and governance of the Austrian health system'. Working paper (unpublished) for the Austrian HiT -report (forthcoming 2018). 2017. 53 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 4: Organisation of the Austrian Health System, 2017, financial flows Source: (6) Governance The various actors involved in the Austrian health system can best be described by their (inherent) governing structure and/or corresponding are a of governmental sovereignty. The relevant categories therefore en compass the federal level, the state level, and social health insurance level. Federal level At federal level, the federal parliament, as the representation of legislative power, as well a s the Federal Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs and, to a lesser extent, the Federal Ministry of Finance represent the key actors in health system governance. There are various commissions in charge of advising the Ministry of Health and Women's Affa irs, all of which require significant medical and/or scientific expertise. The most prominent commission, in this regard, is the Supreme Health Board (Oberster Sanit\u00e4tsrat) , which advises the Ministry on specific medical 54 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options queries, including 'start of the ar t' medical technology and services. In addition to the Supreme Health Board, various advisory boards have been established based on mutual agreements set out in Article 15a agreements of the Federal Constitution, or directly on behalf of the Ministr y, acco rding to \u00a78 Bundesministeriengesetz . The Ministry is also supported by subordinate agencies responsible for various consultancy tasks regarding areas such as information services, food and health safety, and technical infrastructure. For example, by the Austrian Public Health Institute (Gesundheit \u00d6sterreich GmbH),2 Austrian Agency for Food Agentur f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Ern\u00e4hrungssicherheit Record Company (ELGA GmbH)4. L\u00e4nder (state) level Developing the framework for legislation falls under the remit of the Federal Government, however, it is the L\u00e4nder governments who implement detailed legislation (3). At the level of the L\u00e4nder (states), the state parliame nts, as well as the state m inisters responsible for health care, represent the main actors in regard to health system governance. The remit of state health ministers, in general, encompasses the following areas of responsibility: General issues of (public) health Hospital care (running their own hospital or contracting out to providers) Ambulatory services Healthcare labour Long -term care. As previously outlined, the L \u00e4nder are responsible for providing hospital care, specifically by ensuring the availabi lity of adequate hospital capacity. Hospital services are either provided by public state -owned hospitals or public hospitals run by not -for-profit institutions. Regardless of ownership, hospitals are reimbursed by State Health Funds (which receive monies from federal, state and local governments). All 2 The national public health research and planning in stitute, which also administers the Federal Funds for Health Promotion (Fonds Gesundes \u00d6sterreich). 3 Joint agency of the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water management in charge of the p rotection of human, animal and plant health, of medical and drug safety, as well as of food security and consumer protection along the food chain. 4 Joint institution of the Federal Government, the state governments and social health insurance carriers. T he company is responsible for further development of the national e -health infrastructure as well as for the coordination of all relevant activities to roll -out electronic health records. 55 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options states, with the exception of Vienna, have established state -owned operating companies for their hospitals, most of them in the form of a public or privat e limited companies . Finally, all L \u00e4nder have established patient ombudsman /lawyers (Patientenanw\u00e4lte) offices. Each ombudsman operates as an independent institution responsible for informing patients of their rights, as well as acting as mediators and advocates of patient interests where poor -quality care or malpractice has occurred. Social health insurance The primary self -governing bodies relevant within the health care system are the social insurance carriers. In addition, there are professional bodies representing health service providers (predo minantly the Chamber of Physicians), as well as voluntary professional associations (3). The current organisational structure of the health insurance system was established in 1947 under the Social Insurance Tr ansition Act, which established the Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions ( Hauptverband der \u00d6sterreichischen Sozialverischerungstr\u00e4ger, HVSV ). The HVSV operates as the umbrella organisation for all insuranc e carriers operating within social insuran ce, which also covers pension and accident insurance. Theoretically, the HVSV is responsible for coordinating all social insurance carriers, however, in effect, it relies upon the cooperation of its members (i.e. the carriers) (3). The HVSV currently includes 2 1 social insurance carriers, 18 of which offer health insurance (see figure below) . The vast majority of the population are covered by social insurance (i.e. 99%), given, by law, Austrian inhabitants are assigned to an insurance carrier based on their employment status. Specifically, most employees (and their dependents) are insured by a regional health insurance carrier (GKK) corresponding to the location of their employment. Employees not covered by GKKs include railway workers and miners, self -employed, farmers and civil servants. Each of these employment groups are insured with carri ers specific to these groups, which in addition to health may also provide work accident and/or pension insurance . Five, relatively small, professional health insurance carriers (BKK), based on former key public industries, also offer health insurance. In addition to these social insurance carriers within the HVSV, some groups of L\u00e4nder and municipal civil servants are insured with one of 15 KFAs (Krankenf\u00fcrsorgeanstalten ), offering health and accident insurance. The KFAs are not represented in the HVSV and their establishment under L\u00e4nder law is provided for by the B -KUVG. 56 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 5: Organisation of Austrian social insurance, 2017 As previously discussed, health insurance carriers are responsible for the provision of outpatient care for its insurees (3). To carry out this function, carriers must engage in negotiations with the Chamber of Physicians (with one operating in each state), to create a general contract outlining reimbursable services and associated fees. In addition, health insurance carriers may also provide care with their own institutions (3). Strengths Access The Austrian healthcare system performs well on all dimensions of healthcare coverage as it is based on a social insurance model that guarantees all inhabitants equitable access to high quality health services - irrespective of their age, sex, orig in, social status or income. Thus, access to healthcare services is high 57 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options with 99.9% of the population being covered by the social health insurance system (7). Most of the remaining 0.01% are able to opt out in favour of full private health insurance (e.g. physicians ). Relatively low co -payments for services also enhance access to healthcare. Persons who are chronically ill or persons from vulnerable groups are exempt from most co -payments. Also providing for timely access to acute and emergency services is the number of most provider types and the wide availability of services for the population due to planning criteria already factoring in accessibility. Equity Equity, in regard to access to healthcare, is also high given that the social health insurance system covers vulnerable groups such as asylum seekers and needs -based minimum benefits recipients (8). In terms of services provided, very few Austrians report unmet needs in terms of medical or dental examinations due to costs, travel or waiting times according to an analysis of EU -SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Data) (7). Further, the i ncome gradient among reported cases is low, indicating equitable access to care. All in all, this equitable access can be ascribed to the principles of the Austrian healthcare system, which are solidarity, affordability and universality and to the fact tha t patient rights are not only legally defined but can also be enforced by law. Patient ombudspersons in each Land ensure low level access to assistance in cases of malpractice and other types of misconduct irrespective of the individual's capability to cop e with such matters. Resilience The Austrian healthcare system is very stable in terms of the ability to create revenues and to provide services. This can probably be attributed to the overall economic policy and industrial relations geared towards stabil ity, for which the tradition of compromise among the social partners seems to be key. What is more, the system of self -governed social health insurance provides for some independence from political and subsequent budgetary changes in the federal government . As a result, during the economic crisis of 2008 and onwards, the Austrian healthcare system proved comparably resilient (9). Further , the 2013 healthcare reform established a common understanding of a vision for the Austrian healthcare system as well as instruments to find joint solutions for necessary c hange among SHI, L\u00e4nder and federal government. Satisfaction Finally, patients seem to be satisfied with the overall quality of healthcare in Austria: According to the Eurobarometer, 96% of the population regard the system as 'good' and rate the quality o f healthcare 58 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options compared to other EU Member States as 'better' (60%) or 'the same' (34%) (10). A factor which could play a part in contributing to the high satisfaction is the free choice of healthcare providers alongside their availability. This high satisfaction could al so be linked with a high self -reported health status of 70%, i.e. almost three quarter of the Austrian patients classify their health status as being 'good' or 'very good' (11). Challenges Governance Split com petences A fundamental issue in the Austrian healthcare system is the split in competencies between the federal and L\u00e4nder level, which is outlined in the constitution (3). In regard to general healthcare , laws are passed at the federal level, which includes laws social health insurance is based upon. It is also at the federal l evel that responsibility for executing the law lies (art. 10 of the constitution). In regard to hospital care, the L\u00e4nder have the right to pass and execute laws on the basis of a more general federal law. The L\u00e4nder, alongside municipalities, are also responsible for long -term care, however, it is the federal government who funds the long -term care allowance through pension insurance carriers. A simi lar overlap in competencies exists for areas of healthcare concerning people with disabilities (see Volume 2 - Legal Analysis for further details) This fragmentation makes intergover nmental negotiations necessary. Specifically, approximately every five yea rs such discussions lead to an agreement according to art. 15a of the constitution on the organisation and financing of healthcare. This split in competencies is frequently discussed in the literature as a major obstacle to improving health service deliver y, especially for the chronically ill. Accordingly, Austria is not a top -performer in regard to rates of chronic diseases among countries in Europe (6,12 -17). Previous attempts to attribute whole areas of governmental tasks to only one level of government were not successful. Neither the '\u00d6sterreichkonvent' 2003 -20055 nor the working group on administrative reform 2009 -2011 brought about a change in this constitutional setup. The healthcare reform 2005 aimed at creating platforms on the federal (Federal Health Commission, Bundesgesundheitskommission ) and 5 Results of the \u00d6sterreich -Konvent are presented on http://www.ko nvent.gv.at/ 59 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options L\u00e4nder level (State Health Platform, Landesgesundheitsplattform ) to jointly plan the structures and take decisions in the Austrian healthcare system. Moreover, a common planning framework, the Austrian Structural Plan for Health ( \u00d6sterreichischer Strukturplan Gesundheit, \u00d6SG ) was introduced, to be substantiated on the L\u00e4nder level between Land and SHI as the Regional Structural Plan for Health (Regionaler Strukturplan Gesundheit ). However, the success of the reform as a whole seems to have been limited and the Austrian Structural Plan has been criticised for its limited ability to achieve c oordination of planning (18,19) . Thus, the healthcare reform 2013 institutionalised a common governance instrument, the target control system for heal th (Zielsteuerung Gesundheit ), alongside virtual common budgets between SHI and each Land, subject to a maximum expenditure growth path. It also instated a second body on both federal and L\u00e4nder level, the Federal Target Control Commission (Bundeszielsteue rungskommission ) and the State Target Control Commission (Landeszielsteuerungskommssion ), responsible for planning and executing the target control instrument (Gesundheitsreformgesetz 2013). These new institutions consist only of representatives of the mai n payers in healthcare, the federal government, the L\u00e4nder and SHI and seem to be an attempt to reduce the complexity in decision making processes. In 2017, with a new 15a -agreement for both organisation and financing as well as target control, structural planning was made more compulsory by instating the 'Gesundheits -Planungs -GmbH', a limited liability company receiving sovereign rights from both the federal and the L\u00e4nder level to make parts of the structural planning mandatory by official decree (Vereinb arungsumsetzungsgesetz 2017). The Federal Target Control Commission replaced the Federal Health Commission as the governing body of the Federal Health Agency. Fiscal and parafiscal federalism, veto players The split of competencies within healthcare betwe en the levels of government entails that healthcare is heavily affected by fiscal federalism (20). Over the years, negotiations resulted in numerous rules and exceptions, making the financial flows complicated and thus in -transparent (6,13,21) . In addition to fiscal federalism, the same phenomenon applies to social health insuranc e, as every insurance carrier is self - governed and entitled to its insurees' contributions. Federal, L\u00e4nder and SHI's contribution to hospital financing as well as partial equalisation between insurance funds are based on historical values instead of needs , and are incomplete. What is more, as the federal government levies taxes in the name of all levels of government, this paves the way for 'fiscal illusion' : An expansion in hospital services by L\u00e4nder governments might be favourable with voters, who in tu rn are not directly burdened by increased L\u00e4nder taxes (21). While budget constraints apply and debt burden is limited by the stability pact, some L\u00e4nder 60 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options were indeed creative by e.g. having the hospital operatin g companies taking on debts , indicating the need for a transparent way of needs -based alloca tion for tax money. Federal structures can also be found in most other corporatist elements in Austria. The social partners as the main carriers of social health insurance as well as the Chamber of Physicians have federal structures as well. Together with the strong role of g overnment levels in a Bismarckian healthcare system, Austria has to cope with an unusually high number of veto players, making the process of healthcare reform more complex (15,22) . Governance of so cial insurance funds Many European countries ensure responsiveness to insurees either by the introduction of competition (either between more public funds like in Germany or Belgium or between private insurer like in the Netherlands and Switzerland) or by improving their representation (e.g. in Scandinavian countries). While competition might be beneficial in terms of improving responsiveness, it is also prone to unwanted risk - selection. Establishing effective and efficient representation, on the other han d, also proves to be a challenging task. Austria is one of the few countries with a Bismarckian system in Western Europe that has not introduced choice and competition between insurance carriers, further the system continues to rely on compulsory professi on-based insurance (23). Governing bodies are elected indirectly whenever the employers' or employees' chambers hold elections. These governing bodies send their cha irpersons to form the governing body of the Main Association of Social Security Institutions (HVSV). As a result, both voice and choice for insurees are rather limited, which limits the incentive for carriers to be responsive and innovative (22). For example, one study (24) finds one of the reasons that DMPs have not been successful is that insurance carriers lack the incentive to reallocate means accordingly. Thus, introducing some elements of competition, e.g. yardstick comp etition while at the same time improving representation would contribute to system efficiency. Hospital laws With regard to the hospital sector, it is difficult to assess and compare the performance of hospitals across Austria given the current competence distribution and financing arrangements (dual financing). Through the existing competence distribution in many fields there are ten hospital laws (one for each Land and one federal law) . Currently a pattern relating to L\u00e4nder laws can be seen, which shows that the L\u00e4nder either take over federal legal regulations or implement them by means of own expressions with identical 61 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options content. Thus, there are ten legislators, administration departments and legal departments employed with identical topics. In this area a bundling of legislation to the federal level would have a high efficiency potential (i.e. by implemen ting laws in a more timely manner). The Austrian Court of Audit identified several potentials in its report 'Verwaltungsreform 2011' (Bund 2011/1), for example, the fragmented constitutional competences in health care, the deficient coordination between the intra - and extramu ral sector, the overload of the inpatient sector, the high location density, insufficient balance of services and collaborations, the lacking cross -carrier service offer, the service shift between intra - and extramural sector and the absent quality measure ment and assurance (25). For further details regarding possibilities to re -distribute competences with respect to the hospital laws, and in accordance with the consti tutional law, please see Volume 2 - Legal analysis (Chapter 6) . Revenue collection and pooling Contribution base For SHI, the contribution base is income by the employed, their employer's part of contributions and income by the self -employed. With the ex ception of farmers, a uniform contribution rate is then applied. There are no recent studies measuring the degree of equity in financing. However, some older studies show that the social health insurance system was more regressive than other European SHI -systems at the time of the respective studies (23,26,27) . This narrow (i.e. only work -relat ed) contribution base is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the contributions to hospital financing and some other health related activities from all levels of government are based on VAT and general taxes. Nevertheless, Austria has one of the highest tax wedges in the OECD (28). Contributions are collected by each health insurance carrier separately. Where people have more than one source of income, this might mean tha t they are multiple insured. On the one hand, multiple insured must actively ask for refund if they reach the maximum contribution level with all insurance carriers combined. On the other hand, they can choose their insurer in every case of health se rvice provision. Thus multiple insurees, for example, can avoid user charges in one case, while benefitting from high reimbursement for medical appliances in another, raising equity issues in an insurance system without competition (16). General taxation also subsidises healthcare through the s ystem of 'Hebes\u00e4tze' . These 'Hebes\u00e4tze' are a fictitious employer's contribution for pensioners, paid by the respective pension insurance. However, given the federal government subsidises pensions (with the level of subsidisation differing across carriers), the general tax payer effectively subsidises some funds more generously than others. 62 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Pooling across risks and income Due to the profession -based insurance system, with the regional health insuran ce funds as a default, risks as well as income groups are distributed unequally. Nevertheless, no internationally comparable comprehensive risk -adjustment system is in place (16). Only the regional health insuranc e funds take part in the equalis ation fund accordin g to \u00a7447a, redistributing 1.64% of contributions.6 As per capita incom e of insurance funds varies considerably, a major mechanism to reduce the difference in per capita means are the very different tariffs for contractual partners and equalis ation funds for various areas like hospi tal financing. Further mechanisms are in place e.g. mutually reimbursing work accident insurance and health insurance, albeit only through historically based lump sums. As a considerable part of healthcare is funded by the federal governme nt and the L\u00e4nde r, risk -equalisa tion is also an issue th ere. However, the fiscal equalis ation system is mainly based on negotations rather than a risk or needs -based allocation formula. Differences in entitlement and reimbursement Due to historical developments as well a s different income s per recipient, entitlement to services and reimbursement vary between the insurance carriers . While some general rules are defined by l aw, the insurance carriers ' statu tes and so called 'Krankenordnungen' play a major role in defining e ntitlement and reimbursement. The HVSV issues a template statute and a template 'Krankenordnung' and make certain items compulsory for all insuranc e carriers (\u00a7455 and \u00a7456 ASVG). However, as the governing body taking the decision in the HVSV consists of t he cha irpersons of the insurance carriers , there are only few such mandatory clauses, which can also be seen from comparing the statutes in the SozDok7 or HVSV (2016) (29). The KFAs, which are outside the HVSV , seem to have even more generous deviations from the average insurance fund, for example, reimbursing all costs incurred by non -contract providers (as opposed to the 80% offered by other carriers) . This, however, raises equity concerns, as insurees can neither choose their fund nor have effective voice options, while paying the same contribution rates.8 6 For more information on the risk -equalization fund according to \u00a7447a ASVG see SAR or SGKK(2006) 7 SozDok ist he documentation system of social insurance law, www.sozdoc.at 8 This is partly mitigated by the fact that some funds have higher user charges. 63 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Purchasing and provision of services Public health As with other fields in healthcare, the tasks within public health are split between all levels of government and SHI. In its inception, SHI was aimed at providing care for th e ill, and only in the last two decades was tasked with measures of prevention and health promotion (see changes to \u00a7116 ASVG). The healthcare reform of 2013 tackled some of the issues already laid out in a report of the European Observatory on Public Heal th in Austria, most notably to adopt the concept of health in all policies and making prevention and health promotion an explicit goal (30). Nevertheless, Austria still lags behind in some major public health areas, like tobacco control, where it takes t he last rank in the tobacco control scale 2016, as well as in alcohol consumption (17,31) . The healthcare reform 2013 also introduced a system of health targets. Ten very broadly defined framework health targets ( Rahmengesundheitszie le) were determined. These are monitored by 40 Meta - indicators (32). Each framework target has several operative targets ( Wirkungsziele ), each of which are again to be mon itored by 1 -2 indicators. For each operative target, several pre -existing or newly developed measures were defined, each of which is to be measured by one indicator. In addition to this, the target -control health ( Zielsteuerung Gesundheit ), mainly concerne d with the healthcare system proper, is governed by 26 targets monitored by 106 indicators (33). While it is admirable that after a long time with little activity in the field of public he alth, considerable efforts were made to catch up, the number of targets and measures seems overambitious. International experience shows that a lower number of targets that are widely shared among the stakeholders but consequently observed on all levels is the more promising approach (34,35) . Indeed, the latest federal t arget control agreement (Bundeszielsteuerungsvertrag ) shows a reduction of targets at least for target control health. Ambulatory care: structure and personnel The ambulatory sector is split between outpatient departments in hospitals and physicians in private practice (extramural sector). Both subsectors provide a wide range of specialist services, creating an overlap and interactions that provide the opportunit y for supplier -induced demand (36). There is little integration, as SHI is responsible only for services outside the hospital. Access to both subsectors is not limited or coordinated, creating the opportunity to overco nsume services while at the same time hampering coordination of care. In the extramural subsector, the predominant form is single practice, 64 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options limiting its ability to cater to the needs of complex patients or cases out -of-hours, and thus, continuity of care. In the extramural sector, the typical practice consists of the GP or specialist and their practice aid. Efficient allocation of tasks to differentiated non -physician personnel is not possible. In general, Austria performs poorly in terms of true primary h ealth care, leading to comparably low performance in terms of avoidable hospitals admissions and outcomes in chronic diseases (37-39). This major downside is planned to be tackled by the PHC -law, allowing different groups of health professionals to work together. If a true primary care based system is to be implemented, GPs need to be able to cope with a wide variety of health and social problems that can mainly be found in GP -practices. Gathering experience with the setting before taking a post as a self -employed GP in the field, however, is difficult because postgraduate training for GPs is still primarily situated in hospital s despite a recent reform (\u00c4rztinnen -/\u00c4rzte - Ausbildungsordnung 2015 - \u00c4AO 2015). Ambulatory care: contractual arrangements In order to contract GPs and specialists working in practices, SHI has to engage in negotiations with the regional Chamber of Physic ians for all physicians (GPs and specialities) combined. Selective contracts with only one speciality or single physicians without a general contract is not envisaged by the law. This joint negotiation therefore probably increases the veto -power of every s ingle speciality, as only a so called general contract ( Gesamtvertrag ) with all specialities together can be concluded (14,22) . In order to ensure similar general contracts, the Main Association of Social Security Institutions in theory has to negotiate all general contracts on behalf of each sickness fund (\u00a7341 ASVG). However, this is purportedly not the case, perpetuating a great diversity in contracts as well as fee schedules. The diversity does not only pertain to the height of the tariff for one and the same service, but also the items themselves, leading to consider able differences in the number a nd thus the structure of the fee schedules, as can be seen in the meta fee schedule of the Main Association of Social Security Institutions that tries to match the different items to a common list. Apart from the fee schedule, the number of co ntract physi cians per region are negotiated (\u00a7342 ASVG). The positions themselves, however, are filled through a list handled by the Chamber of Physicians, creating an individual contract between the insurance fund and the physician. Thus, the respective insurance fun d cannot decide to contract a specific person on its own. The list is filled based on criteria proposed to the MoH by the Chamber (\u00a7343 (1a) ASVG), e.g. professional experience, additional qualifications, time on the waiting list etc. While SHI can only terminate an individual contract due to severe misconduct by the physician, a contract physician can 65 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options terminate at any time with a three -month notice period. In case a general contract terminates without a new general contract or the general contract is termi nated by one of the parties, an arbitration committee can only extend it for a limited period (\u00a7348 ASVG). After that, all individual contracts expire, and all patients need to pay for physician services out of pocket and have to submit the invoices to the ir insurance fund. As this is a severe administrative burden and an inconvenience to patients, it has been argued that the current negotiation framework favours the physician side (40).It has also been argued that SHI is very limited in the way it can fulfil its task according to \u00a7338(2) to provide ad equate medical care to its insurees, which, in contrast e.g. to Germany9, it bears alone (22). As there are in fact different general contracts for physician services, also the number of contract physician differs. Some physicians opt to only contract with some of the insurance funds, which leads to the paradox situation that smaller but more afflue nt funds have more physicians under contract than the \u00a72-funds (see the following table): Table 2: Number of contracts with different 2015 This system also leads to an unusual separation into the contracted GPs and specialists as opposed to a large and growing number of non-contracted self -employed physicians (explained in detail in section 6.3.7 ). Ambulatory care: financing and payment The fee schedules for contract ed physicians are in general not based on costing data as it is done in relative value scales like TARMED or EBM, but rather on negotiated fees that are jointly increased no matter the underlying changes (41). TARMED and EBM are used in Switzerland and Germany, respectively. Both 9 In Germany, SHI and the A ssociations of SHI -contracted physicians (Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigungen) carry the joint responsibility to provide adequate services (\u00a772 SGB V) . 66 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options systems are based on cost calculations for each service so that compensation reflects the actual expenses and efforts by the personnel. What is more, fees differ considerably between insurance funds, as also the law (\u00a7342(2)) states that fees should be set according to the financial power of the insurance fund. This is found to set distortionary incentives for physicians wh en treating patients. It is also an inefficient allocation of funds, as some physicians have their practice in areas with a population dominated by insurees whose insurance fund pays low fees. This essentially means that the low fees already have to be an acceptable source of income, whereas physicians in affluent regions in this sense thus receive economic rents. The payment mechanism for GPs is contact capitation (approx. 70% of income) with additional fees for service (30% of income). For specialists ove rall, this ratio is essentially reversed. For some services, insurance funds usually apply a maximum volume, beyond which they pay only a reduced or no fee. By international comparison, the Austrian payment system seems thus to be outdated, as it neither r eflects actual costs and efforts incurred nor the risk -structure of patients, nor does is incorporate quality (41,42) . For primary care, the changes in the course of the PHC law is supposed to bring about a change in the payment system for GPs, as the changes to the ASVG require SHI to develop a payment system t hat introduces a more differentiated system of capitation, case -based payments, fee for service and probably some pay -for-performance components (see the new \u00a7342b (3) ASVG introduced by the Gesundheitsreformumsetzungsgesetz 2017 ). Nevertheless, there will still be no payment mechanisms fostering integration of primary and secondary care. The outpatient departments in hospitals are paid by a global budget based on historical values. This sets a distortionary incentive to admit patients to inpatient care, w here the hospital receives DRG -points per stay. On the other hand, SHI pays for all extramural services alone, while it contributes ca. 45% in the form of a lump sum to hospital financing. This sets the incentive for SHI to restrict services that it has to pay for in full, channelling patients to outpatient departments in hospitals. This might be an explanation why despite a lot of public debate, the integration of the extramural sector with outpatient departments (envisaged in the healthcare reform of 2005 ) as well as out -of-hours care in the extramural sector are not well developed. Another possible reason is that any change in this setting would create additional costs during the transition. Winding down capacity of outpatient departments leaves the hospi tal with fixed costs for some time, while a possible transfer of funds to the extramural sector requires payment of full costs, even if they are lower than full costs inside the hospital. 67 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Inpatient care: structure and personnel10 Austria has an unusually l arge inpatient sector and above average inpatient stays. Several factors seem to contribute to this. One is probably the fiscal illusion already mentioned, i.e. in an ageing population, it is politically beneficial to build hospitals, even more so when for the constituency, the connection to the tax burden this entices is concealed (20). Also, the payment system favours the inpatient departments (see below). Another reason might be that even publicly funded non -profit hospitals are allowed to ha ve a so called 'Sonderklasse'. Patients in the 'Sonderklasse' are not only entitled to improved amenities, but the treating physicians also receive additional fees from the private health insurance fund usually paying the additional amenities. In turn, the hospital management claws back some of these fees for the use of the facilities in the function of a 'private' physician11. In sum, there is an incentive for both the hospital management and the physicians to cater to patients in the 'Sonderklasse'. As the law (\u00a716 KaKuG) allows for only 25% of hospital beds being 'Sonderklasse', there is an incentive to keep the overall number of beds high as well . In addition to this, the 'Sonderklasse' might also cause equity issues, as it can be assumed that patients cr eating additional income through their private insurance's payments, or being an actual private patient in the hospital physician's private practice, expect preferential treatment (43). What is more, it has been shown that patients with voluntary health insurance have shorter waiting times ceteris paribus and are in some cases offered payments order to shorten waiting times (44). Austria also has many smaller hospitals that mi ght not be scale efficient, while in general, there seems to be room for improvement to increase efficiency in the inpatient sector (45,46) . Given this structure, more specialisation, division of tasks as well as cooperation among hospitals or between hospitals and other providers in relation to certain processes cou ld help increase efficiency even without a fundamental structural change (47). The personnel structure is dominated by registered nurses followed by physicians. Several professions working in hospitals in other countries do not exist, making the alloca tion of tasks inefficient. Fo r example, there are no physician assistants, medical coders or phlebotomists, for which there is not even approved training (48). 10 The analysis is restricted to the publicly funded hospitals, so called fund -hospitals (Fondsspit\u00e4ler) due to being financed through the State Health Funds. 11 Mind though that these physicians are still employees of the publicly funded hospital. 68 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Inpatient care: contractual arrangements While hospitals are formally a contractual partner of SHI, the latter's role is very limited, as the contractual relationship is governed by the provisions in the 15a -agreement on organisation and financing of the healthcare system. In effect, SHI pays a portion of their income to the state health funds (Landesgesundheitsfonds), forfeiting all say in hospital matters. In the state health fund, the Land has the automatic majority in all matters hospital, although pay ing only about 30% of total hospital costs. Although theoretically, the federal level, contributing about 12% of total hospital costs, can withhold its contribution if a Land does not comply with rules set by the Federal Health Agency (e.g. the \u00d6SG or the Austrian DRG -system) (art. 45 and 46 of the 15a agreement on organization and financing of the healthcare system 2017 -2021), this has never happened so far, possibly due to political considerations (19). With the healthcare reform 2013, Land, SHI and federal governmen t are obliged to work more closely, as especially Land and SH I have a shared responsibility to reach healthcare and financial targets (Gesundheitsreformgesetz 2013). However, accountability for the healthcare targets is based on the publication of the moni toring reports by G\u00d6G, which due to the large number of targets most likely does not receive widespread public attention. The 15a -agreement on target control (2013) introduced a sanction mechanism, which was detailed by the Gesundheitszielsteuerungsgesetz . Sections \u00a7\u00a734 -38 of this law regulate mechanisms in case targets are not reached, one of the parties is in violation of an agreement within the target control mechanism, or no agreement on target control on the L\u00e4nder level is reached. In the first case, the target control commission of the Land has to submit a report to the federal target control commission as to why the targets were not reached, which is then accepted or rejected. Either way, this report is made public. If a party is in violation of the target control agreement, one of the other parties can notify the federal target control commission which then proposes a resolution. If the issue is not resolved within two months, an arbitration mechanism can be invoked. In case no agreement can be reach ed on the L\u00e4nder level, the points of dissent are reported to the federal target control commission, which in turn publishes this report. The federal target control commission or the MoH proposes a resolution for the points of dissent. Inpatient care: fina ncing and payment SHI, the federal government, the L\u00e4nder and municipalities all contribute to every State Health Fund through a complicated financing arrangement that has been frequently criticized due to its intransparency and lack of needs -orientation (13,14,39) . Each State Health Fund pays the hospitals within its Land, so that changes in patient flows can only b e factored in whenever a new 15a -agreement is reached. The 69 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Austrian DRG system called LKF (Leistungsorientierte Krankenanstaltenfinanzierung) is currently used for the inpatient departments only. The LKF system currently does not include quality -dependent components. It is also strictly based on the stay rather than a treatment episode (including readmissions). Through the LKF system, the State Health Fund's budget for the inpatient sector is distributed to all hospitals in the Land. However, as the federal government only requires that more than 50%12 of costs of the hospital have to be reimbursed through LKF, every State Health Fund pays very different values per LKF-point. The remaining costs are called 'Betriebsabgang' and are thus not a true operating de ficit. Each Land can, within some limits, enact different rules as to how this Betriebsabgang is covered by a block payment called 'Betriebsabgangsdeckung'. It has been argued that this mechanism creates soft budget constraints for hospitals owned by the L and while creating harder budget constraints for their private non - profit counterparts, as part of the Betriebsabgang can be attributed to the hospital owner, which is in most cases the Land again for public hospitals, but private entities, mostly religiou s orders, in the case of private non -profit hospitals (46). What is more, as each inpatient stay creates financial compensation, but outpatient depar tments are paid through a global budget, an incentive is set for the management to shift treatments to the inpatient departments, resulting in unnecessary admissions and as illustrated by the high number of cataract surgeries entailing an inpatient stay (41). In order to mitigate the problem, treatments in day clinics were incentivised, as they are paid as a full overnight stay. This measure shows some ef fect as the latest monitoring report shows (49), albeit with considerable differences between the L\u00e4nder. Rehabilitation The responsibility for rehabilitation rests with all three branches of social insurance, depending on the cause for needing rehabilitation. Therefore, many social insurance carriers have rehabilitation facilities of their own. Little research has been done in the area of challenges in rehabilitation. An example is Sperl et al. (2011) on child rehabilitation (50). The authors stress the deficits in the are a of rehabilitation of children due to a lack in appropriate facilities and show international examples on how to improve this field. Only since 2004, there is a more detailed overview of capacities and attempts to plan those capacities in the rehabilitat ion plan by the HVSV and G\u00d6G, currently in its 2016 edition. From the aims of the 12 This requir ement was included in the 15a -agreement so that hospitals belo ng to the private sector according to the System of National accounts, effectively removing deficits and debts in hospitals from the public sector. However, the Manual on Government Deficit and Debt laying out the rules for Maastricht conformity does no lo nger recognize this, so that more than 3 billion Euros had to be added to Austria's Maastricht debt in 2011. 70 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options rehabilitation plans, it becomes obvious, that Austria has far too few capacities in ambulatory rehabilitation, and inpatient rehabilitation capacities need to be adapted. Ca re coordination with hospitals is again hampered by split competencies. Pharmaceuticals In the first decade of the new millennium, pharmaceutical expenditures were a major concern for SHI, especially volume increases. Through diverse measures, most notably a reduction of VAT from twenty to ten percent, as well as introducing a system of rebates and supporting physicians to prescribe more economically, the cost increase could be curbed. However, in recent years, some expensive new drugs have again cha llenged SHI's pharmaceutical budgets. Also, SHI is only responsible for pharmaceuticals outside hospitals, while hospitals bear the costs of their own drugs, incentivising cost shifting. At least for high cost medications, this was attempted to be tackled by the healthcare reform 2013 by the introduction of the pharmaceutical commission ( Medikamentenkommission ) issuing recommendations on high -priced drugs. Improved procurement might be necessary in both the hospital and the extramural setting, as Austria do es not perform as well as in previous years in terms of drug prices (51). Integration of care The split in competencies, the financing and payment mechanisms described above, detailed regulations for structures and contractual arrangements and limited funds for innovation reduce the ability of the Austrian healthcare system to provide integrated care. So far, only one DMP has been rolled out, with initial findings revealing a positive impact, however, participation in the program is low (24). This is a concern, as Austria's demographics follow the general trend in most European countries of double ageing, alongside an increase in chronic and multiple chronic diseases. Other important fields like long term care and social care are the responsibility of municipalities and L\u00e4nder, and thus, not easily integrated with health care. The joint responsibility for primary health care established in th e healthcare reform 2013 still has to show concrete effects in service provision, as currently, true primary healthcare units are still rare, and for integration towards secondary care only some projects exist. Also, there are some training courses for cas e management, but rarely defined positions in healthcare facilities. 71 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 3 International comparative analysis This chapter provides an international comparison of Austria's healthcare system in regard to expenditure, resources, health outcomes and utilisation . Overview This chapter presents an introduction to the performance of Austria's healthcare system, specifically this analysis details the country's methods of healthcare financing, its physical and human resources, its health outcomes and extent of heal thcare utilisation. Healthcare financing is considered with regards to the magnitude of spending on healthcare, both at a country level and an individual level, in addition to Austria's means of financing and the corresponding contributions of different fi nancing methods to total expenditure. The adequacy of Austria's healthcare resources is best assessed through an analysis of the distribution of labour resources as well as physical capital, for example hospital beds. However, in order to construe an infor med opinion of the performance and adequacy of Austria's healthcare system it is essential to consider the overarching dimension of health outcomes. As such this report utilises indicators in the context of life expectancy, burden of illness and unmet need . Finally, a key objective of any healthcare system is access, hence this report will discuss healthcare utilisation in Austria to determine whether this goal is achieved and to what extent inequities present themselves within the country. Various data s ources were employed in order to create this chapter including OECD Health Statistics data 2015, the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, Eurostat database in addition to data provided directly by G\u00d6G. A series of figures were constructed using the availab le data which were then utilised to inform observations regarding the Austrian healthcare system. A comparative analysis approach was adopted, therefore throughout the chapter comparisons are drawn between Austria and other OECD countries. Given Austria em ploys a health insurance system, more granular comparisons were made among European OECD countries also operating health insurance systems such as Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Belgium. 72 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Healthcare financing Health expenditur e as a proportion of GDP Compared with other European countries, Austria's health expenditure represents a relatively large proportion of GDP. Specifically, Austria spends 10.4% of its GDP on health, which is 0.5 percentage points above the EU(28) average, however, lower than in countries such as Germany (11 .1%) and France (11%) (see Figure 6). Austria's health expenditure is comprised mostly of public financing arrangements through government spending an d compulsory health insurance (7.9%) and to a lesser extent, private sources and voluntary health insurance (2.5%); the larger proportion attributed to government/compulsory financing is broadly mirrored among other European countries. Figure 6: Health expenditure as a proportion of GDP ( Europe) (2015) Source: (52) Regarding European countries, which are also characterised by a health insurance system, health expenditure as a proportion of GDP in Austria is comparable to other entities and is equal to that in Belgium, as depicted in the figure below.

Similar to other European countries, the sharpest increase occurred between 2008 and 2009 (see Figure 8). This trend can be attributed to the fall in GDP caused by the Global Financial Crisis.

Figure 9 illustrates that Austria's health expenditure per capita of \u20ac3,789 is the 6th largest among the 28 European countries used for comparison. As discussed above, this amoun t is comprised largely of government/compulsory spending which amounts to \u20ac2,884 per capita and is supplemented by private/voluntary spending of \u20ac905. The mean health expenditure per capita among European countries with health insurance systems is \u20ac3,621, therefore Austria's health expenditure per capita is above average compared to the countries shown in Figure 9 . However, the average is heavily influenced by Luxembourg, which has an expenditure per capita 66% above the average (i.e. \u20ac 6,023 ).

Conversely, its annual growth rate was significantly lower than other European countries with health insurance systems, including Belgium which grew by 3.2%. Austria's average annual growth rate was lower between 2009 and 2015 at 1.1%, which is in stark contrast to Switzerl and and Luxembourg whose growth rates for that period were 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Austria's average annual growth rate from 2009 -2015 however was still 0.4 percentage points higher than the lowest average rate for the group (i.e. EU(28) at 0.7%) (see the figure below).

Approximately 45% of health expenditure in Austria is attributed to CHI, followed by government schemes (31.1%). However, despite CHI acting as the primary source of funding, compared to other European count ries operating health insurance systems, Austria funds a relatively lower proportion of its health expenditure through this mechanism. Its financing structure is most closely aligned to that of Switzerland, however, out of pocket spending in Austria is mar kedly less at 17.7% of health expenditure compared to 26.7% in Switzerla nd.

Specifically, there are only eight nurses per 1,000 people, which is significantly lower than Switzerland, the country with the highest density, which has 18 nurses per 1,000 people (see Figure 16 ). This suggests a strong dependence on physicians within the healthcare system. With respect to pharmacists, Austria has a moderate density which can be considered so mewhat typical of European countries with social insurance systems. There are 0.7 dispensing pharmacists per 1,000 people in Austria which places the country just below the mean density for the basket of countries used for comparison in Figure 1 7. 0.000.200.400.600.801.001.201.40 0123456 Hungary Poland Denmark Norway Slovenia Iceland* United Kingdom Sweden Luxembourg Belgium Slovak Republic* Ireland Spain Latvia Finland Estonia France* Netherlands* Switzerland Czech Republic Italy Germany Austria Portugal** Greece* Ratio GP per specialistPractising physicians per 1,000 population GPs Specialists Ratio GPs/specialists81 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figu re 16: Practising nurses per 1,000 people (2015 or nearest year) (European social insurance systems) Source: (52) Figure 17: Practising pharmacists per 1,000 people (2015 or nearest year) (European social insurance systems) Source: (52) Capital The Austrian health care system relies heavily on secondary care, which is reflected by high resource utilisation in the hospital sector compared to other European countries. Austria has the fifth highest number of hospitals, see Figure 18, and the second highest number of hospital beds per capita in Europe (see Figure 19).

This is a marked increase from 1990 where life expectancy for males and females was 72.3 and 78.8, respectively. A study conducted by Kontis et al . (2017), which aimed to forecast national life expectancies, found that Austria was in the bottom half of the 35 countries13 analysed in regard to the median projected change in life expectancy at birth from 2010 to 2030 (men and women) (54). The median projected change for women and men was 3.25 and 3.75 years, respectively (see Figure 21). Figure 21: Projected life expectancy between 2010 and 2030 (men and women) Source: Graph tak en directly from (54) 13 Including countries such as Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. 85 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The projected female -male difference in 2030 was significantly less than that in 2010, a trend observed in almost all countries examined, indicating gender inequalities are expected to narrow. Both Kontis et al . (2017) and the OECD indicate that Austria la gs significantly behind Switzerland and France with regards to overall life expectancy, both of which are highly comparable countries to Austria due to their health insurance systems (54). Nonetheless, the A ustrian life expectancy exceeds that of Germany and Belgium, albeit only marginally. Analysing male and female life expectancies separately shows that Austria is placed in the middle of European countries with social insurance systems for both cases. For b oth genders Austria is bettered by Switzerland an d Luxembourg. Figure 22: Male life expectancy (European social insurance systems) (2015) Source: (55) 77.878.4 78.478.879.279.980.7 767778798081 Belgium France Germany Austria Netherlands Luxembourg Switzerland86 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 23: Female life expectancy (European social insurance systems) (2015) Source: (55) Burden of illness The top 10 causes of death in 2015 in Austria were: ischaemic heart disease, Alzheimer disease, cerebrovascular disease, lung cancer, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertensive heart dise ase and breast cancer. All of the aforementioned causes of death are non -communicable diseases, eight of which rank within the top 10 causes of premature death, in addition to self -harm and pancreatic cancer (see Figur e 25). Notably, there has been a significant reduction since 2005 in the number of premature deaths caused by road injuries. The number of years of life lost (YLL) attributed to ischaemic heart di sease is the highest among the top 10 causes of premature mortality in the majority of OECD countries, but is especially high in Austria as well as Germany. With respect to morbidity, low back and neck pain was ranked as the biggest cause of disability in both 2005 and 2015. The biggest risk factor which drives the most death and disability combined is diet, closely followed by high systolic blood pressure, however tobacco smoke and alcohol and drug use are also prominent. Collectively these risk factors im plicate that unhealthy lifestyles play a significant role in Austria's burden of illness. The most prevalent health problem in both 2005 and 2015 was oral disorders. 83.2 83.283.483.784.385.2 85.2 8283848586 Belgium Germany Netherlands Austria Luxembourg France Switzerland87 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 24: Top 10 causes of death by rate in 2015 and percent change, 2005 -2015 Disease 2005 ranking 2015 ranking Percentage change Ischaemic heart disease 1 1 -2.3% Alzheimer disease 3 2 20.2% Cerebrovascular disease 2 3 -11.5% Lung cancer 4 4 9.1% COPD 5 5 5.1% Colorectal cancer 4 6 -42.8% Chronic kidney disease 12 7 50.6% Diabetes 7 8 -4.4% Hypertensive heart disease 11 9 42.5% Breast cancer 9 10 5.1% Source: (55) Figur e 25: Leading causes of premature death (YLLs) in 2015 and percent change, 2005 -2015 Disease 2005 ranking 2015 ranking Percentage change Ischaemic heart disease 1 1 -11.5% Lung cancer 2 2 2.4% 88 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Disease 2005 ranking 2015 ranking Percentage change Cerebrovascular disease 3 3 -19.6% Alzheimer disease 5 4 12.7% Self-harm 4 5 -14.5% COPD 7 6 -0.2% Colorectal cancer 6 7 -6.6% Breast cancer 9 8 -2.6% Diabetes 10 9 -14.1% Pancreatic cancer 12 10 11.5% Source: (55) Compar ed to other OECD countries there are definite similarities in the burden of illness. In Germany, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Belgium , the number one cause of death and premature death in 2015 was also ischaemic heart disease. Unhealthy lifestyles c ontribute significantly to the burden of disease and the number of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in the aforementioned countries. Tobacco smoke, dietary risks, alcohol and drug use and high systolic blood pressure comprise the top four risk factor s in all of Austria, Luxembourg, France and Belgium. Alcohol and drug use is less of a risk factor in Germany however. Austria performs relatively well according to the indicator of deaths from cancer per 100,000 people. Specifically, in 2015 there were 1 97 deaths from cancer per 100,000 people, which aligns exactly with Germany and is considerably better than the worst performer of the group in the figure below. On the other hand, it is possible to determine there is scope for improvement as several count ries performed better, achieving a lower number of deaths; in particular Finland had only 173 deaths per 100,000 people. Austria performed particularly well with regards to survival for stomach cancer, achieving a 33.1% age standardis ed net survival rate which was only surpassed by Belgium (33.4%) when comparing the countries included in Figure 27 . Austria also has the highest age standardised net survival rate for lung 89 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options cancer, 17.9%, compared to fellow OECD countries, despite tobacco smoke being the third leading risk factor driving death and disability combined according to the Global Burden of Disease study. It is higher than the worst performer in the group, the UK, by 8.3 percentage points. Despite generally performing well against cancer metrics which act as indicators of overall health care performance, one an omaly exists. The age standardis ed net survival rat e for leukaemia within adults is only 45.8% which is lower than many European countries including those also operating social insurance systems such as Belgium, France, Switzerland and Germany. More than half of adults diagnosed with leukaemia in these countries survive the disease, whereas less than half survive the disease in Austria.

This indicates that the impact of this disease on public health in Austri a is of significance. Furthermore, diabetes is associated with unhealthy lifestyles thus reiterating that population health in Austria suffers due to risk factors such as diet and high body -mass index. Primary care is important for the management and preve ntion of diabetes therefore the above average prevalence once again points to weaknesses within Austria's primary care system.

The rate of hospital discharges per inhabitant can be influenced by a number of demand - and supply -side factors. The former include the age structure and morbidity of the population, as well as other demogr aphic characteristics, whereas the latter mainly refers to the capacity of the hospital sector and its substitutes in the outpatient sector. Austria displays the highest number of inpatient hospital discharges per year (2014 or latest available) with only Germany exhibiting similar values of more than 250 discharges per 1,000 inhabitants. These numbers are considerably above the average of the available European countries which was less than 170 discharges per 1,000 inhabitants (see Figure below). It should be noted that the four countries with the highest discharge rates, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Hungary, are also among the countries with the highest number of hospital beds per inhabitant (see Figure 19). Figure 29: Number of inpatient discharges per 1,000 inhabitants (2014 or latest available year (a)) (a) Latest available year: BE: 2013, DK: 2013 (2009 for curative care), EL: 2011, FR: 2013, NL: 2010.

The advantage of using ACSC as an indirect measure for primary care quality is that hospital data can be used, which is often routinely collected and therefore usually more reliable and comparable than data collected for example, through interviews. The OECD adopted the notion of ACSC, for which hospitalisations are potentially avoidable, to measure the quality of the primary care. Data on five common chronic diseases, which are part of the most used definitions of ACSC s (e.g. (58)), is availabl e for cross -country comparisons. These conditions are asthma, COPD, diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF) and hypertension. The data is presented as number of hospitalisations with one of the conditions, as primary diagnosis, among people aged 15 years or older, per 1,000 inhabitants. It is also age and sex standardised to the OECD population over 15 in 2010. For all conditions, reasons for variations could be not only the quality of the primary health care system, but also in differing levels of morbidi ty and differing coding practices between countries. Some countries were, for example, unable to fully rule out double counting of patients due to referrals (details can be found in the notes of Figure 33 to Figure 36) (17).

Ireland, Hungary and Austria showed the highest hospitalisations rates for these conditions (3.48, 4.28 and 4.36. per 1,000 age -sex standardised population , respectively ). The rate for Austria might be overestimated as not all transfers could be identified due to inappropriate coding and the lack of a patient identifier to correct for double -counting. The average number of hospitalisations of patients aged 15 and older per 1,000 sex -age standardised population in 201 4 (or latest available year) was 2.4, which is around 30% less than the Austrian rate.

Evidence regarding a socioeconomic gradient of health care utilisation in the EU Member States can be found in the results of the 'European Health Interview Survey' (EHIS). Data is publicly available for the first wave which was conducted be tween 2006 and 2009. The collected data shows that 17.3% of the Austrian population reported at least one inpatient hospitalisation during the 12 months before the interview (see Figure 41). Persons with pre -primary, primary and lower secondary education reported a h igher rate of 20.9%, whereas onlh 16.4% of those with tertiary education reported inpatient stays. This means that persons with a tertiary education report 27% less inpatient stays than those with primary or lower secondary education. Compared to other European countries participating in the EHIS, this is a rather low gradient (the highest one is recorded in Greece with over 90%). 17 Method for classifying the choropleth map: class breaks correspond to quantiles of the distribution of variable attribute, so that each class includes approximately the same number of polygons. 104 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 41: Percentage of population with at least one inpatient hospital admission during the last 12 months by educational attainment level (self -reported between 2006 and 2009) Source: (63) Regarding primary health care, 63.8% of the Austrian interviewed population stated that they had no contact with a general practitioner (GP) during the last 12 months. Of those persons whose highest educational attainment is lower se condary, only 55.4% reported that they had no GP contact which is almost 20% below the percentage reported by persons with tertiary education. Compared to the other countries in the survey, this is a rather high gradient (see Figure 42). 8 10.6 10.9 11.1 11.9 12.3 13.3 13.6 14.4 14.4 14.5 15.4 16.2 19.8 20.94.6 7.9 7.7 6.8 7.8 8.5 10.8 7.1 9.5 10.3 10.3 10.3 8.9 11.3 16.4 0.05.010.015.020.025.0 Romania Spain Slovenia Cyprus Bulgaria Malta Belgium Greece Czech...

In addition, the authors showed that the gap between healthcare needs of low- and high -income groups was comparatively small, and only six countries demonstrated smaller gaps. The data therefore implies that Austria does not exhibit significantly large inequities in access to heal thcare. The Netherlands, which also operates a social insurance system, had an even smaller percentage of people reporting unmet need, and interestingly, scored highly with regard to primary care strength indicators. Conversely, all of France, Belgium, Swi tzerland, Luxembourg and Germany presented larger percentages, the highest being France where over 5% of people reported unmet need. Austria conformed to the general trend whereby the lowest income group reported the highest unmet need. Results from the a bove study are mirrored by data collected and analysed within a recent report by the European Commission (65). Based on EU -SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) data, of the 29 96.1 0.020.040.060.080.0100.0120.0 Hungary Germany Slovakia Austria Belgium Poland Czech Republic Slovenia Spain Greece Malta Bulgaria Estonia Latvia Romania Turkey CyprusPre-primary, primary and lower secondary education (levels 0-2) Upper secondary and post-secondary non- tertiary education (levels 3 and 4) First and second stage of tertiary education (levels 5 and 6)106 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options countries examined, Austria had the second lowest share or people reporting unmet healthcare needs as a result of cost, trave l distance and waiting times (as of 2013) (65). Further, re sults from the data show that Austria has made significant progress in this area between years 2008 and 2013 ( Figure 43). Using the same data, an analy sis of unmet need in Austria, compared to the EU(27), was also undertaken according to range of population groups, namely: poorest quintile, lower secondary education, unemployed, female, people aged 65+ and richest quintile. Results from this analysis are promising, given even those in vulnerable groups (e.g. unemployed) recorded significantly lower levels of unmet need than the EU average (see Figure 44).

Compared with other European and OECD countries, Austria spends a re latively large proportion of GDP on healthcare, albeit it is more similar to those OECD countries which utilise a health insurance system. This finding is mirrored at the individual level when analysing health expenditure per capita data. Similar to other European countries, healthcare expenditure as a proportion of GDP is rising, however by contrast, the average annual growth rate in health expenditure per capita is decreasing. Austria's main source of financing is compulsory health insurance yet it also relies quite heavily on taxation and government schemes, unlike many of its OECD social insurance country peers. The data in this chapter provides an insight into the relative importance of different health care providers. It is evident that hospital pro vision is inflated compared to many other OECD countries, due to the high numbers of hospitals and hospital beds, implying insufficient provision is available at the primary care level. With regards to health care professionals, data supports the view that there is an over reliance on physicians and under reliance on other professions, in particular nurses. 108 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Life expectancy in Austria has exhibited an upward trend, which is also reflected in comparator countries, however, current li fe expectancy is lower th an than in several European countries with health insurance systems, suggesting Austria is underachieving in this respect. Further, relative to a number of European countries , life expectancy projections are low. Such results suggest further effort is req uired to enhance current public health initiatives (as outlined in chapter 7). The indicator of deaths from cancer per 100,000 people provides a la rgely positive view of health outcomes in Austria, and for most types of cancer Austria performs close to the average of the countries examined, or better with regards to age standardised net survival rates. Prevalence of diabetes however is above the Euro pean Union average. Finally, the burden of disease in Austria is largely similar to that in analogous countries with the highest amount of premature death attributable to ischaemic heart disease, whilst the biggest risk factors are associated with unhealth y lifestyles. Secondary healthcare utlisation is relatively high in Austria, compared to similar countries, and analysis of hospitalisations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions provides insight as to whether hopsitalisations in general are potentiall y unnecessary. Interestingly, Austria displayed above average rates for asthma and COPD, diabetes and hypertension and congestive heart failure, which provides further evidence that primary healthcare performance is less than optimal. Utilisation of health care differs according to educational attainment, suggesting inequities do exist, with more educated persons reporting a lower percentage of inpatient stays in hospitals. Whilst there appears to be an apparent disparity, it is important to observe that it is less extreme than those in other European countries. Figure 45: Overview of international comparative analysis results Financing Above average expenditure on health when compared to the EU average, however, lower than other countries operating social health insurance systems Relatively low average annual growth rate in years 2005 -09, and even less between 2009 -15 Physical and human resources Relatively high number of practis ing physicians per 1,000 people, with a co ncurrently low number of practis ing nurses and pharmacists Significant number of hospitals and hospital bed s, and thus high rates of inpatient admissions relative to EU and OECD countries 109 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Health outcomes Life expectancy figures for men and women mirror those found in other European social health insurance systems, however, in regard to projections, Austria performs relatively worse Similar to most developed countries, major areas of disease burden are non -communicable and include ischemic heart disease, COPD, and diabetes Utilisation Austria has the highest number of inpatient discharges per 1,000 people when compared to European OECD countries, however, an analysis of trends reveals the number of discha rges has been falling since 2008 Hosptialisations by ACSC reveal that Austria has a relatively high number of admissions for asthma and COPD, diabetes, and congestive heart failure In the outpatient sector, utilisation aligns wit figures recorded across a number of OECD countries All-cause and ACSC hospitalisation rate s differ across the nine states , with the latter experiencing significantly greater variation Austria experiences relatively low levels of unmet healthcare need across all groups in societ y, including the unemployed and thos e in the lowest income quintile. 110 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 4 Structure of Austria's social security system This chapter outlines the organisation of the Austrian social security system. Based on the strengths and weakness of Austria's healthc are system, four alternative social insurance models have been proposed. The models ultimately aim to improve patient wellbeing by improving both efficiency, effectiveness and equity within the system. Structure of social security in Austria Status quo Austria's social security system is comprised of three pillars, namely, accident, health and pension insurance. There are a total of 21 insurance carriers within the current system who offer singl e or multiple types of insurance (66). As previously ou tlined, a ll 21 social secu rity carriers are united under the HVSV. Accident insurance covers physical damage, death or inab ility to work, as a result of workplace accidents or occupational disease. Accident insurance is offered by the: Austrian Workers' C ompensation Board (AUVA); Insurance Institution for Railways and Mining (VAEB); Insurance Institution for Public Sector Employees (BVA); and the Insurance Institute for Farmers (SVB). AUVA is the largest provider, covering 78% of the population (67). Figure 46: Number of insured persons per accident insurance carrier Health insurance covers sickness, health check -ups, incapacity to work caused by diseases, as well as maternity costs. Most of the population are covered by one of the nine GKKs (i.e. 76%), covering each of the L\u00e4n der. The remaining 24% of the population are covered by either the Insurance Institution for the 63,036411,336933,1434,856,887 01,000,0002,000,0003,000,0004,000,0005,000,0006,000,000 VAEB BVA SVB AUVA111 Volume (SVA), the VAEB, SVB , BVA, and to extent, one the 15 KFAs (Krankenf\u00fcrsorgeanstalten ) (13). Figure 47: Number of insured persons per health insurance carrier Lastly, pension insurance covers insurance claims for those of retirement age, as well as for those who have limited working ability, and death. Pension insurance also provides rehabilitation services and healthcare. Eighty -four per cent of the market is covered by the PVA. Pensio n insurance is also provided by the SVA , SVB and VAEB, in addition, there is a pension insurance institution for notaries (67). Figure 48: Number of insured persons per SVA PVA112 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Although not technically within the social insurance system, it is important to highlight health and accident insurance offered to civil servants through the Krankenf\u00fcrsorgeanstalten (KFA).18 There are currently 15 KFAs covering health and accident insuranc e to 200,000 people at the L\u00e4nder or community level. In addition, since 2000, seven employment groups have been given the choice to 'opt out' of the statutory insurance scheme (article 5, GSVG), given their insurance is covered, for example, by voluntary health insurance under the ASVG or GSVG. These professions cover pharmacists, physicians, lawyers, architect s, public accountants , veterinarians and notaries (68). For further details on the structure of Austria's social insurance system, please see Volume 4 - Situational Analysis. Policy options: Social insurance structural models The debate of merging social insurance carriers has been discussed extensively within Austria over the past decade. Advocates of amalgamating carriers point to potential benefits , namely from economies of scale and scope (as ou tlined below). Economies of scale In theory, firms can reduce average costs of production if they increase their level of output. This is commonly referred to in the literature as 'economies of scale' (69). For example, economies of scale may be achieved by streamlining IT processes, human resources, as well as data collection and analysis. It is important to note that, theoretically, economies of scale is not continuous, in that once a certain threshold is reached, the decline in costs per unit will stagnate and eventually rise once more (see figure below). For this reason, fi rms should take caution when expanding their operations given it may also lead to diseconomies of scale due to the heightened complexities associated with managing a significantly large business (70). The specific threshold before diseconomies of scale are reached is rarely known, and is likely to differ across and within industries. Consequently , economies of scale are not necessarily achieved in practic e. 18 KFAs operate in Carinthia Abs. 2: Ausnahmen von der Krankenversicherung ). 113 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 49: Long -run returns to scale Economies of scope A second driver of efficiency relates to economies of scope, whereby it is less expensive to produce a range of products together, as opposed to producing each product on its own (e.g. by reducing parallel structure s, which lead to unnecessary costs) (70). Regarding e conomies of scope, there exist two conflictin g theories, namely the 'Conglomeration Hypothesis' and 'Strategic Focus' (71). The former, states that firms can take advantage of cost and revenue scope economies by operating in several business lines or offering a multitude of different products, resulting in superior efficiency compared to specialised firms . The latte r, on the other hand, a rgues that specialised insurers generate superior efficiency by focusing on one or a limited set of offerings from their core business, where they exhibit competitive advantages (71). According to Cummins et al. (2010), in terms of insurance, the Strategic Focus argument outweighs arguments made wit hin the Conglomeration Hypothesis (71). Further Conglomeration Hypo thesis within the Austrian social health insurance context is not possible given there is no opportunity to expand outside the three forms of insurance. 114 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Additional benefits of mergers Amalgamation of carriers may also address specific challenges facing Austria's social security system including: The lack of cooperation among insurance carriers (for example, during contract negotiations with the Chamber of Physicians, and in regard to investment of own institutions ) Differences in benefit packages acros s carriers, with wealthier funds offering their insured population a wider range of benefits and better access to healthcare Structural fragmentation caused by national and regional laws governing different insurance carriers Limited risk-equalisation to take into account different structures across health insurance carriers. Notwithstanding the above, amalgamation is not the only tool available for improving efficiency and coordination within the system. That is, significant improvements to efficiency a nd coordination can be potentially achieved within the current structural model given weaknesses within the system are addressed. Therefore, it is recommended that the net -benefits of restructuring the social insurance system be contrasted against enhance d cross -carrier cooperation. In light of this, four alternative struct ural models have been developed, each offering differing levels of amalgamation across insurance carriers. For each of the four models proposed, an overview of the model, rationale, ch allenges and legal co nsiderations have been provided. It is important to note that amalgamation is unlikely to lead to cost -savings in the short -run given it takes time to adjust supply -side factors, su ch as office space and labour. F urther , additional co sts will arise from the development and implementation of new processes that are compatible with the new structural model. This is evidenced by the 200 2 merger between pension i nsurance for workers and employees (PVArb and PVAng) . Specifically, the greates t cost incurred by the merger was in 2003 (one year after the merge), which amounted to \u20ac35.2 million. This figure subsequently declined to \u20ac22.7 million in 2005 , and eventually \u20ac5.6 million by 2008 . Reasons for the additional short -term costs include inflexible labour and capital, as well as there being significant structural differences between the two PVA branches. Specifically, the PVA for workers was organised in a decentralised manner with four regional offices, whereas the PVA for the employees had one central head quarter overseeing nine branches.19 19 The final structure largely mirrored that of the workers PVA, with the development of nine regional offices. This decentralised structure required additional staff, with associated increases in office space. 115 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In the long -run, merger costs declined for several reasons including: Selling unused properties Standardising IT processes to fit with the general structure used within social insurance Bulk purchasing of standard software licenses Concurrent sourcing of IT personnel (i.e. hire externals on an ad -hoc basis (which led to a nnual savings of \u20ac1.36 million)). Despite these savings, overall, the predicted savings of 10% were counteracted by overall costs tot alling \u20ac114.8 million (as of 2007) (72). Further evidence that mergers lead to cost increas es in the short -run is found within the German context. Specifically, the German Court of Audit found administration costs rose in the first year after mergers (up to 18% for certain sickness funds). In addition, due to collective employment contracts, the level of staff cannot be adjusted, thus limiting efficiency potentials.20 20 Information regarding the impact of mergers in the short -run completed by Contrast Ernst&Young. 116 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 3: Proposed structural models for Austrian social security system Model Description Risk -adjustment (RA) Rationale Challenges Model 1 * Partial amalgamation - 1 accident insurance - 1 pension insurance - 1 employed health insurance - 1 self -employed health insurance - Limited need for formal RA due to large insurance pools - Re-evaluate need for RA every five years - Standard fees, access and benefits - Joint procurement - Economies of scale - Knowledge specialisation - Introduce KFAs into social security - Standardis ation - KFA competencies - SVB contribution base - BKK administration costs Model 2 * Limited amalgamation - 1 pension insurance - 1 self -employed health insurance - 1 health insur ance for employed (excluding civil servants ) - 1 accident insurance for employed (excluding civil servants ) - Joint health and accident insurance for civil servants - RA between civil servants and employed health insurance - Standard fees, access and benefits - Joint procurement - Economies of scale - Knowledge specialisation - Introduce KFAs into social security Step -wise approach to amalgamation - Standardisation - KFA competencies - SVB contribution base - BKK administration costs Develop RA across employed health insurance carriers and funds for civil servants Model 3* Health and accident amalgamation - 1 pension insurance - 1 health and accident insurance split according to the nine states - Limited need for formal RA due to large insurance pools - Re-evaluate need for RA every five years - Standard fees, access and benefits - Joint procurement - Economies of scale - Knowledge specialisation - Standardisation - KFA competencies - SVB contribution base - BKK administration costs - Splitting AUVA into regions 117 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Model Description Risk -adjustment (RA) Rationale Challenges Introduce KFAs into social security Model 4 Insurance coordination - Current structure - Enhancement of current competence centres - Enhanced risk-adjustment across all health insurance carriers - Develop RA across all insurance carriers - Enhance equity and efficiency - Improve coordination among health insurance carriers - Encouraging meaningful participation in competence centres - Exclusion of KFA from social security Note: *V arious sub -models exists for models 1, 2 and 3 and have been included in the table below. 118 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Model 1 : Partial amalgamation Description Model 1 retains the three -pillared structure of the current system with separate insurance for health, accident (AUVA) and pension (PVA). Under the new system, all three insurance pillars would be nationalised with no single insurance carrier offering multiple or all types of insurance. The health insurance pillar would be split into two groups - employed and self -employed. Employed health insurance would cover all nine regional health insurance funds (GKK), the BVA, VAEB, BKKs , and KFAs , operate outside the social security system . Self-employed health insurance would amalgamate the SVA and SVB. Governance principles and representation for b oth health insurance carriers c ould be based on the principle of proportionalit y. In rega rd to national pension and accident insurance pillars, under model 1 , all types of rehabilitation services would be subsumed by AUVA , with the exception of invalidity rehabilitation . This arrangement is necessary given these services are funded by pension insurance. Health care institutions owned and run by insurance carriers (i.e. hospitals, outpatient clinics, rehabilitation centres) would be managed by one central agency, with si milar arrangements applying for shared service centres. One exemption would apply, specifically, AUVA will retain control over their own hospitals. 119 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 50: Structural model 1 Rationale Unlike the status quo, model 1 de lineates each insurance pillar so that health (employed), health (self - employed) , accident and pension are provided on a national level. Under this new arrangement , one health insurance carrier for the self -employed and one for the employed would be responsible for negotiating with the Chamber of Physicians on tariff levels and services. As a result, variability in fee schedules would be minimised. The new st ructure would create larger risk pools, particularly within the health insurance pillar, thereby improving efficiency and equity within the system (see section 4.2 for further details on the benefits of larger risk pools ). Given the size of each of the two health insurance carriers (self -employed and employed), it is p resumed that no formal risk-equalisation mechanism is needed. However, the need for a formal system of redistributing funds could be evaluated every five years. Lastly, c reating four separate insurance pillars , each with their own focus, can foster synergies and knowledge specialisation, leading to better services for the insured population. 120 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Challenges Despite the above benefits of consolidating insurance carriers, several challenges are associ ated with this form of amalgamation . Each of these challenges has been summarised in the table below, as well as an aligning strategy. Table 4: Challenges associated with implementing model 1 Challenge Strategy Standardising specialist fees, user charges and benefits Currently insurance carriers offer different arrangements for accessing and paying for healthcare. Standardisation of arrangements will be required, however, it should be phased in over a period of time (e.g. 5-10 years). This will provide the insured population and carriers ' time to adjust. KFA competencies Unlike other insurance carriers, KFAs are governed by the L\u00e4nder and do not form part of the HVSV . KFAs also pay for all private ex penditures, and in certain cases, pay in full for (non -contracted) physicians (Wahl\u00e4rzte) (as opposed to the 80%). KFAs under model 1 will have to form part of HVSV and operate under a similar law. Unlike the current KFA arrangement, employed health insur ance will not fully reimburse patients who access non -contracted physicians. Contribution base of SVB The contribute base for current SVB carriers differs from the SVA, with the farmers employing a non -income related base. Therefore, under the merge, the self -employed will be required to cross -subsidise. This challenge could be add ressed by either: changing the SVB contribution bas e so that is it fairer; or using efficiency gains from the consolidated organisation to subsidise the low contribution base from SVB insured population. Administration cost the BKKs BKK administration costs are currently borne by companies The administration costs of BKKs would need to be shifted to the health insurance carrier and away from companies. However, overall savings in 121 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Challenge Strategy administration th rough merging may counteract this additional administrative burden. Variations Model 1a Model 1a mirrors model 1, with the exception that th e national health insurance carrier for the employe d would be split according to the L\u00e4nder configuration. The branches may either sit under one national umbrella organisation, or operate as independent, autonomous carriers . Under this arrangement, risk - adjustment across the branches would need to be facil itated by one central agency for employed health insurance. It could be argued that d ividing the employed health insurance carrier into regions would strengthen cooperation within current State Health Funds, for example by extending existing coordination activities. Model 1b Unlike model 1a, model 1b would split the national health insurance fund for the employed into four healthcare zones (which incorporate s 32 regions) , as specified by the Austrian Structural Health Plan Strukturplan Gesundheit , West: Tyrol and Voralberg. By splitting carriers by healthcare zones, the planning of social health insurance would align with the Austrian Health Care Structure Plan (\u00d6SG). In addition, dividing insurance according to the configuration of the L\u00e4nder risks increasing hospital utilisation, given the Lands are responsible for the provision of inpatient care (i.e. own, regulate and fund hospitals). Model 1b may also equalise the balance of power between social health insurance and the L\u00e4nder, g iven one significantly large insurance carrier would negotiate with multiple Lands. 122 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Model 1c Model 1c differs from model 1 by jointly allowing the SVA and SVB to operate all three insurance pillars, as opposed to just health. Under the status quo, bo th carriers offer services beyond health insurance, with the SVA providing health and pension, while the SVB offers all three types of insurance. Legal considerations Model 1 and 1a With respect to models 1 and 1a, certain legal challenges occur, how ever, most of these challenges can be addressed with simple legislative acts (i.e. no requirements of a two -third majority). Specifically, due to the self -governance -principle, as it is understood in the case -law by the Constitutional Court, amalgamation of employed and civil servants schemes as well as those for self -employed and farmers is possible if the system of collecting contributions is harmonised and (at least: or) separate groups ('curias') of insured persons are formed within the respective self -governance bodies (for details see below Volume 2, chapter 5 ). Under such a common umbrella institution, the provision of services by physicians and other medical staff and the administration could be organised together. But a s those curias (according to the self -governance - principle) must be authorised to release their own regulations (such as 'Satzungen' or Krankenordnungen') this could be contradictory to the goal of harmonization of risks and benefits. Incorporation of the KFAs, however, would require either corresponding legislation by the regional Parliaments (Landtage) or amendments to Federal Constitution which would be subject to two -third - majorities in both chambers of the Federal Parliament (for details see below Vol ume 2, chapter 5.2.3.). Model 1b From a legal point of view, model 1b would cause constitutional problems (only) with respect to regulations for hospitals. Under the current Constitutional system, the Federal Parliament is authorised only for ruling \"pri nciples\" of hospital law whilst the Regional Parliaments are competent to pass more detailed implementation regulations which are applicable, however, only to the respective Land and therefore not applicable to entities (such as these \"healthcare zones\") c overing several L\u00e4nder. With respect to amalgamation of GKKs and BVA respective SVA and SVB and the incorporation of the KFAs the same applies as explained regarding Model 1. 123 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Model 1c Implementation of model 1c would require harmonisation of benefits (for details see below Volume 2 chapter 5.3), as well as harmonisation of policies regarding collections of contributions between the SVA and SVB. Model 2: Limited amalgamation Descripti on Model 2 would create one national insurance pillar for pension and another pillar for self-employed hea lth insurance. In addition, GKKs and BKK s would amalgamate to form a significantly sized employed health insurance carrier. Unlike model 1, mod el 2 w ould create a new health and accident insura nce carrier for civil servant s, that is, the BVA, VAEB (of which 53% are active civil servants (including dependents) ) and KFAs. Regarding accidents, those not covered by the civil servant carrier would receive i nsurance from AUVA. Lastly, s imilar to model 1, own institutions run by insurance carriers would be managed by one central agency to enhance efficiency and coordination. Figure 51: Structural model 2 124 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Rationale The BVA, VAEB and KFAs would establish a new health and accident insurance carrier given their insurees are a relatively homogenous group . The rationale for this separation is that these carriers may, in the short -run, be more challenging to amalgamate giv en they currently offer extended benefits and greater access to physicians. Given civil servants have fa vourable risk profile s, the BVA, VAEB and KFAs would be required to participate in a risk -adjustment scheme with the employed health insurance carrier. The risk - adjustment scheme would be monitored by a central agency governi ng all relevant health insurance carriers (i.e. all except self -employed). Finally, r elative to the status quo, model 2 would create larger risk pools thus improving efficiency and equity, increase economies of scale, foster knowledge specialisation and promote joint procurement. Challenges Implementing model 2 is associated with challenges outlined under model 1. The added challenge of model 2, is to ensure a robust risk -adjustment mechanism between the employed health insurance, and the civil servants is implemented so that the employed health insurance carrier is not put at a disadvantage. Variations Model 2a Similar to model 1a, under model 2a, employed health insurance (GKKs and BKK s only) would be divided according to the L\u00e4nder. The branches may sit under one umbrella organisation or operate as independent, autonomous carriers. Risk -adjustment between the Lands and between the civil servant carrier would be facilitated by one central agency. Model 2b Unlike model 2a, model 2b would create four branches or independent employed health insurance carriers based on the healthcare zones. Risk-adjustment would be required across the healthcare zones , and between the civil servants and employed health insurance carrier. Model 2c Model 2c would maintain the same arrangements under model 2, however, the sel f-employed health insurance would also cover pension and /or accident insurance. For example, implementation could be step -wise by first offering pension and health (given this falls within current SVA an d SVB remits), and later extended to accident insurance. 125 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Legal considerations Model 2 With respect to Model 2 the same legal issues as those posed by model 1 apply. Amalgamation of schemes for all self -employed is possible as far as the system of collecting contributions are harmonised and ( at least: or) separate groups ('curias' ) of insured persons are formed wit hin the respective self -governance bodies. The problem concerning incorporation of the KFAs remains. Model 2a From a legal point of view the same applies as explained with regards to model 1. Model 2b With respect to Model 2b the same problems with respe ct to regulations for hospitals would have to be faced as already explained regarding model 1b. Model 2c From a legal point of view the same applies as explained with regards to model 1c. Model 3: Health and accident amalgamation Description Model 3 w ould create one national pension insurance carrier, and nine regional insurance carriers offering both health and accident insurance. The nine regional carriers may operate under th e one umbrella organisation as branches , or as independent, autonomous carr iers. Similar to models 1 and 2, owned institutions would be managed and administered by a central agency. 126 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 52: Structural model 3 Rationale As is the case in models 1 and 2, model 3 enlarges the risk pool, enhances joint procurement, and foster s knowledge specialisation . For example, by combining the employed and self -employed, funds will automatically be risk -adjusted given high - and low -risk individuals are pooled into one carrier. Nevertheless, given diff erences across states, a formal risk -adjustment mechanism across the nine health and accident insurance carriers would be required. Challenges Implementing model 3 is associated with challenges outlined under model 1. In addition, there is limited synerg ies, in terms of services, between health and accident given health is increasingly focused on prevention , while accident insurance concerns patients who are already injured and therefore require specific healthcare and rehabilitation. Further, splitting AUVA into regions or healthcare zones may be counterintuitive and unnecessaril y increase administrative costs (i.e. diseconomies of scale). 127 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Variations Model 3a Model 3 a would separate employed health and accident insurance into healthcare zones, which would also require a robust risk -adjustment mechanism. Model 3b Under model 3b, health and accident insurance would be further split according to employment status, that is, by employed and self -employed. Model 3c Model 3c would instead amalgamate pension and accident insurance into one national insurance pillar. This would avoid splitting national insurance into branches based on L\u00e4nder configurations. Health insurance would be provided by one insurance pillar, whi ch would be split according to regions or healthcare zones. Legal considerations Model 3 Amalgamation of health and accident insurance both of employed and self -employed would cause (constitutional) problems with regards of the principle of self -governan ce (different risks, different interests, and different representation of insurees) (for details see below Volume 2 chapter 5.2.2.). Model 3a With respect to Model 3a, the same problems with respect to regulations for hospitals would have to be faced prev iously explained under model 1b. Model 3b and 3c No constitutional problems have to be observed in this respect, but there ar e some actual concerns against 'splitting' of AUVA (see below Volume 2 chapter 10.3). 128 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Model 4: Care coordination Description Model 4 maintains the current social insurance structure , including relevant legal entities, however, two additional changes are made. First, a risk -adjustment system across all carriers offering health insurance would be implemented. Second, the role of current competence centres would be enhanced and renamed as Joint Specialist Centres. A number o f Joint Specialist Centres would be created, each providing a defined set of services designed to improve the efficiency of the overall social health insurance system. A joint Working Group including representative from the HVSV , Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs , and the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, would be given responsibility for institutionalising Joint Specialist Centres by coordinating their development and implementation, and defining the list of 'specialties/themes' within each of the centres. To develop this list, a c omprehensive mapping exercise c ould be undertaken to identify, a) areas of need, and b) complementary tasks/responsibilities, which could be bundled into a Joint Specialist Centre. Once the Working Group have defined a list of specialties/themes and their associated services, individual social health insurance carriers must negotiate among themselve s which carrier will take responsibility for each Joint Specialist Centre. A preliminary list of specialties/themes for Joint Specialists Centre has been outlined below, and could be used as the basis for further discussions within the HVSV : Collection and aud iting of contributions General legal matters Joint p rocurement Business management (e.g. accounting, payments) Performance optimisation Management of contractual partners (increasing bargaining power of the social insurers, and harmonising benefits) Specific healthcare treatment (e.g. dental health centres, rehabilitation facilities) . Under this model, it is necessary to define a proportion of costs (for example, as a proportion of contributions paid) that each carrier must dedicate to their respect ive centre. If this amount is not specified, it is likely that some, if not all, carriers would dedicate very little, thus minimising potential efficiency gains. The dedicated amount of cost co uld also fall within t he remit of the Working Group. 129 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Lastly, to incentivise participation in the scheme, take -up and subsequent participation within Joint Specialist Centres shou ld be independently evaluated within the short -term . If results from the evaluation determine health insurance carriers were unable to deri ve maximum efficiency and coordination benefits associated with model 4, models 1, 2 or 3 could be considered. Alternatively, changes to the law could be introduced, which require carriers to actively participate (e.g. by specifying a minimum proportion of costs to be dedicated to Joint Specialist Centres) . Figure 53: Structural model 4 Rationale The primary rationale for model 4 is the introduction of a comprehensive risk -adjustment mechanism across carriers offering health i nsurance (see section 4.2.7 for the five potential risk -adjustment options 130 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options under this model). As a result, health insurance carriers will have similar financial means and therefore be able to offer their insured populations the same benefits. Further, fostering inter -carrier cooperation can counteract inefficiencies and eliminate unnecessary costs caused by duplication. Several advantages are associated with the proposed Joint Specialist Centres. Most importantly by: Enhancing and providing incentives to promote Joint Specialist Centres fosters an environment where further efficiency gains can be realised Giving responsibility for coordinating the development and implementation of Joint Specialist Centres to a Working Group minimis es duplication within the system, thus improving overall efficiency Assigning social health insurance carriers with responsibility for a specific specialty/theme fo sters specialisation, which again promotes efficiency within the system. Challenges In regard to model 4, a key challenge will be for carriers to allocate responsibility for Joint Specialist Centres, for example, powerful health insurance carri ers may in fact define how all c entres are allocated. As a result, carriers who have b een allocated less desirable Centres may refuse to actively participate. Although not a challenge, one significant disadvantage of model 4, relative to all other models, is the exclusion of the KFAs from the social security system. Legal considerations From a legal point of view, the main legal challenges arising from model 4 regards the proposed risk - adjustment mechanism. According to the case law ruled by the Constitutional Court, a mechanism aiming to com pensate risks between different institutions and groups does not violate constitutional pr inciples as long as there is a ' sufficient personal and material link' between the respective 'Versichertengemein schaften' . A sufficient link in this respect can be assumed the more, the less differences can be identified with regards to contribu tions and benefits (including the framework of contractual partnership law) of the respecti ve scheme. Without a sustainable withdrawal or even elimination of those differences (that could be achieved be simple legislat ion without two -third majorities, though) there is no sufficient link so far between the GKKs and the BVA, nor between GKKs and SVA or between SVA and SVB. A risk adjustment scheme covering all carriers would meet the requirements under Constitutional Law only insofar as structural disadvantages can be proofed in an evidence -based way (and are not caused 131 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options only by regional disparities which are already compensated within national -wide carriers themselves). Otherwise a risk adjustment schemes could be implemen ted only by an amendment to Federal Constitution (i.e. only with a two -third majority). Nevertheless , a risk adjustment (mainly) based on taxes would be possible from a legal point of view (s below 4.2.7. and Volume 2 chapter 8.). As long as participat ion in these Joint Specialist Centres is not compulsory there are no legal impediments at all. Legally binding participation, however, could cause constitutional problems with respect to the principle of self -governance. That would not be the case as far a s legislation is only defining targets and that particular way of cooperation as a means to achieve these targets and as long as the carriers themselves (or their representatives in the respective bodies of the Hauptverband) decide which ones of them shoul d run such a Centre and which ones would merely participate. Risk-adjustment mechanisms Enhanced risk -adjustment is a key motive for restructuring Austria's social security system, given its impact on both efficiency and equity. This section explores risk -adjustment in more detail, including case studies from a range of healthcare systems in E urope. Findings from the analysis have been used to inform policy options aimed at improving current methods of redistributing funds across health insurance carriers. Resource allocation methods There exist numerous financing mechanisms to fund healthcar e systems across Europe, including general taxation, local taxation, compulsory insurance and voluntary insurance. Despite this, all systems have one thing in common, that is, to devolve responsibility of purchasing healthcare to numerous 'health care plan s' (73). In England , for example, over 200 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are responsible for purchasing care, while in social health insurance systems, responsibility lies with various sickness funds (74). Austria, similar to other countries, has multiple healthcare purchasers, including individual social health insurance carriers. However, the country is unique in that responsibil ity for purchasing care is split according to the type of care being provided (i.e. social health insurers purchasing primary care, and outpatient care, including pharmaceuticals, while the L\u00e4nder purchase inpatient care , social care and associated medicin es). Austria also distinguishes itself from other countries in regard to risk -adjustment 132 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options for resource allocation. Specifically, t he current risk -adjustment across carriers is minimal (see section 4.2.6 ), and does not incorporate all carriers within the system. A decision must be made on how to allocate pooled funds to various devolved purchasers in a way that meets health system objectives, namely, efficiency and equity. Allocation of funds can generally be grouped into one of the following three categories: a) full retrospective reimbursement for healthcare expenditure; b) activity -based reimbursement based on a pre -determined fee schedule (e.g. DRGs); and/or c) via a prospective budget based on expected healthcare expenditure (73). Increasingly governments have moved towards prospective budgets, given it lowers risk by fixing their fundi ng commitment (see Table 5 for further details) (73). Table 5: Risk associated with different resource allocation methods Full retrospective reimbursement Activity based reimbursement Prospective budget Pooling agency High risk Medium risk* Low risk Purchaser Low risk Medium risk* High risk Funding commitment Uncertain Uncertain Fixed Note: *Risk for agency in terms of volume, and risk for purchaser in terms of case severity. Methods to redistribute funds Pooling agencies who pay purchasers prospectively must decide on a method by which to allocate funds. As outlined by Rice and Smith (2002), there are four methods of reimbursement, all of which are outlined in Table 6, along with potential implications. Table 6: Methods to set prospective budgets and aligning implications Reimbursement method Implications Size of bids from pur chasers Purchasers have an incentive to inflate bids to receive greater funds. 133 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Reimbursement method Implications Political negotiation Vulnerable to political favouritism, with evidence showing this method is unsustainable in the long -term. Historical precedent This method is often viewed as arbitrary, further it does not encourage efficiency or take into account unmet need. Independent method to measure need Increasingly scientific methods are being used to measure the level of need. Namely in the form of capitated budgets. Source: (73) Scientific methods to measure the level of healthcare need are common acr oss developed healthcare systems, primarily in the form of capitated budgets. Capitated budgets pay purchasers a prospective flat rate fee, to cover specific services for a fixed population, over a defined period (i.e. place a cost on the head of each indi vidual covered, subject to an overall budget constraint) (73). Given healthcar e needs differ significantly across groups, the amount of funds allocated to each purchaser must also differ, that is, pooling agencies must redistribute funds based on relative need (i.e. risk -adjustment) (73). Risk-adjustment factors As stated by Juhnke et al . (2016), the 'basic principle' of risk adjustment is to classify key healthcare risks, and compare the level of risk across different groups in order to forecast future expenditure (75). Despite the existence of various risk -adjustment models across countries, the aforementioned authors were abl e to identify a set of common indicators, which include , for example, age, gender, diagnosis, disease severity, disabilit y status and employment status. It is important to note, that although methods to risk -adjust payments have advanced , their predictive ability is still low. As will be discussed in further detail within this section (international case studies), approximately 20% of the variation in risk -adjustment factors can explain variations in individual healthcare expenditure (76). As a result, risk -adjustment mechanisms lead to systematic under and over paym ents to certain groups in society (76). 134 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Impact of risk -adjust ment on health system objectives Equity and efficiency Pooling, and the subsequent risk -adjusted distribution of funds, plays a key role in achieving health system objectives, namely, equity and efficiency (see figure below ). Specifically, risk -adjustmen t can improve equity considerations by spreading the risk associated with healthcare expenditure across a diverse range of people. This allows equal access to healthcare, regardless of the individual's risk profile (76). Risk - adjustment promotes efficiency by redistributin g funds held by insurance carriers with favoura ble risk profiles, to funds with unfavourable risk profiles. Transfers of funds between carriers fosters a 'level playing field', which can improve overall population health (76). For example, additional funding to carriers with unfavourable risk profiles will reduce the probability of insurees delaying or forgoing treatment , which lead to worse health outcomes and high long -term expenditure (76). Figure 54: Impact of risk -adjust ment on efficiency and equity Source: Largely adapted from (76) Note: Dark grey arrows indicate initial endowment, while light grey arrows represent endowment after risk-adjustment. 135 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Impact of risk pooling type on equity and efficiency21 The ability of risk -adjustment to achieve equity and efficiency objectives, how ever, depends on the type of risk pooling mechanism employed. As outlined by Smith and Witter (2004), risk pooling can be broken down into the following four categories: no risk pooling, unitary risk pooling, fragmented risk pooling and integrated risk poo ling No risk pooling No risk pooling, in which patients are responsible for all healthcare costs, is associated with the highest level of individual uncertainty. In such circumstances, vulnerable groups receive no subsidy and are excluded from treatment if they cannot afford c are. Patients can choose to purchase private health insurance to reduce uncertainty, however, in the absence of community -rated premiums, the elderly and/or sick are likely to be discriminated against and pushed out of the market. Further inefficiencies fr om this model arise from high transaction costs, for example, from collecting and calculating user charges (76). Unitary risk pooling Under unitary risk pooling systems, all funds, whether they be collected through general taxation, social insurance or user charges (for example), are pooled into one central fund. Th e central fund is then responsible for purchasing healthcare to meet the demands of the population. Such a system overcomes many of the equity and efficiency concerns that arise from systems with no risk pooling (76). Notwithstanding comments outlined above, unitary risk pooling is not without its faults. Specifically, there is an incentive for supplier -induced demand (SID), which may lead to differences in benefits packages, thus having a negative impact on equity prin ciples. Further inefficiencies arise from moral hazard whereby patients consume more than is necessary, given the economic barrier of price is removed. Lastly, unitary risk pools remove individual choice which reduces competition, and prevents individuals from accessing benefits they are willing to pay for (76). Fragme nted risk pooling Unitary risk pools, when too large, are associated with managerial control and coordination problems. Therefore, as outlined above, responsibility for purchasing healthcare is usually devolved to numerous 21 This section was largely taken from Smith & Witter (2004). Risk Pooling in Health Ca re Financing: The implications for health system performance . HNP Discussion Paper. September 2004. 136 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options organisations. As a result, frag mented risk pools are created. Risk pools may be designated according to geographical location, employment status, personal characteristics (e.g. health or age), or may be voluntary, as is the case in competitive insurance markets. Variations will therefor e exist across risk pools, however, is inversely related to the size of the risk pool. That is, a system with a large number of small risk pools is associated with high variations in spending compared to a small number of large risk pools (76). Variation in expenditure across risk pools can negatively impact both eff iciency and equity if not corrected for. For example, in competitive insurance markets, differences in risk will result in higher premiums for groups with a higher proportion of sick/elderly (76). Integrated risk pooling As outlined above, pure fragmentation can lead to significant differences across groups, which ne gatively impact efficiency and equity. In response, many systems now enforce financial transfers between risk pools to reduce or eliminate high levels of variation (76). Two operational models for integrated risk pooling exist. First, a central agency can collect and redistribute pooled funds to risk pools based on expected healthcare expenditure. Or second, risk pools continue to collect revenues, who are then responsible for redistributing funds from low to high risk pools (76). In regard to equity considerations, this type of pooling may allow risk pools with high levels of employment and a low number of non -earning depende nts to charge relatively lower premiums. If rejected on equity grounds, another transfer will be required to take into account differences in the revenue base of risk pools (76). Table 7: Types of risk pooling Type Magnitude of uncertainty Impact on efficiency Impact on equity No risk pooling Very high Cream skimming Transaction costs Discriminates vulnerable groups Fragmented risk pooling High Competitive market breaks down without corrective action Competitive systems can lead to variations in premiums 137 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Type Magnitude of uncertainty Impact on efficiency Impact on equity Integrated risk pooling Medium Second set of transfers needed to account for differences in revenue base Differences in premiums across risk pools Unitary risk pooling Low Supplier induced demand Moral hazard Reduced competition Denying benefits that patients are WTP for Difficult to control and coordinate Distributes funds form healthy/wealthy to the poor/sick Differences in benefits packages Source: (76) A move from no risk pooling to unitary risk pooling is ass ociated with gains in equity. However, gains in equity must be traded against efficiency losses (see figure below). For example, unitary risk pooling can redistribute funds from the sick/poor to the healthy/wealthy, however, such systems are associated wit h supplier -induced demand, moral hazard and problems with managerial efficiency. Ultimately, however, the optimal size of the population is dependent on country -specific circumstances and preferences (76). 138 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 55: Trade -off between equity and efficiency in risk pooled systems Source: Taken directly from (76) International case studies: Ri sk-adjustment Risk-adjusted capitated budgets come in many forms across healthcare systems, however, they can largely be separated into two categories: territorial and non -territorial. In general, the former relates to instances where national funds are d istributed to geographically defined purchasers of care, while the latter, concerns redistribution of pooled funds to various insurance agencies (either in competitive or non - competitive market s) (see Table 8).

Territorial risk -adjustment England Resource allocation methods have existed in England since the 1970s in order to address disparities in funding and healthcare needs across regions (77). Starting from 200 2, as a way to reduce avoidable health inequalities, a deprivation adjustment was included in a risk -adjusted formula which determined the level of funding each Primary Care Trust (up until 2013, responsible for purchasing a range of healthcare services) r eceived (i.e. poorer areas received larger budgets). Primary Care Trusts were later replaced by Clinical Commissioning Groups, who received risk -adjusted capitated payments (77). The structure of England's healthcare services changed significantly under the Health and Social Care Act . The Act, which was introduced in 2012, aimed to separate the government from the day -to-day running of the NHS (78). Specifically, under new arrangements, the Department of Health transfers a lump sum of money (approximately \u00a395 billion a year) to NHS England, an arm's length body that is held to account through annual mandates with the Secretary of State (78). NHS England de volves responsibility for purchasing secondary and community care healthcare services to over 200 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) across the country (see Figure 56 for further details). Given CCGs work at the community -level and are led by healthcare professionals (namely GPs), they are seen to be in a strong position to purchase healthcare that meets the needs of their designated population (79). 140 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 56: Clinical Commissionin g Groups (England) Purpose and coverage CCGs are responsible for purchasing healthcare services such as mental health, urgent and emergency care, elective hospital services and community care. Each CCG covers between 100,000 to 900,000 people, with an av erage of 250,000. Coverage is based on GP practice lists. Leadership CCGs are led by an elected body of GPs, and other clinicians such as nurses and lay members of the community. Funding Receive risk -adjusted capitated budgets from NHS England. Funding for CCGs comprises two -thirds of the NHS budget. Budgets are set for five years, the first three of which are firm, and two which are indicative. Number There exist 207 CCGs as of 2017. Source: (2) 141 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 57: Paying and purchasing healthcare in England Source: Author's own creation The latest funding allocation to CCGs was determined by the NHS England Board in December 2015 (2016 - 2021). Allocations made to each CCG are based on advice from an independent, expert technical committee (i.e. Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation , ACRA ), which comprises GPs, academics, NHS managers and public health experts (80). Once a national budget for healthcare has been determined, the following four steps are taken to calculate the amount of funds received by each CCG: 1. Determine the target allocation for a CCG based on need and unavoidable cost (explained further under 'factors') 2. Establish a baseline, which amounts to the previous year's alloca tion in addition to any adjustment payments 3. Calculate the difference between target and baseline figure 4. Determine how far each CCG has moved from their target allocation (point 1 above ) each year (i.e. pace of change policy). 142 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Target allocations (point 1 above) for each CCG are determined through a weighted capitation formula which is based several factors, as outlined in Table 9. Table 9: Weighted capitation factors for England's CCGs Risk -adjustment factor Description Size Takes into account the number of individuals within the GP practi ce list (projections are made for future numbers). Age and gender Takes into account age and gender to reflect that young and old have different health needs, as do men and women. Factors 'over and above' those relating to age and gender Additional adjustment to take into account relative need that goes beyond age and gender. Unmet need and health inequalities Assesses need on current NHS services, however, this omits unmet need. Therefore, there is an additional payment based on population health (standardised mortality rate for those aged 75 years and under). Location Market Forces Factor to take into account that the provision of healthcare services is more expensive in certain areas (e.g. London). Also an additional payment for providing emer gency ambulance services in sparsely populated areas, and operating A&E departments in remote hospitals.

An overview of each of these models, including proportion of insurance funds that are risk -adjusted, respo nsible agency, and the type of risk -pooling is provided in Table 10. Further details on each of these models is provided thereafter. 144 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 10: Overview of non -territorial risk -adjustment mechanisms in European social health insurance systems Country Factors Proportion of insurance funds risk - adjusted Responsible agency Premium rate restrictions Type of risk pooling Belgium Gender, age, unemployment, mortality, invalidity, urbanisation, income, and dependent persons 30% National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance Yes Integrated Germany Morbidity, age and gender 100% of contributions Federal Insurance Authority Yes Integrated Netherlands Age, gender, income, region, drug consumption, socioeconomic status, mental care, and previous medical costs 50% of payments made to health insurers National Healthcare Institute Yes Integrated Switzerland Age, gender, prior hospitalisations and pharmaceutic al expenditure 100% outpatient, 50% inpatient Common Institution Yes Integrated Austria Age, gender, and high - cost medical expenses 1.64% of income from contribution (GKKs only )* Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions Yes Mixed of fragmented and integrated (GKKs) Source: See descriptions below. Note: *Main source of risk -adjustment within the system , other compensatory mechanisms also exist . 145 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Belgium Risk-adjustment was introduced into the Belgium healthcare system in 1995, prior to this, all sickness funds were fully reimbursed for their costs (81). Since 1995, sickness funds have been financially responsible for 25% of any discrepancy between actual spending and budget allocations, of which 30% is determined according to a risk -adjusted allocation (82).22 Similar to the Netherlands, Belgium has an external subsidy risk -adjustment system. Under this syste m, the insured population pay a small flat -rate premium directly to their desired insurer, as well as an income - dependent contribution. Unlike the flat -rate premium, income -dependent contributions are pooled by the National Institute for Health and Disabil ity Insurance (INAMI -RIZIV) (hereafter, Central Fund), which is a government agency responsible for organising and managing healthcare insurance (83). Monies within the Central Fund are redistributed to sickness funds, and can be separated into two groups. The first type of payment is a normative, risk -adjusted payment, while the second payment is a retrospective payment based on actual ex penditure (84). The weight allocated to the risk -adjusted payment was originally set at 10%, with plans to increase its value to 40% . Factors included within Belgium's risk -adjustment model for both the employed and self -employed are outlined in the table below.

Estimation results using the risk -adjustment model since 2008 found that 40% of the variation in expenditure can be at tributed to variations in the risk -adjustment factors used in the model. Germany Risk-adjustment was introduced into the German social health insurance system in 1994, which adjusted payments to sickness funds based on age, gender, and invalidity pensio n status (in total, there were 670 mutually exclusive 'risk' cells) (86,87) . Three main reasons were cited for the introduction of a risk - adjustment scheme, which are: a) to ensure fair competition among si ckness funds by equalising risk structures; b) to equalise price differences across sickness funds; and c) to avoid risk -selection and adverse selection (88). The original 1994 risk -adjustment scheme did not succeed as it was not able to compensate all sickness funds, given the high proportion of healthy, affluent people switching funds (87). The latest risk - adjustment scheme was introduced in 2009 under the Act to Strengthen Competition in Social Health Insurance (GKV -Wettbewerbst\u00e4rkungsgesetz) ( 2007) (87,89) . Specific ally, the Act introduced the Gesundheitsfonds, hereafter, the Central Health Fund (CHF), which redistributes insurance contributions based on the sickness fund's risk profile. The CHF is administered by Germany's Federal Insurance Authority (Bundesversiche rungsamt) (87,89) . A major element of the Act to Strengthen Competition in Social Health Insurance was the change in how contribution rates are set. Specifically, the Act set, in law, a standard contribution rate (Social Code Book for Statutory Health Insurance), which is curr ently 14.6% of an individual's gross income (split evenly 147 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options between employers and employees) (90). Previously, sickness funds were able to set their own contribution rate (91). Sickness funds are responsible for collecting contributions, however, these payments are immediately transferred to the CHF (i.e. same -day transaction) (89). The CHF redistributes employer/employee contributions to the sickness funds according to a morbidity -based risk adjustment scheme (morbidit\u00e4tsorientierter Risikostrukturausgleich (Morbi -RSA)) (see section below for further detail). If the funds provided by the CHF are not sufficient to cover the sickness fund's expenses, funds must charge an additional flat -rate, community rated premium (i.e. a premium that is the same for all those insured, regardless of risk profile). Conversely, sic kness funds can use excess handouts from the CHF to refund the insured, however, they are not legally obliged to do so (87,92) . These supplementary premiums are collected directly by the sickness funds, and are thus associated with high administrative costs/effort (92). In addition to contributions, the CHF receive payments from federal and state government taxes, specifically, 1.8% of taxes, and a liquidity reserve (89). However, these two payments are minor compared to contributions (92).23 An overview of the German health insurance system is provided in Figure 58. Figure 58: Overview of funding within the Germany Health Insurance System Source: Adapted from (87) 23 Tax subsidies and the liquidity reserves comprised approximately 12.7% of payments into the CHF as of 2011. 148 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The payment sickness funds receive from the CHF can be broken down into four groups, which are outlined in Table 12. Table 12: Breakdown of CHF payments to sickness funds (Germany) Coverage Risk -adjustment Proportion of CHF payment Standard benefits package Yes 92% Administration costs Half of the payment is risk - adjusted (the other half is made per capita) 5.2% Voluntary benefit package No (flat-rate payment per capita) Not specified Incentive payment to participate in disease management programmes (DMPs)* No (flat rate payment - approx. 150\u20ac) Not specified Source: (87) Note: There exist DMPs for diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, obstructive pulmonary diseases, breast cancer. DMPs are expected to improve the quality of healthcare received by the individual. The CHF redistributes contributions based socio -demographic (i.e. age, gender, and invalidity of pensions) and morbidity -based criteria (Morbi -RSA) (91). To assist in developing an appropriate risk -adjustment, the government appointed a Scientific Advisory Board to assist in determining which 80 'severe' or 'costly and chronic' diseases should be included in risk -adjustment calculations (87,89,91,92) . A disease was considered eligible if the diagnosis exceeded the average per capita expenditure of all insured by at least 50% (the top 80 most expensive diseases were included in the risk -adjustment calculation) (87). Buchner et al . (2013) undertook a study which calculated the ability of Germany's risk -adjustment mechanism to predict expenditure by sickness funds. At the individual level, the authors conclude that the risk -adjustment scheme, introduced in 2009, had a predictive accuracy of approximately 20%. That is, 20% of the variation in factors used to risk -adjust payments (e.g. age, gender and morbidity) can explain 149 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options variations in individual level expenditure (93).24 Specific figure s on the performance of Germany's risk - adjustment model have been provided in the table below. The figures have been taken directly from Buchner et al. (2013). Table 13: Performance of Germany's risk -adjustment model R2 (%) CPM ( %) MAPE (\u20ac) Model, including sick pay 19.6 21.5 1,953 Model, excluding sick pay 20.2 22.5 1,817 Source: (87) At the group level, the predictive power of the risk -adjustment mechanism is calculated using the ratio of the sum of CHF payments and the sum of expenditures for a g roup of insured people. An analysis of this ratio by the author's revealed that the scheme leads to systematic underpayments to those in higher age groups, with multiple chronic conditions, and/or living in urban areas (87). Given the risk -adjustment mechanism is not able to fully adjusted for differences in expenditure, a number of sickness funds have charged a supplementary premium, merged with other sickness funds or closed (92). Netherlands In 2006, the Dutch Government implemented the Health Insurance Act (Zorgverzekeringswet) which introduced regulated, privately managed health insurers in place of sickness insurance funds. Under new healthcare arrangements, a proportion of fund s received b y health insurers is risk -adjusted, to remove incentives for risk -selection (94,95) . 24 The new model had a CPM (Cumming's Prediction Measure) of approx. 22% (closer to 100% indicates a better fit). The CPM is the proportion of the sum of absolute deviations from the mean in individual costs that is explained by the risk model. 150 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Health insurers in the Netherlands receive their funds from three forms of payments. The first payment is a flat rate premium for those aged 18 years and over (6.65% and paid by emp loyers in a central fund ), the second is a contribution from the State to compensate for those aged under 18 years, and the third, is a community -rated premium paid directly by the individual (94,95) . Contributions from employers, the self -employed ad state contributions for a ged under 18 are pooled directly into the Health Insurance Fund (Zorgverzekeringsfonds).25 The Health Insurance Fund is administered by the National Healthcare Institute (Zorginstituut Nederland - ZiNL), which is responsible for the quality, accessibility a nd affordability of healthcare in the Netherlands (96) (see Figure 59 for an overview of the SHI payment system in the Netherlands). Figure 59: Overview of payment system to private health insurers (Netherlands)26 Source: Adapted from (94) Contributions, which are determined by the governmen t, are set at a level so that approximately 50% of all funds received by health insurers are risk -adjusted, with the community -rated premium accounting for the remaining 50% (94,95) . 25 For the employed, employers are responsible for pooling funds into the Health Insurance Fund, for the self - employed it is the responsibility of the Tax and Customs Authority (Source: feedback from P. Jeurissen, 2017). 26 The two -way arrow between the Health Insurance Fund and private insurers states that enrolees with very favourable health profiles will have lower expected costs than 50% of the nominal pre mium. Insurers who only enrol such people will have to refund part of their nominal premium to the Health Insurance Fund as a way to avoid cream skimming. However, this does not happen in practice (Source: feedback from P. Jeurissen, 2017). 151 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options As of 2017, all risk -adjustment payments are ex -ante, and are set prior to the calendar year. This provides insurers with an incentive to fund services within its financial means (i.e. community -rated premiums and risk-adjusted payments). The ex -ante contribution from the Health Insurance Fund is based on health expenditure of the insured based on their risk profile, less the estimated income from a calculation premium (not the same as the community -rated premium, as this would incentivise insures to lower premiums) and the mandatory deductible (set at \u20ac385 per annum). The factors used to estimate expenditure costs are outlined in the section below (94,95) . Up until 1st January 2017, a second retrospective payment to health insurers was made to account for non-observable changes in the risk profile of insured population (95). The payment was introduced as a way to reduce risk -selection in the case of a suboptimal risk adjustment system, however, it was gradually phased out to further encourage efficiency among insurers (94). Risk-adjustment factors used within the Dutch system can be grouped into eight groups, all of which are outlined in Table 14. Table 14: Risk -adjustment factors in the Netherlands Risk -adjustment factor Description Age and gender Those of older age have higher healthcare expenditures, as do women of birth -rearing age (20-40). Income Nature of income such as whether the individual receives social security payments, is salaried or is self-employed. Region Higher compensation is provided to those living in regions with a high proportion of non-western immigrants, above -average risk of mortality and low income. 152 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Risk -adjustment factor Description Consumption of pharmaceuticals Patients who use drugs for chronic diseases in an outpatient setting are considered to be at higher risk of excessive healthcare expenditure. Chronic conditions Chronic conditions, treated at the inpatient level, are divided into 13 categories. Individuals with one or more of these conditions receive greater compensation. Includes expensive DRGs, and excludes pharmaceuticals. Socioeconomic status Socio-economic status of individuals. Mental care Those living in a one -person household are considered at great risk of mental health issues, and require greater compensation. Other Use of medical aids, and high medical costs in previous years. Drawing upon a range of previous research, van de Ven et al. (2015) estimated the incentive for risk selection within the Dutch health insurance market. This was measured through the extent to which the current risk -adjustment mechanism over - or under -comp ensated insurers for specific groups 'for which no explicit risk -adjusters' existed (93). Results from their analysis show that insurers are systematically over (under) paid for groups with favourable (unfavourable) risk profiles. As an example, for 18.9% of the study population who reported the worst score f or health,27 the insurer was undercompensated o n average by \u20ac670 per person, each year. Conversely, for 68.5% of the study population who recorded no chronic condition, the insurer was overcompensated \u20ac152 per person, per year (93). A selection of exact results taken directly from van de Ven et al. (2015) are provided in the table below. 27 Based on th e SF-12 Health Survey (97) 153 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 15: Average under or overcompensation per person and year within the Dutch health insurance market Selected groups (poor or good health) Under (over) compensation (per person and year) Predictive ratio* Reduction in under (over) compensation due to risk - equalisation Worst score for physical health (poor) -\u20ac670 0.85 -75% At least one chronic condition (poor) -\u20ac331 0.90 -80% No chronic condition (good) +\u20ac152 1.16 -66% level (good) +\u20ac142 1.10 -61% Source: (93) Note: *Predictive ratio is calculated by dividing average predicted expenses over average actual expenditures. Thus, a predictive ratio less (greater) than 1 indicates under (over) compensation. Switzerland In general, Mandatory Health Insurance (MHI) premiums differentiate between cantons and are comm unity -rated. Nevertheless, the old and sick have higher premiums when compared to the young and healthy. Hence, risk adjustment is needed in Switzerland to avoid the risk selection of the individuals by MHI companies. Switzerland introduced risk-adjustment into its social health insurance system in 1993, with minor alterations made to the model in 2011 (98). Until the end of 2011, the risk -adjustment formula only considered age and gender. There were 15 different age groups and two gender categories resulted in 30 age and gender categories. The financial flows from the Common Institution to MHI companies do ensure that per insured person, within one of those categorie s, the available resources are the same across MHI 154 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options companies within the same canton. Unlike in the Netherlands and Germany, the risk -adjustment model in Switzerland is 'internal' in that it is not subsidised by additional government funds (98). MHI companies in Switzerland collect the majority of their funds through community -rated premiums (i.e. premiums are the same within each MHI company, within a particular canton28 or sub -region) (99). MHI companies that have favourable risk profiles (e.g. younger and/or wealthier) are required to transfer funds into a pool of funds, which is administered by the Common Institution (a foundation that that is predominantly financed by MHI companies, and to a lesser extent, the federal government) (99). Funds within the Common Institute are then distributed to MHI companies based on a range of risk - adjustment factors (see section below). As can be seen in the graph below, the formula was revised in 2012 and took prior hospitalisation (depending on how many nights were spent consequently after each other either in a hospital or nursing home on the past year) into account. Through the amendment in the risk-adjustment formula, the gross redistribution amount increased significantly. Nevertheless, the net redistribution across MHI companies has not increased, as red istribution takes place mostly within the individual companies. Redistribution within companies is common as each insurance company has both high and low risks during the same period of time. Hence, internal risk -adjustment is required. Based on the calcul ation of premiums, the improved risk -adjustment formula will consequently lead to lower premiums in the insurance plans of high risk groups. The future of the risk -adjustment scheme will lead to changes in the formula and taking other factors into account (see section on 'Factors' below). The factors used within Switzerland's risk -adjustment model have changed since its inception in 1993. Today, factors include age (since 1993), gender (since 1993), prior hospitalisations (i.e. more than three nights in a r ow in an acute hospital or nursing home within the year) (since 2012), and pharmaceutical expenditures exceeding 5 ,000 Swiss Francs (as of 2017) (99). Further risk -adjustment factors can be included by the Federal Council, the senior executive body of the federal government (99). The figure below outlines trends in the gross redistribution of funds within Switzerland's risk adjustment mechanism, including the source of the redistribution. It is evident from the data that the majority of redistributed funds stem from differences in gender. 28 There are 26 cantons in Switzerland, each with their own constitution, legislature, government and courts. 155 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 60: Swiss risk -adjustment trends and redistributions (2007 -2012) Source: (99) Risk-adjustment mechanisms in Austria In 1961, Aus tria introduced a Risk Equalisation Fund (REF), which has a primary purpose of compensating for structural differences among regional health insurance carriers (that is, differences in contribution income, insured persons, and region). Participation of soc ial insurance carriers in the REF has changed over time with insurance carriers joining and leaving between its inception until now, where only GKKs participate (see Table 16). Table 16: Participation of insurance carriers in the Risk Equalisation Fund Period Insurance carriers participating in REF Before 2000 GKK, VA Bergbau and SVA current GKK 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.55.35.6 5.8 6.0 6.1 6.15.1 6.67.07.3 7.5 7.612.7 02468101214 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Swiss Franc, millions Age (Swiss Franc, million) Gender (Swiss Franc, million) Previous hospital stays (Swiss Franc, million)156 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Sources of funding The majority of funds for the REF stem from contributions collected by GKKs.

The equalisation of structural differences 2. The balancing of the liquidity 3. The covering in case of a special need for compensation . Each of the above three criteria are assigned a weighting to reflect their relative importance. As of 2015, structural differences were weighted at 57%, and liquidity and special needs compensation at 33% and 10%, respectively. A vi sual description of the allocation of funds based on the above criteria is provided in Figure 61. 157 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 61: Pooling and All ocation of the Financial Resources of the Risk Equalisation Fund, Contrast EY illustration, based on data from HVSV. Factors In 2006, a scientific structural model was introduced to predict healthcare expenditure across GKK insurance carriers. The struc tural parameters chosen for inclusion are age, gender and cost -intensity of the insured persons. Data for these parameters are sourced from the Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions, who are responsible for calculating the structural eq ualisation model. Further details on the REF can be found in Volume 2 of this report (Situational Analysis report). Additional risk -adjustment mechanisms The Risk Equalisation Fund plays the most significant role in redistributing funds across health i nsurance carriers. However, a range of other compensatory mechanisms also exist and have been outlined in Table 18 below. Comparison with other European risk -adjustment models Unlike other European social health insurance systems reviewed within this section, Austria does not have a competitive social i nsurance market. This, however, does not mean risk -equalisation is not necessary. Specifically, risk -adjustment is required given: Regional differences: income from contributions differs between the L\u00e4nder due to differences in each region's labour market, as a result , income from contributions differs across regional carriers (i.e. GKKS) 158 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Demographic differences: dissimilar ratios between working persons versus pensioners, or differences in the age of insurance -entitled persons Structural differences: structural changes regarding the professions of the insured (for example the number of employed persons is growing, whereas the number of farmers is diminis hing). It is evident from a review of international systems that all countries take a different approach to risk - adjustment. Despite this, there are two areas whe re Austria differs significantly from all other countries. First , the Risk Equalisation Fund, which is the primary risk -adjustment scheme in the system, is made up of just 1.64% of GKK contributions, in other countries such as Germany and Switzerland (for outpatient care), all monies received by insurers are risk -adjusted, while in the Netherla nds this figure is 50%. Second , Austria is unique in that not all insurers participate in risk -adjustment, with only the GKKs participating in the Risk Equalisation F und.

This does not mean that carriers with favourable risk -profiles wholly 'lose out', given they too will receive funds, rather their allocation per insuree will be relatively lower than sicker/older insurees. Required r isk-adjustment within Austria's social insurance syst em depends on the structure of insurance carriers. A summary of risk -adjustment requirements under the proposed structural models has been included in Table 19. Table 19: Proposed structural models and aligning risk -adjustment requirement Proposed structural model Risk -adjustment requirement Model 1* National insurance car riers for accident, pension and health (split into employed and self -employed) Natural risk -adjustment caused by significantly large risk pools . Model 2 * As model 1, except removal of civil servants from employed health and accident insurance Natural risk-adjustment for pension, accident and self-employed health insura nce; formal risk- adjustment required between civil servants and employed health insurance required. Model 3 * National pension insurance and one national health and accident insurance pi llar Natural risk -adjustment caused by significantly large risk pools . Model 4 Existing structure with greater risk -adjustment across carriers, in addition to enhance Joint Specialist Cent res Greater levels of risk -adjustment with the exact risk-adjust ment mechanism and size to be specified. Note: *For variations of these models involving regional or healthcare zone branches, risk -adjustment across regions/zones would be required. 162 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Given the current structure is maintained, tha t is, model 4 is implemented, comprehensive risk - adjustment mechanism is required. This section describe s five policy options which could be adapted to the structural model developed under model 4 to improve both efficiency and equity. The options are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and in certain cases , could be implemented in unison . Figure 62: Proposed risk -adjustment policy options Note: RA3 is broken down into RA3(a) and RA3(b) to reflect marginal differences in the sources of revenue pooled for risk -adjustment. Risk -adjustment option 1 (RA1) Description An analysis of the breakdown of revenue for social health insurance carriers in Austria reveals the minor role risk -adjustment plays in the current system. Speci fically, just 1.7% of health insurance revenue stems from the Risk Equalisation Fund (\u00a7 447a), compared to 82.7% and 10% from contributions and VAT compensation (GSBG) , respectively (100) . Following on from international experience , RA1 proposes an expansion and extension of risk -adjustment, specifically by: Pooling all revenues into a central fund (operated by the HVSV ) which are then redistributed according to a range of risk -adjustment factors Extending risk -adjustment across all health insurance carriers, not only GKKs . 163 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Out of all the pro posed options, RA1 is the most comprehensive and is therefore associated with significant efficiency and equity gains. Due to possible constitutional constraints, the possibility of implementing this option is uncertain, therefore other proposed opti ons should also be considered. For the above reason, consideration could be given to implementing RA1 in a step -wise approach. That is, first introducing partial risk -adjustment, with incremental increases in the proportion of funds risk - adjusted over time. Legal considerations According to the case law by the Constitutional Court, a mechanism aiming to com pensate risks between different institutions and groups would not violate constitutional principles given there is a 'sufficient personal and material link' bet ween the respectiv e health insurance carrier populations ('Versicherten gemeinschaften'). The link will be more sufficient smaller the differences identified with regards to contribu tions and benefits (including the framework of contractual partnership law) of the respecti ve scheme. Without a sustainable withdrawal or even elimination of those differences (that could be achieved b y simple legislation without a two -thirds majority ) there is no sufficient link between the GKKs and the BVA, the GKKs and SVA, nor between SVA and SVB. RA 1 would meet the requirements under Consti tutional Law only insofar as structu ral disadvantages can be proved in an evidence -based way (and are not caused only by regional disparities which are already compensated within national -wide carriers themselves). Otherwise a risk adjustment scheme could be implemented only by an amendment to Federal Constitution (i.e. only with a two -third majority). Nevertheless a risk adjustment (mainly) based on taxes would be possible from a legal point of view (for details see below Volume 2, chapter 8.). Risk -adjustment option 2 (RA2) Description RA2 proposes a reduction in the employee contribution rate across all health insurance carriers. The reduction in the contribution rate would be matched by an equival ent increase in an earmarked levy , which would be channeled into a central fund managed by the HVSV . The HVSV would then be responsible for distributing pooled funds to health insu rance carriers based on a set of pre-defined risk -adjustment factors. 164 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The exact reduction in contributions is not defined in this report, rather it should be discussed and debated by government stakeholders . It is suggested that changes to the contri bution base are not drastic, given the level of tax is outside the control of insurance carriers. Specifically, under RA2, insuranc e carriers will be required to give -up control over a proportion of their revenue, with this proportion now being subject to political negotiation . If implemented, the current Risk Equalisation Fund would be abolished, given earmarked levy funds are expec ted to be sufficient to equalise risk. Legal considerations It has previously been mentioned that a system for compensating different structural risks based on taxes would meet the requirements under constitutional law. These taxes should be collected by the HVSV on behalf of the 'Bund ' (or directly by a Federal au thority) and should be explicitly declared as 'tax', so revenue collected from these taxes may be used for a specific purpose to the benefit of health insurance. Risk -adjustment option 3 (RA3) Description RA3 proposes amalgamating funds fro m existing risk -equalisation schemes to be pooled into a central fund managed by the HVSV . The figure below outlines identified sources of revenue which could be used for risk -adjustment purposes. The sources of revenu e are broken down by 'current sources of risk equalisation' and 'new potential sources of risk equalisation'. Out of all proposed options, RA3 is the most feasible in the short -term given it does not require any constitutional changes, or amend ments to the contribution base. As outlined in the table below, RA3 can be br oken down into two sub -options: RA3(a) includes all current and new sources of risk equalisation, including the Hebes\u00e4tze, while in RA3(b), the He bes\u00e4tze would be excluded. 165 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 20: Sources of revenue for risk -adjustment option 3 Source of revenue Amount Current sources of risk equalization Equalisation fund for regional health insurance (\u00a7 447a) Total budget of \u20ac311 million in 2016 Equalisation fund for the burden of REGO (\u00a7 322b ASVG) Total amount (as of 2015) was \u20ac6 million Fund for dental health (\u00a7 447i ASVG Flat rate payment of \u20ac80 million Health promotion fund (\u00a7447g) Total budget of \u20ac13 million in 2016 Fund for preventative check -ups and health promotion (\u00a7447h) Total budget of \u20ac3.5 million in 2016 Fund for offsetting burden due to 15a agreement (\u00a7322a ASVG) Total amount (as of 2015) was \u20ac132 million Special lump sum payment accident insurance - social health insurance (\u00a7319a ASVG) Equated to \u20ac173.96 million in 2016 Special lump sum payment social health insurance - accident insurance ( \u00a7149ASVG) Equated to \u20ac49.64 million in 2015 New potential sourc es of risk equalisation VAT from Ministry of Finance (currently refunded straight to insurance carriers) In 2015, equated to \u20ac454 million (continue to increase with higher levels of expenditure) Pharmaceutical claw -back (currently refunded straight to individual health insurance carriers) in 2016 amounted to \u20ac122 million in (increase to \u20ac160 million in 2017 , with additional increases expected in future years ) 166 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Source of revenue Amount Between 2012 and 2016, the government contribution rate (i.e. employer) for civil servants was reduced by 0.3%. This policy could be adopted once again with additional funds used for risk - adjustment Given the reduction in the employer's contribution (i.e. the Government) is decreased by 0.3 percentage points, savings of \u20ac60 million annually could be redirected for risk -adjustment purposes. Option RA3( a) only: Hebes\u00e4tze* - pension insurance is obliged to pay the Hebes\u00e4tze to health insurance (5.1% rate multiplied by the Hebes\u00e4tze, which differs cross funds ). Given pension insurance is funded to a considerable extent by go vernment , the Hebes\u00e4tze are indirectly funded through tax money and can therefore be used for risk - adjustment purposes. In 2015, the PVA (GKK), VAEB, SVA and SVB paid \u20ac1.6 billion as *. TOTAL FUNDS FOR RISK -ADJUSTMENT RA3(a): \u20ac3 billion annually RA3(b): \u20ac1.4 billion annually Note: *There is no Hebes\u00e4tze for retired civil servants as their pensions are paid directly by former employers and are financed directly out of the federal budget. Legal considerations There are no legal impediments to implementing RA3. Risk -adjustmen t option 4 (RA4) Description In Austria, hospitals are largely financed through the nine State Health Funds, who are in turn funded by social insurance (46%) , provinces (32%), federal states (12%) and municipalities (11%): 167 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The Federal Government through the Federal Health Agency (i.e. general taxes) Regional VAT allocation from the L\u00e4nder (i.e. 0.95%) Share of VAT from municipalities according to the fiscal equalisation law (FAG) Respective Land GSBG -funds (Health and Soc ial Sector Contribution Act) Social insurance via the Federal Health Agency (\u00a7447f ASVG) (101) .29 Despite contributing to j ust u nder half of total hospital budgets, social insurance carriers are not entitled to participate in decision -making processes regarding healthcare within a hospital setting. Under RA4, social insurance carriers would subsume joint responsibility for funding and operating outpatient centres in hospital set tings, which currently fall under the responsibility State Health Funds. At present, the proportion of total State Health Funds dedicated to outpatient centers is approximately \u20ac661.5 million per year .30 Howe ver, these figures are based on historical negotiations and therefore do not represent the actual costs associated with providing outpatient care. For example, in 2015, actual expenditure on outpatient departments within hospitals equated to \u20ac2.015 billion.31 Under RA4, s ocial insurance, provinces, states and municipalities would con tinue to divert resources into State Health Funds. Once co llected at the regional level, State Health Funds would be required to allocate approximately 15% of total funds to the HVSV (approximate amount of funds s pent on outpatient hospital departments) . Funds pooled within a joint fund will be redistributed to health insurance carriers based on several risk-adjustme nt factors. Carriers will spen d funds on improving primary care and outpatient departments within hospitals, thus reducing the number of hospitalisations. For example, by developing multi -professional networks within an outpatient setting. Funding will be spent collectively, therefore RA4 requires resources to be pooled under a joint fund and allocated based on need (e.g. indirect risk -adjustment). Although demand for 29 The Federal Government is included in the list, but not in the p ercentages above, given it is captured in figures from the L\u00e4nder and municipalities (i.e. Federal Government is responsible for collecting taxes on behalf of the L\u00e4nder and municipalities). 30 No data was provided for Burgenland. Therefore, based on popul ation size, the figure was derived by multiplying the Voralberg figure of \u20ac44.7 million by 0.8, which equated \u20ac35.8 million. 31 Please note that this figure may be an underestimate of the real costs given data for Burgenland was not available, further Styr ia does not explicitly state this figure, therefore only costs that were clearly defined as be redistributed to outpatient departments was included. 168 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options inpatient care may decline, in the short -run (i.e. transition period) , funding for hospi tals should cover fixed costs, such as building maintenance and employee wages. In addition to improving efficiency and equity , RA4 has the added benefit of aligning outpatient services, which are currently offer ed in both hospitals and outpatient specia list clinics. Legal considerations Even though no constitutional obstacles can be identified regarding this option, it has to be considered that a number of amendments would be required. Amendments to ASVG and other social insurance laws may be adopted b y the Federal Parliament (with a simple majority) but require amendments to several treaties between the Federal State and the L\u00e4nder, according to Art icle 15a of the Fede ral Constitution including the 'Finanzausgleich' (Fiscal Equalisation L aw). Risk -adjustment option 5 (RA5) Description GPs in Austria are reimbursed through a mix of fee -for-serv ice (30%) and contact capitation (70%) , where GPs receive the one flat rate payment for each individual patient within a quarter (i.e. three months) . Under RA5, a proportion of health insurance contributions would be pooled into a central fund, managed by the HVSV , with funds being used to pay G Ps on a risk -adjusted capitated basis (i.e. all GP income would be risk -adjusted and provided in the form of a c apitated payment). For this system to work, patients must be registered with a single GP for one year (as opposed to three months, which is the current arrangement), with the possibility of switching GPs every six months if unsatisfied. To encourag e patien ts to register with the one GP, financial incentives could be introduced. For example, a s is the case in France, reducing user charges for patients who visit the 'preferred GP' (i.e. the GP they are registered with) (see section 5.3 for further details on the French system). The requirement for patients to be registered with one GP for a year represents a significant cultural shift, given the high -value placed on freedom of choice within the Austrian healthcare system. For this reason, RA5 is a longer -term solution and should only be introduced once there is increased acceptance among the popul ation that changes to the healthcare system are required. Legal considerations RA5 would require several legal amendments. First, of all regulations, such as \u00a7 135 (2) ASVG stipulating that insured persons must have a choice at least between two physicia ns available within a reasonable period of time, would have to be changed. Second, it is likely that the general contracts concluded with 169 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options the Chamber of Physicians would have to be changed, which is subject to the consent of the doctors' representatives. L egislative interventions in this respect might be possible, however, they must be justified under constitutional law by 'public interest' , in that the intervention must be appropriate and reasonable. Any ch ange of the tariff system must consider the consti tutional principle of 'Vertrauensschutz ', meaning that all individuals may trust in a legal situation ( especially if it concerns a long -period of time ) providing for a certain sort or level of benefits and, thus, is protected against intensive and/or sudde n reductions (i.e. a smooth transition is required if physician fees are changed to their disadvantage) . Risk-adjustment factors Despite significant advancements in risk -adjustment mechanisms, their predictive ability is limited. For example, in Germany a 2013 study found that only 20% of differences in expenditure could be accounted for by changes in risk -adjustment factors (87). In the Netherlands, van de Ven et al . (2015) measured the systematic under and over payment of insured people at -\u20ac670 and +\u20ac152, per person per year , respectively (93). Given the inherit difficulty of accounting for differences in healthcare expenditure, a Scientific Advisory Committee should be commission ed to identify risk -adjustment factors relevant to the Austrian context. Once a set of risk -adjustment factors has been chosen by the Scientific Advis ory Committee, their decision could be enforced by the law that governs social insurance. This could be the ASVG itself as well as a specific pr ovision in a separate legislative act. It is suggested that members of the Scientific Advisor y Committee draw upon existing forms of risk - adjustment in countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and the UK (see Table 21 for example risk - adjustment factors). However, applicability within the Austrian context needs to be considered, for example, the possibility of 'gaming' among health insurance carriers, with only those factors that cannot be manipulated being included wi thin the system. Lastly, in addition to needs -based, demand sid e risk - adjustment factors (see Table 21), in the short -term, it is recommended that sup ply-side factors (e.g. employees ) are considered, given it takes time to make significant structural changes and reallocate resources . Over time, for example 10 years, the weight or relative importance of supply -side factors should be reduced to make way f or demand -side, needs -based factors. 170 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 21: Commonly applied risk -adjustment factors Risk -adjustment factor Example countries Age and gender Nearly all models Diagnosis Germany, Netherlands Disease severity Germany, Netherlands Disability status Belgium, Netherlands Employment status Belgium Prescription of drugs (indicator of chronic diseases) Netherlands ( inpatient and outpatient prescriptions ) Switzerland (pharmaceutical expenditure) Employment status Germany, Belgium, Netherlands (income) Sickness allowance entitlement Germany Unmet need and health inequalities UK Geography and urbanisation UK, Belgium, the Netherlands Source: (75,80) Summary of risk -adjustment policy options RA1 and RA2 offer the most comprehensive forms of risk -adjustment, and are therefore mutually exclusive RA3-5 are less comprehensive and may be jointly implemented with RA1 and RA2 RA3 would build upon existing risk -equalisation schemes, and of all the four options, is probably the most straight -forward to implement. For this reason, RA3 could be used as a first ste p to 171 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options enhance risk -adjustment before more comprehensive mechanisms are considered (i.e. RA1 and RA2) RA4 and RA5 require reforms within the primary and hospital systems and therefore cannot be implemented unless there is a willingness among policy makers to change existing arrangements A Scientific Advisory Committee could be commissioned to determine appropriate risk -adjustment factors to be applied to the risk -adjustment scheme The Scientific Advisory Committee is advised to review relevant factors from existing, sophisticated risk-adjustment schemes; unlike many of these schemes, supply -side factors should be taken into account in the short -term Changes to risk -adjustment mechanisms could be extended to all layers of the Austrian healthcare system. RA1, where all revenue received by insurance carriers are risk -adjusted , and RA2, which involves a simultaneous reduction in contributions and the introduction of an earmarked levy , are the most comprehensive of the proposed options. Therefore , these mutuall y exclusive options are expected to have the greatest impact on health system performance. The remaining options, RA3 (pooling of existing risk-equalisation schemes ), RA4 (redistribution of hospital outpatient funds to social insurance) and RA5 (GP risk -adjusted capitation payment), are not as extensive as RA1 and RA2, however, from a legal and political perspective, may be easier to implement in the short - term. Further, these options are not mutually exclusive and could, in certain cases, be jointly imple mented. For example, a move towards a risk -adjusted capitated payment scheme for GPs ( RA5) would complement a system where funds from various risk-equalisation schemes are merged and re - distribute d to health insurance carriers (RA3). Lastly, RA4 and RA5 involve major structural changes within the system. As a result, either scheme should only be pursued if there is strong political motivation. Going forward a Scientific Advisory Committee could be established to develop a range of risk -adjustment factor s relevant to the Austrian context. It is suggested that the Scientific Advisory Committee draw upon existing countries with sophisticated risk -adjustment systems (e.g. UK and the Netherlands). Further, in the short -term (e.g. 10 years), risk -adjustment could take into account both demand - and supply -side factors. 172 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Although outside the remit of this review, consideration should be given to extending risk -adjustment to all lay ers of the Austrian healthcare system. Namely, between the Fede ral Government and the L\u00e4nder (State Health Funds) (where funds are currently allocate according to historical allocations) , and between social insurance and the L\u00e4nder. Implementation of any of the proposed risk -adjustment options should be done in a gradual manner. This will allow time for supply -side factors to re -adjust, which is not always possible in the short -run. It is important to highlight that even a more extensive risk -adjustment scheme won't necessari ly create a level playing field, given, risk-adjustment fact ors explain only part of total healthcare expenditure. That is, the redistribution of funds will not wholly reflect actual needs of each carrier 's insured population . As a result, carriers with favourable risk profiles are likely to continue to accumulate sufficient reserves. Lastly, risk -adjustment should not be expected to solve all inefficiencies and inequities within the healthcare system, given that some could be considered 'acceptable' . For example, tertiary hospitals and highly specialised centres ( e.g. for rare disease) should continue to be located in highly populated urban areas only . Acceptable inefficiencie s include subsidi es to primary healthcare units, physician networks, as well as healthcare workers in remote and rural areas in order to improve access in these locations. 173 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 5 Financing of social security Chapter 5 explores healthcare financing systems in Austria and other social health insurance systems across Europe. The chapter has been broken into five sections covering collection of contributions, benefit packages, user charges, investment opportunities in healthcare, and concludes with an overview of potential policies to broaden the social welfare base. Collection of contributions Contribution systems in Austria are governed by different laws and therefore may result in varying contribution bases and rates across insurance funds. Ultimately this leads to different levels of self - funding, as well as different ratios between individual's contributions and funds provided by federal tax. Therefore, an alignment in the collection of contributions across different types of funds may render the contribution systems more equitable. This chapter provides an overview of four different contribution systems, followed by an assessment of the differences and rec ent policy developments, and a number of policy options to harmonise the collection of insurance contributions. Workers and employees For workers and employees the contribution is based on the due earned income during the contribution period, as specified in \u00a744 ASVG. Following \u00a749 ASVG, the remuneration is defined as monetary and in - kind earnings, which the compulsory insured employee is entitled to, owing to his/her employment. As such, the principle of entitlement -to-remuneration applies, rather than th e inflow principle that is predominantly found in tax law. In the case of entitlement -to-remuneration, the minimum level considered for the contribution base is the civil claim for payment, as regulated by , for example, general contract s and employment con tracts. However, contributions are not based on the actual amount of payment received. Having a claim to a specific amount is sufficient to calculate and pay contributions, regardless of whether the employee has received a lower pay. The maximum contribu tion for workers and employees for the year 2017 is set at \u20ac4,980 per month, which amounts to \u20ac166 per day, and the marginal amount for those with minor employment is set at \u20ac425.70. In line with the ASVG, the contribution rates apply to workers, employees , freelancers, agricultural workers and miners. The rates amount to 1.3% for the accident insurance, which is paid by the employer; 7.65% for the health insurance, of which 3.87% and 3.78% are paid by the employee and employer respectively; and 22.8% for p ension insurance, which is split into 10.25 % for the employee and 12.55% 174 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options for the employer. Please see Table 22 for a detailed list of the contribution rates for workers and employees. Table 22 Social insurance contribution rates (in percent) for workers and employees in 2017 Self-employed persons engaged in commercial activity and insured with the SVA The contribution paid for by self -employed persons insured with the SVA is based on the individual's income, as stated on the income tax statement. In addition, compulsory pension and health insurance contributions, which were paid in advance for the respective calendar year, a re added to the income32 The contribution base for health insurance is restricted to a maximum of \u20ac69.720 and a minimum of \u20ac5.108,40, while the minimum base for the pension insurance amounts to \u20ac8.682. As the income tax statement is issued at the end of ea ch year, a preliminary calculation of contributions is conducted. In 2016, the monthly minimum contribution base for health insurance was lowered to the level of the ASVG -based marginal earnings threshold. In addition, the monthly minimum contribution bas e for the pension insurance will be gradually lowered in a total of 12 times to the marginal earnings threshold until 2022. The contribution rate for SVA -insured amounts to 18.5% and 7.65% for pension and health insurance respectively. If individuals are c ompulsory insured under the FSVG law, then the contribution 32 (102) 175 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options rate for pension insurance is 20%. In the case of the accident insurance, insured pay a monthly fixed amount of \u20ac9.33 (in 2017), which is independent of income. Farmers insured with the SVB There are two contribution systems in the SVB and insured persons can either pay contributions based on the value of their agricultural/forestry business or opt for the contributions foundation option, which is based on the income as indicated on the income s tatement. If the insurance value ( Vollpauschale ) of a business is below \u20ac75,000 (or below \u20ac130,000 in the case of Teilpauschale ), then the insured needs to opt for the first option. As a result, approximately 90% of all businesses fall into the first cate gory. In this case, the contribution rates for health, pension and accident insurance are 7.65%, 17% and 1.9% respectively. In 2017, the minimum contribution base in the flat -rate system amounts to \u20ac785.56 for the health and accident insurance, and \u20ac425.70 for pensions insurance. The insurance value, which serves as a basis for the contribution rates, is calculated using the tax unit value of the agricultural/forestry area and a so -called income factor, which is a fixed percentage stratified by unit value levels. However, it must be noted that the percentage decreases as unit values increase, constituting an advantage to larger businesses. For instance, the percentage of an agricultural area with a tax unit value between \u20ac5,100 and \u20ac8,700 is set at 19.17%, while that for tax unit values between \u20ac43,700 to \u20ac87,500 amounts to 3.06%. Furthermore, each unit value category is rounded up to the next \u20ac100, which may lead to an average reduction of \u20ac50 of the unit value. It must be noted that for farming businesses operated by married partners, the maximum contribution basis is reached with a unit value of \u20ac277,200, which is more than three -times higher than that for a business operated by a single operator (i.e. \u20ac87,500). Table 23 provides an overview of the unit values and fixed percentages used to determine the insurance value, which serves as a basis for the contribution rates. 176 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 23: Overview of unit values for the calculation of the insurance value of an agricultural/forestry business For insured persons who opt for the contribution foundation option, the contribution is calculated on the basis of income that is indicated on the income tax statement. The method of assessment is the same as the one used under the GSVG law. In contrast to the first option, the minimum contribution bases are higher, amounting to \u20ac1,476.16 for health and accident insurance, and \u20ac785.56 for the pension insurance. Civil servants and public employees In the case of the social security of the civil service, there is a maximum contribution base for health insurance that amounts to \u20ac4,980 (in 2017), however, this does not apply to the accident insurance. Wh en it comes to pension insurance, only new contractual civil servants are insured with the PVA, in line with the ASVG law. The new contractual civil servants are charged a 10.25% contributions rate for pension insurance and the employer pays a share of 12. 55%, amounting to a total of 22.8%. A maximum contribution base is in place for contractual civil servants and university employees, however, for employees who are subject to the Pension Act there is no maximum base and the pension contribution is levied b y the employer. The contribution rate for the health insurance for active civil servants is 7.635%, which is split in 4.1% for the civil servant and 3.535% for the employer. For accident insurance, the rate 177 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options amounts to 0.47%, however, as previously describe d, there is no maximum contribution base. The table below outlines key differences in contributions between the BVA and regional funds. Table 24: Differences in contributions for health and accident insurance between the BVA and regional funds BVA Regional insurance funds Employee contribution for health insurance 4.1% 3.87% Employer contribution for health insurance 3.535% 3.78% Overall contribution rate for health insurance 7.635% 7.65% Accident insurance 0.47% 1.3% Overall contribution rate for health and accident insurance 8.105% 8.95% Differences in the collection of contributions and recent policy developments Although health insurance contribution rates are uniform across carriers, with a minor deviation of 0. 015% in the case of the BVA, contribution bases and mechanisms vary across types of funds and therefore result in different levels of self -funding, as well as different ratios between individual's contributions and funds provided by federal tax. However, v ariations may be partly explained by the setting of contribution bases and differences in the cumulative contributions paid for health, accident and pension insurance. With the aim to better align the GSVG -, BSVG - and ASVG -defined contribution mechanisms, several changes were made in recent years to unify the maximum contribution bases. Nevertheless, substantial differences in the setting of contribution bases with respect to the different social insurance laws prevail. For instance, self -employed persons are assessed on the basis of their profits, farmers are assessed against the insurance value of the agricultural/forestry business, while employed individuals are assessed in terms of their salaries. Since each system follows its own logic, the reporting a nd examination can be different in the carriers. In particular with respect to the self -insured persons, this leads to an increased expenditure 178 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options for the controlling and verification process pertaining to the correct calculation and payment of contributions to the social insurance. Furthermore, under the BSVG law, farmers have the option to pay contributions based on the standard value of their agricultural/forestry business or to opt for the contributions foundation option, which is based on the income as i ndicated on the income statement and follows the same method as applied under GSVG law. According to the SVB annual report (2015), out of a total of 120.253 BSVG -based contribution assessments, 106.249 (i.e. 88%) were calculated in terms of the standard va lue; 8.972 were based on an individual contribution basis, which in particular applies to multiple insured persons in the case that differential contribution bases are set to avoid the exceedance of the specified maximum contribution; 3.400 were assessed t hrough income statements (i.e. BGT -option); and 1.732 income -producing businesses and businesses with the 'Kleine Option', where the setting of the contribution base is not or not purely based on the standard value, were assessed in terms of their earnings as indicated on the income statement. Differences can also be found across ASVG -, GSVG - and BSVG -defined minimum contribution bases. For example, in the case of farming businesses that are operated by married partners, the minimum contribution basis for the farmers' pension insurance is \u20ac212.85 and \u20ac392.78 for the health insurance (in 2017). In contrast, the ASVG marginal earnings threshold is set at \u20ac425.70. Moreover, the calculation and setting of the contribution bases differ significantly between the employed and self -employed. For instance, self -employed persons can control their contributions basis to a certain degree through the tax law, or in the case of farmers, via the effect of the flat rate model. In addition, there are deductions for capital and restructuring gains, as laid out in the GSVG law. By contrast, the contribution base for social contributions paid by employees and workers constitutes the paid wage (Entgelt) by the employer. However, in regards to income tax, employees and workers ar e allowed some deductions in the so -called Arbeitnehmerveranlagung, which is similar to the income tax return of the self -employed. Policy options: Collection of contribution s Multiple contribution systems in the SVB Contributions based on actual income Contributions for farmers and operating managers, who opt for the contributions foundation option, are assessed on the basis of the income, as stated on t he tax statement. Under this option , insured persons 179 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options would pay c ontributions that are based on the actual net income, i.e. taxable income. The objective of a shift in taxation base is to promote an alignment between BSVG and ASVG funds in regards to the collection mechanism of contributions, and therefore to improve eq uity in the financing system. Introduction of a proportional fiscal system with maximum contributions The largest share of contribution assessments is based on the insurance value of an agricultural/forestry business. This insurance value is calculated us ing the tax unit value of the agricultural/forestry area and a so-called income factor, which is a fixed percentage stratified by unit value levels. However, the percentage decreases as unit values increase, constituting an advantage to larger businesses, despite the presence of maximum contribution bases. For instance, the percentage of an agricultural area with a tax unit value between \u20ac5,100 and \u20ac8,700 is set at 19.17%, while that for tax unit values between \u20ac43,700 to \u20ac87,500 amounts to 3.06%. This opti on proposes a shift from the regressive to a more proportional fiscal system in conjunction with the introduction of a maximum contribution amount. The rationale is to introduce a fiscal system that promotes a more equitable collection of contributions and which can be rendered fiscally neutral. Collection of contributions in the BVA Aligning the BVA contribution base with that of regional funds The difference in the health insurance contribution rate between the BVA and the regional funds amounts to 0.015 %, with regional funds having a slightly higher contribution rate. However, it must be noted that the share of contributions borne by employers and employees differs. As such, BVA -insured employees pay a relatively higher share of the contributions, amount ing to 4.1%, as compared to 3.87% for employees insured with a regional fund. The reverse applies to the employer's share, which is set at 3.535% for the BVA and 3.78% for the regional funds. Under this option , BVA contribution rates would be aligned with those of regional funds, meaning that employee contributions would be lowered by 0.23% to 3.87%, and employer contributions would be raised by 0.25% to 3.78%, creating a new contribution ratio between employees and employers. With a total collection of \u20ac90 3,013,331 in contributions in 2015, an increase in the BVA contribution rate would amount to an additional \u20ac18.43 Mio in the collection of contributions. Following the alignment between contribution rates in the first stage of the harmonisation process, B VA contributions could be rendered fiscally neutral in the mid -term. The second part of the alignment process takes into account user charges, which are currently higher for BVA -insured than for those insured with a 180 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options regional fund. In order to foster equity in the collection of contributions across funds, user chargers for BVA insured would be gradually lowered to the regional fund level. This implies an estimated decrease of \u20ac71,195,921 in income for the BVA, which would be partially offset with the additio nal contributions of \u20ac18.4 Mio, resulting in \u20ac52.7 Mio costs to the employer. However, it must be noted that the accident insurance contribution rate, borne by the employer, remains 0.83% lower for BVA insured, than for workers and employees. In addition, the BVA is running excess reserves, which may be used to further mitigate the additional costs. Legal considerations No particular constitutional (but, of course, political) impediments have to be faced in regard to the above policy options. Collection o f contributions of multiple insured in Austria Number of cases and types of multiple insurances In 2016, an annual average of 717.538 persons were covered by multiple insurances, of which two -thirds were dependents. In detail, the multiple insured comprise d 66% children and 1% spouses or other relatives (i.e. partner, or civil partners). As such, only about one -third of multiple insured persons paid contributions to the social security system, i.e. were gainfully employed or pensioners. Therefore, the amoun t of persons who are covered by multiple insurances and also pay contributions is comparatively small. 181 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 63: Persons with multiple health insurances, annual average in 2016, based on data from HVSV Multiple insured persons with gainful employment In 2016, 138.587 persons33 pursued multiple occupations (meaning two or more occupations). The number of multiple -insured working people rose slightly within the past years. However, considering that the total amount of worki ng people has also risen, the share of persons with multiple occupations remained constant. On the 1st of July 2016, 3.5% of the Austrian workforce had more than one occupation. Table 25: Austrian workforce with multiple occupations 2008 -2016 , as of 1st July 2016 Year Total Number of people with one, two or multiple occupation(s) Total number of Occupations One Two This includes persons, who have multiple occupations, yet the same health insurance.

A precondition for the refund is that the sum of all contribution bases for the compulsory insurance in the respective year exceeds the 35 -fold daily amount of the maximum contribution basis for the compulsory insurance (for 2017, this results in \u20ac5,810.00 per month).35 In the case of health insurance, 4% of the excess amount that transcends the maximum threshold of the ASVG contribution is refunded, as this comprises the employee's as well as the employer's contribution, which equals 3.87% 3.78 % respectively36.

The application for refunding the health and unemployment contributions needs to be submitted to one of the insuring health insurance carriers. The application must be submitted until the end of the third calendar year, following the re spective contribution year. If this application is also filed for the following contribution years, it is valid for as long as the insured person is registered for compulsory insurance with this health insurance carrier. The occurrence of exceeding contri butions may be avoided by applying for the differential assessment claim. Based on the ASVG contribution base, the GSVG -/FSVG - contribution base is set at a level that is likely to eliminate an exceeding contribution. Hence, a (partial) exemption from the GSVG obligation to contribute takes place. Furthermore, multiple insured persons secure insurance periods in every pension system of their insurances. However, in order to claim the pension, insurance months, which were acquired in parallel, can only be cl aimed once. This means that insurance months have to be assigned to one of the pension systems. For this purpose the hierarchy ASVG - GSVG - BSVG applies. 11.4% of the amount which was paid in surplus (above the maximum threshold) gets refunded for the ASV G, while for the GSVG/FSVG/BSVG, the full excess contribution (i.e. the employee part) is reimbursed. To date, the so -called wage -sum -procedure has been utilised, where the employer calculates and pays the monthly contribution for all of his/her employees (including both, the employee and the employer contribution fees), without the contributions being allocated to the single person. Hence, the monthly contribution statement is adequate proof, i.e. the names of the employees do not need to be indicated, yet only the wage -sums suffice, which are broken down into contribution - and settlement -groups. Only after the end of the calendar year the pay -slips and the statement of contribution bases have to be created, which comprise the contribution basis for each in sured person. On 1st of January 2019, the monthly contribution base notification (mBGM) will replace this system, for which the legal framework is set by the reporting -obligation Act.38 The mBGM means a complete system transformation for the employers and the social insurance carriers, enabling high quality and more timely data about monthly contributions. Consequently, in future, data will be available more promptly and not only after the end of the calendar year. More specifically, the mBGM represents a s implification of applications and a decrease in having to report redundant data. In addition, this makes changes in the 38 (105) 187 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options insurance history more transparent, errors are avoided due to a clearing system, and the contribution groups are replaced by a new tarif f-system.39 Multiple insured civil servants For civil servants, the situation is slightly different. Civil servants, who simultaneously engage in a commercial activity, are also compulsory insured in the pension insurance - in accordance with the GSVG. Both, the minimum and the maximum contribution base apply, when establishing the contribution base according to the GSVG. The salary of civil servants does not influence the contribution base compliant with the GSVG. This is differently dealt with in the h ealth insurance: Besides the B -KUVG, the commercial activity leads to an additional compulsory insurance in line with the GVSG. Since 2006, the contribution base according to B-KUVG is credited to the GSVG minimum contribution base for health insurances. I n case the contribution base (in accordance with B -KUVG and GSVG) exceeds the maximum contribution base and an applicable substantiation is available, the contribution base according to GSVG must be set temporarily at most to the difference between B -KUVG and the maximum contribution base. The same applies to the employed persons, who are insured according to ASVG and B -KUVG. However, if based on regional law, a sickness insurance claim exists for a sickness insurance institution (Krankenf\u00fcrsorgeanstalt, KF A), then neither a crediting on the minimum contribution base according to GSVG, nor a restriction of the maximum contribution base apply40. Therefore, for civil servants an addition of the contribution bases should be allowed within pension insurance and t he KFA, in order to enable an automatic refund of contributions, exceeding the maximum contribution base. In the work programme of the federal government for 2017/2018, which was decided in a special council of ministers on the 30th January 2017, a simplif ication of multiple insurances was planned, potentially taking effect from September 201741: 'There exist many possible combinations of occupations. Persons who have multiple occupations that are gainful, i.e. employee and part -time farmer, pay multiple soc ial security contributions and are multiple insured. The obligation to contribute persists up to the maximum contribution base. If the sum of the contribution bases exceeds the maximum contribution base, the exceeding contributions can be avoided by claimi ng differential assessment (in advance) or a refund of 39 (106) 40 WKO Info: p.9 188 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options contributions (afterwards). In the future, an automatic difference assessment/refund of contributions through social security will be introduced i n case of multiple occupations. Allocation of contribut ion income and costs Besides the issue of allocating contribution income among multiple insurances, another problem presents the fact that cost allocation is currently not regulated. In fact, the person with multiple insurances, may decide which insurance has to bear the costs of treatment (this may possibly be also influenced by the contractual partner, if he/she partners multiple social security institutions). Thus, distributing the contribution income in relation to the allocation of costs of the differ ent health insurance carriers would be reasonable and fair. Currently, if the multiple insurance is based on ASVG and GSVG, the GSVG contribution base is reduced by the differential assessment, independent of where the costs are allocated. In case of multi ple insurances of multiple employments according to ASVG, employee contributions exceeding the maximum contribution base can get refunded. This happens at the carrier that receives the filed application for differential assessment. The current situation i s problematic, since numerous incentives that have to be taken into consideration exist. If left uncoordinated, these could potentially influence the cost allocation: Scope of service of the respective carrier Issue of user charges and cost sharing Issue o f remunerating physicians providing the same service Amount of remuneration, since with physicians -of-choice 80% of the fees a contractual partner would charge, are refunded. Policy options: Multi ple insured persons in Austria A simplification via automa tic refunding for multiple insured persons and an internal cost allocation is considered a reasonable alternative to the current system of retrospective, manually filed reimbursement. The cost allocation should be based on an estimation of payment flows an d not on single bills of the individual insured persons. The more services, rates and tariff models are harmonised, the easier it will be to obtain a mechanism that involves all health insurance carriers. 189 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Single collection of contributions without a choic e of fund At present, multiple insured persons in Austria pay contributions to all funds they are compulsorily insured with. As the total contributions may exceed the maximum contribution bases, multiple insured must manually file yearly applications for r eimbursement, in order to receive a refund of the excess payment. In addition, multiple insured can choose which carrier to charge for a good or service on a case -by-case basis, constituting an inequitable advantage compared to those insured with a single fund. For instance, multiple insured may avoid paying user charges that are prevalent across more \"generous\" funds, such as the BVA or SVA, while simultaneously making use of those funds' greater benefits when necessary (e.g. in order to reduce waiting tim es or to receive greater allowances for specific services). this policy introduces a single location for the collection of contributions, in addition to keeping maximum contribution bases in place. This can either be in the form of an independent entity or by nominating regional funds to collect contributions on behalf of all funds, in order to simplify the administration process. As such, the refund for excess contributions could be automatically calculated through an official channel, without the need for manual applications. Under this option , insured persons do not have a choice of fund. Instead, a hierarchy could be introduced to determine the fund membership of an individual. This could either be an absolute hierarchy of funds or a hierarchy based on the main income source of an individual. However, it must be noted that a system based on a hierarchy is only feasible if it does not undermine the financial position of a fund. Hence, further studies on the financial impact on funds need to be conducted prior to applications of this option. Single collection of contributions with a choice of fund (sub -option) This sub -option follows the same model as the option above, with the main difference that insured persons could choose their fund of preference, based on their professions. While this op tion does not entirely eliminate inequity in the system, it may reduce the former, as insured could only switch funds on an e.g. yearly basis, rather than intermittently charging different funds. Multiple collections of contributions without a choice of f und Under this option insured individuals continue to pay to multiple funds, however, the insured would be automatically assigned to a default fund. This constitutes the fund for which the insured pays the largest share of contributions and the insured is only entitled to benefits of the default fund. All carriers receiving contributions for the insured would re -direct these contributions to the respective default fund. In addition, the refund process for excess contributions could be automated, in order to reduce the 190 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options administrative burden of manual applications and to eliminate inconveniences to the insured. However, such a system is only feasible if it does not undermine the financial position of a fund, such as the SVB. Hence, prior to the application of this option, a study on the financial impact on funds needs to be conducted. Multiple collections of contributions with a choice of fund (sub -option) This sub -option follow s a similar rationale to that outlined above , with the main difference that under Option 2a individuals have the option to choose a default fund to access services from, while the second carrier will conduct transfers of funds to the former. However, as in the case of previous options discussed, there are only partial improvements in equ ity. Retrospective payments between funds For this final option , one of the funds conducts retrospective payments to the second insurance carrier, which was predominantly used by the insured person to access services. This system constitutes a modificati on of the current mechanism in that it adds a compensatory mechanism to ensure the financial stability of funds. However, it must be noted that this option may be more difficult to implement and does not render the system more equitable. Legal considerati ons Some of the above options may cause problems with respect to the principle of self -governance: As long as there are different 'Versichertengemeinschaften' each of them based on the type of employment of the respective insuree, it will be difficult to j ustify that only one of them is receiving all the contributions, most of all if that particular carrier is determined more or less 'by chance' (including a choice by the insurees themselves). So if substantial harmonization and/or amalgamation of carriers (which should be the main options) cannot be achieved, it seems that a risk -adjusment -system taking into account also the special situation of multiple -insured persons would be a better and more equitable option. 191 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Defining benefits Overview The move towards universal health coverage raises key policy questions, such as how to design and regulate benefits to ensure a financially sustainable coverage of services for all insured persons (107) . Most countries have developed a rationale an d mechanism to guide the composition of a benefits basket, which specifies the full or partial coverage of publicly financed health care services, activities and goods accessible to all residents in social and national health systems. These benefits can be defined through two approaches and often countries employ a mix of both, depending on categories of goods and services: (1) an 'open specification' with a general description of benefits outlining eligibility for these benefits, and (2) 'closed specificat ion' with detailed (positive) listings of all benefits that are covered through public financing (108) . However, approaches and the extent of regulation differ between countries, highlighting ambiguities and challenges in creating a common benefits package. The following section provides a high - level overview of the regulation of s ervice coverage in Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland, and concludes with a brief comparison to the Austrian system. Regulation of health insurance benefits in Europe Belgium Regulated benefits Almost the entire Belgian population is in sured with one of the seven health insurance entities. These include five national associations, which can be broken down into approximately 60 local sickness funds, one public fund for individuals not wishing to join any of the five associations, and a se parate fund for railway employees. All insurance funds must offer the legally defined compulsory benefits package. Thus, differences in services are only present in complementary or supplementary insurance (109) . Service coverage in Belgium is based on a cl osed specification system with detailed positive listing (108) . As such, the c ontent of the compulsory package is specified in the national fee schedule ( nomenclature ), which lists an identification number, the contractual fee and reimbursement rate for more than 8,000 services. Negotiations on the inclusion of new treatments and ex clusion of obsolete ones between the representatives of the health insurance funds and healthcare providers take place yearly or biennially (109) . In order to inform and support evidence -based coverage decisions, the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre (KCE ) performs a number of health technology assessments. However, the KCE merely 192 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options issues non -binding recommendations and is not involved in the actual decision -making or implementation process of the benefit basket (110) . The compulsory benefits package is broad and includes services such as medical care (e.g. GPs, specialists, psychiatric care, hospital care), physiotherapy, prescription drugs, most dental care, home and nursing home care, among many others (109) . Certain ser vices, such as alternative therapies (e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture) are not covered by the basic insurance, while plastic surgery, spectacles and orthodontics may be reimbursed under specific conditions (109) . Optional benefits In addition to the compulsory benefit package, sickness funds may offer supplementary or complementary insurance. Content and insurance policies for services, such as optic and dental care, alternative medicines and certain co -payments for hospital care, d iffer between providers, leaving room for competition (109) . France Regulated benefits Eighty -six per cent of the French population are covered by the general statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme for salaried workers in the private sector (also applicable to legal residents not covered by other funds). The remaining are members of the SHI scheme for self -employed (6%) or members of the scheme for farmers and agricultural workers (5%). The content of the compulsory benefits package is defined at the nationa l level and applies to all SHI schemes (111) . Hence, differences in services are only present in complementary or suppleme ntary insurance. Similar to Belgium, the service coverage in France is based on a closed specification system with a detailed positive listing of more than 8000 covered benefits (108) . These positive lists are defined at the national level and apply to all regions. The Ministry of Health specifies the positive list for drugs and med ical devices for both outpatient and inpatient care, while the statutory health insurance (UNCAM) is responsible for the listing of medical procedures (111) . The coverage decisions are evidence -based, following a health technology assessment of the effectiveness and/or cost -effectiveness of all interventions by designated committees of the independent French National Authorit y for Health (HAS) (112) . Overall, the benefits package consists of outpatient - (e.g. GPs, specialists, dentists, and midw ives) and inpatient care (e.g. hospital care, rehabilitation or physiotherapy), diagnostic services and therapies (e.g. physio -, speech therapy) if prescribed by doctors. Pharmaceutical products, medical appliances and 193 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options prostheses are covered if these are i ncluded in the national positive list and if prescribed by a physician. Health -care related transport is reimbursed in the case of prescription. Cosmetic surgery, spa treatments or services of uncertain effectiveness are not included in the basic package (111) . Optional benefits While the SHI provides a broad benefit package, coverage is generally not 100% and varies between services. Therefore, insured persons can take out complementary insurance to cover all or parts of the residual costs or supplementary insurance for benefits not covered by the SHI (111) . Germany Regulated benefits Eighty -seven per cent of the population in Germany are insured with one of the 113 statutory health insurance funds (GKV funds), while 11% have opted for substitutive private health insurance (PKV) (113) . The Contribution rates vary between sickness funds, however, 95% of GKV benefits are statutorily regulated through Social Code Book V ( SGB V ) (114) . The statutory regulation of services also applies to the basic tariff, which private health insurers are obliged to offer and which encompasses compulsory benefits analogous to the benefit package covered by the GKV. As stated in legislation (\u00a712 SBG V), benefits can only be claimed for services that are adeq uate, appropriate and economical. It is the Federal Joint Committee's (FJC) task to evaluate and determine the specific medical and medico -technical examination and treatment methods for inclusion in the service catalogue (115) . For instance, examination and treatment methods for the outpatient sector must be approved by the FJC for their diagnostic or therapeutic benefit, medi cal necessity and effectiveness. Previously approved services can be excluded from the catalogue if they no longer reflect the current state of scientific evidence. In contrast, all services performed during an inpatient stay are automatically covered, unl ess a specific treatment method has been explicitly precluded due to insufficient therapeutic benefit (115) . The comprehens ive benefits package of the sickness funds encompasses preventive and early detection measures, essential medical treatment (i.e. outpatient and inpatient care, and rehabilitation, including surgical dressings, therapeutic appliances and medication), thera pies (e.g. psycho -, physio -, speech - and ergotherapy), medically necessary transportation, dental care, and sickness benefits. Additional services include insurance coverage for stays abroad in EU member states and choice of doctors and specialists 194 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options (116 ). Although alternative treatments, like homeopathic products, are not part of the statutory benefits package, they are covered by a number of sickness funds. Optional benefits Differences in benefits across GKV insurers are due to optional tariffs ( Wahltarife ), which were introduced as a way to increase competition in 2007 (117) . There are two types of optional tariffs: the mandatory and the voluntary optional tariff. The mandatory op tional tariff is regulated through legislation (\u00a753 SGB V), which means that sickness funds must offer the following four service options as part of the tariff: integrated care, structured treatment programmes for chronically ill, sickness benefits for the self- employed, and family physician care (118) . Via volunta ry optional tariffs, sickness funds can advertise a number of non -regulated services, such as tariffs with deductibles, contribution refunds and alternative medicines. In addition to the services offered by the statutory insurance, individuals can opt for supplementary private health insurance (118) . Netherlands Regulated benefits There are three types of health insurance in the Netherlands: the obligatory basic insurance for essential curative care, the obligatory national insurance for long -term and unaffordable care, and the optional supplementary insurance. All individuals must sign up with a private non -profit insurance provider to obtain the non -risk-based basic health insurance for curative care, which is harmonised across health insurers (119) . Service coverage in the Netherlands is based on an open specification system with a general description of benefits. The content of the basic benefits package is regulated by the central government, based on advice from the National Healthcare Institute (ZIN) (120) . Following the main criteria, services should be essential, e ffective, cost -effective and unaffordable for individuals. Other factors, such as budget and political considerations may further influence the decision -making (121) . However, not all treatments are evaluated or reviewed. Instead, the Healthcare Insurance Board defines a list of priorities for the benefits package agenda, which is held bi -annually (121) . In line with the Health Insurance Act 2015, the benefit package comprised, among other services, medical care (i.e. GPs, s pecialists, midwives, mental care and hospital care), home nursing and personal care, therapies (e.g. physio - speech -, exercise - and occupational therapy), pharmaceuticals and medical aids and devices, maternity care, transportation of sick patients, and d ental care (for children until the age of 195 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 18; persons aged 18 and older are eligible for specialist dental care and a set of false teeth). Also included were quit -smoking programmes and geriatric rehabilitation care (120) . Optional benefits Individuals may also take out supplementary coverage for additional services not included in the basic package. Supplementary insurance is offered by various competing providers and comprises health services such as dent al care for adults aged 18 and over, alternative therapies and medicine, contraception, glasses and contact lenses (122) . Switze rland Regulated benefits All Swiss residents must take out compulsory basic insurance offered by one of approximately 60 private non-profit health insurance funds (123) . Contribution rates vary between insurance providers and geographic regions, however, insurers are obliged to offer the same basic compulsory health insurance (obligatorische Krankenpflegeversicherung ) to any person, regardless of income, age, sex, or health condition (124) . The catalogue of benefits is broadly defined by the Swiss Health Insurance Act (KGV/LAMal) , which stipulates that services must be effective, appropriate and cost -effective (Art. 32 KVG/LAMal). Additionally, the federal government employs ex plicit positive lists and lists of medicines not eligible for reimbursement to specify certain contents of the package, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. However, most physician services are not formally assessed, which can lead to coverage of s ervices with little scientific proven value (125) . The basic insurance only covers services that are provided in the resident's state. However, exemptions include emergencies and compelling medical reasons (e.g. complex interventio ns such as organ transplantations) (124) . In practice, the package comprises most GP, chiropractor, midwife and specialist services, inpatient care, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, laboratory tests, as well as therapies (e.g. physio - and speech - therapy, nutritional and diabetes counseling, ou tpatient care by nurses, occupational therapy, and psychotherapy if prescribed by a physician). Costs for transport or rescue are partially paid for, while coverage for long -term care is based on medical necessity. Dental care is covered in the case of sev ere illness of the masticatory system or if related to care of other diseases (e.g. leukemia). The positive list also specifies a number of prevention and examination measures (e.g. pap smears, mammography 196 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options screening and selected vaccinations) (124,125) . As of 2017, the benefits package will also cover homeopathic medicines. Optional benefits To broaden the basic coverage, the insured can take out private supplementary or complementary insurance with any insurance provider. This type of insurance comes at an additional cost with risk -based premiums. Benefits and policies vary across funds and are difficult to compare. Generally, these benef its can be categorised into outpatient - and inpatient -related supplementary services. Supplementary outpatient coverage may include orthodontic treatment, alternative medicine, and spectacles/contact lenses. Supplementary coverage for inpatient stays may c omprise stays in a private or semi -private hospital ward, and choice of doctor (e.g. senior physicians) (124,125) . Regulation of benefit s in Austria Status quo About 80% of the Austrian population are insured with one of the nine regional insurance funds (GKKs), with the remainder being members of a specialist - and/or company insurance funds. The contribution rates for regional funds are uniform and insured persons are automatically assigned to a specific fund, based on the place of residence and occupational group. Although the contribution rates are the same across regional funds, the benefits are not fully harmonised and can vary for b oth benefits in -kind and in - cash. The guiding rationale is that treatment must be sufficient and appropriate, however, it should not exceed the necessary. Furthermore, there is a positive list for outpatient drugs based on evidence -based technology assessm ents. However, there are no additional positive lists or lists of interventions not eligible for reimbursement that specify covered benefits for outpatient - or inpatient care. Instead, each insurance fund specifies a statute ( Satzung ), which lists their co vered services. In addition, the Main Association of the Social Insurance Funds (Hauptverband der Sozialversicherungstr\u00e4ger, HVSV) is legally obliged to define a template statue ( Mustersatzung ). As such, the HVSV can render a service obligatory, however, a unanimous vote by all insurance funds is required. Service coverage in Austria is based on an open specification system with a general description of benefits. For instance, the General Social Security Act (ASVG) defines an array of broad services that a re covered by social health insurance. According to the legislation, the Social health insurance covers the f ollowing services: outpatient - (i.e. general practitioners and specialists), inpatient - and medical nursing care, 197 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options rehabilitation, therapies (psych o- and speech therapy), pharmaceuticals and therapeutic aids, maternity and sickness benefits, health promotion and illness prevention, and a number of basic dental services, among others. Generally, complementary medicine methods, such as homeopathy, are not included in the benefit basket (126) . Comparison of the regulation of health benefits plans across European countries As outlined in the country descriptions, the six countries differ in type, approach and extent of regulation pertaining to benef its. Similar to Austria, most countries in this analysis employ a guiding principle and an open specification with a general (functional) description of benefits, which is outlined in legislation. Such open specifications may be ambiguously defined and the refore undermine to some extent the harmonisation of benefits, as is the case in Switzerland, for example. However, it must be noted that not only the benefits packages, but also the contribution rates/premiums may vary between funds in Switzerland, Nethe rlands and Germany. In contrast, the contribution rates for regional funds in Austria are harmonised, whilst this is not necessarily the case for benefits packages. In addition, positive lists are generally used to specify coverage for prescription drugs, although in Austria the list only comprises outpatient drugs. France and Belgium are the only countries in this sample to produce detailed positive lists of more than 8,000 outpatient and inpatient goods and services, enhancing the harmonisation of benefit s across insurance providers. The table below provides an overview of the regulation of benefits across the six European countries. 198 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 26: Overview of the regulation of benefits across six European countries Austria Belgium France Germany Netherlands Switzerland Regulated benefits Legislation Source General Social Security Act (ASVG) Law on Compulsory Health Insurance and Allowances (Loi relative a l'assurance obligatoire soins de sante et indemnites ) ( Code de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale ) Social Code Book V (Sozialgesetzbuch ) Health Insurance Act (Zorgverzeke ringswet ) Swiss Health Insurance Act (KGV, LaMal) Coverage criteria Treatment must be sufficient and appropriate, however, it should not exceed the necessary (\u00a7133(2) ASVG) Medical goods and services need to be included in the positive list Medical goods and services need to be included in the positive list Benefits can only be claimed for services that are adequate, appropriate and economical (\u00a712 SBG V) Services should be essential, effective, cost-effective and unaffordable for individuals (1992/1 995 Dutch Committee on Choices in Health Care (Dunning Committee ) Services must be effective, appropriate and cost-effective (Art. 32 KVG/LAMal) Approach to define the benefits package Open specification with a general (functional) description of benefits Closed specification system with detailed positive listings Closed specification system with detailed positive listings Open specification with a general (functional) description of benefits Open specification with a general (functional) descr iption of benefits Open specification with a general (functional) description of benefits Mechanism to define benefits Outpatient services 199 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Austria Belgium France Germany Netherlands Switzerland Functional description of benefits; and a non - exhaustive positive list defined by each carrier Detailed positive list Detailed positive list Functional description of benefits; and positive list (less detailed) Functional description of benefits; and list of medicines not eligible for reimbursement Functional description of benefits; and list of medicines not eligible for reimbursement Prescription drugs Positive list Positive list Positive list Positive list Positive list Positive list Regulatory body Each insurance fund specifies a statue (Satzung ) that lists the services covered.

Private supplementary insurance can be taken out with any prov ider. 200 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Austria Belgium France Germany Netherlands Switzerland Supplementary private health insurance. 201 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Furthermore, a comparison of eight European countries by Van der Wees et al. (2014) showed that a number of countries are increasingly relying on evidence -based strategies to define the benefit package and to keep it affordable (e.g. Belgium, France and Germany) (108) . Regardless of the approach and type of he alth system, packages generally appeared similar between countries. The key differences in coverage were identified f or dental care and physical therapy (108) . For instance, routine dental care for adults is not covered in the Netherlands and Switzerland (see the table below for the selected comparison of services for adults covere d by public financing across European countries by Van der Wees et al. (2016) (127) ). However, the scope and extent of differences in service provision across funds within countries remains to be examined.

The study countries (and their respective agencies) under examination are England (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE), France (Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9, HAS), Germany (Institut f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4t College voor zorgverzekeringen , CVZ) before trying to draw some comparisons with Austria. With regards to the responsibilities and structure of nationa l HTA agencies, across all study countries HTA agencies are autonomous and their role is advisory. In that capacity, they assess and appraise the value of health care interventions and make recommendations for coverage. Usually, a technical group is respon sible for early assessment of evidence following which an expert committee appraises the request 44 Physical therapy in the Netherlands is only covered for certain chronic conditions after 20 sessions. 45 Not covered on a general basis; may be covered in some specific instances. 203 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options for coverage and produces recommendations for the ultimate decision maker. The topic selection process is generally not fully -transparent, with most agencies p redominantly assessing new health care interventions that are expensive and/or with uncertain clinical benefits. In all countries, official country - specific pharmacoeconomic evaluation guidelines are in operation, mainly concerning methodological and repor ting issues (128,129) . Although some of the HTA agencies tend to focus on pharmaceutical products, others evaluate all types of health care interventions, therefore the term \"pharmacoeconomic\" might not be representative of the types of guidelines in place, in which case it mi ght be more appropriate to be referred to as \"methods for HTA\". In terms of evidence and evaluation criteria considered, generally all study countries assess the same types of evidence, however the precise information and value parameters analysed and the way they are evaluated differ across countries. Typical data sources widely used by all countries include scientific studies (e.g. clinical trials, observational studies), national statistics, clinical practice guidelines, registry data, surveys, expert o pinion and evidence from pharmaceutical manufacturers (130) . In terms of methods and techniques applied and in addition to clinical benefit assessment, all countries adopt some type of economic evaluation technique (mainly Cost -utility analysis or Cost -effectiveness analysis) as an analytical method to derive the value of new technologies, besides France and Germany, both of which formally used to apply solely a comparative assessment of clinical benefit as the preferred methodology but with economi c evaluation progressively becoming more important as of 2013. All countries acknowledge that randomized controlled head -to-head clinical trials is the most reliable and preferred source of treatment effects (i.e. outcomes), with data from less -rigorous st udy designs being accepted in most study countries (England, France, Germany) e.g. when direct RCTs for the comparators of interest are not available (130 -132) . Also, most agencies require systematic literature reviews to be submitted by manufacturers as a source of data collection and carry out their own reviews. A meta - analysis of key -clinical outcomes is recommended for pooling the results together given the homogeneity of the evidence in England and Netherlands (130 -132) . If evidence on effectiveness is not available through clinical trial data, then France and Netherlands allow for a qualitative extrapolation based on efficacy data, with, England applying both qualitative and quantitative model ling. In both England and Netherlands, short -term clinical data are extrapolated also if data on long -term effects are absent. In terms of resources used, and in addition to direct medical costs, France considers all relevant costs including direct non -med ical and indirect costs, both for patients and carers (129,130) ; however, only direct costs are considered in the reference case analysis and incorporated in the ICER (133) . Germa ny 204 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options also takes into account informal costs and productivity gains separately as a type of benefit, whereas England additionally considers cost of social services. In the Netherlands, the Health Care Insurance Board's \"Manual for cost research\" applies for t he identification, measurement and valuation of costs; pharmacoeconomic evaluations need to include both direct and indirect costs inside and outside the healthcare system (134) . In all study c ountries both costs and benefits are discounted (129,131,135,136) , and uncertainty arising due to variab ility in model assumptions is investigated usually in the form of sensitivity analysis. No explicit, transparent, or clearly defined cost -effectiveness thresholds exist in any of the countries except for England. Finally, in terms of the decision outcomes and implementation, evaluation outcomes are primarily used to inform coverage decisions relating to the reimbursement status of the health care interventions but also pricing decisions, either directly or indirectly. Generally the time needed for the evalu ation of a health technology to be completed differs from country to country. However, in line with the EU Transparency Directive, all countries must have reached a decision on pricing and reimbursement within 180 days post marketing authorization (137) . In all countries the final decision report is publicly available, usually through the HTA agency's website (137,138) , and the policy implication of the evaluation outcome relates to the pricing and reimbursement status of the technology: reimbursement (List), no reimbursement (Do Not List), or conditional reimburs ement (List With Restrictions) (137,139) . However, all countries apply access restrictions usually relating to specific indications or specific population sub -groups. Most countries employ dissemination procedures in order to support the implementation of their decisions, including prescribing guidelines and national drug formularies (140) , having appeal mechanisms in place in case of dissent, revising their decisions either a ccording to fixed time schedule or on a rolling basis (131,137) . HTA processes in Europe England In England, the Secretary of State for Health has indicated to NICE a number of factors that should be considered in the evaluation process: (i) the broad balance between benefits and costs (i.e. cost - effective ness); (ii) the degree of clinical need of patients; (iii) the broad clinical priorities for the NHS; (iv) the effective use of resources and the encouragement of innovation; and (v) any guidance issued by the Secretary of State (141 -143) . Decisions are supposed to reflect society's values, underlined by a fundamental soci al value judgment (144). The degree of unmet clinical need is a formal criterion taken 205 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options into account, at least partially being reflected by the availability of alternative treatments (132,145) . NICE acknowledges that rari ty has a key role in the assessment of orphan medicinal products and NICE's Citizens' Council has stated that society would be willing to pay more for rare and serious diseases (146) . The severity of the disease is taken into account mainly through the special status of life -extending medicines for patients with short -life expectancy as reflected through the issuing of supplementary advice of life -extending end -of-life (EOL) treatments by NICE (132,147) . All clinically relevant outcomes are accepted with final clinical outcomes (e.g. life years gained) and patient HRQoL being preferred over intermediate outcomes (e.g. events avoided) or surrogate endpoints and physiological measures (e.g. blood glucose levels) (131,148 -150) ; particular outcomes of interest include mortality and morbidity. Safety is mainly addressed through the observation of adverse events (132) . Uncertainty is addressed explicitly through quality of evidence, implicitly, through preference for RCTs and indirectly, through rejection of submissions if evidence is not scientifically robust. The encouragement of innovati on is an important consideration and by definition, the incremental therapeutic benefit as well as the innovative nature of the technology are formally taken into account as part of the product's incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) (132) . Although productivity costs should be excluded, cost of time spent on informal caregiving can be presented separately if this care might otherwise have been provided by the NHS or the Personal Social Services (PSS) (151). As already reflected through NICE's working principles, the relative balance between costs and benefits (i.e. value -for-money) and the effective use of resources should be taken into account in England (e.g. through the explicit cost -effectiveness c riterion) (141) . Some st udies also suggest that the impact of cost to the NHS in combination with budget constraints (budget impact considerations) are taken into account alongside the other clinical and cost -effectiveness evidence (139,143,152 -154) . Besides the notion of clinical need as reflected through NICE's principles, other equity considerat ions include the 'need to distribute health resources in the fairest way within society as a whole' and the aim of 'actively targeting inequalities', both of which are explicitly mentioned by NICE as principles of social value judgements (141) . Equality, non -discrimination and autonomy are othe r explicit ethical considerations (145) . The preferred type of economic evaluation is CUA with cost per QALY gained being the favoured health outcome measure, but CEA may also be accepted if there is supporting evidence to do so (as in the case that the use of QALY for a particular case seems in appropriate) (129,130,136,141,142,150,155 -157) . Although evidence suggests the existence of a threshold ranging somewhere between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 (149,155,158,159) , it is evident that such a threshold range may not be strictly applied in practice, 206 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options with some products with a cost per QALY below these ranges receiving negative cover age recommendations and other products above these ranges ending up with positive recommendations (150,160,161) . Indeed, several studies point towards the existence of a threshold range base d on which additional evidence on several factors is required for the recommendation of technologies with an ICER of above \u00a320,000, and even stronger evidence of benefit in combination with explicit reasoning required for the coverage of technologies with an ICER above \u00a330,000 (132,137,142,143,158,162) . Indeed, additional criteria may apply as part of NICE's deliberative process that may push the acceptable ICER beyond the acceptable range; these criteria include severity of the disease, rarity, end -of life criteria, innovativeness of the technology, and equity, particularly in the context of disadvantaged populations and paediatric use. Despite the historically accepted ICER range of \u00a320,000 -\u00a330,000 per Q ALY, a recent study using data on primary care trust spending and disease -specific mortality estimated an empirical based \"central\" threshold of \u00a312,936 per QALY, with a probability of 0.89 of less than \u00a320,000 and a probability of 0.97 to be less than \u00a330 ,000 (163) . Reimbursement status has no direct effects on price, but indeed price indirectly affects the reimbursement status of the pharmaceutical in question as it will have an impact on the ICER. Major and minor restrictions exist though: the former relate to cases where the technology is indicated only for second -line treatment (and beyond) or for only specific sub -population, and the latter relate to the need for specialist supervision or treatment monitoring (143) ; performance based agreements (or response rules) also exist, especially in regards to the use of biologics and cancer drugs, according to which a pre - specified clinical (endpoint) condition must be reached at a specific post -assessment time point for the coverage of the technology to continue (164) . The NHS in England is legally obliged to implemen t NICE recommendation and guidance that has been accepted by the Secretary of State for Health and fund the recommended technologies within three months from the outcome of the decision, possibly by displacing resources from the use of other technologies (132,150) . However, NICE may revise technology appraisals once new evidence becomes available, with the average rate of positive recommendations (with or without restrictions) being around 90% (165) . France In France the dominant model of technology assessment and appraisal relates to (comparative) assessment of clinical benefit, in combination with selective use o f economic evaluation. Assessment of (comparative) clinical benefit is conducted through the use of two key indicators, namely, the product's 207 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options overall medical benefit (Service M\u00e9dical Rendu, SMR) and the improvement Servi ce M\u00e9dical Rendu, ASMR) ; the former determines reimbursement, while the latter informs pricing decisions. The SMR provides a ranking of a new product's absolute benefit, regardless of existing alternatives, ranging from important to insufficient (4 categor ies); in principle, the higher the SMR, the higher the rate of reimbursement. The ASMR provides a ranking of the new product's comparative benefit relative to existing therapies, ranging from 'breakthrough' (ASMR I) to 'no improvement in clinical benefit' (ASMR V) for a total of 5 categories. As of October 2013, economic criteria have been introduced with the Commission for Economic Evaluation and Public Health (CEESP) evaluating the cost -effectiveness (without a cost -effectiveness threshold in place) of products assessed to have an ASMR I, II or III that are likely to impact social health insurance expenditures significantly (total budget impact greater than EUR 20 million), being used by the Economic Committee for Health Products (CEPS) in its price n egotiations with manufacturers (166) . Nevertheless, and under this cur rent framework, these economic evaluations do not have the same impact on price negotiation with ASMR, which are directly linked with pricing but instead their role is limited to a consultative one. Both the severity and the existence of alternative treatm ents are acting as formal criteria, thus essentially defining the concept of 'need' (145) . Severity is considered as part of the SMR, taking into ac count symptoms, possible consequences (including physical or cognitive handicap) and disease progression (in terms of mortality and morbidity) (167) . The existence of alternatives is scored against a categorical 2-level scale (Yes vs. No) (133,168) . Clinical evidence (relating to therapeutic efficacy and safety) acts as the most important fo rmal criterion of the evaluation process (137) . The product's medical benefit or medical service rendered (SMR) relates to the actual clinical b enefit of the drug, responding to the question of whether the drug is of sufficient interest to be covered by social health insurance. It takes into consideration the following criteria: (a) the seriousness of the condition; (b) the efficacy of the treatme nt; (c) side effects of the drug; (d) its place within the therapeutic strategy given other available therapies; and (e) its interest for public health (129) . Clinical novelty is considered by definition through the product's improvement of medical benefit ( ASMR) relating to the relative added clinical value of the drug which informs the pricing negotiations. Additiona l innovation characteristics relating to the nature of the treatment (e.g. differentiating between symptomatic, preventive and curative) are also considered but as a second line of criteria (131,137,1 67,169) . In terms of socioeconomic parameters, 'expected' public health benefit acts as another explicit dimension via an indicator known as public health interest (\"Int\u00e9r\u00eat de Sant\u00e9 Publique\", 208 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options ISP), which is assessed and scored separately by a distinct committee as part of the SMR evaluation but is not used often (145,167,169,170) . Until recently, cost was not acknowledged as an explicit or mandatory criterion, but budget impact, while not mandatory, has always been recommended highly (167) . Although the expert comm ittee had been reluctant to use cost -effectiveness criteria in the evaluation process (137,153) , following the by -law of 2012 (which took effect in 2013) the role of economic evidence was strengthened (168) . The CEESP gives an opinion on the efficiency of the drug based on the relative added clinical value (ASMR) of alternative treatments. Additional explicit parameters considered in France include the technology's place in the therapeutic strategy mainly in relation to other available treatments (i.e. first -line treatment vs. second - line treatment etc.), and the tec hnology's conditions of use (133,167,168) . Comparative assessment of clinical benefit incorporating final endpoints as an outcome measure used to be as the single evaluation procedure in place. However, economic analysis of selected pharmaceuticals with expected significant budget impact is contin uously being considered more formally, especially if its choice is justified and any methodological challenges (especially associated with the estimation of QALYs) are successfully addressed (129,130,133,135,145,168) . The choice between CEA and CUA depends on the nature of the expected health effects (if expected significant impact on HRQoL then CUA, otherwise CEA). By assessing the evidence of the product's medical benefit or medical service rendered (Service M\u00e9dical Rendu, SMR), the improve ment in medical benefit and added therapeutic benefit (Am\u00e9lioration du Service M\u00e9dical Rendu, ASMR) are derived, which determine the reimbursement status and influence the price level of the product respectively, therefore only drugs with additional therap eutic value can \"obtain a higher reimbursement basis\" (137) . However, drug registration is subject to renewal every 5 years and a drug may also be subject to post -registration studies. Germany In Germany the Act to Reorganize the Pharmaceuticals Market in the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) System [Gesetz zur Neuordnung des Arzneimittelmarktes in der gesetzlichen Krankenversicherung (AMNOG)] came into effect on 1 January 2011. Since then, all newly introduced drugs are subject to early benefit assessment. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have to submit a benefit dossier for evaluation by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQW iG). A final decision is made by the Federal Joint Committee ( Gemeinsame Bundesausschuss , G-BA). Benefit for new drugs encompasses the \"patient -209 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options relevant therapeutic effect, specifically regarding the amelioration of health status, the reduction of disease duration, the extension of survival, the decrease in side effects or the improvement in quality of life\" (171) . Importantly, all new drugs are reimbursed upon marketing authorization and benefit assessment mainly determines price rather than reimbursement status. There are no pricing restrictions one year post -MA. Severity is considered as part of added (clinical) benefit assessment. The clinica l assessment is based on \"patient -relevant\" outcomes, mainly relating to how the patient survives, functions or feels, essentially accounting for the dimensions of mortality, morbidity and HRQoL (172) . Similarly to France, all clinically relevant outcomes are considered and final clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. increase in overall survival, reduction of disease duration, improvement in HRQoL) are preferred over surrogate and composite endpoints (129, 130,135,148,172) . HRQoL endpoints are considered if measured using validated instruments suited for application in clinical trials [24, 32] . With regards to uncertainty, the Institute ranks the results of a study according to \"high certainty\" (randomized study with low bias risk), \"moderate\" (randomized study with high bias risk), and \"low certainty\" (non -rando mized comparative study). The complete evidence base on value is then assessed and a conclusion is reached on the probability of the (added) benefit and harm graded on a six level scale, notably, (a) major added benefit, (b) considerable added benefit, (c) minor added benefit, (d) non -quantifiable added benefit, (e) no added benefit, and (f) lesser benefit (167,172) . The quality of the evidence is assessed on a three -level scale, as follows: (a) proof, (b) indication of proof and (c) hint of proof. Following one year of free pricing the G -KV Spitzenverband either (a) puts the product in a reference gro up if there is no proof of evidence of significant added benefit, or (b) if there is major or significant added benefit, the price is negotiated with the outcome being a price which is between the comparator and the initial list price of the new product. Clinical novelty is considered implicitly as part of the consideration of added therapeutic benefit for premium pricing. Ease of use and comfort (if relevant for morbidity or side effects) can be reflected indirectly through treatment satisfaction for patie nts which can be considered as an additional aspect, however not as an explicit factor, similarly to the nature of treatment/technology (173) . Public health benefit is not explicitly co nsidered but only partially reflected through the requirement from manufacturers to submit information on the expected number of patients and patient groups for which an added benefit exists as well as costs for the public health system (statutory health i nsurance) (167,173) . All direct costs have to be considered, including both medic al and non -medical (when applicable), whereas indirect costs are not a primary consideration but can be evaluated separately if they are substantial, with 210 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options productivity losses due to incapacity being included only on the cost side (174) . In turn, productivity losses due to mortality are only considered in the outcome on the benefit side (to avoid doub le counting). Budget impact analysis (BIA) is mandatory and should include any one -off investments or start -up costs required in order to implement a new technology, with methodology and sources clearly outlined (129,174) . Economic evaluation is not standard practice in the evaluation but rather optional and can be initiated if no agreement is reached between sickness funds and the manufacturer on the price premium or if the manufacturer does not agree with the decision of the G -BA regarding premium pricing (added benefit); instead, BIA is mandatory (Advance -HTA, 2016). 'Cost -effectiveness' acts as one of the most important formal evaluation criteria in Sweden. Parameters having a socioeconomic impact, such as avoiding doctor visits or surgery, productivity impact, and, in general, savings on direct and indirect costs are also considered (167) . Germany is the only country that do es not apply any conditions of use in regards to specific sub -populations, in principle reimbursing drugs across the whole indication spectrum as listed on the marketing authorization (167) . Economic evaluations are performed within therapeutic areas and not across indications, thus an efficiency frontier approach of CBA using patient relevant outcomes is the preferred combination of analysis method -outcome measure (129,130,135,174,175) . Since the introduction of the AMNOG, economic evaluations are supposed to be conducted for cases when price negotiations fail after the early benefit assessment and the arbitral verdict is challenged by the technology supplier or the statutory health insurer (174) . However, no such analysis has been su bmitted so far and seems unlikely to ever happen because the CBA would have to be re -evaluated by IQWiG which would hardly bring any better results (167) .The efficiency frontier approach is used to determine an acceptable \"value for money\", even though this is not involved in the process of the initial rebate negotiations. The Netherlands The Netherlands focuses on four priority principles when assessing medical technologies: (a) the \"necessity\" of a drug (severi ty / burden of disease) (145,176) ; (b) the \"effectiveness\" of a drug, according to the principles of Evidence -Based Medicine (EBM) (140,176) ; (c) the \"cost -effectiveness\" of a drug (158) ; and (d) \"feasibility\", that is how feas ible and sustainable it is to include the intervention or care provision in the benefit package (177,178) . The severity of the disease can be considered either implicitly or explicitly, more recently tending towards explicit burden of disease measures. The availability of treatments is considered by estimating the number of treatments perceived as necessary and comparing 211 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options these with the actual capacity in place, whereas the prevalence (e.g. rarity) of the disease is also considered. Therapeutic value is the most critical criterion for reimbursement in the Netherlands as part of which patient preference data a nd user friendliness might also be considered (140) , with surrogate and composite endpoints included in the analysis, in addition to disease -specific quality of life endpoints. Although clinical novelty is a key innovation dimension considered, the ease of use and comfor t might be used informally on an ad hoc case -by-case basis, whereas the nature of treatment or technology might only be implicitly considered. In terms of socioeconomic impact, explicit estimates might be produced to measure any public health benefit, wher eas social productivity is also considered. In the assessment process by ZIN, the cost -effectiveness criterion follows that of the therapeutic value and the cost consequence analysis. Cost -effectiveness is only considered for drugs with added therapeutic value, which are either part of a cluster and are reimbursed at most at the cluster reference price or are not reimbursed in the absence of possible clustering (140, 179) . The agency usually performs its own BIA, although voluntary submission from the manufacturer is also an option (140,153) . The Netherlands also takes into consideration explicitly ethical criteria based on egalitarian principles, such as solidarity and affordability of the technology by individual patients (145,167,180) . The preferred type of economic evaluation is CUA if the improvement in quality of life forms a n important effect of the drug being assessed, or, if this is not the case, a CEA (134,181) . There is no formal threshold in place b ut there have been some attempts to define one. The \u20ac20,000 per life-year gained (LYG) threshold used in the 1990s to label patients with high cholesterol levels eligible for treatment with statins has been mentioned in discussions on rationing, but was ne ver used as a formal threshold for cost -effectiveness. The same was the case with a threshold that the Council for Public health and Health Care wanted to implement based on criteria such as the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, in line WHO recommen dations, which for the Netherlands would translate into \u20ac80,000/ QALY (179) . The Council also suggested that the cost per QALY may be higher for very severe conditions (a tentative maximum of \u20ac80,000) than for mild conditions (where a threshold of \u20ac20,000 or less may be applied) (178) , but none of the above was ev er implemented. The positive outcome of an HTA results in the inclusion of the medical technology in the positive list (140) , and if the cost -effectiveness analysis for a new innovative pharmaceutical is of good quality, reimbursement will principally not be denied on the basis of cost -effectiveness, despite potentially relatively high cost -per-QALY values (179) . 212 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options A system of coverage with evidence development (CED) for high cost and orphan inpatient drugs has been used exte nsively between 2006 and 2011. Currently, financial -based agreements and performance -based risk sharing agreements are considered as well. So far, revisions seemed to be taking place systematically after four years for in -patient drugs and on an ad hoc bas is for out -patient drugs (137,176) , however more recent evidence suggests that in practice, the process is irregular with providers asking the Dutch healthcare authority for a revision of reimbursement. HTA in Austria As stipulated in Article 15a of the Federal Constitutional law on the financing and organisation of the health care system, evidence based medicine (EBM) and health technology assessment (HTA) should be employed to inform and support policies that ensure the quality of care in Austria. Following, a national strategy for the framework and implementation of HTA was introduced in 2010. Despite efforts to consolidate HTA in Austria and its use in specifying a list of reimbursable outpatient drugs, there is no systematic assessment of technologies or interventions to inform decision -making regarding the definition of a basic benefits package, nor a defined body to assess and appraise technologie s. Rather, the system consists of a number of decentralised HTA units of varying importance that carry out specialised services. Indeed, a key challenge in the Austrian setting stems from the division of competencies between the federal states, who take care of hospitals, and the social security institutions (SSIs) that focus on the outpatient sector. As such, regions are primarily focused on how to reduce hospital LOS and SSIs focus only on patients in outpatient settings, leading to a shift of burden (e .g. SSIs do not look at LOS, because they do not want to take over the costs). The two players only reflect on the economics of their own sector. In what concerns the current state of HTA in Austria, due consideration needs to be given to different types of technologies, specifically, (a) surgical and diagnostic interventions, (b) out -patient pharmaceuticals and (c) in -patient pharmaceuticals. The d istinction between these three types of interventions highlights the differences in the use of HTA as well as the competences by different health stakeholders in the Austrian health system. The processes for the above types of technologies are discussed br iefly in turn. With regards to surgical and diagnostic interventions, all new hospital interventions that are included in the hospital benefits catalogue (excluding drugs; including surgical and diagnostic high -risk interventions 213 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options such as pacemakers), are already being assessed. Hence, no intervention can be included in the catalogue, unless an evidence analysis has been undertaken. With regards to out -patient pharmaceuticals, all out -patient pharmaceuticals that are to be included in the list of reimbursab le pharmaceuticals ( Heilmittelverzeichnis ) need to undergo a health technology assessment. These are rapid assessment and, as such, manufacturers submit their dossiers for an evaluation to the Main Association of the Social Insurance Carriers (HVSV). Follo wing an assessment of the evidence by the EWG department within the HVSV, a recommendation is issued to the Drug Evaluation Committee ( Heilmittel -Evaluierungs -Kommission (HEK) ). This committee, which constitutes the final appraisal body, consists of 20 mem bers: 10 representatives from social insurance, 3 independent research experts, 2 representatives from the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber, 2 representatives from the Austrian Federal Chamber of Labour, 2 representatives from the Medical Chamber, and 1 r epresentative from the Chamber of Pharmacists. The inclusion of pharmaceuticals in the reimbursement list is governed by \u00a7351g ASVG VO -EKO, which provides a transparent overview of the goals and procedures of the pharmacological, medico -therapeutic and hea lth economic evaluations. The latter constitutes primarily cost-effectiveness analyses that do not encompass social costs. However, the final assessment and appraisal reports are not published, rendering the decision -making process non -transparent, and manufacturers have the right to appeal in court in the case of unfavourable decisions. With regards to in -patient pharmaceuticals, the process is different from the one outlined above for out - patient pharmaceuticals. Each hospital company (i.e. public and p rivate limited not -for-profit hospitals46) within a federal state has a pharmaceutical commission ( Arzneimittelkommission ), which defines the list of drugs to be used at their respective hospital(s). Each hospital can either have their own list, or the hosp ital company can make the list binding for all its hospitals. The task of the pharmaceutical commission is to create and adapt the list for inpatient pharmaceuticals, as well as to develop guidelines for the procurement and use of pharm aceuticals. Accordin g to \u00a719a (4 ) of the Federal Law for Hospitals and Rehabilitation Facilities (KAKuG), the development of these guidelines must take into consideration the appropriateness and cost -effectiveness of a pharmaceutical product. Specifically, of several therapeu tically equivalent pharmaceuticals, one should choose the one that constitutes th e greatest economic advantage (4 .1). However, there is no explicit obligation to perform health technology assessments. As such, hospitals may or may not employ HTA as a tool to inform decision -making. For 46 Vienna is the only region owning hospitals, which are therefore governed by the rules of Viennese administrative bodies. 214 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options instance, a recent survey has shown that merely 10% of the surveyed hospitals have reported the use of HTA (Czypionka et al., 2017). Hospital pharmaceuticals include costly interventions, such as oncology products; these are reviewed at a regional level and each hospital has its own list. Each region has a drug commission that creates the benefits catalogue for pharmaceuticals. As a result, treatments and pharmaceuticals differ across regions. Furthermore, there is no connecti on between the hospital decision - making and the 9 regional social security institutions, even though hospitals are largely financed (approx. 46%) by the social security institutions. Finally, different hospital companies and hospitals within a region may e mploy different HTA procedures and methods, leading to further cross - and intra -regional differences in access to inpatient drugs. Overall, and in what concerns hospital pharmaceuticals, HTA is not mandatory, assessments, where they take place are decentra lized and there is no uniform and/or transparent evaluation process. From an institutional standpoint, there are a number of (HTA) units of varying importance. Key among them is the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute (LBI), which is financed by research councils a nd 60% by the payers of the system: MoH (10%); Social Security Institutions (SSIs); and nine regional health funds that take care of hospitals. It conducts mostly single -technology assessments of high -tech medicines and some public health interventions. Me dical devices review is also centralised through LBI. Assessments are not economic evaluations or cost -benefit analyses but only clinical benefit analyses (similar to France and Germany) and budget impact analyses. In this context, LBI assesses the benefit s of new interventions to aid the benefits catalogue of hospitals for goods/services that require tariffs. Based on these assessments, LBI makes recommendations (primarily the assessment stage) and then political committees make the final decisions (i.e. a ppraisals). Final decisions are made publicly available. Other organisations that perform some type of HTA include Gesundheit \u00d6sterreich (G\u00d6G), Donau -Krems University (DUK), Private University for and Technology (UMIT), and Medical Univ ersity Graz (IAMEV) (see Figure 67 outlining the type of work they undertake). Some institutions are very small and each has its individual specialisa tion (e.g. in methods) and ownership structure. Therefore, there is hardly any overlap in the work undertaken. However, there is no actual body in place to prevent duplications (e.g. in some cases G\u00d6G performs quick assessments/rapid reviews and subsequent ly, the LBI institute is commissioned to perform an HTA on the same intervention, which constitutes an inefficient policy strategy). There is an informal network of Austrian HTA units, which meets once annually.

There are many decentralized decision -makers and there is no effort to create and finance a national HTA institute or an HTA board in order to establish a centralized research insti tute. Regional decision -makers also seem to prefer to make their own decisions and are against a centralized body. Although promoting efficiency in resource allocation appears difficult 218 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options in such a fragmented environment, a number of options exist to improve the coherence, transparency and functionality of the current system and, potentially, help the transition to an independent, arm's length system. These options are examined in turn. What HTA system for Austria? The current approach to HTA in Austria is fr agmented and, often, non -transparent. Addressing fragmentation would require consolidation or better coordination. The existence of multiple units undertaking HTA is not necessarily a negative development and, most certainly, it is a feature of some insura nce-based and/or decentralized health systems. Examples include Italy and Spain in this context. However, all these institutions undertaking HTA could be brought under a formal umbrella and either be consolidated into a hierarchical structure or coordinate d more effectively. Addressing non -transparency would require that assessments and appraisals are conducted in a clear, transparent and inclusive manner, whilst ensuring that recommendations are well supported by good evidence and clear reasoning. Deviatio n from available guidance would require clear reasoning and arguments. If consolidation and/or more effective coordination could in principle address the issues arising from fragmentation (and potential duplication) and non -transparency, the next question is how such consolidation and effective coordination should take place. A key international trend in this context is a clear preference for independent, arm's length HTA agencies that provide advice to decision -makers. One could, therefore, imagine a tra nsition into an independent, arm's length HTA body that undertakes HTA for different types of technology (pharmaceuticals, medical devices, surgical procedures, etc) and provides advice to the relevant decision -makers concerned. It is clear from the Austri an setting that the decision -makers vary according to the type of technology or indeed the setting in which the technology is being made available. Such coordination/ central function exists already in the context of medical devices, where LBI is taking th e lead. A comparable process may need to be generated for pharmaceuticals (both out- and in -patient) and other technologies if this does not exist. It is not uncommon for the same HTA body to be accountable to or serve different decision -makers, as reflect ed by the structure of the health care system. In France, for example, HAS is providing advice to health insurers on whether a new product should be reimbursed and is also advising separately the Ministry of Health and the Economic Committee on the pricing strategy based on incremental benefit. An important set of issues arises from a likely consolidation and coordination and relates to workload and topic selection. This is also related to the HTA process and whether this is going to be a rapid assessment or a full HTA. All these involve important trade -offs. A full HTA may be time consuming and it is certainly 219 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options an in -depth assessment of wider costs and benefits from introducing a new technology; it maybe in the interests of Austrian decision -makers to promot e a full HTA for a subset of technologies, particularly those that have important resource implications. Formal evaluations should be introduced across costly technologies and a threshold for this purpose should be established. Clarity is therefore needed on topic selection and the choice between rapid assessment and full HTA. International evidence can provide detailed steer on the criteria that can be used for this purpose. Clarity is also needed on a number of parameters regarding the conduct of HTA, suc h as type of evidence requirements and the types of evidence that can be admitted into assessment and appraisal; whether the HTA body will commission further evidence generation or conduct its own analysis, or whether it will rely on manufacturer submissio ns; guidance is needed on the comparators used in assessments; guidance is needed on the methods of assessment and the criteria - beyond costs and effects - that can be used as part of a deliberative process in the appraisal phase; the role of stakeholder involvement, particularly on issues such as scoping of assessments, consultation as part of HTA, review of draft reports, among others; the appeals process and the associated timelines; the timelines for assessment and re -assessment for rapid reviews, full HTAs and multiple HTAs (if applicable); and the monitoring and implementation of decisions. Clarity is also required on the structure and composition of the relevant committee (Technology Appraisal Committee - TAC) that will review the evidence and make b inding funding decisions. The TAC needs to reflect the stakeholder complexity in the context of each technology type, and the national -regional -local trade -offs that exist in different circumstances. HTA in pharmaceuticals deserves particular mention since it is currently internalized and follows the integrated option in Figure 68. If an independent, arm's length HTA body is not forthcoming, disclosure of out -patient drug assessments would make the current process more transparent. The introduction of an arm's length HTA body would enhance transparency of process, among other things, and would be a preferred option. In the case of in -patient p harmaceuticals, better coordination needs to take place across regions, including a transparent decision -making process. Again, the independent arm's length HTA body would be better placed to undertake this and coordinate across regions, stakeholders and e vidence, although, arguably this may take some time to materialize and build consensus. 220 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 68: Types of HTA systems Source: Kanavos, 2017. Harmonisation of benefits in Austria Differences in benefits There are four different types of differences in benefits that need to be examined, namely legally defined differences in benefits, statue based differences, de facto differences, and differences in benefits due to contractual policies. The following secti on will focus on the legal and statute based differences in benefits. Legally defined differences Please refer to Volume 2 - Legal Analysis, specifically, sections 3.2.3 to 3.2.5. Statute based differences HTA SYSTEMS Arms' length HTA body Regulatory TLV (Sweden) GBA (Germany) Advisory NICE (England) KCE (Belgium) HAS (France) IQWiG (Germany) Coordination NIHR (England) SBU (Sweden) HTA function integrated/incorpora ted Develop independent HTA function w/in insurance body Advisory INAMI (Belgium) Use HTA to inform pricing or coverage decisions Regulatory AIFA (Italy)221 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Each insurance fund in Austria specifies a st atute (Satzung), which lists the services covered by a fund. Unless the template statue, which is defined by the Main Association of the Social Insurance Carriers, renders a service obligatory, the benefits for some categories of goods and services may dif fer across funds. These differences are captured in the latest report on the different statue regulations published by the Main Association and are present in the following areas: Medical aids Therapeutic appliances Dental care o Orthodontics o Dentures Sickness payment Special sickness payment for inpatient stays Public health measures (Tick -borne encephalitis vaccine) Cost subsidies in the case that contractual regulations are not present, more specifically lump sum payments for the reimbursement of medic al costs o Non -medical psychotherapy o Ergotherapy o Medical home care o Physiotherapy o Logopedics o Freelance massage therapy o Medical and therapeutic aids o Paediatric nurses o Diagnosis through clinical psychologists o Other Travel (journey) costs Transportation costs. The following section provides an overview of the statute -based differences in benefits across funds (please see Table 29), as well as further descriptions of the differences in benefits for goods or services with significant variations across carriers, including medical aids, therapeutic appliances, dental care, sickness pay, TBE -vaccination, travel (journey) costs, and other ser vices such as psychotherapy, 222 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options physiotherapy, ergotherapy and logopedics. It must b e noted that in line with \u00a7131b (1) ASVG, the allowance amount offered to the insured for using non -contracted services depends on the financial situation of the funds as well as the economic need of the insured, which explains some of the current differences in the size of benefits across funds. Table 29: Statute -based differences in benefits across insurance funds Good(s)/Service(s) Differences in benefits in -kind/in -cash across the insurance funds Medical aids Allowances vary between the 3 - and 8 -fold amount of the maxi mum contribution base of 166 EUR, i.e. between 498 EUR and 1,328 EUR. Therapeutic appliances Allowances vary between the 3 - and 8 -fold amount of the maximum contribution base of 166 EUR, i.e. between 498 EUR and 1,328 EUR. Allowances for therapeutic aids that are suited to replace functions of missing or deficient body parts, vary between 3 - and 20 -fold amount of the maximum contribution base, i.e. 498 EUR and 3,320 EUR. Dental care (orthodontics and dentures) Orthodontics : Patient contribution range s between 10% and 50% per year of treatment and repair - for contractually agreed tariffs. Funds may reimburse 50% to 100% per year of treatment and repair - for non-contractually agreed tariffs. Some funds, such as the VAEB, BVA, SVA and SVB may reimburs e a fixed annual amount for specific treatments. Dentures : Patient contributions for acrylic resin dentures, metal framework dentures, full metal crowns on clip teeth and veneered metal -ceramic crowns for partial dentures and their repairs range from 10% to 50% of the contractually agreed tariff rates. Sickness payment The number of weeks covered is between 26 and 78 weeks. Generally carriers cover 52 weeks. Special sickness payment for inpatient stays Currently not provided by WGKK, KGKK, TGKK, BVA and BKK Zeltweg. TBE-vaccine Allowances range between 2 EUR and 19 EUR. 223 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Good(s)/Service(s) Differences in benefits in -kind/in -cash across the insurance funds Travel (journey) costs WGKK, N\u00d6GKK, BGKK, KGKK, TGKK, BKK Wiener Verkehrsbetriebe. The coverage across the remaining carriers ranges between 0.07 and 0.10 EUR per kilometre for journeys without an accompanying persons and between 0.11 and 0.24 EUR per kilometre for journeys with an accompanying person. Some funds include additional criteria for reimbursement, such as specification of the type of service for which journey costs are covered. Transportation costs Not all carriers cover the transportation costs and among those that do, allowances may vary. The following carriers do not provide allowances: VGKK, VAEB, BKK Mondi, and BKK Zeltweg. A number of carriers do n ot provide allowances, except for in specific circumstances or cover a specific percentage of the tariff cost: N\u00d6GKK, BVA and SVA. The remaining funds offer allowances per route equal to the amount of the prescription charge. However, some funds may speci fy conditions, or provide allowances that are twice as high as the prescription charge. Reimbursement of non -contracted services: Non -medical psychotherapy E.g. allowances range between 8.72 EUR and 15 EUR for 30 min sessions. There are additional diffe rences in contingents of benefits in kind. Ergo therapy E.g. allowances range between 12.72 EUR and 29 EUR for 30 -minute sessions. There are additional differences in contingents of benefits in kind. Physiotherapy Differences in the reimbursement of single vs. group sessions and in the type of therapies, in addition to differences in allowances. There are additional differences in contingents of benefits in kind. Logopedics Covered range between 14.53 EUR and 22.09 EUR for a 30 -minute session. 224 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Good(s)/Service(s) Differences in benefits in -kind/in -cash across the insurance funds Medical home care aining carriers vary between 4.36 EUR and 8.72 EUR per visit. Freelance massage therapy All carriers, except for the SGKK, TGKK, VGKK and the SVA, have adopted the allowance amount for freelance massage therapy, as specified in the template statute. The remaining carriers have specified different allowances and/or may cover additional services, such as lymph drainage. Medical and therapeutic aids Not covered by SGKK, TGKK, VGKK. Some funds cover between 75% and 80% of the billing amount, deducting the patient contribution. Other carriers define benefits on a case -by-case basis or set the amount of the allowance equal to a comparable tariff service. Paediatric nurses Not the remaining insurance funds ranges between 4.36 EUR and 12 EUR during the day per case and day of care. Diagnosis through clinical psychologies Partial coverage of 14.53 EUR only available for VGKK and BKK Wiener V erkehrsbetriebe. Other In addition to the above listed types of services, there are several other services, for which some of the funds offer benefits. These services include, e.g. acupuncture, midwife consultations, sonography, and CT -guided nerve root infiltration. 1. Medical aids Medical aids are regulated through \u00a7137 ASVG and include, among others, glasses, contact lenses, orthopaedic arch support, trusses and wheelchairs. The coverage for this category of goods varies substantially between carriers, with differences in benefits being legally defined with reference to the statute. For instance, \u00a7137 (5) stipulates that insurance carriers cannot bear costs for medical aids that 225 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options exceed a ceiling amount defined in the carrier's statue. The statute can either define a uniform ceiling for all medical aids or different ceilings for specific types of medical aids, however, as stated in \u00a7108 (3), the ceiling may not exceed the 10 -fold amount of the maximum contribution base ( HBG ) of 166 EUR, which amounts to 1,660.00 EUR and refers to the monthly demand. In the case of allowances for medical aids, the template statute provides for a bandwidth that ranges between the 3 - and 8 -fold amount of the maximum contribution base of 166 EUR, i.e. between 498 EUR and 1,328 EUR. However, in the case of contact lenses the lower bandwidth may be decreased to e.g. the 1-fold amount of the maximum contribution base. This translates into some of the funds bearing costs that are three times the amount of the maximum contribution base, such as the WGKK, N\u00d6GKK, StGKK, KGKK, BVA, SVA and SVB cover the 8 - fold amount of the maximum contribution base, amounting to a difference of up to 830 EUR per insured person (please see the table below for a detaile d list). Table 30: Differences in the coverage of costs of medical aids across insurance funds Insurance carrier Ceilings for the coverage of medical costs (based on the maximum contribution base (HBG) of 166 EUR) Ceilings BGKK 5-fold the HBG *5-fold amount of the HBG In addition, it should be noted that the user charges differ between the fund for the self -employed (i.e. SVA), which is regulated through the GSVG, and all other funds. As such, the user charges for SVA -insured 226 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options persons amount to 20% of the medical aids co sts (at least 20% of the maximum contribution base (HBG), i.e. 33.20 EUR; at least 60% of the maximum contribution base (HBG), i.e. 99.60 EUR for visual aids), while those of all other funds amount to 10% of the medical costs (at least 20% of the maximum c ontribution base (HBG), i.e. 33.20 EUR; at least 60% of the maximum contribution base (HBG), i.e. 99.60 EUR for visual aids). 2. Therapeutic appliances As stipulated in \u00a7154 ASVG, allowances for therapeutic appliances in the case of mutilations, disfigureme nt and physical deficiency may be specified in the statue insofar as there is no claim from the statutory accident insurance or entitlement to benefits in kind as part of the medical rehabilitation measures. Both the federal states or the social insurance can be in charge of the coverage of therapeutic aids, and depending on the case, responsibility may be borne by the accident, pension or health insurance. Thus, the law does not provide for benefits in kind, except in the case of medical rehabilitation. In practice, however, there are in some cases contracts for benefits in kind that define tariff rates, although levels of patient contributions may vary across carriers. Similarly to medical aids, the allowances for this category of goods vary substantially between carriers, with differences in benefits being legally defined with reference to the statute. The allowance comes to 90% (80% in the case of the SVA) of the medical costs, however, it cannot exceed the ceiling amount specified in the statute. Since 2016, this ceiling ranges between the 3 - and 8 -fold amount of the maximum contribution base of 166 EUR, i.e. between 498 EUR and 1,328 EUR. However, in the case of therapeutic aids that are suited to replace functions of missing or deficient body parts, th e ceiling can vary substantially between funds, ranging between the 3 - and 20 -fold amount of the maximum contribution base of 166 EUR, i.e. between 498 EUR and 3,320 EUR. For instance, regional funds such as the WGKK and TGKK provide allowances of up to 49 8 EUR, while the N\u00d6GKK, \u00d6OGKK and SGKK can provide benefits in cash of up to 3,320 EUR (please see the table below for a detailed list), amounting to a difference of up to 2,822 EUR between some funds Table 31: Differences in the p rovision of allowances for general therapeutic appliances across insurance funds Insurance carrier Ceilings for the provision of allowances for general therapeutic aids (based on the maximum contribution base (HBG) of 166 EUR) WGKK N\u00d6GKK TGKK 3-fold amount of the HBG 227 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Insurance carrier Ceilings for the provision of allowances for general therapeutic aids (based on the maximum contribution base (HBG) of 166 EUR) BKK Table 32: Differences in the provision of allowances for specific therapeutic aids across insurance funds Insurance carrier Ceilings for the provision of allowances for therapeutic aids that are suited to repla ce functions of missing or deficient body parts (based on the maximum contribution base (HBG) of 166 EUR) WGKK HBG 228 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Insurance carrier Ceilings for the provision of allowances for therapeutic aids that are suited to repla ce functions of missing or deficient body parts (based on the maximum contribution base (HBG) of 166 EUR) BKK voestalpine Bahnsysteme BKK Zeltweg 3. Dental care The statutes pertaining to dental care are for the most part harmonised across funds and there is a nationwide uniform contract and fee schedule for conservative surgical services. In addition, since 2015 all children and adolescents until the age of 18, who suffer from severe tooth displacements (=IOTN -4 and IOTN -5), are elig ible for free dental braces, regardless of their fund affiliation. However, in the case of orthodontics for adults or dentures there may be significant differences in patient contributions or allowances across funds, as specified in the statu tes. For insta nce, patient contributions for orthodontic services for insured persons over the age of 18 may range between 10% and 50% of the contractual tariff rate. In case of treatments without contractually agreed tariffs, insurance funds may reimburse 50% to 100% o f the treatment or repair costs. In addition, some funds, such as the VAEB, BVA, SVA and SVB may reimburse a fixed annual amount for specific treatments. Please see the table below for further reference. Table 33: Differences in pa tient contributions for orthodontic treatments (excluding repairs) with contractually agreed tariffs across insurance funds Insurance carrier Patient contributions as a percentage of the contractually agreed tariff rate per Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options When it comes to dentures, similar differences across funds prevail. For example, patient contributions for acrylic resin dentures, metal framework dentures, full metal crowns on clip teeth and veneered metal - ceramic crowns for partial dentures and their r epairs range from 10% to 50% of the contractually agreed tariff rates. Table 34 provides an overview of the differences across carriers for acrylic res in dentures as an example. Table 34: Differences in patient contributions for acrylic resin dentures (excluding repairs) with contractually agreed tariffs across insurance funds 4. Sickness payment In the event of illness -related incapacity to work, all insurance carriers, except for the SVA, provide sickness benefits for up to 52 weeks. In addition, the for the possibility to extend sickness pay from 52 to 78 weeks, while the BVA offers to pay a maximum of 78 weeks of sickness benefit to all of its insured persons. In contrast, BKK carrier Patient contributions as a percentage of the contractually agreed tariff rate per International comparisons and policy options the SVA offers a support benefit starting on the 43rd day of work absence and which is paid for a max imum of 20 weeks. This benefit amounts to 29.46 EUR per day. In addition to this support benefit, the SVA may cover up to 26 weeks of sick pay in the case of voluntary supplementary insurance. Insured persons pay a 2.5% contribution rate and can make use o f the benefit once the individual has been four days absent from work. The extension of sickness benefit from 52 weeks to a maximum of 78 weeks can be achieved through a change in the statue (p lease see Table 35 for an overview of the differences across carriers). Table 35: Differences in the coverage of sickness payment across insurance carriers Insurance carrier Maximum duration of the provision of sickness payment SVA (*Only with supplementary weeks 5. Special sickness payment for inpatient stays In the case of necessary, inevitable inpatient stays47 at hospitals, as well as rehabilitation centres as part of the follow -up treatment, ten of the health insurance carriers pay special sickness benefits, while five do not provide the benefit (please refer to the table below for an overview). 47 The entitlement to special sickness benefits for inp atient stays is subject to further regulations. Please refer to \u00a730 of the insurance fund statutes. 231 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 36: Differences in the coverage of special sickness payment for inpatient stays across insurance carriers Insurance carrier Benefit provided for in the TBE -vaccine Health insurance funds provide allowances for the insured and their dependents for the costs of tick - borne encephalitis (TBE -) vaccine, which may range between 2 EUR and 3.70 EUR across regional funds, between 3.70 EUR and 16 EUR for national funds and bet ween 2 EUR and 19 EUR across all insurance carriers (please see the table below for an overview of the different allowances across funds). Table 37: Differences in the allowances of TBE -vaccination across insurance carriers Insurance carrier Allowance in EUR 48 Implementation of special sickness pay is not appropriate. 49 Implementation of special sickness pay is planned. 232 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Insurance carrier Allowance in EUR for the TBE -vaccination costs) Mondi 19.00 EUR 7. Travel (journey) costs A number of regional funds do not cover travel journey costs (please see Table 10 for a detailed overview). With the exception of SVB an d BKK Zeltweg, the remaining funds offer reimbursement at 0.09 EUR per kilometre for journeys without an accompanying person and 0.14 EUR per kilometre for journeys with accompanying persons. The SVB offers 0.10 EUR per kilometre, however, this is only app licable to journeys for preventive check -ups and public health measures for ill health prevention. Furthermore, the SVB does not pay benefits in the case of journeys with an accompanying person Table 38: Differences in the coverage of travel (journey) costs across carriers Insurance carrier Allowance in EUR per kilometre for journeys without an accompanying person Allowance in EUR per kilometre for journeys with an EUR) BKK Zeltweg SVB (*only for preventive check -ups and public health measures for ill health prevention; does not pay benefits in the case of journeys with an accompanying person.) 0.10 EUR 0.15 EUR 233 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 8. Psychotherapy, physiotherapy, ergotherapy and logopedics The statute outlines differences in benefits for psychotherapy, physiother apy, ergotherapy and logopedics provided by non -contracted health professionals. As such differences can be found in the reimbursement of single vs. group sessions and in the type of therapies, and allowances. For instance, allowances for ergotherapy range between 12.72 EUR and 29 EUR for 30 -minute sessions, and between 8.72 EUR and 15 EUR for 30 -minute psychotherapy sessions (excluding psychologists). Allowances for logopedics treatments at non -contracted health professionals are currently provided BGK K, SGKK, BKK Kapfenberg and BKK voestalpine Bahnsysteme only. However, it must be noted that allowances for non -contracted health professionals may correspond to the level of benefits -in-kind provided by the respective carriers, which depend on the number of health professionals they have contracts with. Therefore, a high allowance for non -contracted professionals may also imply lower benefits -in-kind. Hence, there are additional differences in contingents of benefits in kind, which are not captured in the statutes and which need to be examined, in order to harmonise benefits for these services. Cost of harmonising benefits across funds Methodology The scope and level of per capita expenditures for the use of statute -defined benefits vary across funds and types of services. However, these differences in expenditure do not necessarily reflect cross -carrier differences in benefits, as there are number of additional factors that can influence the former, including the risk structure of the insured population, variations in tariffs, differences in entitlement to benefits, authorisation regimes, service form and quantity. As such, a higher per capita expen diture does not necessarily imply better benefits for the insured, and individual -based data may constitute a more sophisticated basis for an analysis of differences in risk structures and benefits across carriers. However, due to data limitations, this st udy proceeds with a comparison based on cross -carrier variations in per capita expenditures. The following section highlights differences in the per capita expenditures across carriers for medical aids, therapeutic devices and dentures, using data from th e official income statements of carriers for the year 2015 that are provided by the Main Association of the Social Insurance Carriers. Data for psychotherapy, physiotherapy and logopedics was obtained from the HVSVs Einzelnachweisung \u00e4rztlicher Hilfe for t he year 2015 and the average per capita expenditures include both contracted and non -contracted health 234 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options professionals. In order to estimate the initial costs of harmonisation for specific goods or services, unadjusted and risk -adjusted calculations were per formed. For the unadjusted calculations, we present the range and average of per capita expenditures for benefits - in-kind and in cash across funds. Following, we introduce a number of different expenditure floors and increase the per capita expenditure (P CE) of those funds, where expenditure levels are below the newly defined floor. However, if a fund's per capita expenditure is greater than that of the newly introduced floor, then the fund's expenditure levels are not lowered. These artificial per capita expenditures of a fund are then multiplied with the number of insured persons in order to obtain an estimate of the total expenditure of a carrier for a good or service when levels of benefits are raised. Two different floors were employed for this exerci se: (1) the average expenditure across all funds and (2) 70% of the highest per capita expenditure within a category of goods or services. At last, the total floor - based expenditures are aggregated across funds and compared to the present overall expenditu res for specific goods or services. The difference between those two overall expenditures constitutes a basic bandwidth estimation of the cost of increasing benefit levels, which would resemble a partial or complete harmonisation of services across funds, depending on the type of artificial floor used for the calculation (please see Table 39 for results). However, a number of limitations prevail. For instance, it must be noted that the income statement includes data on dental treatment and dentures, however, does not specify the costs of orthodontic care. Therefore, the present calculations only refer to th e cost of harmonising dentures across funds. Furthermore, the cost of harmonising allowances for transportation costs were not included due to significant regional and geographical differences in proximity to health care facilities, which may undermine act ual differences in per capita expenditures. In addition, recent policy developments have taken into consideration the differences in benefits for transportation costs and include the aim to harmonise patient contributions for transportations pertaining to specific treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, dialysis and emergency transport, among others. Similarly, the costs of harmonising sickness pay were excluded, as not only the social insurance entitlements, but also the labour law entitlements vary across carriers. Hence, merely extending the duration for which insured are entitled to social insurance sickness pay would not take into account variations in labour law entitlements, which may explain differences in the duration of sick pay entitlem ents. In addition, some funds offer to pay allowances for a longer time period due to the low number of insured patients applying for the benefit. Last, it must me emphasised that the cost bandwidths 235 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options are based on unadjusted calculations that do not take in to account any of the previously mentioned influencing factors, such as risk structures and variations in tariffs. Thus, the higher expenditure floors may over - or underestimate actual costs and are not necessarily synonymous to efficient levels of expendi ture. Therefore, where possible, a sensitivity analysis is performed in which per capita expenditures of funds are risk -adjusted for age and gender. First, the total expenditures for specific goods or services are calculated for each risk group within the respective carriers. As this information is not available in the income statements, the distribution of total expenditures across age and gender groups for medical aids and therapeutic appliances is derived from the LIVE dataset, which enables the calcula tion of age -and gender -adjusted per capita expenditures. The LIVE database is a product that collects information on the costs of the health insurance benefits used by the insured, who receive a yearly statement on the former. The data encompasses all carr iers except for the SVA and VAEB, who run separate systems to collect data in order to inform their members about the annual use of benefits. Following, the risk -adjusted per capita expenditures are raised to one of the two artificial fl oors, as previously described. However, there are limitations to this sensitivity analysis. For once, it is noteworthy that total expenditures for the same category of goods or services differ between these two datasets. For example, the income statement reports a total exp enditure of 729,111,510 Mio for dental care and dentures, while 702,601,048 Mio are reported in LIVE. On the other hand, the total expenditure for medical aids and therapeutic appliances is with 494,808,415 Mio significantly higher in LIVE compared to the 191,691,415 Mio reported in the income statement, despite not even including data for the SVA and VAEB. Therefore, the LIVE distribution of expenditures across age and gender may not reflect the actual distribution corresponding to the income statement. Fu rthermore, LIVE data on distributions of use across risk groups are only available for medical aids and therapeutic, as the remaining categories do not apply to the previously identified statue -based differences. Last, the per capita distributions across r isk groups for dental care combine both dental care and dentures in LIVE. Given that the focus lies on dentures only and that the per capita distribution for dental care is most likely to differ significantly from that of dentures, no risk -adjustment is pe rformed. In addition, there are a number of other population risks that may exacerbate variations in per capita expenditures and which ought to be adjusted for, such as income levels and employment status. Furthermore, there are several additional factors that should be accounted for besides the risk structure of the insured population, in order to approximate the actual costs of harmonising benefits. Therefore, a 236 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options risk-adjustment that accounts for the effects of age and gender on per capita expenditures ma y somewhat improve cost estimations of harmonising benefits, however, it is not sufficient to approximate actual costs. Results As presented in Table 39, the per capita expenditures for medical aids and therapeutic appliances, dentures, psychotherapy, physiotherapy and logopedics vary significantly between funds. However, as previously emphasised, the differences may be due to several factors that canno t be accounted for in the present calculations, such as risk structure of the insured population, variations in tariffs, differences in entitlement to benefits, authorisation regimes, service form and quantity, and therefore should be considered with cauti on. Following the introduction of two artificial expenditure floors, a n unadjusted cost of harmonising benefits across specific goods and services was calculated (please refer to Table 40 and Table 41 for the cost of harmonising benefits). The initial calculations, which do not account for a number of significant influencing factors, may provide an initial guidance to approximate costs of a partial harmonisation, however, the results may deviate to a significant extent from the actual costs, unless further adjustments are made. Based on the initial c alculations, raising the per capita expenditure (PCE) of those regional funds whose PCE lies below the average PCE -level of all funds, would come at a cost of EUR 148.653.819 Mio, while raising the PCE of all carriers to the average PCE is estimated to cos t EUR 171.075.130. In comparison, increasing per capita expenditures to a level that equals 70% of the currently highest PCE could come at a cost that is approximately 2.2 times higher than the cost of introducing the artificial floor 1. For instance, rai sing the PCEs of funds that currently have an expenditure level below floor 2 is estimated at a cost of EUR 327.763.167 Mio and EUR 390.117.440 Mio, when harmonising across regional funds and across all funds respectively (please see Table 42). Furthermore, when taking into account the age and gender risk -structures of the funds (except for SVA and VAEB, as data is not included in LIVE) for medical aid s and therapeutic appliances, the estimated costs of harmonising benefits deviate from the unadjusted calculations, ranging between an additional EUR 3.9 and 6.6 Mio. Cost may further deviate if calculations are adjusted for additional risks, such as incom e, and for the remaining goods and services other than medical aids and therapeutic appliances. Please see Table 40 and Table 41 for an overview of the cost of a partial harmonisation. 237 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Overall, the pres ent total expenditure for the described goods and services is estimated to increase between 0.194% (floor 1) and 0.428% (floor 2) if benefits are harmonised across regional funds only, and between 0.223% (floor 1) and 0.509% (floor 2) if goods and services are expanded across all health insurance carriers. However, as previously mentioned, these values need to be cautiously examined due to the presence of other influencing factors that could not be accounted for. Please see Table 43 and Table 44 for a detailed overview of the total expenditures across different floors post harmonising benefits.

This refers in particular to the regional funds, for which contribution rates are already harmonised, as well as the care system of the federal and regional public servants and company funds. In consideration of the differences in benefits that are perceived and criticised by the insured community, a decree was issued by the Tr\u00e4gerkonferenz in October 2016, followed by a set -up of a working group to address the present variations in benefits across health insurance carriers. The working group has identified 23 goods and services that are to be harmonised in a gradual manner, of which the following eleven goods and services are to be addressed in the first phase: TBE -vaccine, PSA test, transportation 241 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options costs (i.e. patient contributions), endovaginal sonography, wheelchairs, absorbent incontin ence products (e.g. diapers and pads), blood glucose test strip, FreeStyle Libre, orthodontic services, sickness pay (i.e. family allowances) and special sickness pay for inpatient stays. Furthermore, a report was published as part of the Tr\u00e4gerkonferenz on 13 June, in which carriers have agreed to expand the provision of benefits for psychotherapeutic services by one -fourth. The aim is to extend provision of care from 65,000 patients in 2015 to more than 78,000 patients in 2019 and to grant access to mult i-professional health care facilities for an additional 3,500 children and adolescents. Although each carrier specifies their own targets for psychotherapeutic services, the recent developments provide a good example of cross -carrier coordination efforts t o define and aspire towards a common goal of extending and to some extent harmonising the provision of benefits to the insured. These developments are central to improving access to and provision of goods and services, and ought to be gradually expanded across other areas, where differences persist. This chapter has described a number of such areas, including legally and statue based differences in benefits across funds that are identifiable and of relevance to the insured. For instance, significant varia tions exist in the coverage of costs of medical aids and therapeutic appliances, patient contributions and allowances for dentures and orthodontics, the maximum duration for which sickness pay is granted and allowances for other services such as psychother apy, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, and logopedics. In addition to identifying areas for harmonisation, the financial impact on insurance carriers needs to be assessed as well. This study has attempted to provide initial cost estimations by introducing a num ber of expenditure floors to raise and concurrently harmonise the level of benefits in form of per capita expenditures across funds, by increasing the expenditure levels of those funds that are e.g. below the average per capita expenditures. Although the e stimated costs need to be considered with caution, as there are a number of influencing factors that could not be accounted for due to data limitations (e.g. variations in tariff rates), the estimated cost bandwidths may provide initial insights into the p ossible financial impact on insurance carriers and may guide the prioritisation of categories of goods and services that are to be harmonised in the initial stages. In addition, it is highly suggested to take into consideration and perform additional stud ies that account for influencing factors, such as tariff rates, population risk - factors and volume, in order to further assess and determine actual differences in benefits and to approximate the true costs of a harmonisation. Furthermore, a unified colle ction of high -quality data that is comparable across funds is of central importance to supporting the harmonisation of benefits. Although there have been significant 242 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options developments in recent years to improve the quality of data, a number of limitations preva il that may undermine cross -carrier comparability. For once, billing periods, which can be monthly or quarterly, differ across funds and consequently produce incomparable data. Moreover, the relatively large number multiple insured obscures expenditure rat ios. Therefore, further efforts are required to ensure uniform data storage and structure. One example would be to extend the LIVE database to the SVA and VAEB, in order to collect comprehensive and comparable information on expenditures across risk classe s, such as age and gender. The harmonisation of benefits across areas of concern to the insured is an important step forward and one that needs to be gradually co ntinued. However, in the longer -term evidence -based mechanisms, such as health technology ass essments, should be employed and fostered to define benefits packages, in order to inform reimbursement and coverage decisions that promote and extend the provision of (cost -) effective, safe and qualitative goods and services, while simultaneously ensurin g the financial sustainability of the health care system. In addition to harmonising benefits, there are other areas that need to be considered and addressed as part of the aim to improve equity and access to care. For instance, these include structural i nequalities due to current contracting policies and the availability of resources. Legal considerations Most of the distinctions between the different branches of the Austrian health care system with respect to services and benefits in kind could be har monised by legal acts passed by the national Parliament (even without a 2/3 -majority). This would be possible as long as there is no intensive and/or sudden reduction compared with the entitlement as it was before, which would be a violation of the constit utional principle of 'Vertrau ensschutz'. Legal interventions aiming to harmonisation of benefits could be a problem, too, as far as existing general contracts (e.g. those with the Chambers of Physicians ) are con cerned. Such interventions can be justifie d under constitutional law, however, by 'public interest', (which could be assumed basically with respect to harmonisation measures) as long as the respective intervention is appropriate From a legal point of view the easiest way of harmonisation could be pursued by the different health insurance carriers themselves by coordinating their respective 'Satzungen' which would be possible with regards to all services and benefits that are not strictly determined by legislation. 243 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The same applies to the 'Mustersa tzung' released by the 'Hauptverband', which is authorised to declare certain (but - at present - not all) provisions of that Muster satzung as binding. Harmonisation measures could be pursued most of all by wide ning the scope of those binding provisions as laid down in the Mustersatzung by co vering all health insurance carriers which is subject, though, to unanimity in the 'Tr\u00e4gerkonferenz', and thus, requiring the consent of all carriers. Harmonisation with respect to the 'Krankenf\u00fcrsorgeanstalten' is m uch more dif ficult as they are based on regional law which is under the competencies of the Re gional Parliaments ('Landtage'). So covering the KFAs, too, would require an amendment to the Federal Constitution or at least coordinated legal acts passed by each Landtag. (For details see Volume 2 chapter 3.3.). Summary of policy options: Harmonisation of benefits With the aim to initiate a process of harmonisation of benefits in Austria, recent developments have focused on a select choice of 23 goods and se rvices that are to be adjusted across insurance carriers in the coming future. Building on these developments, this study has provided an initial estimation of costs for three broad categories of goods or services, which differ in the scope and level of pe r capita expenditures across insurance funds. However, a main driver of these cross -carrier variations constitutes the difference in tariffs. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted that account for this influencing factor. While this study provi des initial cost calculations, the harmonisation of benefits is a political decision to be taken by the government and stakeholders. Even though a harmonisation of benefits is central to ensuring equity, it is noteworthy that Austria has one of the lowest levels of unmet need in Europe, as identified in an international analysis of trends in Chapter 3 of this report. Although some European countries have more comprehensive and uniform benefits packages, they have experienced higher levels of unmet medical n eed than in Austria. This is because there are a number of other important factors to equity, including access to care and the level of user charges, which are not considered major challenges within the Austrian environment. There are a number of financin g options in the case of a political decision to harmonise benefits. (1) Partial funding could ensue through a risk -adjustment scheme, or enhanced risk -adjustment scheme, as outlined in the opti ons in section 4.2.7 (2) Alternatively, or in addition, government funds could be directed to 244 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options insurance carriers that offer a slightly less comprehensive benefits package compared to other funds. (3) Further fu nds could be directed to the project by improving efficiency in the system. For instance, a reduction in hospitalisations could lead to significant savings. However, significant investments in outpatient and primary care are required in the first instance to maintain high -quality care, whilst simultaneously reducing hospital admissions, meaning that savings to be used for a harmonisation could be generated in the mid - to long -term. (4) In addition, better coordination and consolidation could also lead to ef ficiency gains, which could be directed in the form of savings to increase coverage of benefits in Austria. User charges Cost -sharing, theoretically, can improve healthcare efficiency through three main channels (see Figure 69). First , by ex posing the patient to price, a rational individual will only consume care that is of high -value and cost -effective. As outlined within Gemmill et al . (2008), any reduction in co nsumption of healthcare as a result of user charges is seen to contribute to allocative efficiency, irrespective of the impact on vulnerable groups and health outcomes (182) . Second , a reduction in healthcare consumption due to user charges assists in containing expenditure. Third , user charges can raise revenue if they are set at a rate that does not significantly deter utilisation. This last argument is more relevant in low -income countries where public funds may not be sufficient to supply adequate levels of healthcare. In such setting s, injections from private resources can improve overall health, given vulnerable groups are exempt (182) . Despite the above three arguments, there is increasing empirical evidence50 to suggest user charges may have the opposite effect. In regard to improvements in allocative efficiency, research has shown that patients do not have the knowledge to distinguish between high - and low -value care, leading to a reduction in both necessary and unnecessary care. By delaying or forgoing necessary care, patient outcomes are likely to worsen, therefore leading to greater long -term healthcare costs. Lastly, the ability of user charges to raise revenue is limited by exemption policies, which are needed to protect vulnerable groups (e.g. elderly and/or chronically ill). Specifically, since vulnerable groups consume a disproportionally greater amount of healthcare services, user charges are unlikely to significantly impact revenue. Without exemptio ns, user charges would effectively act as a 'tax on the ill' (182) . 50 Evidence and aligning references includ ed in the remainder of the report. 245 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 69: Efficiency argument for user charges Source: Adapted from (182) As outlined above, there i s limited evidence on the positive impact user charges have on efficiency. Instead of abandoning cost -sharing, policy -makers have instead begun to link user -charges with incentives to encourage a reduction in low -value care only (i.e. value -based user char ges) (183) . Given the patient's lack o f medical knowledge, this translates into taking the decision of what is considered high -value care away from patients and to external experts. A number of countries across Europe and the US currently employ various forms of value -base d user charges, which are most common within the outpatient drug market (183) . The remainder of this section explores the types of user charges, case studies in the European context, the impact of user charges, value -based user charges, and concludes with an overview of policy options. Types of user charges and incentives User charges can be applied to patients directly, which requires a financial payment for certain health care goods or services, or indirectly through top up payments if only a fixed rate for a drug or service are reimbursed (see Table 45 and 46 below ). Commonly used direct and indirect user charges have been outlined in the tables below, including associated patient incentives. 246 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 45: Direct user charges and associated incentives Type of user charge Definition Incentive Co-payments Paying a fixed fee of the medical good or service . Patient may reduce volume of services. Regarding drugs, patients may reduce the number of prescriptions, while simultaneously increase the size of the prescription. No incentive to switch to cheaper products unless co -payment differs. Co-insurance Paying a fixed proportion of the cost of the medical good or service . Patient may reduce volume of services, and there is an incentive to switch to a cheaper product. Deductible When an insured person is liable to pay up to a certain threshold of costs, before the insurance takes on a certain amount or proportion of the costs . When close to the deductible, there is an incentive to increase consumption of services to reach threshold. When not close, patient s have an incentive to reduce consumption and/or switch to a cheaper product.

Patient less likely to consume a product that is above the reference price. Incentive to switch to a cheaper, generic product. Extra / balance billing Users have to pay the difference between the amount the payer is willing to reimburse and the price charged by the provider . Patient has an incentive to consume products/services that the health insurance will reimburse in full. Multi -tiered formularies (prescription drugs) Typically involve 2 -3 layers which are associated with different co - payment levels (e.g. first tier usually generics with low co - payment). Incentive for the patient to switch to generic products. Source: (182) User charges in European Social Health Insurance Systems The share of OOP spending within total health expenditure (THE) differs significantly across countries with SHIs in Europe. Swiss citizens currently pay the greatest proportion of OOP, followed by Belgium and Austria. France and the Netherlands, have relatively low OOP expenses, at 6.4% and 5.2% of THE, respectively (184) . In France, this is due to the high proportion of the population covered by private health insurance to cover additional expenses, whi le in the Netherlands, the figure excludes the annual \u20ac385 deductible. 248 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 47: Out of pocket spending of total health expenditure (%) (2014) Country OOP as a % of THE Switzerland 26.8 Belgium 17.8 Austria 16.1 Germany 13.2 Luxembourg 10.6 France 6.4 Netherlands * 5.2 OECD 13.6 High -income 13.3 Source: (184) . Note: *Excludes the \u20ac385 deductible. In all European countries with SHI systems, cost -sharing is applied to acute inpatient care and pharmaceutical sector. At the outpatient level, cost -sharing is employed in all countries except Austria and Germany. Deductibles are less common with only the Netherlands and Switzerland enforcing such a mechanism (185,186) .

International case studies France Outpatient: \u20ac1 as well as between 30% to 70% o f costs, depending if they are registered with a physician or specialists or not, and if they are referred to a specialist or not Inpatient : \u20ac18 a day, and \u20ac13.50 for patients who require psychiatric facilities (if the procedure is not costly, then a 20% co -insurance rate applies, as op posed to a \u20ac18 a day fee) Pharmaceuticals: \u20ac0.50 per drug box, in addition to a subgroup specific cost -sharing rate France's health expenditure not covered by SHI is covered either by voluntary health insurance or by patients (187) . What makes France stand out is its voluntary health insurance system which covers user charges (while contracts differ, on average they voluntary health insurance covers around 50% of charges) (187) . Thus the existence of voluntary health insurance explains the relatively low OOP spending at just 6.2% of THE in 2014 (the lowest of all OECD countries) (184) . 251 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In France, cost -sharing is required for all four categories: acute inp atient care, primary care, outpatient specialists, and outpatient prescription drugs (185) , as well as any type of care not included in the SHI positive list (187) .51 Co-payments are required in acute patient care in terms of payments per day as well as a catering fee. Specifically, patients are required to pay \u20ac18 a day, this figure falls to \u20ac13.50 for patients who require psychiatric facilities (185) . In primary car e, a copayment of \u20ac1 is required, as well as 30% of costs if individuals are registered with a physician and 70% if they are not (185) .52 Specifically, patients who are registered with the GP are required to pay 30% of \u20ac25 (i.e. \u20ac 7.50) plus an additional \u20ac1 (185) . For utilisation of outpatient specialist care, patients also pay \u20ac1 as well as 30% of costs or 70% of costs, depending if they were referred to see the specialists or not (higher co -insurance rate for those who are not referred) (185) . Certain specialist areas do not require referrals, so cost sharing is always 30% for gynecologists, ophthalmologists, psychiatrists and neuropsychiatrists (185) . Outpatient prescription drugs are subject to a copayment of \u20ac0.50 per drug box, in addition to a subgroup specific cost -sharing rate (185) . This is determined by the Service Medial Rendu (SMR), a rating determined by the severity of the pathology of the medication's primary indication and by the efficacy and tolerance of the drug (0%, 35, 70%, 85%) (lower copayment for necessary, more serious treatments) (185,187) . The \u20ac0.50 or \u20ac1 payments are, despite their traditional meaning, sometimes referred to as deductibles - they are the value that is subtracted from the amount that the patient would otherwise be reimbursed (187) . Extra -billing is also prominent among specialist doctors, and to a lesser extent, GPs in private practices. At present, approximately 50% of specialists and 8% of GPs have the right to bill over t he official tariff rate. There are various protection/exemption mechanisms in place. For example, as the system is based on direct payments, that is paying now and being reimbursed later, there are exemptions in place for low income families (beneficiarie s of CMU -C, ACS and AME insurance) and particularly expensive care, such that the patient is not required to pay in advance of being reimbursed (187) . Such immediate third party 51 Positive lists outline drugs that are reimbursed. Any products not in the positive list, must be paid in full by the patient. 52 In France, since 2004 (Medicin Traitan), patients are required to sign with a physician, either a specialist or GP (depends on the patient's preference). The vast majority (approx. 99%) register with a GP. 252 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options payments have recently been extended (2016) to include long -term/chronic patients as well as pregnancies, with plans to include all SHI recipients by November 2017 (187) . Subgroups of individuals, as well as other particular circumstances are exempt f rom co -insurance. Specifically, chronically ill individuals, some specific treatments (e.g. abortions/fertility treatments), occupational injuries, pregnant women, contraceptives until 18 years of age, organ donations and disabled dependents (187) . In total, there are 30 groups of diseases which are exempt and which make up two -third s of public expenditure on health. While low income individuals are not exempt from all co -insurance, they are eligible for free public complementary health insurance to cover all such costs (187) . Low income individuals (i.e. CMU -C and AME beneficiaries) are however exempt from inpatient cost -sharing (187) . Lastly, for all individuals, the additional \u20ac1 or \u20ac0.50 payments for outpatient services and prescription charges are capped to a total of \u20ac50 per annum (187) . At the inpatient level, there is a maximum co -insuranc e rate of 20%, however, this is not applicable for diagnostic or surgical procedures whose costs exceeds \u20ac120. Despite the above exemption policies, unmet need due to financial barriers exists. For example, a 2012 study found that, on average, 18% of Nati onal Health Insurance beneficiaries, aged at least 18 years, reported unmet need in regard to dental care. This figure fell to 10% for optical care needs, 5% for medical consultations and 4% for other types of care (188) . Figure 70: Unmet care needs due to financial barriers by complementary health insurance coverage (2012) needs GP consultations Other Private CHI beneficiaries CMU-C beneficiaries Without CHI coverage253 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Germany Outpatient: Up until 2012, flat rate quarterly pay ment for accessing primary care (Praxisgebuehr) (abolished) Inpatient : \u20ac10 per day, capped at 28 days per year Pharmaceuticals: 10% copayment of the pharmacy's sale price of a drug Co-payments, as well as corresponding exemption mechanisms are central to the German health care system. At 13.2%, Germany's proportion of OOP spending within THE is close to the average of OECD or high -income countries (184) , with the highest share coming from pharmaceutical payments (189) . The 1989 Health Care Reform Act advocated cost -sharing to raise revenue, make patients liable for part of the costs, and encourage appropriate use of health care by lowering co -payments to reward positive behavior (e.g. preventative healthcare) (189) . In order to reach the Statutory Health Insurance Modernization Law (2004) savings expectations, OOP requirements increased (189) . Among these policies, was the introduction of standardised copayments for acute inpatient care, as well as the quarterly payments for first physician c ontact at the primary level, the Praxisgebuehr,53 the latter was abolished in 2012 (189) . The reason for the abolishment was the combination of a limited red uction in health care utilisation and high administrative costs, which resulted in insignificant cost savings (190 -192) (see Table 50 below). Table 50: Germany's Praxisgebuehr (primary care co -payment) (abolished) Germany's Praxisgebuehr Type of user charge Co-payment . Amount \u20ac10 for the first visit to an outpatient physician (GP or specialists) or dentist's office within a three -month period . Exemption Those aged under 18 years.

Duration 2004 -2012 . 53 Under the policy, all adults within the statutory sickness funds had to pay 10 euros at their first physician visit within each three -month period. Vaccinations and preventative services are exempt. 254 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Germany's Praxisgebuehr Impact Limited impact on access to physicians after first year (see Table 54 for details) . Source: (193) The German health care system has co -payments for acute health care as well as outpatient prescription drugs (185) . In inpatient acute care, patients are required to pay a \u20ac10 fee per day (185) . This is how ever capped at a total of 28 days a year (185) . Regarding pharmaceutical expenditure, patients pay a 10% copayment of the pharmacy's sale price of a drug (185) . There is however also a reference pricing sys tem in place,54 so when a patient insists on a more expensive originator drug, they must pay the difference between the originator and cheaper generic product (189) . Germany has always placed a strong emphasis on its protection mechanisms. These exemptions however do not apply for reference pricing differentials th at patients are required to pay (189) . Protection mechanisms in Germany come in the form of a total OOP cap of annual household income. Spending is capped to a maximum of 2% of household income for healthy individuals, and at 1% for chronically ill (189) . Chronically ill is defined by either requiring long -term car e, being severely disabled or providing a certificate from a doctor about the importance of continuous treatment (189) . Furthermore, individuals with 'extraor dinary spending' which is defined on a case -by-cases bases may be eligible to apply for an exemption from income tax (189) . Netherlands Outpatient: \u20ac385 annu al deductible, which applies to specialist outpatient care (not GP consultations) , inpatient care and pharmaceuticals . Further user charges subject to each individual's health insurance plan. The proportion of OOP spending within THE in the Netherlands is the lowest of the European SHI systems at 5.2% (184) . Since 2014, there has been an increase in the OOP spending mainly due to an increa se in the mandatory deductible (194) . 54 There exists internal and external referencing price. The former uses the prices of drugs already on the national market with similar therapeutic effects to determine the cost of the new dr ug, while the latter looks at the cost of the same drug in other countries to determine price. 255 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In the Netherlands, there is limited cost -sharing beyond the compulsory deductible, which is set at \u20ac385 per annum and applies to all individuals 18 years and above (194) . The logic behind the deductible is to reduce moral hazard, which it seems to be doing as approximately only half the population reach the full amount of the deductible (194) . This deductible applies to the use of most health care services including outpatient prescription drugs and diagnostics, but does not include GP consultations, ma ternity care, home nursing and integrated care in primary care settings (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cardiovascular risk management) , as well as care for children (194) . Patients are thus not liable to pay any user charges for outpatient GP care, while outpatient specialist care, outpatient prescription drugs, as well as inpatient care are subject to deductible payments (194) . The amount of cost -sharing beyond the deductible depends on individual's health plan (194) . Patients also have the choice of an additional 'voluntary deductible', the value of which they can choose themselves (between \u20ac100 -\u20ac500 per year), which acts to lower their premiums (the reduction of the yearly premium is approximately 50% of the voluntary deductible amount) (194) . The voluntary deductible is applied across the same care sectors as the compulsory deductible, however, only a small although growing proportion of patients opt for this option (i.e. approximately 12% of the insured population, of which 69% choose the maximum deductible amount) (194) . In-kind policies may limit reimbursement to contracted providers, while restitution policies offer free choice of provider, however, compensation for services is only made up to an amount set by the insurer (194) . The majority of individuals choose an in -kind policy, while only a small m inority chose a selective policy, which covers le ss contracted providers than a normal in -kind policy (194) . Thus cost -sharing would occur if patients covered by in -kind policies choose providers whi ch are not contracted by their insurer. Although, under Dutch law there exists freedom of choice which means that such co -payments might not form a material barrier to visit a provider of choice. The Netherlands has also implemented certain value -based u ser charges schemes (explained in further detail in the next section of this chapter). For example health insurers have the option of offering a scheme where deductibles are not charged if preferred medicines are used, preventive health programs for certai n diseases are followed, or contracted providers are chosen (194) . Furthermore, there is a reference pricing system in place, in the sense that after the general deductible is reached, there is no cost -sharing for outpatient prescription drugs, except for the price differential between generic drugs and chosen branded drugs (185,194) . 256 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options There are no exemptions to the deductible or contributing to SHI premiums (194) . Low income individuals receive a 'Health Care Allowance' which is based on the average premium by insurers and the compulsory deductible (194) . This is paid in advance of every month and surplus finances or deficits are balanced out on an individual level (194) . Chronically il l and disabled individuals are not exempt from user charges either (194) . However, low income beneficiaries were fully compensated for the substantia l increase of the deductible in 2013 in their healthcare allowances. Also municipalities, are allowed to and often do, offer group plans to people on welfare that bear lower user charges (due to pre -payment of the deductible). User charger policies in Aus tria Out-of-pocket payments in the Austrian healthcare system As of 2015, Austrian citizens spent \u20ac 8.57 b illion on volunt ary health care payments (\u20ac 2.28 billion ) and household OOP payments (\u20ac 6.29 billion ). For voluntary healthcare payments, patients typically spend their funds on inpatient curative and rehabilitative care (i.e. 48%), followed by governance and health system financing administration (25%). For household OOP payments, the largest item of expen diture relates to outpatient curative and rehabilitative care (37%), with inpatient care accounting for just 7% of overall expenditure. When combining voluntary healthcar e and household OOP payments, 29% of all private expenditure is targeted at outpatient , rehabilitative care, followed by medical good s at the outpatient level (26%), and inpatient care (18%) (see Figure 71). 257 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 71: Share of voluntary household expend iture and household OOP by type of care (Austria, 2015) Source: Statistics Austria (System of Health Accounts) In terms of trends, between 2004 and 2013 , private healthcare expenditure per capita (constant prices) have been increasing across all levels of care. In particular, preventative care and long -term care rose by 88% and 45%, respectively. Inpatient care , on the other hand, grew by just 1% over the specific period (see Figure 72).

The remaining 36% of private expenditure was spent on prescribed medicines (30%) and other medical non -durables (6%) ( see the figure below). The relatively low proportion of private expen diture on prescribed medicines is due to the high level of subsidisation via government schemes and social health insurance (i.e. 88% of total prescribed medicine expenditure). 1%8% 9%10%21%45%88% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Inpatient curative and rehabilitative careGoverance, and financing administrationOutpatient curative and rehabilitative careMedical goods dispensed to outpatientsAncillary servicesLong-term care Preventive care259 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 73: Share of private pharmaceutical expenditure (2015) Source: Statistics Austria (System of Health Accounts) User charges in social health insurance Outpatient: Depends on the insurer (varying rates of co -insurance across he alth insurers ) Inpatient : Co-payment between \u20ac12-20 per day (capped at 28 days) , with rates varying across regions and insurance status Pharmaceuticals: flat rate payment of \u20ac5.85 per packet of drugs (with an expenditure cap at 2% of the individual's net income) An overview of user charger arrangements across all social security institutions in Austria is provided in Table 52. Social insurance carriers all offer different user charges, with the exception of copayments for pharmaceutical products. Specifically, all insurance carriers charge a flat rate payment of \u20ac5.85 per packet of drugs. If the cost is below \u20ac5.85, then the patient must pay the full amount (e.g. if the cost is \u20ac4.00, the patient must pay \u20ac4.00). To protect vulnerable groups, there exi st prescription fee exemptions. Latest data show that 517,601 people received permanent exemption status.55 55 Information provided directly from the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection. 30% 64%6% Prescribed medicines Over-the-counter medicines Other medical non-durables260 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 51: Exemption policies for pharmaceutical prescription fee Group Description Law General exemptions Contagious disease Young men in civilian service and immediate relative Asylum seekers Decree by the HVSV according to \u00a731(5)16 Exemptions for social reasons (automatic) Those on low pensions All in sured when REGO has been reached Exemptions for social reasons (require application process) Those under a certain income threshold Source: (68) In a positive move, a cap on pharmaceutical expenditure was introduced at 2% of an individuals' net income (excluding inpatient drug expenditure). Previously, those who are financially vulnerable and/or those with chronic conditions were not protected agains t high drug expenditure. In 2015, 400,506 people reached this threshold.56 For outpatient services, regional insurance carriers (GKKs) charge an \u20ac 11 service fee for the e -card each year . In regard to healthcare services, patients who seek medical care from non -contracted doctors will only be reimbursed 80 % of the cost charged by contracted doctors , and thu s pay the remaining 20% OOP (plus an additional cost if the non -contracted doctor charges more than the contracted fee) . A co - payment for medical aid s is also required of GKK insurees. Lastly, relative to wealthier funds, GKKs offer less benefits, which increases the level of indirect OOP for their insured populations. Other insurance carriers, with the exception of the SVB, employ a co-insurance rate between 14 -20% on all outpatient services. The SVB, on the other hand, charge a flat -rate payment of \u20ac9.61 per quarter if the patient accesses medical care. 56 Ibid. 261 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In addition to the traditional user charges outlined above, the SVA and VAEB h ave experimented with value -based user charges. Specifically, the SVA reduces the co -insurance amount from 20% to 10% if the patient achieve s preventative healthcare goals agreed with by their doctor (e.g. weight, physical exercise), while the VAEB repays \u20ac1 per medication package if a patient switches to a cheaper generic product (see figure below for further details) . Figure 74: Value based user charges within Austria's social insurance system The SVA has introduced a 'Be Healthy on Your Own' program which aims to encourage people to take better care of their health. To achieve this, the SVA will reduce the co -insurance rate for medical and dental care from 20% to 10% if the patient makes improvement in one of the following five a reas: weight, physical exercise, tobacco consumption, alcohol consumption, and blood pressure. Exemptions are rewarded for all areas, except alcohol and tobacco consumption (e.g. pregnant women). The co -insurance rate is also reduced for those with Type 2 Diabetes who engage in the Diabetes Disease Management Program (Therapie Aktiv). Data on participation from 2012 (latest available) revealed low participation rates across all income groups. Specifically, participation in preventative check -ups (which a re required to receive the co - insurance reduction ) ranged between 7.5% to 14.9% depending on the income rate at which the individual's contribution rate was set (those in the lowest income group were the least likely to participate). The VAEB offers a sim pler value -based user charger program, that is, the 'Best -Price -Euro'. Under this program, insurees are reimbursed \u20ac1 per medication package if they switch to a cheaper generic product. Source: (195) In 2015, patients spent \u20ac708 million on user charges within Austria's social insurance system. Drug prescriptions represented the highest share of user charges at \u20ac409 million, or 58% of all user charges. This result is not surprising given all health insu rance carriers implement user charges for pharmaceuticals. The second largest component of cost -sharing in Austria relates to medical practices at \u20ac152 million, while the smallest component is made up of the e -card fee charges by regional carriers (\u20ac38 mil lion). 262 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 75: Revenue generate d from user charges in Austria (millions) (2015 ) Source: Information provided by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection (sourced from Finanzstatistik 2015) Total fees (user charges and cost -sharing) as a proportion of total income differs across each health insurance carrier. Drawing upon 2013 data, user charges represented between 3. 4% (all GKKs) and 7 .4% (SVA) of total income. On average, 4.2 % of total income is made up of revenue from cost-sharing (see Figure 76). Figure 76: Share user charges and cost sharing in total income, 2015 Source: Information provided by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consum er sharing (LHS) User charges (LHS) User charges as a % of total cost sharing (RHS)263 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The final figure within this section compares the cost per insur ee between total fees, cost sharing and user charges, and only user charges. User charges for GKKs and BKKs is \u20ac0, which reflects the fact, that in technical terms, these carriers have not implemented user charges (i.e. only the \u20ac11 e -card service fee). For all remaining carriers, the proportion of user charges within OOP varies significantly. For example, 68% of OOP within the SVA can be attributed to user charges, compared to 41% within the SVB and VAEB. For further information, please see Volume 4 - Situational Analysis.

As previously mentioned, the evidence around user charges has not directly aligned with what economic theory would suggest. More specifically, there have been concerns about the impact of user charges' impac t on a health systems' efficiency, health outcomes and equity. An overview of the impact of user charges on equity, demand for healthcare services, and expenditure is provided below. Table 53: Impact of user charges Area Impact Equity Essentially a 'tax on the ill', given this group consume a relatively high proportion of healthcare services. Low-income individuals less likely to access healthcare services. Demand for healthcare Reduction in necessary and unnecessary healthcare services as patients unable to always distinguish between and high and low value healthcare. Impact on patient often limited by influential role of doctors in prescribing (drugs). Impact depends on level of user charge (i.e. price inelastic if user char ge makes up small % of income). Expenditure No clear evidence on impact - can reduce expenditure in the short -term, however, long -term costs can increase due to delays in accessing care ('squeezed balloon effect'). Limited impact on expenditure if there are numerous exemptions. Source: See descriptions below. 267 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Impact on equity User charges may lead to an unequal reduction in health care utilisation and thus health. Specifically, i n Western countries, such as Austr ia, a small proportion of the population (e.g. the elderly and/or chronically ill) contribute to a significantly higher proportion of health care expenditure. This is demonstrated in Figure 78, whic h shows the proportion of the German population and their aligning healthcare expendit ure. Specifically, 5 % of the population in Germany consume 53 % of total healthcare expenditure (24% in the Netherlands) , this figure increases to 79 % for 10% of all patients. Similar results are found in France where 20% of the top healthcare consumers make up 60% of total user charges (i.e. average yearly user charge of \u20ac1,327 for the top 20% compared to \u20ac182 for the remai ning 80%) (197) . Given most healthcare expenditure is consumed by a relatively small group of patients (i.e. the sick and/or elderly), user charges essentially act as a 'tax on the ill' (198) . Figure 78: Distribution of health expenditure for the German population As those who are unhealthy are more likely to be from lower socio -economic backgrounds, user charges have an even greater impact on access to care for vulnerable groups. For example, as discovered within the RAND HIE (199) and confirmed through various other studies, low income individuals, and other vulnerable groups, are more likely to forego care, including essential care, in response to user 65% 268 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options (see Table 54) (182,200) . A recent detailed case study from the Netherlands the impact of the annual deductible on access to specialist medical care is provided in Table 55. Table 54: Impact of user charges on equity (overview of academic studies) Study Country Description R\u00fcckert et al. (2008) Germany Germany's Praxisgebuehr (primary care flat rate payment) delayed access to care for young/healthier people.

(2010) US Retirees in poor heal th had greater reductions in spending on physician visits and prescription drugs than those in good health (3% and 8% reduction in physician visits and drugs, respectively, for health retirees compared to 15% and 27% for unhealthy retirees). Chernew et al. (2008) US Patients from low -income backgrounds are more sensitive to drug co -payments than middle - to high -income patients (i.e. low-income patients less likely to adhere to medications, particularly for Statins).

At the outpatient level, the deductible is charged to outpatient specialists, but not GP consultations. The deductible is charged if the patient follows the GP referral to a medical specialist . Objective To determine the impact of the deductible on non -compliance with medical specialists care (i.e. patients not following up with GP referrals to specialist). Results Between 2008 and 2013, the annual deductible increased from \u20ac150 to \u20ac385 per yea r, over the same period, the non -compliance rate grew by 7 percentage points (i.e. from 20% to 27%). Non -compliance rates were higher for: younger patients (i.e. 31% for those aged 25 -39 years, 26 -27% for older patients, and 25% for children) those with multiple chronic diseases (i.e. 28 -29% for those with at least 1 chronic condition, compared to 26% for those without a chronic condition) those living in urban deprived areas (i.e. 28% for those living in urban deprived areas, compared to 27% for those in other areas).

Source: (205) Impact on demand for healthcare One of the main aims of user charges is to shift financial responsibility t o the patient to reduce unnecessary health care utilisation. A systematic review of recent evidence confirms that the vast majority 270 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options of studies show that user charges reduce the use of emergency department, outpatient prescription drugs, general practitione rs and specialists (206) . Evidence, both from the RAND HIE (207) , as well as recent literature reviews have confirmed that individuals do respond to the existence or to increases in user charges by reducing t heir health care use (182,200,206,206,208) . However, th e argument that user charges increase efficiency relies on the assumption that patients have the information and knowledge to make rational judgements and decisions over the necessity of particular health care interventions. Evidence has shown that this as sumption does not hold for the majority of patients. Both the RAND HIE (199,207) , as well as various reviews and studies have confirmed the inability of most patients to distinguish between high and low value care. As a result, user charges often lead to a reduction in both essential an d nonessential care (182,183,200) . With regards to outpatient care, a systematic review of the literature found that user charges d o reduce utilisation, however a few outliers saw no effect (206) . Evidence on the impact of the German Praxisg ebuehr does show a slight reduction in outpatient physician visits, but not significant enough to generate cost savings (191,192) . Further, the impact of the co -payment on demand was only apparent during the transitory year in 2004, after which demand for physician visits remained the same (191) . The i mpact of user charges on utilisation differs by the amount of the user charge, as well as the population subgroup. In regards to the user charge amount, in Sweden, where user charges make up a relatively low proportion of income, their increase over time h ad a minor impact on health care utilisation (i.e. patients are price inelastic when user charges are low) (209) . The impact of user charges on healthcare utilisation also depends on the relative power of other stakeholders. For example Gemmill et al . explain the limited response to prescription drug charges, due to the influential role of doctors in prescribing, which means patients' drug demand is relatively price inelastic (182) . Moreover, healthy patients are more likely to reduce health care use in response to higher OOP than chronic patients as their health care use is generally not as essential to their immediate health (182) . However, the difference in reduction in heal th care use between high and low income individuals, due to OOP payments representing different shares of their income, leads to equity concerns. Impact on health expenditure Pharmaceutical spending: Gemmill et al . confirmed in their review of OECD countries, that the impact of user charges on total prescription drug expenditure and drug prices are unlikely long term (182) . Most included studies find that increased cost -sharing resulted in a slight reduction in total pharmaceutical 271 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options expenditure and a shift of cost burden to patie nts, however the magnitude of the impact on total cost depends on the amount the user charge increases costs, as well as the types of drugs or which segment of the population it targets (182) . There is limited evidence of the impact reference pricing has on long term pharmaceutical e xpenditure. Gemmill et al . suggest that it is unlikely that such user charges can give long term pharmaceutical cost control, rather this mechanisms simply shifts costs towards patients (182) . Their review does find evidence of drug prices dropping in response to reference pricing, howev er findings suggest that changes in drug prices are likely to cancel out - i.e. while some drug prices drop, others increase to meet the reference price (182) . Thus, the introduction of reference pricing is unlikely to lead to a decrease of pharmaceutical expenditure at a given level of consumption. Total health expenditure: The impact of user charges on total health care spending is not unanimous with studies finding both a positive and negative impact on long term expenditure. The RAND HIE brought the expectation that total spending ma y decrease in response to increased cost -sharing (199) . However, reviews of the literature ever since conclude that the effect of cost -sharing on total health care expenditure is more likely to be an increase (182,200) . The potential for a so -called 'squeezed balloon' effect as well as increasingly expensive ne w technologies are considered potential barriers to a reduction in spending (183,200) . The squeezed bal loon effect refers to the shift in costs from preventative/maintenance health care to more acute health care (183,200) . The RAND HIE, as well as reviews of studies ever since, have confirmed the possibility of such an increase in total health costs (199,200) . Gemmill et al .'s literature review finds that prescription drug charges are likely to lead to an increase in costs due to increased usage of alternative services such as in -patient care, long -term care, as well emergency department admissions (182) . Outpatient specific studies suggest similar result s. In addition to the German Praxisgebuehr not generating sufficient cost saving due to limited response from patients (191 -193) , the policy resulted in high amounts of administrative costs, which caused its abolishment (190) . Moreover, supporting the squeezed balloon hypothesis, decreased preventative care utilisation may also result in increased intensive/acute care costs in the long run. For example, a Danish study found that high risk individuals were almost t wice as likely to attend a heart disease screening if it was provided free of charge rather than if they had to pay a fee OOP (210) . The distribution of health spending across populations is highly skewed given the majority of services are used by a narrow segment of the population (e.g. elderly, those with chronic conditions) (see Figure 78). 272 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Since increased cost -sharing h as a greater effect on healthier patients, it is likely to skew the spending distribution further (i.e. healthy will consume even less) (200) . Chronically or acutely sick people are unlikely to be as affected by an increase in cost sharing, given their lack of control after initiating treatment (200) , as well as treatment being essential for many chronically ill patients. Lastly, the impact of user charges on controlling health care expend iture is limited given the existence of numerous exemption policies to protect vulnerable patients. Protection mechanisms The above -mentioned impact on equity highlight the importance of protection mechanisms for vulnerable groups. Such protection mechan isms come in forms of capping total OOP spending, reduced fees, as well as exemptions. All the considered European SHI Systems have some form of protection mechanism in place (see Table 49). Such mechanisms have the potential to improve health care efficiency and equity. Analysis of the variation of equity in health by type of health insurance finds that annual caps or exempt ions reduce the likelihood that those on low incomes and/or chronically ill will avoid treatment due to costs (203) . A recent Swedish analysing access to healthcare by education level over time fou nd that among people of poor health, those who are less educated have lower access to care (209) . However, they do find that the increase in user charges over time, only had a marginal impact on the extent of the inequality in access to care, which they attribute to both relatively low levels of user -charges as well as Sweden's extensive protection mechanisms, suc h as their payment cap to protect the chronically ill (209) . Value -based cost sharing The negative impact of user charges on equity, access and healthcare expenditure has led to an increase in the employment of value -based cost sharing. Value -based cost -sharing entails nudging individuals towards more essential or more valuable care, in order to decrease the lik elihood of patients limiting their access to essential care. The intended goal is minimise waste and spending on health and thus maximis e efficiency. Cost -sharing can target health care utilisation towards high value -care, both through rules/mandates, as well as through incentivising patient or provider behaviour (211) . Mandating a reduction in low -value care use can be, for example, an automatic switch from a branded product to a generic if available (i.e. generic subs titution) (211) . It has been shown that value -based user charges have the ability to increase use of high -value services and drugs, however they may bring with them high administrative costs, as well as equity concerns (211) . 273 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Across European SHI systems, value -based approaches have been applied to encourage utilisation of preferred providers, more effective outpatient prescription drugs, generic utilisation, as well as use of preve ntative services or behaviour (see Table 56). Table 56: Value -based approaches across providers, outpatient prescription drugs and prevention Policy area Policy Country Outpatient drugs (therapeutic value) Differential cost sharing by level of clinical effectiveness (less cost -sharing for more effective) France Outpatient drugs (clinical indication) Level of cost -sharing dependent on severity of disease to treat Belgium, Finland, France, Norway Outpatient drugs (clinical indication) Patients must meet clinical conditions to determine effectiveness Finland Outpatient drugs (relative price) Lower c ost-sharing for cheaper drugs vs higher cost -sharing for drugs with a generic alternative Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands Prevention Preventative behaviour incentivised through bonus schemes, or different co-payments Belgium, Germany Use of preferred providers Cost -sharing determined by whether the provider is preferred or not Netherlands (limited - insurers can offer this, but are not obliged to ) Source: (211) Value -based cost -sharing: prescription drugs Value -based cost sharing is most commonly applied to outpatient prescription drugs. Within this context, value, can refer to a range of factors such as economic or therapeutic value, clinical indication/therapy area/patient need, or relative prices to subs titutable drugs (211) . Majority of the literature on value - based cost -sharing revolves around reference pricing. Reference pricing is expected to both switch 274 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options patients' demand to cheaper generic drugs, but also to redu ce prices of pharmaceuticals subject to reference pricing regimes, and reduce total pharmaceutical expenditure. Various systematic reviews have shown that reference pricing can in fact effectively shift prescription drug use to cheaper drugs (212,213) . However, there is evidence of contrary results, for example, Swartz in her review argues tha t this may be due to a lack of patients' understanding of the interchangeability of branded and generic drugs (200) . Regarding impact on pharmaceutical expenditure, reference pricing can decrease prices of some products, while cheaper generics may raise their price to meet the reference threshold, this cancelling out any cost savings (182,211) (182) . Thus, reviews have found that reference pricing is unlikely to generate overall long term pharmaceutical cost control, and instead simply shifts costs towards patients (182) . Figure 79: Case study - Impact of value -based user charges for prescription drugs Setting Claims data from two US employ -sponsored health plans was analysed to determine whether more aggressive multi -tiered formularies policies had a greater impact on utilisation on three drugs (i.e. ACE inhibitors, proton -pump inhibitors, and statins) . Results Those enrolled in the more aggressive health insurance plan experienced a slower growth in the probability of using a drug, further, there was a greater shift from the plan to the enrollee. Those in the aggressive healthcare plan were more like ly to switch from tier -3 statins (most expensive tier) to either tier-1 or tier -2 medications (49% vs 17%). Similar results were found for ACE inhibitors and proton - pump inhibitors. Source Huskamp et al . (2003). The effect of incentive -based formularies on prescription -drug utilisation and spending. The New England Journal of Medicine . Vol 349, pp. 2224 -2232. Source: (214) Value -based cost -sharing: preventive services Exempting preventive health care services from user charges or incentivising healthy/preventative behaviour is another type of value -based cost -sharing. 275 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In some SHI systems with user charges in place for outpatient primary care (185) , the decision to exempt preventative care from user charges acts to direct patients to valuable care. As Danish studies have shown, individuals are almost twice as likely to attend preventative and screening procedures if they are provided free of charge, in the latter case even for individua ls at particularly high risk of poor health (210,215) . Similarly, in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, bonus schemes have been introduced to encourage patients to partake in preventi on schemes (i.e. supporting healthy behaviour and early detection of chronic diseases) (211) . Figure 80: Case study - Impact of value -based user charges for preventative services Setting Systematic review of differential user charges between primary and secondary care across eight studies covering six countries. Results Five studies examining the impact of greater secondary care user charges found that most ( n=4) saw a decrease in seconda ry care utilisation, and three showing an increase in primary care utilisation. One study evaluating the impact of a reduction in primary care user fees saw an increase in primary care utilisation. The introduction of a fee for those who access secondary c are without a referral led to a reduction in primary are utilisation (one study). Lastly, one study found that higher secondary care user charges led to higher utilisation of primary and secondary care. The authors noted that caution should be taken when i nterpreting results given quality of studies examined. Source Hone et al. (2017). Does charging different user fees for primary and secondary care affect first -contacts with primary healthcare? A systematic review. Health Policy and Planning . Vol 32(5), pp. 723 -731. Source: (216) Limitations of value -based cost -sharing Although value -based cost -sharing addresses certain issues associated with user cha rges, it does have limitations of its own. The first limitation concerns efficiency. Specifically, developing and up -keeping value -based user charges come with a high administrative burden which has led several countries to cancel value -based schemes, 276 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options for example, Denmark, Norway and Sweden (211) . Due to these additional costs, the impact of user charges on efficiency are often not felt until the long -term. Secondly, information asymmetry and the role of physicians' i n administering healthcare limit the patients' ability to respond to user charges (211) . Moreover, in order for value -based cost -sharing to achieve its intended effect, it is important to have a robust information sys tem that is transparent to providers and patients (211) . Lastly, the specific example of France highlights the importance of careful policy design to accompany value -based approaches. In France the existence of additi onal insurance covering OOP payments, has limited the impact of reference pricing on patients (211) . Policy options: User charges User charges could act as a signal to consumers to reduce consumption of unnecessary, low -value care, while simultaneously raising revenue. For this reason, they are a popular tool among health policy -makers. However, for the following reasons, caution sho uld be taken when implementing non -targeted user charges. First, user charges reduce consumption of both high - and low -value care as often patients are unable to differentiate between the two. A delay in consumption of necessary, high -value care may lead to worsening health conditions and thus greater long -term health expenditure. Second, those who are relatively sicker and poorer, consume a disproportionate amount of healthcare services. User charges therefore act as a 'tax on ill', which limits their reve nue raising potential, given exemptions usually apply to such patients. For reasons outlined above, we have proposed policy options which advocate user charges that are fairer, more equitable, and linked to value. It is important to note that we do not r ecommend an increase in user charges, rather change in the composition of user charges to maximise efficiency, for example, by linking payment to the value of care provided. Fairer, more equitable pharmaceutical expenditure caps Out-of-pocket expenditure for pharmaceutical s is capped at 2% of net income for all insured people. Although a positive initiative, g iven the capped amount is independent of an individual's income, th e exemption policy fails to reflect insurees ability to pay. We propos e a fairer more equitable system by dividing the pharmaceutical expenditure cap into three levels. The first level applies to low -income earners who would see their pharmaceutical expenditure cap reduced from 2% to 1. 5%. The second level, comprising m iddle -income ea rners, would experience no change in their pharmaceutical expenditure cap 277 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options given it would remain at 2% . Lastly, the cap for third -level, high -income earners would increase to 2.5% (see Table 57). Table 57: Proposed changes to the pharmaceutical expenditure cap Income -level Proposed pharmaceutical expenditure cap on net income Low 1.5% Medium 2.0% High 2.5% To ensure insurees are allocated to the appropriate level, which reflects their true ability to pay, the individual's total income could be taken into account (i.e. income from primary form of employment, as well as income derived from property ownership o r other types of economic activity). Social health insurers do not have access to information on total income due to privacy reasons. To overcome this barrier, it is proposed that the relevant tax office provide social health insurers with a brief statemen t on which co -insurance rate should be applied to individuals, without reporting the actual overall income of the individual. The exact income brackets for each of the three -levels has not been laid as this should be discussed and debated within governmen t. To the extent possible, the chosen brackets should ensure fiscal neutrality. However, if this cannot be ensured, consideration should be given to government compensation within the short -term (e.g. five years) , to allow social health insurers time to re -adjust to a reduced revenue stream. The impact of the policy should be evaluated within the short -term. If the policy generates a positive impact on patients and insurers, the cap could be extended to all inpatient and outpatient healthcare services. Lastly, t he proposal outlined above will benefit those on lower incomes, this does not mean, however, that changes should be made to existing exemption policies for vulnerable groups. 278 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Legal considerations There are no specific legal observations or concern s in this respect. Implementation could be done as well on legislative level as on level of 'directives' (Richtlinien) released by the HVSV (which is currently the case, \u00a7 31 Abs 5 Z 16 ASVG). Value -based user charges Value -based user charges are limited in Austrian social health insurance, with only the SVA and VAEB experimenting with such policies (see Figure 74). A reason for this may be the limite d use of health technology assessments , which inform policy -makers about the clinical - and cost -effectiveness of a drug/service/device . Therefore, as a first step, an improvement in HTA processes in Austria is required (e.g. enhance transparency, improve c oordination) (see section 5.2.4 ). Hereafter, it is recommended that social health insurers draw upon findings from HTAs to determine co -insurance r ates across products/services (i.e. reducing user charges for high -value care). The development of robust HTA systems is likely to take time. Therefore, in the meantime, social health insurance carriers could draw upon experiences and findings from the SVA and VAEB to implement other forms of value -based user charges. For example, by linking user charges to engagement with preventive care and/or consumption of generics (see Figure 74 for further details) . However, such policies are behavioural -based, which for reasons outlined below, are associated with implementation issues. Ideally value -based user charges would consider individual circumstances. However, s uch policies are complex (e.g. various exemption policies), which in turn increase administrative costs. Therefore, user charges should be linked to the effectiveness of a product/medical device/service, as determined by a robust HTA. This approa ch is adopted by various countries (e.g. reduced or no co -payments for generic products). Legal considerations There are no specific legal observations or concerns in this respect. Implementation could be done as well on legislative level as on level of 'directives' (Richtlinien) released by the Hauptverband (which is currently the case, \u00a7 31 Abs 5 Z 16 ASVG). 279 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Convergence of user charges As outlined in Table 52, differential user charges are applied across health insurance carriers. This creates inequalities across insured populations, and may restrict certain individuals from accessing appropriate healthcare services. For this reason, it is recommende d that wealthier funds (such as the SVA) reduce their co-insurance rate, for example, from 20% to 10% or less for ambulatory care so as to align with rates set by the BVA (10%) and VAEB (7% by 2018). It is important to note that this is already occurring as evidenced by the drop in revenue from user charges, specifically from \u20ac152.2 million in 2015 to \u20ac128.7 million in 2016 (217) . Naturally , user charges will converge if carriers are amalgamated, as proposed under structural models 1, 2 or 3 (see Table 3). In this instance, user chargers must be revised to ensure all insurees have the same or better access to healthcare. However, harmonisation of user charges should be slowly phased in to take into account affordability, given revenues will be reduced. Legal considerations There are no specific legal observations or concerns in this respect, either. It should be considered, however, that user charges for all employed insurees would cause quite huge additional administrative costs if they were collected by the funds themselves. Summary of policy options for user charges In summary, user chargers should be implemented with caution given, if they are not targeted, are likely to disproportionally impact sicker/poorer populations. Further, blunt user chargers will reduce access to both valuab le and non -valuable services, which may lead to higher expenditure in the long -term. For these reasons, we have developed policy options that aim to improve equity and efficiency in the system. Regarding the former, we propose a three -tiered pharmaceutical expenditure cap based on a patient's financial means, with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds paying less. To improve efficiency, all social health insurers should consider implementing value -based user charges drawing upon findings form robust HT As. 280 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Investment in healthcare services To improve access to high -quality care, social insurance carriers invest heavily into service provision. Funds for investment are derived from a portion of reserves (i.e. assets less liabilities), which can be used to 'make' (developed and owned by the insurer) or 'buy ' (purchased from a provider) healthcare services . Alternatively, insurers may enter into an arrangement which combines the two funding models. Section 5.4 first outlines the level of reserves within the social insurance system, with a specific focus on health insurance carriers. Second, an overview of how to efficiently invest reserves is provi ded. Specifically, when to make or buy healthcare services, and ways to coordinate investment. Reserves within the social insurance system Reserves within the so cial insurance system represent the sum of assets less liabilities. At the end of 2015, the sum of reserves across all three insurance pillars equated to \u20ac5.7 billion. Of this amount, 47% was attributed to health insurance, compared to 31% and 22% for pension and accident insurance, respectively (see the figure below ). It is important to note tha t reser ves are not necessarily liquid as they may also include items such as real estate and owed contributions. Figure 81: Level of reserves by insurance pillar, in billions (2015) Source: (218) Reserves can be broken into three exclusive groups, namely, general reserves, service provision reserves , and smaller special reserves (i.e. support funds and replacement procurement reserves) . In regard to service provision reserves, health insurance carriers are required to build up reserves totaling 1/12 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options service expenditures to cover fluctuations in contribution income and benefit payments. A breakdown of reserves by each of the three categories is outlined in the figure be low, which shows that just over half of reserves are considered 'general reserves'. Figure 82: Net asset structure of social insurance carriers, in billions (2015) Source: (218) Reserves at the individual health insurance carrier level are provided in Figure 83 figure below . Results from the data reveal si gnificant dif ferences, with reserves ranging from \u20ac9 to \u20ac734 million (BVA). As a generalisation, reserves are greatest among carriers offering more than one insurance pillar, followed by GKKs and finally, BKKs.

Three significant forms of assets, in addition to cash, include real estate, contribution claims, and securities, loans and deposits. As shown in Table 58, there is no clear pattern in regard to the division of assets. Table 58: Breakdown of assets as a proportion of total assets by health insurance carrier (2015) Insurance carrier Share of total assets Real estate Contribution claims Securities, loans and deposits GKK International comparisons and policy options Insurance carrier Share of total assets Real estate Contribution claims Securities, loans and deposits SVB 0% 27% 49% Source: (218) Make, buy and concurrent sourcing of healthcare services Make or buy In a purely competitive market with numerous competitors, homogenous products, limited barriers to entry, and perfect consumer knowledge, it is often pres umed that there will be an optimal allocation of resources. The healthcare market, however, is not 'perfect' for a number of reasons including information asymmetry, moral hazard, adverse selection, and imperfect information (219) . For these reasons, provision of healthcare is not solely left to the private marke t, with payers of health care (e.g. social health insurers) employing a mix of in -house (make) and outsourced services (buy). Despite ample literature on the topic, there is no consensus on whether to solely make or buy services. What is frequently reported , are the conditions which influence such decisions. In regard to the healthcare market, two salient factors determine whether services should be made or bought, contestability and measurability (220) : Contestability: A market is contestable if the service ope rates in a market where there are low barriers to entry an d exit. For example, expertise and reputation increase barriers to entry, which reduce contestability. Measurability: Ability to measure the inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes of a particular service. High measurability implies tasks can be easily de fined and evaluated and therefore suitable for purchasing . For example, volume and prices of drugs and equipment are relatively easy to measure (220 -222) . Each healthcare service, as specified by the World Health Organisation, can be placed along a continuum matrix, which ranges from high measurability and contestability, to low me asurability and contestability (220,221) . The 'make or buy decision grid' states that if a healthcare service operates within a highly competitive market and can be easily measured, then it should be contracted out to a private provider. 284 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options On the other hand, if there is a limited number of competitors ( e.g. monopoly provider) and information cann ot be easily collected and anal ysed , services should be provided in -house (see figure below ). Figure 84: Make or buy decision grid Source: Adapted from (220) When examining the broader literature on make and buy (i.e. outsi de the healthcare market), several additional factors were identified. These factors , including their impact on make or by decision making , have been outlined in Table 59. Table 59: Additional factors impact make or buy decisions Factor Description Impact on decision -making Centrality of task Whether the task is considered central or core to the o rganisation's overall objective . Tasks that are not considered critical are more likely to be outsourced (e.g. cleaning, catering). By outsourcing such tasks, more effort can be directed at fulfilling core competencie s. Asset specificity Level of asset specificity used within production . This factor is closely Idiosyncratic, nuanced assets are more likely to be produced in -house. 285 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Factor Description Impact on decision -making related to contestability as high levels of specificity restrict market access. Irregular demand Irregular or cyclical demand which is outside the control of the organisation. If de mand is irregular, organisation s will be more likely to outsource relevant services as capital and labour may otherwise sit idle during downturns. Labour expertise Highly skilled staff often demand higher wages, which are generally provided in the private sector. Thus it can be difficult for the public sector to employ those with the required skill set. Training staff to a specific level of expertise can be costly, especially if staff turnover is high. In this instance, it is preferable for organisation s to contract highly -skilled workers on an ad-hoc basis. Intellectual property For example, patient records. If an organisation's IP is highly sensitive, then services are more likely to be provided in -house. Synergies Complementary services across the organisation's supply chain. Providing services in -house builds up internal capacity. In certain instances, improved capacity and knowledge in one area may enhance tangential components of the supply -chain, thus improving overall service provision. (see below) Market failures The healthcare market is often associated with market failures; that is, where the free market fails to provide an adequate level of service. This frequently occurs in rural and remote areas where demand is low, thus leading to inequitable access. Where market failures occur , health insurance carriers should consider making their own services. Proper analysis is required to determine whether the market has in fact failed. Source: (221 -223) 286 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Concurrent sourcing Despite various fa ctors outlined above, in practice , the decision to either make or buy is not straightforward. As a re sult, organisation s are increasingly turning to mix methods of sourcing, which incorporate both aspects of make and buy (i.e. concurrent sourcing) (223) . Specific environments in which concurrent sourcing is supported by empirical evidence are provided in Parmigiani (2007) (223) . These include where: There is technological uncertainty The organisation and supplier have complementary areas of expertise Economies of scop e exist . Relative to purely making or buying services, concurrent sourcing enhances an organisation's knowledge by fostering information sharing (i.e. learn ing from the provider) . Information sharing is particularly pertinent during times of rapid unpredi ctable technological development, given it enhances the organiation 's likelihood of adopting relevant, successful strateg ies. Therefore, in times of technological uncertainty, organisations should concurrently source (223) . The level of internalisation, that is , in-house production , falls on a continuum related to the organisation's level of expertise (i.e. there is a positive relationship between expertise and producing services in -house). In general, the organisation will have a high -level of expertise, but with certain knowledge gaps. Therefore, the organisation will be motivated to partner with the supplier to combine complementary areas of expertise (223) . Concurrent sourcing can improve efficiency as, where possible, services will be produced simultaneously as opposed to in silos (i.e. economics of scope). Specifically, simultaneous production lea ds to a 'fuller utilisation' of production inputs (between the organisation and supplier), which reduces average costs compared to when services are produced independently (223) . Policy options: Investment in healthcare services Reserves and investment coordination In addition to liquid assets, reserves among social insuran ce carriers also include items such as claims on contributions and real estate. Current financial reporting requirements delineate reserves according to the categories outlined above, yet all are termed as 'reserves'. This terminology is misleading given n ot 287 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options all reserves are liquid and in certain cases are required to fund essential services. For this reason , we recommend the following t wo policy options. First, only report assets that are liquid and not required to fund required services as reserves, to ma ke it explicit that these assets can be used for investment purposes . Remaining items would then be classified as 'non -liquid assets'. And secondly , enhance the use of reserves via the following three options: 1. Pooling all or a part of each carrier's reser ves into a joint central fund , administered by the HVSV. To encourage social insurance carriers to pool liquid reserves, the make -up of total reserves as a proportion of each carrier's contribution should be made clear. These proportions would then be used to allocate investment returns across the social insurance system (i.e. those who contribute more to the pool of reserves would receive greater fin ancial returns from investments ). 2. Encourage joint investment without pooling reserves, with contributions to investment based on each carrier's level of reserves. 3. Encouraging carriers who invest in healthcare services to open up their facilities to all individuals, not just their insured population. Enhanced coordination of investment activities is associated with many benefits including: a) avoiding duplication of effort; b) improving allocative efficiency, thus improving insuree access to relevant services; and c) promoting specialisation and efficiency by assisting services to suitable carriers. In regard to options 1 and 2 above, the following six high -level complementary recommendations regarding investment coordination have been provided: 1. Develop an overarching investment strategy for social health insurance, with all future investm ents being reported to a central agency 2. Require all future investments to align with the aforementioned investment strategy 3. Social health insurance carriers to jointly invest in facilities/programs that improve primary and public health (e.g. primary healt hcare units, disease management programs, case management, dental clinics, and other joint competence centres57); as outlined in option 3 above, these could be made open to all individuals, not just insured populations of carriers who have made investments. 57 At present, only three joint competence centres exist - Integrated Care (Integrierte Versorgung), Therapeutic Products and Aids (Heilbehelfe und Hilfsmittel, HBI), and Transportation (Transportwesen, TW ). See Volume 2 - Situational Analysis for further deta ils. 288 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 4. Use liquid reserves to invest in 'bricks and mortar' capital, which would be rented out to providers. Under this arrangement, insurers would not lose their reserves as they would earn rental income. 5. Utilise the target control mechanisms and joint virtual budgets at the L \u00e4nder level to better coordinate investment in facilities (e.g. if the L \u00e4nder have excess capacity in outpatient department, health insurance carriers could use this capacity for setting up PHUs or other outpatient clinics). 6. Forma lise investment coordination between Federal States and health insurance carriers, which in turn would improve services across the spectrum of care. Legal considerations There are no legal impediments with respect to an enhanced financial reporting. The 'pooling' of already allocated reserves, however, could be a problem with respect to the principle of self-governance as pooling of reserves would lead to a (partial) transfer between different groups of insurees ('Versichertengemeinschaften'). According to the case law by the Constitutional Court, such transfers are lawful only insofar as the re is a 's ufficient personal and material link' bet ween the respective groups. As long as all insurance carriers benefit proportionally from such a central fund this has not be considered as an unlawful transfer, of course (for details see below Volume 2 chapter 11). Make, buy or concurrent sourcing As outlined in section 5.4.2 , there is no clear rule as to whether insurance carriers should make or buy, given both sourcing options are associated with a range of advantages and disadvantages. Based on a review of the relevant literature, we recommend that prior to each investment decision, social insurers undertake a mapping exercise against each of the factors outlined in Figure 84 and Table 59. In particular, insurers should focus on aspects related to contestability in the market, and m easurability of tasks and performance. Notwithstanding the above, for the following reasons it is recommended that health insurance carrier invest partly in developing their own healthcare services: To improve knowledge and capacity, which could enhance their ability to negotiate more favourable contract ual agreements 289 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options To improve flexibility by offering a 'fallback' option should contractual agreements break down (i.e. as is the case now, carriers could employ additional physicians, who are not contracte d, to provide services within their own healthcare institutions) Legal considerations There are some legal impediments with respect to providing services within the carriers' own institutions such as \u00a7 339 ASVG (an agreement with the Chamber of Physician s is requested for establishment or enhancement of an 'Ambulatorium') or under the KAKuG (requring a public assessment of needs). So this option would be subject to amendments by (of course, only simple) legislation. Summary of policy options for healthca re investment Reserves across the social insurance system, and specifically within health insurance, differ across carriers. However, gross value of reserves can be misleading and therefore difficult to compare. Specifically, reserves do not wholly refle ct 'leftover' funds for investment purposes given figures also include non - liquid assets such as real estate and contributions owed. For this reason, it is recommended that only liquid assets be termed as 'reserves' within the remaining grouped as 'non -liquid assets'. Liquid reserves could then be pooled into a central investment fund, with returns to carriers proportional to the level of investment made. Using reserves, health insurance carriers have the option to make, buy or concurrently source healt hcare services. No option is superior, therefore, decisions made by carriers should consider circumstances within the market, in particular, how contestable the market is and how well the service can be measured. Nevertheless, to improve the capacity and f lexibility, it is recommended that carriers partially invest in producing their own services. As previously outlined, liquid reserves could be pooled into a central fund to improve overall healthcare provision. To ensure monies within the fund are maximi sed, an overarching strategy, which all carriers would abide by, is recommended. For example, the strategy could outline appropriate competence centres to invest in. 290 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Broadening the social welfare base Historical economic performance Within Europe, Austria is a strong economic performer, with a relatively high level of employment and GDP per capita. For example, since year 2000, Austria has recorded a higher GDP per capita (total, and in terms of per hour worked) than the average of th e Euro Zone (19), European Union ( 28), and the OECD (see Figure 85). Figure 85: GDP per capita in Austria, EU and OECD (2000 -2016) Source: (224) In regard to employment, historically (i.e. between 2005 and 2014), Austria's unemployment level has fallen below both the OECD and EU. However, since 2014, unemployment in Austria, unlike international trends, has been increasing (see Figure 86). $- $10,000 $20,000 $30,000 $40,000 $50,000 $60,000 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Austria EU (28) EU (19) OECD291 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 86: Unemployment rate for Austria, EU and OECD (2005 -2016) Source: (225) Future economic performance and challenges facing social health insurance Economic forecasts According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) and the OECD, Austria's economic outlook looks strong (226,227) . In the short -term, the Austrian economy is expected to grow by 2% and 1.8% (real terms) in years 2017 and 2018, respectively (226) . From 2018 -2021, the growth rate is predicted to decline marginally to 1.5% in real terms, or 1.7% in actual terms (226) .

For example, since 2000 , the female participation rate in Austria has outperformed countries within the OECD, Eurozone and EU (see Figure 90). Figure 90: Female participation rate with Austria, Eurozone (16), EU (28), and OECD (2000 -16) Source: (228) Despite positive economic projections, future challenges impacting social health insurance finances need to be considered. In particular, Austria's population is ageing, meaning the proportion of the working age population will decline , while simultaneously t hose in retirement will rise . This will negatively impact the financial capacity of health insurers as contribution revenue will decrease, while the number of health services accessed will increase (given older people access healthca re services more frequently). For example, the EU-Commission Ageing Report (2015) estimated that the total economic dependency ratio58 for Austria will increase from 101.9 in 2013 to 122.2 in 2060 (see Figure 91) (229) . 58 Ratio of dependent people, both young aged below 20 and elderly aged 65 or above, relative to the working -age population (20 -64)) 50.055.060.065.070.075.0 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Austria OECD EU (16) EU (28)295 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 91: Total economic dependency ratio projections for Austria (2020 -2060) Source: (229) Taking into account demographic and economic predictions, changes to social health insurance contribution revenue have been estimated. For example, the HVSV (2017) forecasted the balance of social health insurance revenues and expenditures up until 2019. Results from their research reveal that from 2017 onwards, social hea lth insurance, on average, will operate in defi cit, which in 2019 will amount to \u20ac277 million.

Table 60: Labour market c hallenges facing social insurance systems Challenge Description Challenge to financing Digitilisation Advances in technology have increased the size of the online economy. Three main tax challenges caused from digitalisation are: lack of physical presence in a country, valuing personal data, and characterising payments. Self-employment The digital economy has led to an increase in the number of non -standard workers, includ ing those who are self - employed. Tax avoidance. AI and automation Advances in AI and automation are increasingly rendering certain forms of human capital obsolete. Potential for mass unemployment leading to lower tax revenues. Source: See descriptions below. Digitalisation The proliferation of the Internet across all age groups and economies has led to significant growth in the online marketplace (233) . As outlined by a recent OECD report (2016), internet companies are no longer dominated by service providers, or soft - or hard -ware companies, but rather platform operators (e.g. Apple, Google, Facebook and Airbnb) (233) . The proportion of the population who engage with online platforms is significant and continues to grow. A recent study found that 17% of Europeans use services within a collaborative online platform (e.g. Uber, Airbnb), of these people, just under a third (32%) provide the service (234,235) . A recent report (2016) 297 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options estimated the size of the European collaborative digital economy at \u20ac4 billion in terms of revenue in 2015, which generated \u20ac28 billion worth of transactions (236) . The digital economy offers consumers better, smarter products and services, and therefore plays a significant role in economic growth (237) . However, it also represents a key challenge for governments in terms of tax collect ion. The OECD has categorised these tax challenges into the following three categories: 1. Nexus: Unlike traditional 'brick and mortar' businesses, digital businesses are highly mobile, therefore digital companies often operate in countries without a physica l or legal presence. 2. Data: Personal data is highly profitable for digital companies such as Google and Facebook, who use it for advertising purposes. A key challenge is how to attribute value to this data and how to classify it for tax purposes. 3. Characte risation: It has become increasingly difficult to characterise payments in new digital business models, given there is no intermediary (238,239) . Other indirect tax challenges resulting from digitilisation involve VAT in terms of cross -border trades in good, services and intangibles (i.e. results in minimal to no levels of VAT being applied) (239) . Governments across the OECD recognise the important challenge digitilisation represents to their economies. In response, t he OECD has created a Task Force on the Digital Economy (TFDE) which evaluated several policy options to addr ess tax challenges posed by digitalisation. The TFDE concluded that exceptions to permanent establishment (PE) should be modified so that core activities performed by a company in a specific country are taxed accordingly. Secondly, they recommend that cou ntries apply international VAT/GST guidelines, which outline global standards on the allocation of VAT/GST taxing rights on cross -border transactions (239) . An overview of policy options explored by the TFDE, including those outlined above , are provided in Figure 93. Figure 93: Policy options to tackle tax challenges caused by the digital economy The OECD T FDE analysed several policy options to tackle the tax challenges caused by the digital economy. The options included: Changes to the exceptions of Permanent Establishment (PE) status, that is, whether preparatory of auxiliary activities should remain exempt * Alternative to the current PE threshold 298 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Introduction of a withholding tax on payments by country residents for goods and services purchased online from non -resident providers Introduction of an equalisation levy to ensure equal treatment between foreign and domestic suppliers (essentially it is a way to tax non -resident companies who have significant economic presence in a country) Collection of VAT on imports of low -valued goods Collection of VAT on cross -border business -to-consume supplies of services and intangibles* Source: (239) Note: * Dot points which are bolded reflect policies that were eventually supported by the TFDE. The remaining policies were not supported. As in all countries, automation probability differs significantly across professions. A recent report by Nagl et al . (2017), examined automation probability across nine professions in Austria. Their findings show that across the professions, low automation probability ranges from 0% to 44.6%, and between 0% and 30.3% for high automation probability (see the figure below ) (240) . Further, Austria has recently introduced a digitalisation strategy called 'School 4.0', which includes training to enhance IT competencies amongst school -aged children. Figure 94: Low and high aut omation probability by profession (Austria) Source: (240) 0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0% Agriculture and forestry Clerks Service workers Technicians Operator Crafstmen Elementary occupation Executives Academics Low automation probability (less than 30%) High automation probability (over 70%)299 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Self-employment The digital economy has led to a growth in non -standard work (NSW), w hich is defined by what it is not: 'full-time dependent employment with a contract of indefinite duration' (233) . NSW is often irregular (e. g. part-time or temporary) and the individual is often self -employed. Self-employment is challenging the traditional labour market, particularly within occupations such as management, technicians and associate professionals (see figures below) (241) . Workers who classify themselves as self -employed are more likely to work multiple jobs, have numero us income sources, and in many cases, can work from anywhere in the world. Despite drastic changes to the labour market, standard working hours, minimum wages, insurance, taxes and benefits have remained unchanged or have only been marginally adapted (241) . Self-employment is often viewed positively as it allows workers greater flexibility, requires entrepreneurship and innovative ideas thus boosting overall economic growth. On the other hand, it can be seen as exploitative as many workers are not awarded bas ic employment rights, and are more exposed to financial insecurity (242) . In terms of public financing, self -employment represents a challenge to governments as it is associated with lower tax rates, lower incomes and higher rates of tax evasion (242) . In Austria, for example, there is an increasing number of 'bogus' self -employed individuals who do so to avoid tax or social security contributions (243) . Figure 95: Self -employment as a % of total employment for a selection of countries ( 2015) Source: (244) 13.03%16.10% 0.00%10.00%20.00%30.00%40.00%50.00%60.00% LUX USA NOR RUS DNK EST SWE AUS DEU KOR MEX TUR GRC COL300 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options AI and automation The developed world is facing a new indust rial revolution caused by advances in AI which make certain forms of manual routine labour increasingly obsolete (e.g. bank tellers, cashiers, car assembly) (230,231) . To date, job losses caused by automation have larg ely been felt by the middle -class and those with lower levels of education, thus widening the income equality gap (245) . For example, the OECD (2016) estimate that 40% of workers who have a lower secondary education degree are employed in jobs with a risk of automation, compared to 5% for those with a tertiary degree or above (241) . However, development in AI will increasingly place highly -skilled jobs under risk. Prominent examples already present within the econ omy are outlined below: Law firms are turning to E -Discovery software to sift through large volumes of documents, which is replacing the work undertaken by human clerks or paralegals Enlitic has developed deep learning technology to assist healthcare pr oviders in clinical decision making (e.g. Enlitic software can compare multiple lung CT scans to identify blood vessels, harmless imaging artefacts or malignant lung nodules) (246) . For decades' economists have predicted rising rates of unemployment caused by advances in technology. The debate continues today with a number of researchers predicting growing unemployment attributable to the rise in computer controlled equipment (see Figure 96). For example, the OECD have predicted that AI will lead to a loss of 5.1 million jobs across numerous countries between 2015 and 2020. At a country - specific level, researchers within the US have estimated that each additional robot will replace between 180 to 340 workers. Figu re 96: Impact of automation on unemployment: Brief review of recent research papers and policy reports Frey & Osborne (2017). The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerization. The authors looked at 702 occupations in the US and estimated that over the next two decades, 47% of workers in the country could be automated. Acemoglu & Restrepo (2017). Robots and jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets. Research showed that one addition al robot per 1,000 workers is associated with a reduction in the employment to population ratio by 0.18 -0.34 percentag e points (i.e. one additional robot could repla ce 180 to 340 workers). 301 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options OECD. (2016). Automation and independent work in a digital economy . Based on results from the Survey on Adult Skills, 9% of jobs across the OECD are at high -risk of being automated* For a further 25% of jobs, it is expected that 50% of their tasks will change significantly due to automation. World Economic Forum. (2016 ). The Future of Jobs. Predicted that between 2015 -2020 there would be a total of 7,165,000 job losses across 20** different countries due to automation and AI, largely in office and administration, a nd manufacturing and production. Over the same period, AI and automation is expected to create an additional 2,021,000 jobs within the areas such as business and financial operation, and management . Net impact of 5,144,000 job losses between 2015 and 2020. However, the combined population of all countries us ed in the study is well over 2 billion, therefore 5.1 million jobs could be considered relatively small. Source: (230 -232,241,247) Note: *OECD figures are markedly below that of other studies given their methodological approach. Specifically, the OECD report looks at task content of individual jobs in each occupation, as opposed to occupations as a whole. ** Australia, Brazil, Chin a, France, Germany, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The impact of AI on employment sh ould not thwart its development given technological developments lead to significant improvements in everyday lives. Further, other industries may 'soak up' workers who have been made redundant in highly -automated industries (e.g. demand for labour in the health and long - term care sector which will continue to grow as people g et older and sicker). Lastly, productivity gains may in fact expand employment opportunities within affected areas thus boosting overall employment (230) . For example, one study found that for each job created in a high -tech industry, an additional five complemen tary jobs are al so added (see the figure below for an overview of the impact of AI and automation on the economy) (241) . 302 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 97: Impact of artificial intelligence and automatio n Although automation and AI is unlikely to lead to high levels of unemployment, and in certain cases, may increase overall employment, governments still need to act swiftly to fully capitalise on the benefits of technological advances, and to avoid shor t-term employment displacement. Policies within Austria are already showing promise in terms of adapting to changing labour markets. For example, relative to other European countries, Austria spends a relatively high amount on R&D, most of which stems from the private sector (see Figure 98) (248) . Figure 98: R&D expenditure as a % GDP for a selection of EU countries (2005 and 2015) Source: (248) 2.38%3.07% 0.00%1.00%2.00%3.00%4.00% Luxembourg Netherlands EU France Belgium Germany Austria 2005 2015303 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Current international policy responses Social insurance systems, in the past, have relied upon a mix of policy options to broaden the social welfare base. Typically, governments rely on chan ges to taxation policy to raise healthcare funds , for example, through the introduction of new taxes, or via changes to the taxation base. Examples of prominent taxation policies targeted at widening t he financial welfare based are outlined in this section and include changes to the French taxation base, earmarked health taxes and the Financial Transactions Tax. Changes to the French taxation base During the 1990s, France was faced with slow economic growth and high rates of unemployment. Consequently, the country experienced high budget deficits, which were largely attributed to the healthcare sector. In an effort to improve the sustainability of the healthcare system, in 1995, the then President called for reform within the social insurance system, inc luding ways to widen the revenue base (249,250) . In 1997, the French Government proposed a bill on social security funding, outlining a significant increase in the general social contribution tax (contribution sociale g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e (CSG)) (i.e. from 3.4% to 7.5% (5.3% earmarked for health) ), along with a simultaneous reduction in employee sickness insurance contributions (5.5% to 0.75%) (249,250) . By increasing the CSG, the French Government increased the social welfare base given, unlike sickne ss contributions, the CSG also takes into account income derived from unemployment and disability benefits , gambling, pensions and financial assets (see figure below for a breakdown of CSG funds). Today, 70.2% of CSG funds are allocated to the country's healthcare sector (249,250) . 304 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 99: Origins and allocation of CSG revenues (2012) Source: (250) The CSG represents the government's greatest effort to diversify funds for healthcare. Over the past 10 years, the government has generated a 'third pillar' of revenue for social security through the form of additional taxes (Imp\u00f4ts et Taxes Affect\u00e9s), which includes over 20 types of earmarked taxes. In 2012, these taxes raised \u20ac51 billion, with just over half (55%) of these funds being dedicated to health (249,250) . Figure 100: Distribution of earmarked taxes for social security (% and billion EUR) (2012) Source: (250) A timeline demonstrating the source of funds for social security in France has been provided in Figure 101. The figure shows that France has made significant progress in diversifying the financial base for healthcare, and is therefore less reliant on the labour market.

The same exemptions also apply to: Livret Juene (savings accounts for people aged 12-25) (15% of hosueholds), Livret de D\u00e9veloppement Durable (savings accounts development) (37% of househo lds), and Livret d'\u00e9pargne Populaire (popular savings accounts) (20% of households). Earmarked 'sin' taxes In response to rising rates of obesity, tobacco and alcohol consumptions, a number of countries have introduced 'sin taxes' on items that are deeme d unhealthy (251) . In many cases, these taxes are earmarked with all or a portion of revenue being used to fund areas within healthcare, such as health prevention and promotion, and health insurance (252) . Thus, t he objective of earmarked sin taxes is two - fold: firstly, to discourage unhealthy consumption, which may reduce future demand for healthcare, and secondly, to raise revenue for underfunded areas within the healthcare sector (252) . Several countries in America, Europe and Asia have implemented one or several forms of sin taxes in recent years. For example : 306 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The UK announced the introduction of a sugar tax within the Government's 2016 budget. The tax is expected to raise \u00a3400 million a year. Denmark introduced a levy of \u20ac2.41 per kilogram of saturated fat used in a food product (2011). This policy was not considered successful and subsequently abandoned in 2012. As of 2017, France's tax on sweetened drinks totaled \u20ac7.53 per hectolitre (i.e. 100 litres). In 2016, the tax raised \u20ac313 million. Further, taxes on tobacco and alcohol account for around \u20ac8 billion and \u20ac1 billion in revenue each year, respectively. Sever al US states have sugar drink taxes in place, a 2009 report estimated that a national tax of 1 cent per ounce on sugar -sweetened beverages would generate US$14.9 billion annually (250) . By linking additional tax revenue to specific health projects, public support is more likely, which may outweigh industry opposition (251) . Italy's IRAP (imposta regional sulle attivit \u00e0) Tax in Italy is collected at the federal, regional and local level. At the regional level, governments tax companies, including foreign companies with branches in Italy, on their productive activities (i.e. the imposta regional sulle attivit \u00e0 (IRAP)). The IRAP is generall y set at 3.9%, however, for banks and financial entities, and insurance corporations this rate is higher at 4.2% and 5.9%, respectively (253,254) . The IRAP represents one of the primary forms of funding for Italy's National Health System (i.e. 35% of total financing) (254) . Key features of the IRAP are outlined in Figure 102. Figure 102: Italy's imposta regional sulle attivit \u00e0 (IRAP) IRAP is an earmarked corporate tax levied on the net added value of production The IRAP is applied at the regional level by resident companies and by foreign companies with permanent establishment (PE) status IRAP is not levied on foreign income IRAP is pooled at the national level, and later allocated back to the regions Each region ha s the flexibility to increase or decrease the IRAP by 0.92%, meaning that different levels of IRAP tax are applied across the country Source: (253,254) 307 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Financial Transactions Tax The Financi al Transactions Tax (FTT) has been proposed as a uniform tax on share, bond and currency transactions. The objective of the tax is to increase contributions from the financial sector to widen the revenue base. The original suggested tax rate was 0.5%, however, economists suggest a figure ranging between 0.1 -1% (255 -257) . FTTs are designed to increased funds for governments to offer greater stability within the economy. On the other hand, such a tax may lead to a reduction in financial transaction, leading to job losses in the financial sector. Further, banks are likely to pass on the costs to consumers, therefore lowering returns for pensioners and those with savings (255 -257) . Several Asian countries have implemented an FTT including Hong Kong, India (Mumbai), South Korea (Seoul), and Taiwan (Taipei). In Europe, in 2011, the European Commission proposed a FTT for the entire EU. By 2012, a unanimous agreement on the tax could not be reached, however, several member states were keen to go ahead with implementing an FTT. To date , an FTT in Europe has not been introduced (255 -257) . Policy options: Broadening the social welfare base Based on international experiences and new challenges facing labour markets across the world, including Austria, a number of policy options have been developed to broaden the country's social welfare base. These have been grouped into the following policy categories: taxation, education and skills , retirement , and workforce participation . Education and ski lls59 Education systems It is advised that governments and industry leaders fully cooperate to ensure that academic institutions teach students skills that meet future demands. This may entail increased investment in vocational training, and programs which promote re -training and lifelong learning (as described in further detail below). It is important to note that Austria already performs well in this area, with a relatively high 59 These policies have been based on options derived by the World Economic Forum (2016) and the US Government (247,258) . 308 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options proportion of students within upper se condary education engaged in vocational education and training (see Figure 103). Figure 103: Share of upper -secondary students in vocational programs (2014) Source: (259) Lifelong learning People are living an d working longer today than in the past. Longer lives partnered with a rapidly changing economy mean that an increasing number of older people find themselves out of work and without the relevant skills to fill upcoming positions. The Austrian Government could enhance its effort to collaborate with business to encourage ongoing retraining an d upskilling to ensure employee skills set are up to dat e. The Government may also offer tax breaks or other financial incentives to businesses on expenditure related t o retraining/upskilling. Such initiatives have already been undertaken in this area. For example, in January 2017, the Austrian Government created an additional 30,000 training positions. Of these positions, half are dedicated to young professionals (i.e. under the age of 25), with the remaining half falling under the 'Second chance in the Labour Market' concept. For example, under this concept, 6,500 positions are awarded to those who wish to re -orientate Luxembourg Netherlands Switzerland Austria Male Female309 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Further education Automation and AI will reduce demand for highly -routine manual labour. The focus should therefore be on providing the younger population with higher education which will allow them to transition into jobs requiring strong cognitive skills. Governments could assist this process by offering incentives for individuals wishing to seek higher education. Governments could also run education campaigns during high -school years to encourage children to go on to further education. Legal considerations No particular legal impediments exist for the above policy options. Retirement policies The legal retirement age in Austria is 65 years for men and 60 years for women, with an expectation that the latter figur e will converge to the male age by 2033 (260) .60 Despite the legal retirement age being set between 60 -65 years, the actual retirement age in Austria is approximately 60 years. To addr ess this issue, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection have put in place several pension reform measures, which have already seen positive returns (for example, abolishment of early retirement options) . Specifically, between 2012 and 2016 , the real retirement age increased from 58.4 to 60.33 (see Figure 104) (8,261) . 60 There are provisions in place for early retirement. Specifically, men can retire at 62 years if they had been employed for 45 years, for women, an equivalent policy has been suspended until their legal retirement age has been harmonise d. 310 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 104: Trend in the real retirement age (2012 -16) Source: Data provided by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection It is recommended that the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection continue its effort to raise the actual retirement age in coming years. Policy -makers should also continue thei r effort in the area of health prevention and promotion to avoid early retirement where possible. Legal considerations An increase of the actual retirement age is a salient issue in public discussion as well as for policymakers. The main legal impediment that has to be faced in this respect is the principle of 'Vertrauensschutz', meaning that all individuals may trust in a legal situation (especially if it is applicable already for a long - period of time) and, thus, are protected against intensive and/or s udden reductions. Therefore, 'smooth transition provisions' are required for any amendments aiming to increase retirement age. Workforce participation The participation rate of women aged 15 -64 years is significantly below that of men at 68%. Although this figure represents a significant increase from 60% in 2004, additional policies to encourage women to enter or re -enter the workforce should be implemen ted. For example: Impro ve affordability and quality of child care Encourage business es to offer flexible working time arrangements 58.458.559.660.260.33 5757.55858.55959.56060.561 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016311 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Encourage fathers to be more involvement in child -rearing responsibilities, for example, through changes to parental leave arrangements. Increasing the number of women in the formal workforce will improve the financial strength of social health insurers, as well as reduce the need to increase taxes to fund healthcare. Legal considerations Even though a wide range of measures would be necessary for implementing these policy options, no particular legal impediments have to be faced in this respect. Taxation policies At present, 80% of revenue for social health insurers is sourced from employee/employer contributions. The reliance on contributions may be problematic given labour market volatility, which is expected to worsen given rising rates of self -employ ment, digitalis ation, ageing of the population, and AI and automation. To address this challenge, social health ins urers could: Alter the contribution base to consider total income, including incom e from benefits and properties, for example . If this approach is taken, the maximum income threshold should be upwardly revised to fully realise the financial benefits of wi dening the contribution base (explored further in the section regarding 'collection of contributions' ). Alter the contribution base stemming from employers, for example by taxing profits. However, caution should be taken when considering this approach as although it may lead to short -term gains, in the long -run, Austrian companies may be less competitive on a global scale and less likely to hire, thus reducing overall contributions (see Italy's IRAP, Figure 102, for further details) . Diversify revenue sources by increasing the level of earmarked health taxes, beyond the current tobacco tax (\u00a7 447a Abs. 10 ASVG), which currently contributes to the R isk Equalisation Fund (2/3 of tax revenue) and the Health Prevention and Promotion Fund (1/3). For example, additional taxes could be levied on alcohol, and products with high leve ls of sugar and saturated fat. Before such taxes are introduced, it is impor tant to clearly specify whether the main objective of the tax is to change health behaviours or raise revenue. If the former, the literature suggests that taxes should b e set 20% or above (specifically, for sugar -sweetened beverages). 312 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Legal considerati ons Whilst increasing taxes dedicated to a specific health purpose would not cause particular legal impediments, widening of the basis for social insurance contributions by including income which is not gained from (self -)employment would lead to problems with respect to the fundamental concept of social insurance, which is closely linked to (self -)employement and, thus, to the income gained from that source. Moreover a problem with respect to the principle of self -governance has to be faced, too, as perso ns living on properties are not part of any 'Versichertengemeinschaft': So why should they pay contributions and why should (self -)employed persons share their risks with landlords etc? (for details see Volume 2 chapter 5.2.2.) International studies In addition to the policy options outlined above, it is advised that the Austrian Government keep up -to- date with research being undertaken in this area by international institutions, namely the OECD. For example, t his year, t he OECD have commissioned a Future of Work project to advise governments on how to address challenges caused by changes to the traditional labour workforce (see Figure 105). Figure 105: OECD Future of Work project The OECD initiative on the Future of Work will look at how demographic change, globalisation and technological progress are affecting the quantity and quality of jobs, as well as labour m arket inclusiveness, and what this means for the labour market, skills and social policy. As part of this project, the OECD will look at which schemes or models providing social protection to non -standard workers are already in place across the OECD, how w ell they work, and what implementation problems exist. Summary of policy options for broadening the social welfare base First and foremost, t o ensure the financial sustainability of the social insurance, policy -makers should implement appropriate policies to improve efficiencies within the system. Only then should further efforts to widen the social welfare base be considered. Within sectio n 5.5.3 , a description of the FTT was provided, however, it has not been included within our proposed policy options given there is disagreement about the policy's implementation across Europe. 313 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Specifically, this option is not recommended given the adverse impact an FTT would likely have on financial markets if implemented by a single country. It is advised that the government intensify its effort to prepare the labour market for changing industry demands. Specifically, by investing in relevant education programs that span across an individual's working life. By ensuring skills match demand, the possibility of rising unemployment as a result of AI and automation will be minismised. A continuation of policies to boost the actual retirement age and participation of women in the workforce is also highly recommended in the short -term. Changes to the tax system , through a broadening of the contribution base , should only be considered if 'soft' measures (as outlined above) are unable to raise sufficient funds. This appr oach is recommended for various reasons. First, there is no political consensus or motivation to pursue this policy. Second, Austria already draws upon both direct and indirect taxes to subsidy healthcare. And thirdly, an increase in taxes is inconsistent with recent policies to reduce the overall tax burden for citizens. Lastly, in regard to earmarked sin taxes, we advise that the Austrian Government commission a study to evaluate the impact such taxes have on changing individual behaviour and raising add itional revenue. Based on findings from the review, the Government could consider extending sin taxes beyond the current tobacco tax (\u00a7 447a Abs. 10 ASVG). 314 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 6 Contracts and purchasing Chapter 6 relates to contracts and the purchasing of services within healthcare systems. The chapter is focused on the negotiation process between providers (i.e. physicians) and payers (i.e. health insurance) , for exam ple, by covering topics such as reimbursement and quality of care. Issues regarding IT and procurement of medicines (including expenditure) are also discussed. Framework for p rimary and outpatient care Policy -makers are increasingly interested in strengthening primary and outpatient care given i ts role in promoting coordinated, appropriate health services . Primary and outpatient care therefore plays a salient part in improving healthcare efficiency by minimising unnecessary, costly services deliver ed within an inpatient setting. A pivot towards primary and outpatient care is evident in Austria, where, in recent years, two primary healthcare units have been established, in addition to financial incentives for establishing group ambulatory care centre s (further details provided in section 6.3.8 ). Dimensions of primary and outpatient care can be broken down into 10 elements, which are further grouped into the following three indicators: structure, process and outcomes (262) . Many of these dimensions are influenced by contractual negotiations, therefore the agreement reached between social health insurance and the Chamber of Physicians is of significant importance for improving primary and outpatient care. Further details regarding contractual negotiations, including elements within the primary and outpatient care conceptual framework, are discussed in sections 6.2 and 6.3. Table 61: Elements of primary and outpatient care Group indicators Element Description Structure Governance Vision, regulations Economic conditions Expenditure, remuneration Workforce development Training Process Access Access to care, physicians and services 315 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Group indicators Element Description Comprehensiveness Breadth of services Coordination and continuity of care Link between all levels of care Outcomes Efficiency Cost -effective use of resources Equity Systematic differences in healthcare access and outcomes Source: Adapted from (262) Figure 106: Conceptual framework for primary and outpatient care in Austria Source: Adapted from (262) 316 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Structure Governance Primary and outpatient speci alist care operates within Austria's social in surance system. Social health insurers are self -governed institutions operating under various laws . Social insurance carriers must belong to the umbrella institution, the HVSV , which is responsible for the overall vision of social insurance. It is importan t to note that 15 KFAs, although by definition are a form of social insurance, do not operate under the HVSV . Economic conditions Ambulatory care accounts for 21.9% of current health expenditure in Austria, or \u20ac7.7 million. Of these funds, just under half (43%) are spent on services provided by physicians, followed by dentists (23%), and finally, other health practitioners, ambulatory healthcare centres, and home health care services (34%). GPs and specialists who are contracted with a social health insurer are remunerated via a mix of FFS and contact capitated payments (see section 6.2 for further details) . Non -contracted physicians, are paid directly by individuals, who are later partly reimbursed by their social health insurer (described further in section 6.2). According to Stigler et al. ( 2012), Austrian GPs, on average, earn between 33 -50% of outpatient specialists income. This proportion indicates the relative inferior status of GPs within the healthcare system (263) . Workforce development According to Hofmarcher (2013), those wanting to become a physician, of any sort, must first complete a degree in human medicines, which includes a minimum of 12 semesters of classes at a medical university (4). To become a specialist, individuals must complete an additional 63 months of postg raduate clinical training, and examinations. Post -graduate education for GPs, on the other hand, is limited to 33 months (4). Training during these three years primarily takes place within a hospital setting , however, six months is spent with a GP setting. 317 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Process Access GPs do not have a formal gatekeeper role within the Austrian healthcare system, therefore patients are free to access any type of outpatient specialist and/or inpatient care. Access to healthcare is also facilitated by relatively low levels of cost -sharing, with most services being provided in -kind by social health insurers (263) . Opening hours for both GPs and specialists, as outlined within contractual agreements is low, which may force patients to access inpatient care, despite suffering from relatively minor conditions. For example, it is typical for the general contract to state that GPs be open for at least 20 hours. Actual opening hours are likely to be longer, however, this figure is unknown as it is not formally recorded.61 Actual working hours in other developed healthcare systems ranges from approximately 33 -51 hours per week (264,2 65).62 Access to GPs and specialists differs across social health insurers as carriers with greater financial means are able to offer more attractive contractual agreements, that is, higher tariffs. As a result, insurees with wealthier carriers have grea ter access to GPs and specialists. In regard to outpatient specialists, criteria for developing where posts are located has not based on robust needs -based factors , which may have le d to a shortage of specialists within certain areas. Regional Structural Plans for health ( Regionaler Strukturplan Gesundheit ) aim to coordinate care between the Land and social health insurance, however, the initiative's succ ess, to date, has been limited. Further, in recent years, a cap on certain outpatient specialist proced ures has been implemented (e.g. a cap on MRIs, where Austria performs a relatively high number of exams (see figure below ), has been met with frustration). Caps, which may either apply to specialists of GPs, differ across contractual agreements. As an example, carriers may apply points to services, which are linked to reimbursement, with the value of each point declining after certain thresholds are reached w ithin a specific time period (this may be applied at the aggregate level, or at a specific service level). An alternate method is to limit the number of procedures 61 The HVSV are currently undertaking a project using a web crawler to determine opening hours amongst contracted GPs. 62 For example, Australian GPs, on average, work 33 hours per week, compared to 44 and 51 hours in the Netherlands and Belgium, respe ctively. These figures cannot be compared directly as findings were sourced from two surveys which used different methodologies (264,265) . 318 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options physicians can perform over a specific period of time, after which no reimbursement is provi ded. Carriers may implement either or both forms of caps (266) . Implementing caps can be a positive move to reduce unnecessary care and contain costs. H owever, to ensure those in real need are not put at a disadvantage, they should be implemented alongside relevant guidelines. Figure 107: MRI exams per 1,000 people (2014 or nearest year) Source: (17) Comprehensiveness Despite recent efforts to expand physician and healthcare networks, the majority of GPs and specialists operate within single practices (4). This arrangement limits the breadth of services a patient receive s when visiting their GP or specialist. Coordination and continuity of care As previously discussed, Austrian citizens have unregulated access to GPs and specialists . The principle of free provider of choice can act as a barrier to providing a high -quality healthcare system, given no single physician is responsible for managing and monitoring healthcare at the individual level. As frequently highlighted during roundtabl e stakeholder discussions, in Austria, this mean patients are often left 58.6 0.020.040.060.080.0100.0120.0 Cyprus Bulgaria Romania Ireland Portugal Hungary Lithuania Slovenia Croatia Latvia Malta United Kingdom Czech Republic Finland Poland Netherlands Slovak Republic Estonia Austria EU26 Greece Denmark Spain Belgium Luxembourg France Germany319 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 'wandering' the healthcare system, and thus accessing inappropriate levels of care. It is important to note that patient management is not required for all individuals, just those who suffer from one or multiple chronic conditions, and who therefore require access to a number of different healthcare providers. Continuity of care between primary, ambulatory and inpatient care is further hindered by the dual financing system, where the L\u00e4nder is responsible for inpatient care, and social health insurance for primary and ambulatory care. Outcomes Efficiency Insufficient primary and ambulatory care has a negative impact on overall healthcare efficiency. This is evident in Austria, where there is a relatively high number of hospital admissions (see section 3.5 for further details). Frequency of access to care in Austria is also present across lower forms of care, specifically , at the outpatient and primary care level. For example, a report by Pichlh\u00f6 fer an d Maier (2014) found that unrestricted access to healthcare services has led to a relatively hig h overall utilisation rate (see section 3.5). Equity Equity of care is high in Austria given the vast majority of people have access to the social health insurance system. Ineq uity does however exist between social health insurers. Specifically, given multiple contractual agreements, t he number of GP s and specialists available to patients, and reimbursable services, differ according to each health insurer. These differences occur despite harmonised contribution rates. In terms of user chargers, social health insurance carriers have implemented differ ential user charges, which again may act as a barrier to healthcare for some. Further, the pharmaceutical expenditure cap (i.e. 2% of net income) , although a positive initiative, is not in technical terms 'progressive' and thus adversely impacts those on l ower incomes (see section 5.3 for further details on user chargers ). Summary For the reasons outlined above, Austria frequently ranks poorly in t erms of primary and outpatient care. For example, an international comparison of primary care by Stigler et al . (2012), classified Austria as a 'low primary care country' along with Belgium, France, Germany and the US (263) . This finding was mirrored by Kringos et al. (2013) who also classified the system as 'weak' (267) . 320 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Despite this ranking, the vast majority of the population satisfied with the general outpatient sector (98%) and the treatment they receive (97%).63 Further, a recent analysis comparing patient -provider interactions across all 28 EU Member States revealed Austria performs well in this area (see figure below ). However, caution should be take n when interpreting these results given the authors had minimal knowledge of why patients report low or high levels of quality (65,268) . Figure 108: Quality of inte ractions between patient and primary care physician (score), EU(28), 2013 Source: Taken directly from (65,268) Paying healthcare providers Types of provider payment schemes Predominate payment mechanism for primary/outpatient physicians and hospitals are fee-for-service (FFS) (healthcare providers are paid for each individual service), capitation (healthcare providers are paid a fixed amount per enrollee, which is independent of number of patients treated), physician salaries, and to a lesser extent, pay -for-performance (P4P) (269) . 63 Satisfaction survey (2015) completed as part of the Federal Health -Target contracts (objective 8.4.1). 321 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In regard to outpatient services, the trend within this area has been towards blended payment, which incorporates elements of each of the four payment models outlined above (270) . At the hospital level, payers of in patient care have increasingly moved away from global budgets and FFS to 'bundled' payments that group together components of healthcare (i.e. grouped packages of care, and grouped inputs to delivery of care) (270) . Bundled payments within the hospital sector are generally classified under a DRG (diagnostic -related group) case -mix system. An overview of each of these payment method s is provided in Table 62. Table 62: Type of provider payment methods Payment method Description Unit of payment Setting Fee-for-service Retrospective payment based on volume of individual services Units of service Hospital and physicians Salary/global budget Lump sum payment for a specific period of time Time Physicians Capitation Periodic lump sum payment per enrolled patient for specific services Persons registered Hospital and physicians DRG Statistical system that classifies inpatient stays for the purpose of reimbursement Type of service Hospitals Pay-for-performance Payment linked to quality of care provided Performance Hospital and physicians Source: (270) As outlined above, provider payme nts is one of the tools policy -makers can use to achieve health system objectives (271) . Traditional methods of payment outlined above, however, do not directly align with all 322 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options health system priorities, such as efficiency, quality and equity . Further, many of these methods have inbuilt incentives that lower the quality of care. For example, FFS can lead to overprovision of services which inflates expenditure and, in certain circumstances, can worsen patient outcomes. Capitation, on the other hand, can control expenditure, however, it may lead to 'cream skimming' and cost -shifting. Lastly, the use of DRGs can encourage fraudulent behaviour given hospitals have an incentive to up -code in order to receive greater payments (see the following two t ables for further details) (270,271) . In response t o shortcomings associated with traditional payment methods, policy -makers have become increasingly interested in linking payments to the quality of care provided (i.e. P4P). In theory, P4P can overcome the principal -agent problem by aligning patient -provid er incentives (269) . Despite economic incentives, there is limited evidence to suggest P4P has a positive effect on health system objectives (further details on P4P is provided in section 6.4.4 ) (272) .

International case studies: Paying providers Physician payment mechanisms across European social health insurance systems are similar. At the GP and outpatient specialist level, FFS dominates reimbursement, however, increasingly policy -makers are 324 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options introducing pay -for-performance (P4P) schemes to incentivise high -quality care. Despite this, P4P comprises a small proportion of overall income. At the hospital level, European social health insur ance systems are reliant on diagnostic related groups (DRGs) to reimburse hospitals as a way to improve transparency and contain costs. The remainder of this section provides a description of physician reimbursement schemes for GPs, outpatient specialists and hospitals, in Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sw itzerland and Austria. Table 65: Physician reimbursement in Europe Country Primary care Outpatient specialists Inpatient care Belgium Largely FFS using national fee schedule, capitated budgets and P4P (lump sum payments) FFS Prospective budgets and FFS France FFS, capitation and P4P FFS and P4P DRGs Germany FFS and pay -for- performance FFS DRGs Set fees for highly specialised services Netherlands FFS, capitation, bundled payment DRGs* DRGs Switzerland FFS (national fee schedule) and capitation FFS DRGs Austria FFS and capitated flat rate payments FFS and flat rate payments Budgets informed by DRGs (i.e. LKF in Austria) Source: See country descriptions below. Note: *Dutch DRGs are referred to as DBCs, with the main difference being that they also include outpatient care. 325 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Belgium In Belgium, the majority of physicians work in in independent medical practices and are self -employed. Medical specialists work in health institutions (mainly hospitals) and/or in an outpatient private practice (82). Independent medical practitioners are largely paid on a FFS basis, with less than 1% of physicians being paid via a salary. Those who are salaried generally work in integrated medical health care practices owned by physicians and remunerated by National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI) (who manage compulsory health insurance) according to a capitation payment (82). The proportion of income GPs receive from FFS, although still large, has been declining due to the increase in lump -sum payments linked to quality of care (i.e. from 2.6% of income in 2000 to 20% in 2010). Specifically, for: Managing a patient's global medical file (file of patient information held by the GP to share with other providers to improve care coordination) Coordinating disease management p rograms (e.g. type II diabetes and chronic kidney failure) Participating in continuing education activities and peer review sessions Being on call (274) . Specialists working in hospitals are also reimbursed through a FFS model using rates negotiated at the natio nal-level . Although specialists theoretically get paid directly for their work, in reality, hosp itals retain a proportion of fees in order to compensate for capital and other overhead costs (82). Hospitals in Belgium are reimbursed through two separate mechanisms depending on the type of service being provided. Specifically, services such as accommodation, nursing activities/units, operating rooms and ste rilisation are paid through a prospective budget system. Medical services, such as polyclinics and laboratories, for example, are largely paid via FFS (82). France64 The majority (58%) of G Ps in France are self -employed in solo, group or multi -professional practices, and who are largely paid on a FFS basis (87% FFS, 13% on other forms of payments such as P4P and 64 Information collected from D. Polton directly. 326 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options capitation65). In addition, there are approximately 400 health centres who employ salaried GPs. Other funds stem from payments that are linked to improvements i n care coordination. Specifically, in 2008, the Ministry of Health launched a pilot to test prospective payment schemes to encourage the development of multi -professional group practices in primary care (Exp\u00e9rimentation de Nouveaux Modes de R\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ). The pilots included multi -professional group practices, healthcare networks and health care centres, who participated on a voluntary basis. The prospective payment comprised approximately 5% of general medicine practice revenue and can be broken down into the following three groups: Payment for time and costs associated coordinating care Payment for provision of new services for targeted patient groups Payment for cooperation through skill -mix modifications between medical and nursing staff. An independent evaluation of the pilots by IRDES suggested the pilot scheme achieved its overall objectives of encouraging group practice and improving, to a certain extent, the geographical distribution of GPs, efficiency structures and quality of care (w ith results varying according to group structures). The pilot program was later generalised for all multi -professional group practices. Under the scheme, multi-professional group practices can claim additional performance -based payments for three targets: accessibility of health care (e.g. opening hours, range of services delivered), intensity of teamwork (e.g. implementation of multi -professional guidelines for chronic diseases), and utilisation of computerised patient medical files , which are shared amon g all providers in the practice. Assuming a patient population of approximately 4,000 people, a multi -professional group practice can earn an additional \u20ac17,850 to \u20ac51,800 per year, depending on their performance. Although multi -professional group practice s continue to grow, they still are in the minority, comprising between 10 -15% of all GPs in France. Further details on the points -based payment scheme are provided in the tables below. Lastly, GPs who set up their practice in underserved areas can receive a lump -sum payment of \u20ac50,000 to cover set -up costs , in addition to other financial incentives for operating in these areas . Although not performance related, GPs can obtain additional remuneration to help set up their practices (e.g. electronic medical records, organisation, care coordination, teleservices, coding of medical data, training of young doctors). This additional payment, as of 2017, amounted to \u20ac1 ,750, and will increase to \u20ac4,620 by 2019. 65 In 2016, the latter component of GP remuneration (i.e. 13%), as of 2016, includes P4P (indicators related to care), a weighted capitated payment, payment linked to the organisation or the practice (e.g. software, electronic communication with sickness funds, training of young doctors, as well as additional payment i n underserved areas. 327 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 66: Remuneration system for integrated group practices (medical homes and network ) - basic remuneration (France) Target Details Points * Fixed remuneration Access to care Open 8am to 8pm, Saturday morning and holidays Access to unplanned care every day Coordination function identified 1,200 points Team work and coordination Multi -professional protocols for some diseases 500 points IT system Sharing of patients' records - 33% of patients in 1st year, and 66% in second year 850 points Variable remuneration (depends on number of patients - following figures relate to 4,000 patients) Team work and coordination Formalised multi -professional coordination on a regular basis for some disease, synthesis in the electronic patient record 1,000 points IT system As above 1,500 points Note: *\u20ac7 per point.

Specialists in the outpatient sector who are self -employed are reimbursed via FFS (approx. 36%), while the remainder are employ ed by hospitals and either fully salaried or have mixed income. In 2014, the P4P scheme was extended to all self -employed physicians, not just GPs. On average, self -employed specialists can earn \u20ac5,480 per year, which constitutes about 2% of specialist inc ome (275) . Finally, since 2008, all hospitals in France have been reimbursed according to a DRG system, which is used to pay physician salaries. 329 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Germany Social health insurance contracted physicians working in the outpatient sector are largely reimbursed on a fee -for-service basis. The fees that SHI reimburse for are outlined within the Uniform Value Scale (UVS) (Einheitlicher Bewertungsma\u00dfstab), which sets out the range of healthcare services reimbursable by sickness fun ds at the outpatient level (276,277) . A limit on the amount each physician can invoice their regional doctor association ( (Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigungen (KV)) is determined every quarter (276,277) . Physicians at the outpatient level also receive additional flat -rate payments for each patient enr olled in a disease management program (DMP) (e.g. Type I and II diabetes, breast cancer, ischemic heart disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). In 2015, the flat fee amounted to \u20ac120 per patient (275,277) . Further information on Germany's DMP is provided in section 6.4.4 . In line with international trends, Germany in 2005 began to gradually phase in DRGs, which were based on the Australian Refined DRG system. Today there exist approximately 1,200 DRG categories (275) . On top of DRGs, there are additional fees for highly -specialised services (i.e. services that cannot be appropriately reimbursed through the DRG system) (277) . Netherlands66 Payments for primary care consists of three layers. First, traditional primary care providers are reimbursed through a combination of capitation and FFS payments, which accounts for approximately 70% of turnover. Second, over the past decade primary care physicians have increasingly formed part of collaborative, joint regional out -of-office care centers; in addition, for certain chronic illnesses care pathways were funded (bundled payments). Forty care groups organise these forms of care on behalf of the participating primary care physicians (20%). Unlike FFS and capitated payments, these rates are not set by government. Thirdly, physicians can negotiate with insurance companies about 'innovation' funds (e-health, substitutions of care etc.) ( which account for the remaining 10% of turnover). Dutch insurers and hospitals negotiate on both the price and the volume of care. The prices of 70% of turnover are freely negotiable, which includes capital remuneration. The impact of rate setting is modest, although the Dutch Healthcare Authority sets the actual packages of care, which providers need to comply to. For certain expensive medicines, complex treatments and specific functions, separate sources of funding exist. Since 2014 just under half (45%) of self -empl oyed hospital physicians are required to 66 Information sourced directly from P. Jeurissen (member of the international evaluation committee) 330 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options negotiate with the hospital on their reimbursement, that is there are no longer formal negotiation partners for the insurance companies. The Government's fiscal policy tries to ensure that provider payments comply with a central goal of total health expenses. Due to limited formal influence on actual payments (especially for hospitals), they have done this by negotiating subdued annual budget raises. An overrun of a certain subsector of providers can be recouped ret rospectively according to each provider's market share. To date this instrument has never been used. Switzerland Outpatient GPs and specialists are paid by a mix of FFS and capitation. Specifically, 90% and 91% of GP and specialist payments are via FF S, with the remainder funded through capitated budgets. Since 2004 , standardised fees for clinical outpatient procedures (both diagnostic and therapeutic services) have been set out in TARMED (278) . Specifically, TARMED assigns a uniform tariff point to each service which is negotiated and agreed upon by the association of physicians and hospitals on the provider side, and by tarifsuisse SA or curafutura on the purchaser side (health insurance assoc iations). The objective of introducing TARMED was to harmonise the amount healthcare providers were reimbursed across cantons (278) . Hospital outpatient acute care is also paid on a FFS basis using the TARMED points based syste m, however, the points differ for physicians working in ambulatory care (i.e. GPs and outpatient specialists) (278) . As of 2012, acut e care hospitals in Switzerland have been paid according to the national SwissDRG system in order to harmonise hospital payments and improve transparency and efficiency. The SwissDRG model is based on the German DRG model, which was in turn was based on th e Australian system. Just under half of inpatient admission costs are borne by health insurers, with the remaining amount under the responsibility of canton governments (278) . Austria GPs and specialists who are contracted with a social insurance carrier and working in the outpatient sector are reimbursed though a mix of FFS and flat-rate payments . The proportion of reimbursement from each payment mechanism depends on the social insurance carrier . For example, ASVG GPs are largel y paid through contact capitated payments, which are paid in full the first ti me a patient visits a GP with in a three -month period (approximately 70%), and to a l esser extent FFS for specific services (approx. 30%) 331 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options (279) . Withi n smaller health insurance carriers , however, physician payments are mainly based on FFS (approx. 90%). In regard to outpatient specialists, again physician payment mechanism depends on which social health insurer the physician is contracted with. Unlike GPs, the primary form of payment for ASVG funds and smaller funds is FFS (i.e. 70 % of ASVG and 90% of small carriers pay physicians on a FFS basis) (280) . For contracted physicians, treatment tariff levels are based on 'staffing plans', which are negotiated between i ndividual health insurance carriers and regional physician chambers . For this reason, the income of a physician will depend on which health insurer(s) he/she is contracted with (37). Non -contracted physicians, Wahl\u00e4rzte, are paid directly by patients, with patients being reimbursed 80% of the cost charged by contract ed doctors (37). Hospital outpatient clinics and acute care are financed by a mix of social ins urance carrier lump sum funds and by federal authorities, L \u00e4nder and local authorities. Hospitals in Austria are reimbursed through budgets, which are informed by the country's DRG system (i.e. (Leistungsorientiertes KrankenanstaltenFinanzierungssystem (LK F) - performance -orientated hospital financing)) (270,279) . In 2016, the Austrian DRG system was extended to outpatient departments within hospitals in order to prevent u nnecessary hospitalisations (for example, for services such as colonoscopies, or for surveillance purposes). Figure 109: Austria's DRG system (LKF) Year The Austrian DRG system was introduced in 1997. Responsibility Federal Hea lth Commission (Bundesgesundheitskommission) , Executive Body of the Federal Health Agency (Bundesgesundheitsgentur) , is in charge of 'setting the terms related to the country's DRG model. The Commission is comprised of representatives from national governm ent, social insurance carriers, local authorities, hospitals, Chamber of Physicians and patients. The Commission has also set up a DRG Working Group who are responsible for maintenance and development of the system. Objectives 332 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Increase transparency Contain costs Optimise use of resources Reduction of unnecessary and multiple procedures Shift care to the outpatient sector, where possible Reduction in acute beds. LKF areas There are two funding areas associated with the LKF, the core area and the control area . The first relates to inpatient hospital stays, which are awarded points based on diagnosis -related case groups (i.e. the 'core area') (Hauptdiagnoseugruppen) . The core area determines budgets for hospitals. The budget of each State Health F und is then dispersed across hospitals based on their total -point value. The control area, on the other hand, takes into account special care provisions that differ across each Land (medizinische Einzelleistungen) . In essence, LKF points for the core area depend on main diagnosis, as opposed to the main services provided for the control area. Together, both areas form the performance -orientated case groups (Leisungsorientierte Diagnosefallgruppen, LDF). Monies that are reserved for hospital financing throu gh the State Health Funds are divided according to the total number of LKF points, which are invoiced by providers. To take into account different circumstances across the Lands, each LKF point differs according to regions. For example, as of 2015, remuner ation per LKF point equated to \u20ac1.28 in Voralberg, compared to \u20ac0.35 in Burgenland (with an average of \u20ac0.82 across Austria). Source: (279,281,282) Contractual agreements between physicians and social health insurers Overview of contractual agreements in Europe Within social insurance systems, tariffs for outpatient services (i.e. GPs and specialists), and to a lesser extent, volume and quality, are negotiated between physicians and health insurers. It is typical within Europe for negotiations to occur between physician associations and health insurer associations, with the agreement being formalised within a general contract . One major exception occurs in the Netherlands, 333 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options where GPs are legally restricted from entering into general contract s and can only jointly discuss contractual arrangements when in the best interest of patients. Although general contract s are the 'norm' in social health insurance systems, countries such as Germany and Switzerland have allowed insurers to sign selective contracts in regard to integrated care models. The objective of this arrangement is to improve competition and thus the qua lity of care. The remainder of this section discusses contractual negotiation processes for the outpatient sector in a range of European countries operating social health insurance models. Contractual negotiations at the inpatient level (i.e. hospitals) have also been included, howe ver, they are not the focus of this report given, in Austria, social health insurance carriers do not have a say in hospital contracts.

Note: *Regulations control exist, however, they are not discussed within contractual negotiations (e.g. the number of inexpensive medicines was imposed on all doctors by Royal Decree). **A limit on the number of procedures, which can be performed by outpatient specialists and GPs is applied (no such cap exists for services). Belgium Negotiation process: outpatient and inpatient care The fee schedule for GPs, specialists and hospitals reimbursable by sickness funds (i.e. the nonmenclature) is negotiated annually or biennia lly between sickness funds and healthcare provider representatives (e.g. doctors' organisations and hospital federations) (283,284) . These discussions also include arrangements pertaining to content, quality and quantity of care. For the purpose of these negotiations, sickness funds work collectively, and could be viewed as representing patient interests (283) . Discussions surrounding GPs and specialists (inpatient and outpatient) take place within the National Commission of Represen tatives of Physicians and Sickness Funds (also referred to as the 'Medico -Mut'), which sits within the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (INAMI) (285) . The Medico - Mut is c omprised of both provider organisation and sickness fund representatives (50/50 split).67 The agreement on tariffs/fees within the Medico -Mut must be accepted by the Minister of Social Affairs, and, in general, last for up to two years (284,286) . An approval of fees by the Minister may be overturned if the following two scenarios occur: Over 40% of physicians within a region reject the agreement 67 For general physicians: there are three members from the AADM, two members of the Cartel and one from the BVAS. For medical speciali sts: there are five members of the BVAS and one members from the Cartel (285) . Members are elected every four years (285) . 335 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Over 50% of GPs and 50% of other medical specialists in total reject the agreement (284,286) . Given the above two scenarios do not eventuate, fees agreed by the Minister will take effect 30 days after publication within the Belgium Official Journal (where laws, royal decrees, ordinances etc. are published) (286) . Physicians who sign up to the agreed fee level must charge these prices, and in return, receive benefits, such as a 'supplemental pension plan' (4, page 226) . Physicians also have the option of not signing up or parti ally signing up to the set fee level. Those who do not sign up to the agreement have the flexibility to set their own fees. Any difference in the fee set by the physician and that agreed by the Minister must be paid by the patient. In 2015, 11.4% of GPs an d 19.2% of specialists refused the set fee level (287) . Refusal by specialists is partic ularly high for those working within obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, and orthopaedics (286) . If, however, the two scenarios occur, one of the following three paths will be taken: a) publically imposed fees; b) a restart of negotiations; or c) fixed reimbursement tariffs (82). France Negotiati on process: outpatient care Since the introduction of social security in France, prices and volumes of healthcare services have been negotiated between independent physicians and insurance funds (288,289) . Prices for new and existing procedures is negotiated and agreed by physician unions' (of which there are three) and the National Union of Health Insu rance Funds (Union Nationale des Caisses d'Assurance Maladie) (UNCAM) (288,289) . The rates for healthcare services, that is, the tariff level, is defined within a Tarif de convention (tariff references) (288,289) .68 Nearly all healthcare professionals (99.2% in 2014) agree to the tari ff. Specifically, of the 116,126 physicians in independent practices, 912 are not part of the general contract (707 are GPs and 205 are specialists).69 Despite this, 50% and 8% of specialists and GPs have the right to bill more than the official tariff rate, respectively. The right to balance bill is a significant problem in France as it limits 68 Conventions exist for doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, transport, medical device suppliers and biological laboratories. 69 Information sourced from D. Polton (CNAMT) (2017). 336 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options access to healthcare for those on low incomes.70 Lastly, conven tions are typically discussed and agreed upon every four to five years, however, regular amendments occur throughout this period (288,289) . The relevant ministry of health has two key roles during negotiations. Firstly, the financial mandate for each profession is discussed and defined with the Ministry prior to the negotiations, as well as the prioritie s and objectives. For example, in 2012, the new Government asked the UNCAM to open a negotiation to f ind a solution to the issue of ' sector 2 ' (physicians having the right to bill more than the official tariff). Secondly, in the case where negotiations bre akdown, th e Government appoints a single arbiter ,71 as was the case with dentists in France recently , who has the legal right to deliver a contract to the relevant ministry of health, if an agreement can still not be reached. The role of the Ministry in negotiations has only been made explicit in legislation recently. Specifically, the recent law of the future of the healthcare system states that the Ministry issues guidelines prior to all negotiations. This arrangement has been seen by the medical professio n as a constraint on and limitation of their freedom to negotiate .72 As outlined by Chevreul et al . (2015) and Johnson et al . (2017), negotiations between providers and insurers is strained due to the high degree of power exercised by medical professional associations (288,289) . Negotiation process: inpatient care At the hospital level, it is the respon sibility of the Health Minister to set DRG rates, which determines the reimbursement rate paid by social health insurers. Most hospitals have an agreement with a social health insurer, however, for those that do not, patients are required to pay out -of-pocket for care, which is later reimbursed according to a specific statutory tariff (288) . Germany Negotiation process: outpatient care Reimbursement arrangements for private physicians in Germany are complex. Under the system, private physicians authorised to treat compulsory health insurance patients bill their regional association of social 70 Ibid. 71 In recent years, an arbiter from the Auditor Commission has been used. 72 Information sourced from D. Polton (CNAMT) (2017). 337 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options health insurance physicians (Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigungen (KV)) every quarter. KVs are then responsible for distributing pooled funds to physicia ns. For more details on KVs, see Table 69. At the national level, the 17 KVs are represented by the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung (KBV)) (290) . Table 69: Overview of Germany's regional association of social health insurance physicians Characteristic Description Number 17 KVs in total (one in each region, except for North Rhine -Westpahalia, which has two) Membership Compulsory Number of physicians covered Approximately 141,000 physicians Management Each KV is governed by an executive board, which consists of physicians serving on a voluntary, part - time basis Role Ensure those covered by statutory health insurance have access to a sufficient level of outpatient care. They also represent physician interests, and enter into general contract s with sickness funds regarding benefit packages and reimbursement. Source: (89,276) Services provided by social health insurance (SHI) physicians that will be reimbursed by sickness funds is outlined within a Uniform Value Scale (UVS) ( Einheitlicher Bewertungsma\u00dfstab ). The medical services within the UVS are each assigned a rating score, thus each SHI physic ians records the total number of his/her points each quarter and reports this to their regional KV for reimbursement (89,276) (further details of the UVS are provided in Figure 110). Responsibility for the Uniform Value Scale falls under the remit of the Valuation Committee (Bewertungsausschuss ), which is comprised of representatives from the KBV and the National Association 338 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options of the Germany Statutory Sickness Funds ( GKV -Spitzenverband ). General contract s made at the federal level act as a framework for discussions that occur at the regional level (291) . Figure 110: Germany's Uniform Value Scale Purpose Sets out the range of healthcare services reimbursable by sickness funds at the outpatient level. Specifically, each service that sickness funds will reimburse for is assigned a relative weight, which informs how much the physicians will get paid. Respons ibility Valuation committee which is made up of representatives from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and sickness fund federal associations. If a decision cannot be reached, the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH) can enforce extended Valuation Com mittee members be brought in to reach a decision. MOH can also define alternative arrangements if no resolution is reached. Coverage Social health insurance physicians can only invoice for services within the UVS. Volume control Each quarter social heal th insurance physicians are informed of how many UVS points they can be reimbursed for. Source: (292) To minimise the physician's incentive to over -supply services, since 2009, a limit on the volume of standard services has been applied. Specifically, at the beginning of each qu arter, physicians are informed of the maximum volume of services they will be reimbursed for (89). With the introduction of the Social Health Insurance Modernization Act (2004) ( GKV - Modernisierungsgesetz ), selective contracting has been permitted for models of integrated care. This allows individual health insurers to negotiate services and prices with individual or groups of healthcare providers (271) . The ability for sickness funds to contract directly with healthcare providers is meant to increase competition and thus improve healthcare quality and efficiency (89,276) . 339 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Negotiation process: inpatient care Capital in vestments are financed through the L\u00e4nder, while hospital running costs are financed primarily by sickness funds, but also through private health insurers and patient out -of-pocket payments. Running costs are negotiated between individual hospitals and reg ional sickness funds associations (276) . Legally, sickness funds negotiate contracts with hospitals, which they are allowed to reject. However the final decision is taken by st ate governments (277) . Netherlands The negotiation process between sickness funds and healthcare professionals has been broken down into the following segments: primary care and hospitals. Negotiation process: outpatient care (GPs) Up until 1998, GPs negotiated as a collective group regarding contractual arrangements on price, volume and service levels. The Dutch Competition Act in 1998 saw GPs come under intense scrutiny, which led to a ban on group negotiations. Later, in 2011, GPs were fined up to \u20ac7.7 million if they were found to be colluding. The fine was removed in 2015, and GPs were again allowed to cooperate when it is in the best interest of the patient (293) . That is, GPs can legally discuss with one another conditions of the contract, however, the y must sign individual contracts with health insurers, four of which control 90% of the market (294) . Health insurers contract independent GPs for core primary car e services on the government set capitation and fee -for-service rates (approximately 70% of services). Remaining services for integrated care (bundled payments) (20% of services) and innovative care models (10% of services) are negotiated between GPs and h ealth insurers (see Table 70 for further details). Table 70: Overview of primary care payment models (Netherlands) Segment Proportion of funding (approx.)

During negotiations regarding bundled payments for chronic conditions, GPs are generally represented by care groups, of which there are 40. Care groups are legal entities that, on behalf of the self -employed GPs, act as the contracting organisation between providers and insurers (297) . GPs are a central element of these care groups, with a median of 50 GPs in one care group (numbers vary between 4 -150 GPs) (297) . Negotiatio n process: inpatient care (including outpatient specialists) Prices and volumes of healthcare within this setting are negotiated between the nine independent insurers and the 110 hospitals (298) . In theory, insurers and/or hospitals can engage 341 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The amount paid to hospitals is determined, since 2005, by Diagnosis Treatment Combinations (DBCs), a concept similar to diagnostic -related groups (295) .73 Initially, only a small proportion (10%) of rates for hospital services were freely negotiable, however, this gradually increased to 70% in 2012 (298) . The remaining 30% of hospital service rates are set nationally, and are non -negotiable. Specifically, the Dutch Healthcare Authority sets a ceiling price (296) . Negotiations at the hospital level also determine outpatient spe cialist fees, who are reimbursed according to the same DBC system. To avoid hospitals setting unreasonable high prices for services that are negotiable, insurers can enter into selective contracts with hospitals (298) . Switzerland Collective contracts are negotiated between healthcare providers and healthcare insurance associations, of which there are three: Sant\u00e9suisse (largest of all the three) (represents approx. 50% of insurers) Curafutura (represents approx. 40% of insurers) Association of Small and Medium Insurers (RVK) (represents approx. 10% of insurers) (99). Contracts outline the tariff level for healthcare services, as well requirements regarding efficiency and quality. However, the latter are neither specific nor monitored (99). Contracts may either be national or set at the canton level; within the former, contracts become valid if approved by the Federal Council, while the latter can be approved by cantonal governments (99). An overview of the contracting arrangements in ambulatory care and hospitals is provided below: Negotiation process: outpatient care The tariff schedule for primary and specialised care in Switzerland is defin ed within TARMED, which is run by TARMED Suisse, a corporate institution. The reimbursement rate within TARMED is negotiated between the association of physicians and hospitals on the provider side, and by tarifsuisse SA or curafutura on the purchaser side . Tarifsuisse SA, was developed in 2010, and can be contracted by MHI 73 Statistical system that classifies an inpatient stay according to various factors (e.g. patient age and sex, presence of co -morbi dities, complications associated with the procedure). Cases with a DRG group are meant to economically and medically similar (299) . 342 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options companies to negotiate contracts with healthcare providers. As of 2015, tarifsuisse represented approximately 75% of al MHI companies. In the case where an agreement is not reached, the cantonal government can define the reimbursement rate (99). If an insurer does not wish to be part of a collective contract, it can choose to selectively contract with physician networks or health management organisations. Despite this, physicians within these contracts must follow the TARMED fee schedule (99). Negotiation process: inpatient care Similar to other developed countries, hospital reimbursement rates are defined within a DRG system, which acts as a national tariff framework. In Switzerland, DRG rates are specified within SwissDRG SA, a corporate institution. The rate for each DRG is neg otiated between hospitals (either at an individual or group level) and healthcare insurance associations. These rates must be approved by cantonal authorities, who in the case of no agreement, can fix the DRG base rate. Recommended DRG rates are provided b y the Price Supervisor, which sits within the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research. DRG rates agreed by cantons that are above the recommended rate must be justified (99). Austria Formally, it is the responsibility of the HVSV to negotiate all contracts between health insurance carrie rs and the Chamber of Physicians (\u00a7341 ASVG ). In practice, however, general contractual agreements (Gesamtvertrag) are negotiated and agreed between the respective Chamber of Physicians (regional or federal) and individual or groups of social insurance car riers , with the HVSV signing off on agreeme nts once they have been reached. In regard to groups of carriers, an example are the BKK and SVB who partner partner with regional insurance carriers (GKK s) to streamline administrative processes and increase barg aining power (\u00a72). Contractual negotiations include discussion and agreement on fee schedules , which include reimbursable services, as well as the number of contracted physicians per region (\u00a7342 ASVG). Posts are filled using criteria developed by the Chamber of Physicians, which are proposed to the Ministry of Health and Women's Affair (\u00a7343 (1a) ASVG). General contractual agreements are then used as the basis for individual contracts, which are signed between the physician and the social health insurance carrier. If an agreement between social health insurers and the Chamber of Physicians cannot be rea ched, the Federal Arbitration Committee can postpone the termination of the contract for up to three months. After this period, physicians have the power to charge their own prices ( vertragsloser Zustand ), which patients 343 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options must pay OOP for. If a patient visi ts a non -contracted doctor, social health insurers will generally only reimburse 80% of the cost charged by contracted doctors (it is only general as KFAs reimburse patients 100%, while other social insurers may fully reimburse for certain services) . By law (\u00a7338 (2) ASVG), insurance carriers are obliged to 'try hard' to conclude general contractual agreements, however, such agreements are not compulsory . As a result, the Chamber of Physi cians can exercise significant power during negotiations . Even after an agreement is signed, physicians can continue to exercise power by terminating a con tract, as long as three -months notice is given. Social health insurers, on the other hand, can only end a contract in the case of severe misconduct. Not all physicians choose to enter into contractual agreemen ts with social health insurers. Patients who choose to visit non -contracted doctors (i.e. Wahlarzt) pay OOP, and must apply for reimbursement from their social health insurer who will re -pay 80% of the cost charged by contracted doctors . On average, 63% of specialists working in practices, and 40% of GPs working in practices are not contracted with a social health insurance carrier. These fig ures appear significantly high given 99% of the population are covered by so cial health insurance. Figure 111: Non -contracted specialists as a % of all specialists working in a practice (all W S O\u00d6 B N\u00d6 Non-contracted specialists, % of all specialists in a practice Average across regions344 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 112: Non -contracted GPs as a % of all GPs working in a practice (all regions) Source: IHS (2017) As outlined in the figures above , non-contracted doctors make up a significant proportion of all doctors working within the primary and ambulatory care. This proportion may continue to rise with historica l data showing a downward trend in the total number of contracted doctors per 10,000 people (despite there being an increase in the number of contracted doctors for \u00a72 carriers between 2005 -15). This may be a result of several factors such as: increasing population, more doctors joining group practices and/or the large number of students studying medicine (prior to university restrictions).

Comparison with European countries As evidenced by the above country descriptions, complex arrangements for contractual negotiations exist across Europe. At a high -level, the contractual arrangements in Austria closely mirror t hose in France and Germany. Systems in the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland differ in certain key aspects. For example, in the Netherlands, the government (Dutch Healthcare Authority), limits the role of health insurers and providers by setting prices for core primary care services and 30% of DBCs. Further, at the outpatient level, GPs are legally forbidden from negotiating as a group, thus only selective contracts are permitted. In Belgium, the Minister of Social Affairs must agree to the price agreed between insurers and providers, 6,900 6,950 7,000 practitioners General specialists Other specialists 2005 2011 2015347 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options which can later be overturned if rejected by a certain proportion of physicians. Lastly, regarding inpatient care in Switzerland, DRG prices are initially provided by an external Price Supervisor, which plays a significant role in determining DRG rates agreed between insurers and hospitals. Arrangements within Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland may act to reduce the variability of contracts between health insurers and healthcare providers within respective countries. Policy options: Contractual agreements between physicians and social health insurers Based on a review of payment systems contractual arrangement s in Austria and Europe, a range of policy options have been developed (see Table 71). Each of the 12 policies proposed aim to achieve one or more of the following objectives: Promote harmonisation of services and prices across physicians Enhance primary and outpatient care in order to reduce the number of hospital admissions Encourage coordination of care Promote financial sustainability within the healthcare system Create a level playing field during contractual negotiations between social health insurers and physicians. Each policy option has been categorised by an implementation period, that is, short, medium or long term, which reflects its pri ority. Specifically, policies classified as being implemented in the short -term indicate that the policy is of high importance and should take precedence over medium and long -term policies. 348 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 71: Contracting policy options over view Policy option theme Policy option description Implementation period Contractual negotiations Introduce external arbiter to assist in contractual negotiations Short -term Allow health insurance carriers to contract selectively for certain services Structural plans Introduce an independent committee to provide advice on number and location of contracted physician posts Short -term Harmonisation amongst outpatient specialists Harmonise coding among specialists to improve transparency Short -term Enhancement of primary and outpatient care Continued investment in multi -professional practices Short -term Better training for GPs within the system Improved system coordination via ELGA Further investment in Disease Management Programs Bundled payments Introduced bundled payments for multi -morbid patients across the healthcare spectrum via joint SSI and L \u00e4nder budgets Medium -term Rural GPs Incentivise GP specialisation and networks in rural areas via a change in the payment scheme (i.e. risk -adjusted capitation and FFS) Medium -term GP remuneration (all GPs) Extend risk -adjusted capitation and FFS to all GPs across Austria Long -term Enhance role of GPs Introduce voluntary scheme to incentivise patients to have referrals from a GP to access certain outpatient specialists and inpatient care . Long -term 349 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Short -term policy options Contractual negotiations To create a more level playing field between social health insurance carriers and the Chamber of Physicians during contractual negotiations, the following two mutually exclusive options are proposed. The first option would allow the Federal Arbitration Co mmittee to postpone the termination of contracts from three to six months (where during this period the current contract would remain in place). If after six months, an agreement cannot be reached, an external arbiter would be introduced to facilitate discussions. Given the Chamber of Physicians and social health insurers are still unable to conclude contract negotiations, the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, based directly on the recommendations of the arbiter, would have the possibility to determin e the final contractual agreement. Regarding the arbiter, initially, social health insurance and the Chamber o f Physicians should be given the option to mutually appoint an arbiter. If this is not possible, the arbiter c ould be set by the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs. The second option would allow social health insurers to contract selectively with physicians for certain items within contractual agreements, that is, items that cannot be agreed upon in the gene ral contract. For example, social health insurance could be given the option to selectively contract physicians to fill vacancies. Such an arrangement exists for primary healthcare units, however, the Chamber of Physicians must be in favour. Introducing s elective contracting for general contract s is unlikely to be successful given physicians have the option to work as non -contracted physicians, with patients submitting invoices to social health insurers. Legal considerations Even though no particular co nstitutional impediments have to be faced with respect to both options, a number of amendments to the current system of conctractual agreements would be required. Structural plans Going forward, regional structural plans for health (Regionaler Strukturplan Gesundheit) will define the number of ambulatory physician units (\u00c4AVE) for each specialty within a region (both for contracted outpatient specialists and for those working in hospital outpatient departments). Given, soc ial health insurers must then reach an agreement with the Chamber of Physicians (who are not involved in regional structural plan discussions) to either increase or decrease these numbers (former being easier to achieve, 350 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options given it is near impossible for soc ial health insurers to terminate contracts ), the impact regional structural plans will have on ensuring contracted physicians posts are needs -based is unclear. If regional structural plans fail to achieve their desired objective, an independ ent committee could be established to provide recommendations on the number and location of GP and specialist physicians. Recommendations would form the basis of contractual negotiations between social health insurers and the Chamber of Physicians, with any deviation from recommendations being justified to the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs. All new posts would be subject to findings from the independent committee, however, changes to existing posts should be phased in over a period of time (e.g. 10 years). Lega l considerations Even though no particular constitutional impediments have to be faced with respect to this option, some amendments to the current system of conctractual agreements would be required. Harmonisation among outpatient specialists Contracts between social health insurance and the Chamber of Physicians set out services and associated fee schedules. As discussed in section 5.2, services a cross social health insurers are not harmonised, further, the naming of services/items also differs. In regard to the latter issue, different naming of services/items makes it extremely difficult to compare prices across insurers. For this reason , it is proposed that coding of services/items within contracts be made consistent across insurers, thus improving price transparency. Legal considerations No particular legal impediments have to be faced in this respect. Enhancement of primary and outpa tient care It has been suggested that if a proportion of hospital admissions is reduced, immediate cost savings w ill be realised. Specifically, a recent report on efficiency potentials with in the Austrian social insurance system (2016) quoted the Austrian Court of Auditors (Rechnungshof) , which stated that shifting resources from the inpatient to outpatient sector (i.e. so that the number of acute beds equates to the European average) can lead to savings of \u20ac2.9 billion (300) . However, in order to maintain high -quality care, whilst simultaneously reducing hospital admissions, significant investment in outpatient and primary care is required in the first instance. Therefore, in the short -term, costs may increase as hospitals will need to be subsidised for structural fixed costs, such as employee salaries and maintenance of buildings. 351 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Austria has recently implemented reforms at both the outpatient and primary care level to reduce the relatively hi gh bu rden placed on hospitals . At the outpatient level, Austria has recently extended DRGs to hospital outpatient departments to limit the number of unnecessary inpatient admissions (301) . At the primary care level, two primary healthcare units have been implemented, with plans to extend the number to 75 by year 2020 (see Figure 116). Further, since 2010, physicians have been given the right to develop group practices as limite d liability companies, which is associated with small tax advantages ( Act to Strengthen Ambulatory Care ) (302) . Figure 116: 15a Agreement, Article 31 (Primary Healthcare Units) Financing of cross -sector projects The contracting parties agree to allocate financial resources, in accordance with the following contract provisions for financing cross -sectional projects. The projects are aimed at strengthening the provision of ambulatory care, in particular the establishment of primary care, which is primarily the responsibility of t he social insurance system, as well as the establishment of multi -professional and/or interdisciplinary provision of care in the outpatient specialist care. A total of \u20ac200 million will be earmarked for these purposes for the duration of this agreement by 2020. The projects are carried out in accordance with the project -related planning decisions in the RSG and should contribute to the improvement of care and to the relief of hospitals. The aim is to realise at least 75 primary care units in primary care by the end of the terms of this agreement. As outlined above, promising reforms have been introduced to enhance primary and outpatient care, however, further effort is required to ensure the sustainability of the healthcare sector. A range of potential opt ions to reduce the burden on hospitals have been outlined below. These options are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and could be implemented in unison. Primary healthcare units and group practices : A total \u20ac200 million has been dedicated to the development of 75 PHUs by 2020. At this stage, it is unclear how these funds will be sourced , further, it has not been made explicit how and when those who invest and develop PHUs will be refunded for their efforts. Such an arrang ement fosters uncertainty and reduces the incentive to invest in PHUs. A similar problem occurred under the Reform Pool of 2005, which outlined a commitment to funding to 352 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options improve extra - and intra -mural care, without defi ning specific funds for projects (303) .74 For this reason, it is recommended that it be made explicit where the \u20ac200 million is collected, and how it will be distributed to carriers. Outpatient hospital departments: Extend the number of DRGs applicable within hospital outpatient departments, so that an increasing number of procedures take place outsid e inpatient c are. System coordination: The ELGA system to coordinate patient care is a relatively nascent initiative within Austria's healthcare system. However, further changes to the system are required to maximise its potential. For example, by collating patient r ecords in an easy to interpret format for physicians accessing a patient's file for the first time. Disease Management Programs: At present, there exists just one national disease management program, the program for diabetics (Therapie Aktiv , 15a agreemen t 2008 -13). In response to the rising num ber of multi -morbid patients, further investment in DMPs is recommended (e.g. for cancers, obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary disease, and asthma).75 Given DMPs offer patients 'state of the art' treatment, it is advised that all physicians be required to offer such services. GP training: Postgraduate training for GPs primarily takes place in hospitals , with an additional six months required within a GP practice ( \u00c4rzteausbildungsordnung, \u00c4AO 2015 ). Although posit ive that young physicians (i.e. recently graduated) spend a portion of their training within a GP practice, six months is a relatively short amount of time when compared to countries such as the UK (18 months in a practice) and Australia (3 to 4 years, dep ending on rurality) (306 -308) .76 A barrier to increasing physician time within a GP practice may arise from dual financing arrangements, given social health insurance is not provided with additional funds to cater to trainees. Therefore, we recommend that a portion of L \u00e4nder funds be distributed to social health insuranc e to pay specifically for GP training. Enhanced GP training will improve primary care services, and therefore, in the medium - to long -term reduce hospitalisations and thus costs to the L \u00e4nder. Given benefits may take a certain number of years to ensue, in the short -term, additional funds should be provided to the L \u00e4nder to cover fixed costs. 74 For inpatient and outpatient sector, 1% (2006) and 2% (2007 -08) of total funding for be dedicated to pr ograms facilitated coordination between the two sectors (304) . 75 Themes based on Germany's Disease Management Programs (305) . 76 Three years to complete a Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (an option for an additional year to advance rural skills), or four years to complete a Fellowship of the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine. 353 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options GPs in outpatient care: One full -time GP could be introduced into hospital outpatient departments to triage patient admissions. This approach has been implemented in various settings including in Deventer, a region with the Netherlands, where GPs operate hospital outpatient departments. Such efforts have already been made within Viennese hospitals. Legal considerations Even though no particular constitutional impedim ents have to be faced in this respect, a comprehensive legal assessment of consequences and issues arising from the recent reform is not possible at this stage. Medium -term policy options Bundled payments Multi-morbid patients consume a disproportiona te amount of healthcare services. For example , in Austria , just under half (44.9%) of those with three or more chronic conditions access inpatient care compared to 13.6% of those with no chronic conditions (Figure 117). Similar patterns emerge at the outpatient level, where 95.9% of multi -morbid patients (i.e. three or more) see a doctor as opposed to 82.2% of healthy patients (i.e. t hose with no chronic conditions). Figure 117: Probability of accessing inpatient care by number of chronic conditions in Austria (waves 1,2,4 and 5) Source: SHARE data (Survey for health, ageing and retirement in Europe), analysis by LSE 13.6%23.4%33.2%44.9%86.4%76.6%66.8%55.1% 0.0%20.0%40.0%60.0%80.0%100.0% 0 1 2 3+ Number of chronic conditions Yes No354 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 118: Prevalence of access to doctors associated with number of chronic conditions (waves 1,2,4 and 5) Source: SHARE data (Survey for health, ageing and retirement in Europe), analysis by LSE To improve care, and reduce overall co sts, risk -adjusted bundled payments for high -cost multi -morbid patients is recommended. Specifically, to encourage continuity of care and avoid patients 'wandering' through the healthcare system, joint budgets between social health insurance and the Lands would be created to cover costs across the spectrum of care (i.e. primary care, ambulatory care, hospital care and social care). Prior to the implementation of bundled payments, a study should be commissioned to gain a better understanding of the types of multi -morbid patients in Austria (e.g. the proportion of multi -morbid patients: nearing death; with persistent chronic conditions; and short -term high need patients). Legal considerations Basically no constitutional impediments have to be faced in this respect. Anyhow multi -morbidity could be definitely an important risk -adjusment -factor and care for multi -morbid patients could be target for a specific fund such as the already existing ones for prevention or dental Yes No355 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Rural and remote GP remuneration Small popula tions in rural areas limits coverage of specialised healthcare services. To ensure insured patients in these areas receive adequate and appropriate care, it is advised that networks of specialised GPs be encouraged (e.g. specialisation in diabetes, arthritis, heart disease and other areas of care relevant to rural populations). For geographical reasons, these GPs do not need to be located within the one practice, rather, GP networks c ould develop robust internal referral systems. Rural GP networks could be encouraged through changes to the current remuneration system outlined within contractual agreements. Specifically, by introducing risk -adjusted c apitation payments, with elements of flat rate payments. The capitation component may incentivise physicians to move to rural areas as they will be guaranteed a certain income, thus reducing financial uncertainty. Rates for capitated budgets should take in to account that , relative to urban posts, working in rural/remote areas is less desirable , involves treating more complex cases , and requires greater responsibility. Consideration could also be given to applying different rates depending on rurality, with, for example, higher capitated budgets being allocated to physicians working in poorer and/or less densely populated areas. Flat rate payments could also be introduced to complement capitated budgets, and be linked to actions/services that promote overal l improvements in care quality. For example, a once off payment for establishing a specialised GP network, in addition to bonus payments for networks which continually promote coordinated care (e.g. draw upon the French payment system, which provides physi cians with additional payments related to time spent coordinating care, as well as the mix of health care professionals within a network, see section 6.2.2 ). Legal considerations No particular constitutional impediments have to be faced in this respect, but some amendments to the current system of conctractual agreements would be required. Long -term policy options GP remuneration A change to a fully risk-adjusted capitated payment system represents a significant cultural and organisational change as it would require patients to register up with one physician. Therefore, risk - adjusted capitation should be trialed within rural and remote areas, wh ere natural registration occurs (i.e. due to the limited number of physicians within a certain location). Given risk -adjusted capitation in rural 356 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options and remote areas achieves its stated objectives, consideration should be given to extending this form of payme nt to GPs working within urban settings. Similar to rural/remote GPs, additional flat rate incentive payments could be offered to encourage better value -care, such as participation in preventative care (e.g. smoking cessation programs), or minor surgeries to reduce the number of inpatient admissions. To 'ease in' the introduction of risk -adjusted capitation, insurees could have the option of registering with either a GP or specialist (as is the case in France, where 99% of insurees choose a GP). Legal con siderations Even though no particular constitutional impediments have to be faced in this respect, it has to be considered that 'registering' with a certain physician would impose restriction to the patients' right to choose which physician(s) they visit. Enhanced role of GPs Discussions with relevant stakeholders highlighted the value placed on freedom of choice within the healthca re sector. However, in the long -term , consideration c ould be given to enhancing the role of GPs within contracts by assig ning them responsibility for referring patients onto outpatient specialists or inpatient care. Such a move should be voluntary, further insurees could be given the option to register with a specialist, as opposed to a GP (as is the case in France, howeve r, 99% individuals choose a GP). Enhancing the role of GPs would follow international trends including countries such as France and Denmark (see Figure 119). It is important to highlight that models outlined in the figure below, although considered best practice, are not directly applicable to the Austrian context given low levels of user charges (thus financial incentives to encourage insurees to access their chosen GP or specialist are limited). For this reason, other policies such as appropriate marketing and advertising are required. Figure 119: The role GPs in France and Denmark France The 2005 health financing reform law aimed to encourage coordinate treatment pathways by requiring patients to register with a preferred physician of their choice (GP or specialist).* Patients who access specialists** with a referral from their preferred p hysician pay a lower co -insurance (user charge) rate, compared to patients who access specialists directly (i.e. 30% vs 70%). 357 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Denmark Denmark has introduced a novel initiative to improve the appropriateness of care provided by giving patients the followi ng two options. Under option one, which 98% of the population opt for, a referral from a GP is required if a patient wishes to seek secondary care. Registration with a GP is necessary in this circumstance. For the second option, individuals have the freedo m to choose their GP as well as uninterrupted access to specialists. However, copayments are required for both GPs and specialists. In either options 1 or 2, patients must obtain a referral before accessing hospital care (with the exception of emergencies) . Source: (309 -312) Note: *The scheme is in fact not compulsory, however, the vast majority of population believe it is (i.e. 82%). **With the exception of certain low -cost specialists such as gynecologists and ophthalmologists, which patients can continue to visit directly. This policy option should only be introduced once appropriate structure s and processes have been developed within the primary care sector. For example, further education and training would be required to increase the capacity of GPs to properly triage patients to outpatient specialists or inpatient care. Further, the number of GPs would also need to increase to cope with greater levels of demand. Finally, enhancing the role of GPs to triage patient cases will be mitigated if patients choose to access primary healthcare units, given referrals to specialists will naturally occur. Therefore, as stated throughout this repor t, further effort should be directed at increasing the number of PHUs and encouraging patients to use these units as their first 'point of call'. Legal considerations No particular legal impediments have to be faced in this respect. Summary of policy options for contracts between physicians and social health insurers Decisions made within contractual negotiations have a significant impact on structures, processes and outcomes within outpatient healthcare settings. For example, they p lay a role in determining remuneration for physicians, and what and how services are delivered. 358 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Based on a review of contractual negotiation arrangements in Austria and across Europe, 12 associated policy options have been developed. Each policy option has been categorised into three sub -groups to reflect their relative importance. In the short -run, it is recommended that efforts are made to : enhance the power of social health insurers during contractual negotiation s; introduce robust needs -based criter ia for positioning contracted doctors ; harmonise services across contracted physicians ; and finally , to foster an environment which enhances the role of primary and outpatient care. Once short -term policies have been implemented, policy -makers could consi der changes to remuneration packages to: a) improve care coordination for multi -morbid patients by introducing bundled payments across outpatient, i npatient and social care; and b) improve access to care in rural and remote areas through risk -adjusted capi tated payments, which reflect relative difficulties associated with working in such environments (e.g. more complex cases, less support). Finally, in the long -term, risk -adjusted capitated payments could be extended to GPs in urban settings, in addition to flat -rate payments to encourage utilisation of high -value care. Concurrently, the role of GPs could be enhanced by requiring patients to obtain a referral before seeking specialist care. Healthcare quality Measuring health system performa nce Rising demand for healthcare services, constrained resources and variations in healthcare provision have led to an increased interest from governments to measure and monitor healthcare quality. As a result, an increasing number of countries have imple mented performance measurement and quality improvement tools (313) . Performance measur ement within the healthcare sector aims to 'monitor, evaluate and communicate' the extent to which health care systems meet pre -defined objectives (314) . Performance is often measured through the development and implementation of targets that provide a robust picture of the healthcare system of interest (314) . Targets are considered a desirable tool for both policy makers and the population, as they express a clear commitment to a specific goal within a set timeframe (314) . Modern economies are increasingly concerned with measuring the quality of healthcare provided. The growth in quality and performance measurement can be traced bac k to the World Health Organis ation's 359 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options (WHO) 1981 report - Health For Al l, which specified that targets are a useful tool to improve health outcomes (314). Other factors that have contributed to the rise in the use of performance measurements include demand side changes such as, cost -containment, increasing patient expectations and demand for accountability, as well as improvements in technology, whic h have made collecting information more effective and efficient (314) . Defining healthcare quality To measure the quality of healthcare, a robust definition of what constitutes 'quality in healthcare' is required. To date, several definitions of quality in healthcare have been developed, which differ across the lens in which t he healthcare system is viewed (313,315,316) . The most common definition comes from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (US) whi ch describes the term as 'the degree to which healthcare services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge' (199) . Thi s is a high -level definition of healthcare quality, for this reason, researchers have broken down the concept down into domains. The OECD defined 10 dimensions of healthcare quality within their 'Health Care Quality Indicators Project', of most importance (or the most commonly cited dimensions) are those that overlap with IOM's dimensions, which are outlined in Table 72 below (3). Table 72: Healthcare quality domains Dimension Definition Effectiveness Providing care processes and achieving outcomes which are supported by scientific evidence . Efficiency Maximising a unit of health delivered (or health benefit) for a given unit of healthcare resource used (i.e. getting the most output with a given level of input) . Equity Providing healthcare of equal quality to individuals regardless of personal characteristics (other than preferences f or care or clinical conditions). 360 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Dimension Definition Patient centeredness Meeting the needs and preferences of patients and providing education and support. Safety Patient bo dily harm (actual of potential). Timeliness Accessing care in a timely manner with minimal delays . Source: (317) Note: A dditional indicators stated by OECD are acceptability, accessibility, capacity, appropriateness, capability, continuity, and sustainability (318) . Measuring healthcare quality Upon defining healthcare quality, a robust conceptual framework in which to measure healthcare performance is required. Such a framework ensures that all relevant areas of health system performance are measured, that healthcare priorities are identified, and l astly, that collection and analysis of data is neither misdirected nor duplicated (314) . Typically, healthcare performance is measured using indicators, which as outlined by Campbell et al . (2002), are explicitly defined, measurable items that allow policy -makers to assess the provision of healthcare (319) . Historically, the literature and empirical evidence on quality indicators have focused on hospital care, however are today increasingly expanding into primary care services (319) . Indicator typologies In his seminal 1996 paper, Donabedian developed a framework for measuring the quality of healthcare by grouping indicators into the following categories - structure, process and outcome (320) . Structure measures refer to the resources needed to provide care and relate to healthcare settings, such as personnel, equipment, or facilities (321) . Process measures focus on how consistently or comprehensively healthcare providers follow a set of procedures or guidelines that outline best practice. Further, they focus o n how care is delivered; however, they must be associated with health system outcomes (e.g. appropriate prescribing). This reinforces the idea that a provider has followed 'best practice', which may increase positive health outcomes. Lastly, outcome measu res attempt to correlate medical care to optimum patient health status. Outcome measures monitor the effect of treatment and 361 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options can review patient experience in addition to physical health (321) . Outcomes can be challenging to measure as numerous factors determine patient health status and are often out of the provider or health system's control. Typically, outcome measures are used within secondary care (i.e. inpatient care) given indicators are more readily available in this area (e.g. 30 -day mortality) (321) . Outcome measures are less common within outpatient care (e.g. GP practices) (322) . Despite there being a separate category for outcome measures, high quali ty care can only be achieved with appropriate structures and processes. Risks and benefits of indicators Using indicators to measure and monitor health system performance can lead to a range of benefits. However, caution should be taken when designing r elevant structure, process and outcome indicators, given there are a number of associated risks which may result in adverse health outcomes. The risks and benefits of using indicators to measure performance are outlined in the table below. Table 73: Risks and benefits associated with measuring health system performance Risks Benefits May encourage fragmented rather than a holistic approach to care May not cover al l aspects relevant to measuring healthcare quality May require dat a that is not readily available or is of low quality May lead to provider backlash, if not developed in collaboration with the medical community May not be cost -effective if designed poorly Can lead to 'cream skimming' (choosing healthier patients) or c ost-shifting Can encourage a culture of blame and erode a provider's internal motivation Can distract providers from providing optimal care Documents the quality of healthcare provision Compares the performance of healthcare providers offering the same service/product (i.e. benchmarking) Measures the performance of healthcare providers over time and thus establish trends (particularly relevant when evaluating the impact of a new policy) Identifies areas of priority within the healthcare system, which assists in allocating resources appropriately Holds healthcare providers accountable for their performance, which if made publically available, can assist the patient's choice of provider . 362 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Risks Benefits Can incorrectly attribute health outcomes to providers Can encourage data manipulation Indicators cannot cover all important aspects of healthcare quality and thus cover only a minority of clinical activity. Source: (323 -325) Best practice in designing indicators A number of authors have developed best practice principles to guide policy -makers in developing healthcare indicators that minimise the risks outlined (see table below) (314,319,326) . For th e purpose of this paper, a summary of characteristics of good performance indicators has been drawn from Campbell et al . (2002), given these principles are based on primary care, which is the focus of this review (319) . Campbell et al . (2002) outlined seven characteristics that define a good healthcare performance indicator, namely: content validity, reproducibility, acceptability, feasibility, reliability, sensitivity, and predictive validity (see table below) (314,319) . Despite these characteristics, the authors recognise that producing an 'error free' measure of quality may not be possible, however, to the extent possible, these characteristics should be adhered to (319) . Table 74: Indicator characteristics Indicator characteristic Description Content validity The indicator should accurately represent what it is trying to measure/assess. Acceptability Indicators should be accepted by both those who are being assessed as well as those who undertaken the assessment (e.g. indicators should be developed in colla boration with the medical community and patients). 363 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Indicator characteristic Description Feasibility Indicators should be valid, reliable and be measured using consistent and available data. Reliability Results from indicators should be associated with minimal measurement error, further, they should be easily reproducible across providers. Sensitivity The indicator should be able to detect changes in the quality of healthcare. Predictive validity The indicator should be able to detect quality of care outcomes. Reproducibility The indicator should yield the same result if the method was applied repeatedly. Source: (319) Uses of performance measurement Once data on performance measurement has been collected, the next consideration is what to do with the available data. The two most widely advocated strategies to promote high -quality are reporting of performance and pay -for-performance. The former aims to stimulate interest in quality among healthcare providers, while the latter incentivises quality improvement by financially rewarding/penalising providers (327) . Reporting Public reporting Public reporti ng has two key objectives. First, to stimulate quality improvement by assisting patients in choosing top performing providers and identifying providers that are underperforming. And second, to increase transparency and hold individual healthcare providers, hospitals, or physician practices accountable (328) . 364 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Public reporting can focus on reviewing healthcare practices or indiv idual physicians. Research has shown that hospital level public reporting increases quality improvement activities (314) . According to Shekelle and colleagues, hospitals were more likely to implement quality measures after the release of performance data (2009). However, the positive impacts are relatively small (329) . There is minimal evidence of the impact reporting has on quality at the primary care level. Reviews of individual providers can be posted publicly. Provider performance can also be relatively ranked in comparison to their peers. This may inspire compe tition and lead to positive results, but may create conflict in the workplace. Additionally, articles speculate that public reporting may lead to adverse consequences, such as provider reluctance to operate on high risk patients or distort clinical prior ities (329 -333) . Professional improvement reporting Reporting can also take p lace at the healthcare provider or individual physician level as a means to improve service provision. This type of reporting allows healthcare providers to compare their performance against peers, at either the regional, national or international level. The debate on whether provider level performance should be made public or not is widely contested. However, literature on the topic reveals that performance measurement schemes should be 'designed and owned' by health professionals who in fact use the syst em (314) . Reporting targeted at professional improvement is primarily within the form of quality registers, where data is collected on behalf of providers who share results to a register. Such systems are popular within Scandinavian countries, such as Sweden and Norway (314) . Impact of reporting Various studies evaluating the impact reporting schemes have on h ealthcare quality have been undertaken. Similar to P4P, consensus on the impact of reporting on healthcare quality has not been reached with studies finding both positive, neutral and negative effects (334,335) . Proponents of public reporting highlight the impact it has on physician motivation, however, there is limited evidence to suggest that physician motivation and thus patient outcomes improve (335) . Critics, on the other hand , point to the range of negative side effects that can occur from reporting, specifically: Limited accuracy and reliability of information High costs associated with collecting and analysing qualit y data 365 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Gaming among physicians, for example by refusing to care for chronically ill patients Misinterpretation of data among patients (334) . International case studies: Reporting Examples of he althcare reporting in Sweden and Canada have been outlined below. Both systems have been recognised by the OECD as 'best practice' given the depth of data and availability. Sweden The National Board of Health and Welfare (hereafter, the National Board) i s a government agency within Sweden's Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (336) . The role of the National Board is to monitor and evaluate Sweden's healthcare and social services. As part of this role, the National board dev elops healthcare quality indicators as a way to measure the performance of care being delivered (336) . Data for each of these indicators is summarised within National Quality Registers (NQRs), which are initiated and led by he althcare professionals (337) . Sweden's NQRs include a range of information such as: Patient demographics Provider organisation characteristics Structure of care Process of care (including patient -reported experience measures (PREMS)) Outcomes of care (including patient -reported outcomes measures PROMS)) (337) .77 As of 2016, there were 96 NQRs covering 15 disease groups, which have been outlined in Table 75 below (338) . Certain indicators receive 'national status' and are therefore made publically available online (today, results from over 800 indicators ar e made publically available) (339) . Depending on the quality of data collected, results for each indicator may be published at the regional, county -city or healthcare provider unit level. For example, each year the National Board, in collaboration with the SALAR (Swedish Association of L ocal Authorities and Regions), releases a 'Quality and Efficiency in Swedish Health Care - Regional Comparisons' report, which publishes results from a range of indicators across Sweden's 21 counties (339) . The Regional Comparison reports do not analyse why differences across counties occur or provide specific policy recommendations; this is seen a s the responsibility policy makers at the regional level (339) . 77 The str ucture, process and outcome indicators cover both inpatient and specialist outpatient care. 366 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options There are three goals associated with publishing comparative healthcare data across counties: 1) to make publically financed healthcare systems more transparent and accountable; 2) to advance healthcare management and control by identifying satisfactory and unsatisfactory outcomes, which serve as the basis for implementing change (i.e. identifying areas of need and best practice); and, 3) to promote quality and availability of data relating to healthcare performance outcomes (i.e. encourages the collecti on of up -to- date, nationwide, robust data) (340) . A unique feature of Sweden's NQRs is the use of unique patient identifiers, which are based on individual social security numbers. By including a patient identifier, data from different quality registers can be linked, which provides a more robust picture of the type of care a patient receives (339,340) . Lastly, despite being an asset for Sweden's healthcare system, NQRs, in their current form, have certain limitations. Firstly, indicators within the NQRs are focused on hospi tal care and thus do not adequately cover primary or social care. Secondly, indicators do not capture the quality of on -going care, given indicators are clinically focused with well -defined beginning and end points. And thirdly, heterogeneity among data c ollection processes is inefficient, however, work is being undertaken to create a streamlined, automated approach data collection (340) . Table 75: NQR disease groups in Sweden Disease groups within Sweden's NQRs Cancer Dental care Emergen cy, anaesthesia and intensive care Eyes Lung diseases Psychiatry Paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology Other areas Circulatory Elderly palliative care Endocrine organs Infection Musculoskeletal system Nervous system Stomach and intestines Source: (338) In-depth analyses of certain disease groups are published online within 'National Performance Assessments'. For example, recent National Assessmen t reports have covered diabetes (2014), musculoskeletal disease (2014) and stroke (2011). Typically, National Assessments cover 20 -60 national -367 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options guideline specific indicators relevant to the disease group under assessment (339) . Results from the indicators are reported at the national, regional, county -council and healthcare unit level, and are also disaggregated by age, gender and socio -economic status. Unlike Regional Comparison reports, the National Board provides recommendations on where policy -makers can make improveme nts based on findings from the data (339) . In addition to Regi onal Comparison and National Assessment reports, each NQR publish annual reports within their specific field, as do a number of patient organisations and foundations (339) . Canada The OECD have recognised Canada as an example of best practice example in terms of publically reporting on healthcare performance (341) . Specifically, the OECD reference The Canadia n Institute of Health Information's (an independent, not -for-profit cooperation focused on disseminating quality health information) Your Health System initiative as a model of healthcare reporting to be followed (341) . The online website, which is available to all, can be broken down into two key segments: 'In Brief' and 'In Depth'. The former, classified indicators as relating to either 'access', 'quality of care', 'spending', 'health promotion and 'health outcomes' (see Table 76) (342) . These groups were used as they were assessed as being of most importance to Canadians. Data on each of the above indicators are reported at the national, and province and territory level. Results at the province and territory level are recorded as performing above, same or below average, which is benchmarked against the national average. Tre nds within and across regions is also available (342) . The In Depth section covers 37 nuanced indicators covering safety, health status, social determinants, person centeredness, appropriateness and effectiveness, and efficiency. The section also includes details on health service resourcing and activity. Performance against these indicators can be benchmarked at the province, territory, region, city of hospital level (341) . The online platform78 is designed for the 'lay' viewer and is thus interactive and user -friendly. 78 See: https://yourhealthsystem.cihi.ca/hsp/inbrief?lang=en 368 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 76: CIHI's In Brief indicators Indicator classification Types of indicators Access Access to a regular doctor Specialist waiting times Radiation treatment waiting times Joint replacement waiting times Quality of care Readmission rates to hospitals Hospital deaths Repeat hospital stays Inappropriate use of antipsychotics in long - term care Spending Age-adjusted public spending per person Cost of a standard hospital stay Health promotion and disease prevention Obesity rates Smoking rates Health outcomes Life expectancy at birth Avoidable deaths Children vulnerable in areas of early development Source: (342) Pay-for-performance Despite strong intrinsic motivation, clinicians, like other professionals, respond to financial incentives. This is evident from the rise in pay -for-performance (P4P), which is being increasingly used in conjunction with other forms of payment, such as cap itation and fee -for-service. The academic and grey literature have provided numerous definitions of P4P (269,343) . Partel (2014) describes P4P as using 'financial incentives, and sometimes disincentives, to encourage health services to behave in certain ways when undertaking certain ac tivities, such as clinical care and resources used' (344) . In simpler terms, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (US) defines P4P as 'paying more for good performance on quality measures' (345) . Despite various definitions, at a basic -level P4P 369 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options represents payments to healthcare providers that are contingent on performance, which is defined through a set of pre -defined quality measures. Advantages and disadvantages of P4P P4P models were introduced as a tool to overcome the shortcomings associated with traditional payment methods such as fee -for-service and capitation. Empirical evidence supporting the impact of P4P on the delivery of quality healthcare is available, howev er, in developed countries it is minimal. For example, studies which find a positive association between quality/health outcomes and P4P note that improvements are modest and may be misleading given poor methodological evaluation design. For example, Eijke naar et al. (2012) undertook a systematic review of systematic reviews regarding the effectiveness of P4P programs and found that, in general, improvements in performance were modest (272) . Further, Scott et al . (2011) in their summary of primary care P4P programs noted only one of the various indicators within each program had a statistically significant positive impact, meaning that the authors co uld not say with confidence that P4P had an impact on the remaining indicators (346) . Further advantages and disadvantages of P4P schemes is provided in Table 77. Table 77: Advantages and disadvantages of P4P Impact Advantage/disadvantage Explanation Quality of care and health outcomes Advantage A number of studies in recent years have shown statistically significant improvements in healthcare quality and patient outcomes as a result of P4P . Spillover effects Advantage Positive impacts on non - incentivized healthcare measures .

Note: (319,347 -352) to the inpatient sector, P4P programs at the primary/outpatient level are limited.

Social health insurer United Kingdom In 2004, the UK Government introduced the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) to reward GP practices for providing high -quality care. Although the QoF is voluntary, nearly all UK practices (99%) participate in the program (353) . 372 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The QoF is comprised of 81 indicators each attached to on e of three health domains (areas of interest), namely, clinical, public health, and public health (additional services). Within each of these domains are a range of clinical areas. QoF indicators are focused on improving quality of care via: Process measures (e.g. the percentage of patients with cancer diagnosed within the preceding 15 months, who have a patient review recorded as occurring within six months of the contractor receiving confirmation of diagnosis) Clinical outcomes (e.g. the pe rcentage of patients with coronary heart disease in whom the last blood pressure reading is 150/90 mmHG less) (354) . GP practices are provided with financial rewards depending o n the number of points they obtain. Points are rewarded based on a GP's adherence with an indicator. As of 2014 -15, each GP practice could achieve up to 559 points, with a higher score translating into a greater financial reward (355) . As of 2014 -15, one point equated to \u00a3160.15,79 with the final payment being adjusted for surgery workload, local demographics, and prevalence of chronic conditions in the local area (NHS Employers, 2016) . In 2014 -15, the average score for a GP practice was 529.6, with obesity and epilepsy clinical areas performing the best (356) . Further details can be found in the table below .

Note: aEach of the indicators fits within one of the clinical areas. As a proportion of total income, QoF provides GPs with a high level of additional income relative to other incentive schemes. For example, in 2005 -06 the average additional income awarded to GP practices from QoF was \u00a3126,000, which when split across GPs, comprises approximately 20% of total GP income. Similar proportions continue to exist today (353) . A systematic review of the literature regarding the impact of the QoF has recently been undertaken80 by Mandavia et al. (2017) . Of the 21 articles used as part of the study, seven found a positive effect, 13 found intermediate effects and one had no effect. Australia The Australian Government introduced financial incentives into primary care in 1996 under the Better Practice Program. In 1998, the program was superseded by the Practice Incentives Program (PIP). As of 2011, Medicare data found that 68% of GPs in Australia were registered for the PIP, however, this does not mean that all those who are registered receive payments. For example, the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL ) survey found that in 2010 -11 only 43% of GPs received an incentive payment. This represents a decrease from approx imately 47% in 2008 -09 (357) . Financial incentives are bas ed on GP practices adherence to a range of indicators within the 11 clinical areas of interest. The payments are made quarterly to GP practices and are absolute in measurement (i.e. rewards are not based on performance relative to other practices) (358) . Incentive payments from PIP are part of a broader payment syste m for GPs, which also includes fee -for- service income. In general, incentive payments make up a small proportion of GPs overall income. For 80 Working Paper. 374 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options example, in 2008 -09 PIP payments represented between 3.8% and 10.3% of GP income in capital cities and rural areas, respectively (359) . Germany Increasing healthcare costs and fragmented coordination of care led to the creation of the Disease Management Programs (DMPs) in 2001. The DMP strives to improve quality and coordination of care in order to reduce costly complications and hospitali sations associated with complex medical conditions Health funds w ere originally reimbursed by the Risk Compensation Structure (RCS) on per capita basis and adjusted by age and gender; however, this financing mechanism led to cream skimming and no incentive for physicians to treat the sickest patients, or to provide high quality of care (360) . Sickness funds implemented 10,618 DMPs across a ll disease areas as of 2012 and six million people were covered (360) . The DMP first focused on diabetes, breast cancer, obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary disease (360) . These were proposed by the Joint Federal Commission, which is a group of physicians, representatives from sickness funds, and the German Hospital Organis ation. Disease specific committees were also formed to create evidence based guidelines (360) . These guidelines were verified b y the Agency for Quality in Medicine and the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (361) . Sickness funds have freedom in interpreting and de signing their DMPs, but they must follow specific guidelines. These guidelines specify the patient enrolment process, evidence based treatment, feedback to patients and providers, education to patients and providers, electronic record documentation, and quality assurance and evaluation (361) . DMP programs have the following performance domains - documentation, follow -up of patients, additional services, and training. There are 10 indicators that are measured and rewards are absolute. These incentives are distributed as a flat -rate, additional payment s per enrolled patient, per indicator met, and per service provided to enrolled patients (362) . Sickness funds receive flat rate payments as incentives based on the creation of DMPs and patient enrollment (360) . Physicians are reimbursed directly related to the costs of providing education and coordinating patient care. Physicians also receive additional remuneration for the provision of DMP services in the form of lump sums per patient. According to Stock et al. (2011), physicians receive referral financial incentives per case if they send patients to a chronic disease specialist. Financial payments vary by region. Chronically ill patients are also incentivised to seek treatment through waived co -payments, reduced medicine costs, and payment exemptions from physical therapy (361) . 375 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options France81 Pilot P4 P programs were initially introduced into France's ambulatory care sector in 2009. The original P4P model included a small number of indicators, which were divided into one of the following group s: prevention, chronic disease management, and drug prescrip tion efficiency . All but one of the indicators were directly calculated by the sickness funds based on claims, and thus, did not require additional data to be collected from GPs. In its initial phase, the P4P scheme awarded GPs, on average, \u20ac3,000 per year (with a maximum of \u20ac5,600). P4P was initially met with hostility from: the physicians' union as P4P arrangements were implemented in individual, voluntary contracts; the drug industry, given the inclusion of efficient prescribing targets; and from vario us other institutions due to the mix of quality and efficiency indicators. Despite these objections, 40% of all GPs signed up to P4P . In 2011, the physicians' union and sickness funds agreed to introduce P4P into general contract s as a core component of G P remuneration. The scheme included all original indicators, in addition to a dimension on practice organisation, as well as separate P4P indicators for cardiologists and gastroenterologists in private practice. An overview of current indicators, which w ere jointly developed between sickness funds and the physician's union is outlined below and have been grouped into the following categories: management of chronic diseases; prevention; and efficiency. Similar to international arrangements, the majority of indicators are process related.

(2012) by outlining, at a high -level, key policies to improve quality management within the Austrian healthcare system over the past 20 years (363) . In addition, notable quality programs have also been included . Salient changes to the way quality in healthcare is managed in Austria can be found below: The Federal Health Quality Act (Gesundheitsqualit \u00e4tsgesetz ) (2005): The objective of this Act was to intensify efforts to systematically manage quality of healt hcare in Austria. Efforts to improve quality management, as stated within the Act, should consider patient orientation, transparency, pa tient safety and sustainability. Health Care Structure Plans (2006): As part of the 2005 Healthcare Reform, integrated health care structure plans were introduced at the federal (\u00d6SG) and regional level (Regionaler Struktuplan Gesundheit, RSG). The federal structure plan functions as a template for RSG plans, which are implemented according to the L \u00e4nder configuration (agr eement under article 15a). In short, the federal structure plan outlines capacity planning in the following areas: inpatient care, outpatient care, rehabilitation, biomedical equipment, and the interface of health and long -term care. Further, the structure plan includes guidelines related to structural quality standards and their implementation (363,364) . At the regional level, requirements, as outlined by the federal structure plan, are implemented through the RSGs (between the Lands and social health insurance), which take into account the needs of individuals in each Land (363) . 379 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Federal Institute for Quality in the Healthcare Systems (Bundesinstitut f \u00fcr Qualit\u00e4t im Gesundheitswesen, BIQG): the Health Quality Act (2005 , \u00a79) led to the development of BIQG, which sits within G\u00d6G and cooperates with various stakeholders including social insurance, federal and regional governments, professional societies, c hambers and professional representations, and patient advocacy an d support groups. BIQG specialis es in healthcare quality, and on behalf of the Federal Government develops, implements and regularly evaluates a nationwide quality system based on the mandato ry principles of patient centeredness, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency (304,365) . Austrian Society for Quality Assurance and Quality Management in Medicine (\u00d6sterreichische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4tssicherung und -management in der Medizin In 2006, the Chamber of Physicians established \u00d6QMed, which includes represent atives from the Federal Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, G\u00d6G, HVSV, social security institutions, Chamber of Physicians, academics, and the patient ombudsman. \u00d6QMed is tasked with developing and conducting the self - evaluation for physician practices . The \u00d6QMed acts as a Scientific Advisory Board which provides recommendations regarding how best to measure and monitor the quality of care provided by contracted and non -contracted physicians working within the outpatient sector. Each year \u00d6QMed publish es a Medical Quality Report outlining results from self -administered physician questionnaires (discussed in further detail in this section) (365) . National Quality Strategy (2010): (366) . As a result of the Federal Health Quality Act, in 2010, the Austrian Federal Health Commission assigned the Working Group on Quality to develop a nation -wide quality strategy. The strategy, which was developed by government, social health ins urance and providers, was later agreed by the Federal Health Commission (BGK). Technically, the objectives of the strategy are binding, in practice, however, this is not the case (363,367) . Similar to the Act, the strategy focuses on areas such as patient orientation, safety, equity, effectiveness, and cooperation and coordination (367) . Austrian Inpatient Quality Indicators (2011 ): In 2011, the Federal Health Agency implemented A -IQI as a way to measure quality of care within hospitals. A -IQI, which is based on the German model, was first implemented in Lower Austria and later expanded to all Lands. Today, the A -IQI is explicitly stated in the law, therefore it is compulsory for all hospitals to record data against each of the indicators (368) . Aligning outpatient indicators were introduced in 2013, however, this initiative is at an infancy stage. 380 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Target control health (Zielsteuerung Gesundheit ) (2013): Target Control Health i s a target -based, coordinated and cooperative control system involving social insurance, and federal and state governments. The primary instrument within Target Control Health is the Federal Target Control Agreement (Bundeszielsteuerungsvertrag, B -ZV), whi ch was concluded in June 2013, and the L\u00e4nder Target Control Agreements ( Landeszielsteuerungsvertr\u00e4ge ) on the level of the states. One of the key objectives of the B -ZV agreement was to implement uniform federal quality management systems in hospitals and private practice, and to coordinate systems with the outpatient sector. In terms of structure, as part of the 2013 reform, the Federal Target Control Commission (Bundeszielsteuerungskommission, BZK), was established as a second body in the Federal Health Agency, which took over responsibilities once held by the Federal Health Commission (Bundesgesundheitskommission , BGK) (established in 2004 -05). The BZK is comprised of 17 representatives from federal government (four), regional government (nine) and social health insurance (four). Under the supervision by the BZK, sits the Coordinating Committee ( St\u00e4ndiger Koordinierungsausschuss), who in turn oversees four professional working groups covering e -health, public health, supply processes (which includes the qu ality strategy) and supply structure. Each of these professional groups can undertake work in -house or commission projects to another organisation (e.g. the BIQG in regard to the Quality working group). In addition, there are State Target Control Commissio ns (Landszielsteuerungskommission, LZV) across each of the L\u00e4nder, each comprising 11 representatives from federal government (one), regional government (five) and social health insurance (five). The Federal and State Target Control Commissions are aligned , in that targets developed at the federal level are implemented at the state level, which take into account local conditions. Responsibility for monitoring targets lies with G\u00d6G. A new Federal Target Control Agreement was recently implement, which covers the period 2017 -21. Federal health targets: Under the healthcare reform (2013), 10 over -arching (framework) health related targets were developed and adopted by the Council of Ministers and the Federal Health Commission. The 10 health targets were based on a number of guiding principles including 'orientation towards health determinants', 'health in all policies', and 'promoting health equity'. Together, the targets aim to increase the number of healthy life years by two between 2012 and 2032. The above t argets are broad, therefore a number of sub -targets ( Wirkungsziele ) and aligning indicators have been developed . Most performance indicators are monitored by G\u00d6G, with results being made publically available (annual). It is recognised that the 10th Federal Health Target ('to secure 381 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options sustainable and efficient healthcare services of high quality for all') aligns and complements Target Control Health (369) . In regard to quality initiatives, the following two examples may be considere d the most important. First, introduction of a diabetes disease manag ement program (Therapie Aktiv) (2007 -08), and secondly, the introduction of primary healthcare units (PHUs) as part of the 2013 healthcare form. 382 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 83: Healthcare quality management and major quality projects in Austria since 1997 Year Milestones Objectives Federal level L\u00e4nder level 1997 DRG -based hospital financing Improve efficiency 2004/05 Federal Health Agency introduced Federal Health Commission established Introduction of e-card (SHI) State health Funds established Regional Health Platforms established 'Reform Pool' to coordinate inpatient and outpatient care - Improved collaboration between Federal and L\u00e4nder governments - Better integration between in - and out -patient care Possibility to create Federal quality directives and Federal quality guidelines Better patient pathways 2006 Austrian Health Care Structure Plan for integrated care introduced Regional Health Care Structure Plans introduced Capacity planning and quality management guidance Federal Institute for Quality in the Healthcare Systems (BIQG) established as part of Healthy Austria Ltd., and located with G \u00d6G Austrian Association of Quality Assurance and Management (\u00d6QMed) within the Chamber of Physicians Implementation of national quality standards Outpatient quality management 2007/08 Austrian Health Care Structure Plan for 2008 launched Amendment of Regional Health Care Structure Plans Capacity planning based on volumes and activities Capacity planning for all of health and social care Introduction of the diabetes disease management program (Therapie Aktiv) Improve treatment of diabetic patients 2009 HTA Strategy launched by BIQG First Federal quality guideline for diabetes introduced Reporting & Learning system made available online by \u00d6QMed Quality survey on outpatient care published by \u00d6QMed Improve transparency, patient safety and patient pathways 383 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Year Milestones Objectives Introduction of ELGA to coordinate patient electronic health records 2010 National Quality Strategy published by the Federal Health Commission Online quality reporting platform launched by BIQG Meta guidelines approach introduced by BIQG Publication of Guideline for Reporting & Leaning Systems (BIQG) Independent online Health Portal Outline of main quality objectives Standardisation of federal clinical guide lines Improve patient safety Austrian Health Care Structure Plan for 2010 Regional Health Care Structure Plans for 2010 Improved planning for ambulatory and rehab care 2011 National Quality Report on hospitals by BIQG Introduction A-IQI by the Federal Health Commission Cross -sector P atient Satisfaction Survey (nationa l) results presented (G\u00d6G) Publication of the Reporting & Learning guidelines Improved transparency Standardisation of data collection Improved patient satisfaction 2012 Binding regulations on waiting lists for planned operations in hospitals Improve access to care 2012 Pilot Critical Incident Reporting System implemented within Universtiy of Graz (intensive care, expanded to all units in 2013) Identify potential ha zards within healthcare 2013 Introduction of target control health to monitor seve ral indicators.

(2012) (363) . 385 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Measuring quality of physicians within social health insurance Since 2006, quality standards among contracted and non -contracted physicians have been measured and monitored by the Austrian Socie ty for Quality Assurance and Quality Management in Medicine (\u00d6QMed), a subsidiary of the Chamber of Physicians (291) . Specifically, \u00d6QMed administers self -questionnaires (either online or on paper) covering a range of quality criteria largely related to structures, and to a lesser extent, processes (see table below) (291) . Questions, in general, are broad and responses are limited to yes, no or no t applicable. Given the questionnaire is self-administered, random checks are carried out by representatives of the Chamber of Physicians (Quality Assurance Officers) , however, sufficient warning is provided to private practices prior to an inspection (app roximately six weeks) (363) . \u00d6QMed comprises professionals from a range of different organisations including, the Federal Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs , G\u00d6G, HVSV , social security institutions, Chamber of Physicians, academics, and the patient ombudsman (370) . It is important to note that \u00d6QMed operates purely as an advisory board, in that the Chamber of Physicians is not required to implement their recommendations regarding which ind icators should be measured. Table 84: \u00d6QMed quality criteria categories (as of 2011) Indicator categories Evaluation criteria set out by \u00d6QMed includes 20 categories, with aligning sub -categories to measure the quality of care pr ovided by physicians in social insurance.

To do so, process or outcome measures are typically applied, with an increasing preference for the latter. Hospital discharge and readmissions are frequently evaluated for this purpose. The following section describes the existing uses of hospital discharge and readmission metrics in measurin g and paying for performance, and reviews the primary evidence for this metric within the Austrian context. Discharge care and post -discharge mortality and readmission rates Discharge care and the incidence of post -discharge mortality and readmission even ts are used as process - and outcomes -based measures of hospital quality and performance. One stream of evidence on hospital quality in acute coronary syndromes has relied on evaluations of discharge and secondary preventive pharmaceutical care, as well as hospital readmissions (372 -378) . This line of evidence typically evaluates whether, and to what extent, best clinical practices were met during discharge care for particular conditions. With regards to clinical outcomes, the i ncidence of all -cause and, in particular, unplanned hospital readmissions within some period after the hospital episode are taken as a measure of the quality of care delivered during the patient's hospital stay. For example, the literature has often used c are and outcomes surrounding acute myocardial infarction (AMI) events to evaluate hospital and health system performance. Once an AMI has occurred, studies have evaluated how the efficiency of admission processes - including rapidity of ambulance services and hospital -based pathways to initial treatment - predicts readmissions, as well as in -hospital and post - discharge AMI mortality (379) . Once an admission has occurred, studie s have also evaluated how patient course is influenced by delivery of invasive (e.g., PCI) and pharmaceutical (e.g., thrombolysis, statins, aspirin) treatments at any time prior to discharge (373,375,380) . 387 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Less developed, but growing, is the literature that uses hospital readmissions to measure cost efficiency (381) . This dearth of evidence likely reflects technical difficulties in associating patient outcomes, including readmissions, with hospital inputs, which may be defined in financial or physical resource terms. Efficiency analyses of this sort may be facilitated with the emergence of micro -costing hospital data, such as patient - level information and costing systems (PLICS) in the UK. Discharge care and readmissions in Austria Bearing in mind that discharge care and the incidence of post -discharge mortality and readmission events are used as process - and outcomes -based measures of hospital quality and performance, this section now considers the Austrian experience in performance on both of these measures. The OECD defines hospital discharge as 'important indicators of hospital activity', that may be affected by several factors, including: the capacity of hospitals to treat patients; the ability of the primary care sector to prevent avoidable hospital admiss ions; and the availability of post -acute care settings to provide rehabilitative and long -term care services (382) . The OECD finds that in 2013 (or nearest available year) Austria and Germany were the two countries with the highest hospital discharge rates of OECD countries ( Figure 29). At 263 hospital discharges per 1 ,000 population, Austria had the highest discharge rate of all OECD countries examined. Austria's discharge rate was 55 % hig her than the OECD average of 169 hospital discharges per 1 ,000 population. Elsewhere, reports indicate that discharge rates are particularly high in Austria for hypertensive disease (383) . It is important to evaluate these data with caution: for instance, an EC -sponsored research project in 2008 found low discharge rates in Spain, but attributed this to known underreporting (383) . The OECD argues that high discharge rates are generally observed in settings that ha ve a larger number of hospital beds. Indeed, at 7. 6 beds per 1 ,000 population, Austria ranks among the highest in countries evaluated by the OECD in number of hospital beds, adjusted by population (see Figure 19 and Figure 20). It should however be noted that Germany, which outranks Austria in number of hospital beds per 1,000 population, has a fewer number of hospital discharges per 1,000 population. This points to higher rates of use of hospital services in Austria: patients may genuinely have greater health needs, or may, for reasons that deserve further examination, overuse hospital services. Indeed, an EC -sponsored report in 2008 indicated that higher rates o f discharge in Austria were due to a higher rate of hospital readmissions for investigation and treatment of cancer patients than in other European countries (383) . The report indicated that high rates of readmission were unlikely to b e caused 388 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options by 'morbidity reasons' (383) . The implications of this finding for patient health, and particularly the risks and benefits to cancer patients, remain to be investigated. Factors contributing t o high hospital admission rates in Austria Fiscal illusion and political economy of hospitals From the viewpoint of political economy, in an ageing society, political benefits can be reaped by providing ample healthcare services, e.g. in the form of hosp itals. What is more, as most hospitals are eventually owned by the L\u00e4nder, they provide the opportunity to exert power according to the theory of bureaucracy (384) . Moreover, hospitals always provide employment for q ualified personnel and improve economic activity in a region. All these ef fects reflect positively on regional (i.e. L\u00e4nder and municipal) governments and thus create the tendency to over -provide. The above scenario is normally outbalanced by the necessity to also tax the regional population to pay for the hospitals, as is the case in many other countries, e.g. Sweden. In Austria, however, nearly all taxes are levied by the Ministry of Finance, while social insurance contributions are collected by the health insurance funds. Therefore, the regional governments do not have to bear the negative consequences from taxing their populations for hospital services, while still benefitting, a phenomenon known as fiscal illusio n (384) . Also, the L\u00e4nder, while endowed with ample control over hospitals (art. 12 of the Austrian constit ution), pay only 32 % of costs. Figure 120: Public financing of fund hospitals Source: Statistics Austria 2017 government , health insurance , 46%389 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Indeed, there has been a continuous struggle between the federal government and local governments about hospital beds, with several attempts of the federal government to reduce their numbers, first the Austrian Hospital and Lar ge Devices Plan ( \u00d6sterreichischer Krankenanstalten - und Gr\u00f6\u00dfger\u00e4teplan ), then the \u00d6SG with a sanction mechanism in the 15a -agreement. Keeping hospitals open while the occupancy rate is low is politically infeasible. Therefore, also known as Roemer's law (385) , there is the incentive to lower the requi rements for hospital stays so that the capacities can be shown to be necessary, a phenomenon also found in empirical s tudies of the hospital sector (386) . The L\u00e4nder also have the means to conduct such a policy as they command many competencies in the hospital sector. Specifically, t hey: 1. Enact hospital laws 2. Execute hospital laws 3. Regulate market entry (\u00a73KaKuG) 4. Command the automatic majority in all decisions concerning hospitals in the state health funds 5. Own most hospitals 6. Finance hospitals partly . In addition to this, most L\u00e4nder hospitals hav e been organisationally privatis ed, and the 1 5a-agreement on the organisation and financing of the healthcare system explicitly states that state health funds shall be able to cover more than 50% of costs. This provision has the effect that the hospital companies owned by the L\u00e4nder are treated as be ing entities of the private sector in the system of national accounts. Therefore, up until 2010, deficits and debts of the hospital companies did not count towards Austria's Maastricht deficit and debt. When Eurostat revised the rules of the manual on gove rnment deficit and debt, the debt burden of all L\u00e4nder hospitals became known to the public for the first ti me amounting to \u20ac3.8 billion (6). Reasons lying in the domain of social health insurance For the management of Social Health Insurance, the main benchmark is not to keep the overall health budget in line, but to spend only as much as its own revenues allow (also known as Einnahmenorientierte Ausgabenpolitik ), even more so as there is no compet ition for insurees in Austria. As SHI pays a share of their revenues to the state health funds regardless of the number of patients actually attending hospitals, it is faced by the following decision problem: 390 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Increasing the number of contract physicians w ill incur additional expenditure, while limiting the number of contracts helps contain costs. The external effect of this decision is that people are faced by a limited supply of services especially out -of-hours, while at the same time there is no user cha rge or restriction of using hospital outpatient departments. Figure 114 illustrates that despite a growing population, the number of contracts betwee n SHI and the Chambers of Physicians remains the same, effectively reducing the relative capacity in the extramural sector, essentially constituting cost -shifting behaviour. The fact that this is not an effect of a shortage of physicians can be shown when calculating the share of physicians who own practice and do not have a contract with any social insurance carrier (63% of specialists and 40% of GPs). Structure of extra -mural sector and incentives for patients Given the incentive for SHI to underprovide contract ed physician services, and as the extramural sector consists mainly of single practices, patients with more complex problems must book several appointments, and spent an increased amount of time waiting for services . What is more, GPs up until 2015 received only three years of vocational training, all of which taking place in hospitals. More than 95% of contract physicians work in single practice, with only a practice aid but no nurse practitioners or other medical professions. Contact hours are the refore limited and often only 20 hours a week. Specialists work mainly in single practice as well, making it more difficult to integrate services. While Germany introduced outpatient facilities providing integrated specialists services a long time ago with its legislation on integrated care, efforts to do so in Austria were never successful (40). This leaves a gap in service provision of integrated care for the chronically ill between single practices on the one end and hospitals on the other, sometimes called intermediate or step -down facilities (387,388) . 391 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 121: Practice settings of \u00a72-Physicians Source: (389) By contrast, outpatient departments offer all services under one roof with same -day service, 24/7. Thus, in order to avoid long waiting times in the extramural sector as well as having to keep multiple appointments, patients will, given these circumstances, prefer to go to outpatient hospital departments. Despite its importance, very little empirical work has been devoted to this topic. However, Haidinger et al. (2013) conducted a study on persons visiting outpatient departments without referral (390) . They find that at least 60% of these could have been treated by a GP, while only 3% required treatment in a hospital. The weakness of the primary care sector can also be seen when looking at avoidable hospital admissions. Austria performs very poorly in this respect (see Figure 33 to Figure 36). Sonderklasse and payment system According to political economy literature, hospital managers and department heads are not impartial when it comes to more or less funds allocated to their hospital even if the hospital is not -for-profit (see Mueller (2003) pp. 362ff and pp 373ff for a review of empirical studies) (384) . More funds might not mean more profits in this case, but they offer the possibility to pay higher wages, to pursue scientific interests, to be held in higher esteem by peers or simply to exert power. In Austri a, at least two factors set strong incentives reinforcing this mechanism, the Sonderklasse and the payment system. Specific group practice , 1% Group practice , 3% Single -handed practice , 96%392 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Sonderklasse Even in Austrian not -for-profit hospitals, patients can pay for better amenities and the right to be treated by a specific phy sician, either out -of-pocket or through their voluntary health insurance. The patients are then admitted to the Sonderklasse . The patients' payments go to the hospital but also increase the income of the physicians working at the department. Therefore, bot h the hospital management and the physicians have an incentive to admit and treat such patients. The hospital law KaKuG in \u00a7 16 sets some limits to this. Not -for-profit hospitals must not have more than 25% of beds in the Sonderklasse . In the long run thou gh, this sets the incentive to increase the total number of beds, as only then also the number Sonderklasse -beds can be increased, contributing to what can be seen in Figure 19. Payment system While the inpatient sector of hospitals is paid through a DRG -like system called LKF, the outpatient departments only receive a global budget based on historical values. In effect, it is much more valuable for th e hospital to have patients admitted to inpatient departments than treating them in the outpatient department. For this reason, even cataract surgery was mainly performed during an inpatient stay only some years ago. In order to change the incentives, a f irst step was the introduction of the Tagesklinikkatalog in 2006, a list of procedures that could be performed in day clinics, while the hospital still received payment for an overnight stay. Since then, more and more services are provided in day clinics, albeit with considerable regional differences (391) . Another step to improve the situation would be the introduction of a DRG - system for outpatient departments. Preparatory work has been undertaken with the implementation of the Katalog Ambulanter Leistungen (KAL) . Policy options: Maximising quality of care A key mechanism to enhance the quality of care provided by physicians is to measure their performance against a set of key indicators. These indicators can relate to healthcare structures, processes or clinical outcomes, and in many countries, are linked to financial rewards or penalties. The agency responsible for measuring and monitoring indicators has important implications for quality of care, given it is their role to ensure the data collected is used in a way to enhance patient care. 393 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Based on a revi ew of policies used to measure quality among Austrian physicians, and international experiences, the following policy options have been developed. These options can be divided into the three groups, and are aimed to maximising quality of care within the Au strian social health insurance system (see Figure 122 for an overview of policy options). Figure 122: Summary of policy optio ns Role of \u00d6QMed Retain \u00d6QMed and create an additional independent quality committee responsible for monitoring the quality of care among social health insurance physicians . Relocate \u00d6QMed to the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, and g ive the organisation control over monitoring the quality of care among soc ial health insurance physicians. Maximise the value of data collected through quality indicators through, for example, providing physician feedback and s haring best practice principles. Data availability and q uality indicators Code patient diagnosis . Increase focus on outcome indicators, and where possible link them to aligning process indicators . Link quality indicators across all levels of care . Hospital admission, readmissions and discha rge management Investigate the causes, as well as clinical and policy implications, of high rates of hospital discharge and readmission in Austria . Financial targets within Zielsteuerung Gesundheit if real values, as opposed to nominal values, are used as the basis for the target . \u00d6SG to base forecasts on epidemiological data and b est practice service provisions. Integrate secondary care units in outpatient sector with primary care and hospitals . For the LKF, link payment to quality . Set up joint budgets for the chronically ill including both social health insurance and the L\u00e4nder . 394 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options \u00d6QMed role As previously d iscussed, the Chamber of Physicians is responsible for monitoring the quality of care provided by physicians within social health insurance. To assist the Chamber in measuring and monitoring healthcare quality, it has established a scientific advisory board, \u00d6QMed, comprising representatives from numerous organisations/levels of government, including two from social health insurance (see sectio n 6.4.5 for further details). Given \u00d6QMed is a subsidiary of the Chamber, it is not independent, further, its current role is purely advisory, wit h no requirement for the Chamber to implement recommendations made by the board. Such an arran gement is challenging given those measuring the quality of doctors are docto rs themselves. To overcome a potential conflict of interest , the following two mutual ly exclusive options are proposed. The first option would be to retain \u00d6QMed within its current form in the Chamber, however, ultimate responsibility for monitoring physician quality would lie with an independent quality committee located within the Minist ry of Health and Women's Affairs. Alternatively, \u00d6QMed could be relocated to the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, to ensure its independence. Under this new arrangement, \u00d6QMed would be responsible for developing indicators to measure physician quali ty, and deciding how information collected through the indicators are used. If the former approach is adopted, consideration should be given to limit avoid/limit duplication between \u00d6QMed and the independent quality committee . Under both options, either \u00d6QMed or the independent quality committee would be jointly funded by the Ministr y of Health and Women's Affairs, and the Chamber of Physicians. To maximise the value of data collected on quality, it is recommended that the final agency responsible for m easuring and monitoring physician quality employ one or several of the following approaches: providing physician feedback, sharing knowledge (best practice), intervention when poor performance is identified, and potentially, in the long -run, pay -for-perfor mance (see Figure 123). To maximise the potential of all strategies outlined above, it is recommended all interventions be designed in cooperation with the Chamber of Physicians. 395 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 123: Maximising the value of data on quality indicators Physician feedback Each physician c ould receive a short 'scorecard ' outlining their performance across the different quality indicators. In addition to their individual performance, physician performance at the relevant regional level and national level would also be provided, allowing for comparisons to be drawn. The sco recard would highlight areas where, in relative terms, the physician is performing well (i.e. above the regional/national level) or poorly. Scorecards would be provided biannually, by mail or online, allowing physicians to track their performance over time . Given differences across regions, indicators will be risk -adjusted so that like -for-like comparisons are drawn (see following section for further details on quality indicators). The public could also have access to performance data, however, it is reco mmended that data at the regional, as opposed to the individual provider level, only be made available. Knowledge sharing As previously outlined, data on quality indicators will be tracked across physicians and time. Therefore, significant positive change s in performance at the individual, practice or regional level will be tracked. Investigation into how improvements were made should be undertaken , with findings shared and promoted to all physicians. It is important to note that only regional aggregate da ta would be available to all physicians. That is, individual performance data would only be accessible by the physician themselves. Intervention Readily available data on quality indicators at the individual, regional and national level, will enable \u00d6QM ed or the independent quality committee to identify areas of need within the system. For example, if physicians in an entire region perform poorly in certain indicators, investigation and appropriate intervention at the regional level will be required. Pri or to intervention, a thorough analysis is needed to ensure the problem lies with physician quality, as opposed to external regional factors. At the individual level, poor performing doctors wil l be easily identified, allowing intervention at the earliest possible stage. If performance does not improve, disciplinary action may be taken. Pay-for-performance 396 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Governments across the world are increasingly interested in incentivising high -quality care through monetary rewards or penalties. Such an approach could be adopted in Austria, however, the evidence of its impact on quality is limited. Legal considerations No particular constitutional impediments have to be faced in this respect, but some amendments to the current system of contractual agreements w ould be required. Quality indicators Across all healthcare systems, collection and analysis of quality indicators at the outpatient level is in its early stages, when compared to hospital care. This is the case in Austria, where a limited number of struc ture and process quality indicators are collected to measure the performance of contracted and non - contracted phys icians. The focus on structure and process indicators does not follow internatio nal trends, which is to measure patient outcomes directly. To collect data on outcomes, information on patient diagnoses is required. At present, social health insurance physicians are not required to provide this information. This shortcoming was frequently highlighted in roundtable stakeholder discussions, and has also been recognised by government as evidenced by the topic's inclusion in the latest healthcare reform (i.e. health targets). Given the above , the following recommendations are made to improve quality of care provided by contracted and non -contracted p hysicians: Diagnosis coding We support current thinking among a range of Austrian healthcare stakeholders that physicians be required to code patient diagnosis for each consultation. Such information would allow social health insurers to develop and impl ement of outcome quality indicators. It is important to note that previous efforts have been implemented to introduce diagnosis coding at the primary care level. Specifically, discussions were had regarding the implementation of ICPC -2 (International Class ification of Primary Care, 2nd edition), however, were never introduced. 397 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Process and outcome indicators Future evaluations of physicians should focus on both process and outcome indicators, and could, where possible link the two types of indicators to ensure results are interpreted correctly. Specifically, by linking outcome and process indicators, changes i n patient health outcomes are more likely to be attributed to a change in the provision of care, as opposed to external factors outside the control of the physician. However, it is important to note that combining two indicators into one represents additio nal work on part of the physician. For this reason, the total number of indicators would have to be reduced. Put simply, there is a tradeoff between the total number of indicators, and the quality of each indicator. Finally, it is important to note that m easurement of outcome indicators, relative to those related to processes, are more burdensome given individual patient circumstances should be considered. So, although outcome indicators are ideal, process indicators may be more efficient, further, process indicators within the healthcare sector are relatively well developed. Working Group As part of the 2013 Healthcare Reform, a Federal Target Control Commission (Bundeszielsteuerungskommission , B-ZK) was implemented, and operationalised under the Federa l Health Agency ( Bundesgesundheitsagentur, BGA). It is the responsibility of the B -ZK to oversee a Coordinating Committee (St\u00e4ndiger Koordinierungsausschuss) responsible for four professional groups covering e - health, public health, supply processes and su pply structure. Responsibility for the quality strategy falls under the remit of the professional group dedicated to supply processes. We recommend that, should there be an agreement to introduce additional process and outcome indicators, the professional group for supply processes be given responsibility for designing and implementing indicators. That is, the professional group could develop indicators in -house or commission a relevant organisation to undertake the work (e.g. Federal Institute for Quality in the Health Service, BIQG (Bunde sinstitut f within G\u00d6G ). Regardless of whether indicators are developed in -house or commissioned by an external organisation, members of the medical community should be involved in the decision -making process. Failing to adequately consult physicians is likely to delay implementation of and participation in the collection of quality indicators. Legal considerations No particular constitutional impediments have to be faced in this respect. 398 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Data availability Measurement of quality, in Austria and across the world, is largely focused on isolated aspects of care. Such an approach fails to holistically measure quality of care, thereby diminishing the utility of collected informat ion (392,393) . For this reason, a ny additional process and /or outcome indicators implemented at the primary/outpatient care level would ideally be linked w ith new or existing inpatient quality indicator s. By doing so, patient pathways are created which facilitate understanding of healthcare p erformance at the system level (a n example of a COPD patient pathway within the UK's NHS is provided in Table 85). Further, linking quality indicators across the spectrum of care fosters joint accountability across Federal Government, L\u00e4nd er and social health insuranc e. Coordination of indicators across the spectrum of care was stipulated within the 2013 Healthcare Reform (Federal Target Control Agreement), however, to date, it is unclear what policies have been implemented to achieve this goal. For this reason, it is rec ommended that policy -makers enhance current efforts to better coordinate quality indicators across the spectrum of care be enhanced. Table 85: Patient pathway quality indicators for COPD (UK, NHS) Domain Quality indicator General practice (diagnosis) Prevalence of COPD Asthma prevalence COPD diagnosis Exception rate for COPD indicators General practice (treatment) Adults with COPD who smoke Patients with long -term conditions with smoking status (recorded) Patients with long -term conditions offered education on smoking Successful smoking quitters at four weeks Prescribed nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline Eligible COPD patients offered rehabilitation COPD patients with a medical review 399 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Domain Quality indicator Secondary care Length of stay, emergency inpatient COPD admissions Emergency admissions for COPD Emergency readmissions within 28 days and 90 days Mortality and end of life care Deaths from COPD (all ages, and less than 75 years) Years of life lost due to mortality from COPD Deaths with mention of respiratory disease as a cause Note: See Jonas et al. (2012) for a through overview of COPD patient pathways in the UK (392) . Legal considerations No particular legal imped iments have to be faced in this respect. Hospital admission, readmissions and discharge management Readmissions and discharge management Hospital discharge and readmission rates in Austria are high compared with other countries. As additional evidence is generated on the causes of these phenomena, Austrian policymakers may wish to consider approaches to reduce hospital readmissions without compromising patient outcomes. To provide Austrian policymakers with a guide on how to do so, the followi ng section r eviews and synthesis es two major and recent empirical contributions to the literature that evaluate this issue. Couturier and colleagues (2016) conducted a systematic review of observational and interventional studies evaluating components of the hospital discharge process and patient outcomes following discharge (394) . The authors find that all relev ant studies (n= 20) explored various discharge -process components, including: discharge summaries, discharge instructions, drug -related problems at discharge, transition from hospital to home, and continuity of care after hospital discharge. At the same time, mos t studies examined re -hospitalis ations (n=18), emergency department visits (n=8) , and mortality (n=5). Certain studies that examined patient re -hospitalisations and emergency department visits 'reported at least one significant association between the discharge process and these outcomes,' while none reported 400 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options an association with morta lity. Evidence -based approaches to reducing hospital readmissions may therefore reduce healthcare spending without negatively impacting patient outcomes. Leppin and colleagues (2015) highlight that policies aimed at reducing 30 -day post -discharge hospital readmissions aim to improve hospital quality (395) . Like Couturier and colleagues (2 016), Leppin and colleagues (2015) therefore conduct a review of papers published between 1990 and 2013 to 'synthesize the evidence of the efficacy of interventions to reduce early hospital readmissions and identify intervention features that might explain their varying effects' (395) . Of the trials that were published over this period and met eligibility criteria, 42 prevented early readmissions to hospital. Exploratory subgroup analyses also revealed that the following intervention characteristics were associated with greater effectiveness in reducing post -discharge hospital readmissions: interventions containing many components (1.4 times more effective than other interventions); interventions involving more individuals in care delivery (1.3 times more effective than other interventions); and interventions that support patient capacity fo r self -care (1.3 times more effective than other interventions). Consistent with Couturier and colleagues (2016), post -hoc regression analysis revealed that providing patients and caregivers with comprehensive, post -discharge support could help reduce 30 -day post -discharge hospital readmissions. If hospital discharge is taken to represent one component of patient care, improving hospital discharge processes may therefore reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions, reduce costs, and indeed improve the care tha t is provided to patients. Austrian policymakers should take this evidence review to indicate that it may be possible to reduce unnecessary and costly hospital readmissions by better managing the hospital discharge process. The empirical evidence also app ears to suggest that doing so does not compromise patient outcomes. By reducing costs, while preserving or indeed improving patient care and outcomes, comprehensive approaches to improving patient discharge care may therefore provide unambiguously positive value to patients and the health system. It is arguably acceptable from a clinical standpoint \u2014albeit technically inefficient given lower -cost, alternative methods of care for non -urgent conditions \u2014for Austrian patients to rely heavily on hospital services if it is for routine care. Should this be the case in Austria, policy makers should consider prioritis ing reforms that increase the efficiency of healthcare delivery. However, the findings presented above would be more concerning from a health systems and clinical perspective if high hospital discharge and readmission rates are due to unplanned, urgent medical needs. Further research is needed to investigate the causes, as well as clinical and policy implications, of high rates of hospital discharge and rea dmission 401 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options in Austria. Even as this research is undertaken, the existing empirical evidence suggests that comprehensive efforts to improve the hospital discharge process may reduce healthcare costs, while preserving or indeed improving patient care and outco mes, and may therefore provide unambiguously positive value to patients and the health system. Hospital admissions In order to outbalance political benefits and costs, federal government funds to L\u00e4nder should be based on objective criteria that reflect the needs of the population . Additional pressure could come from the financial targets in the Zielsteuerung Gesundheit and the stability pact. The financial targets could be more effective in that real values instead of nominal values are used and concrete efficiency gains form the basis for this target. The Austrian Structural Plan for Health (\u00d6SG) forecasts the capacities in the inpatient and outpatient sector that ought to be planned in detail on the state level and then implemented. But as the internati onal comparison shows, its success in terms of reduction of beds is rather limited. One of the reasons might be that the planning is based on current provision of services, which might be too high. Ideally, the \u00d6SG would base its forecasts on epidemiologic al data and best practice of service provision, rather than taking the current demand as a proxy for need. Alongside the planning in the \u00d6SG and the Zielsteuerung Gesundheit , the quantity and quality of services in the extramural sector should be determin ed with the goal to reduce avoidable hospital admissions and keep the vast majority of treatments in the outpatient setting, while hospitals only provide higher level services. A first step has been taken by the initiative to introduce a true primary care system, which has been shown to reduce unnecessary admissions. Nevertheless, the high number of single -handed practices and missing intermediate (step -down) facilities with specialists providing integrated services to chronically ill have to be tackled as well. A small first step is the commitment in the latest 15a agreement to set up secondary care units in the outpatient sector. While this is necessary, integration of these units with primary care and hospitals is not yet adequately addressed. With regard s to payment, the LKF system could be enhanced in several directions. Payment cou ld be linked to quality, by, for example, paying a stay and possible readmissions only as a bundle. For the outpatient departments, the development of a DRG system seems to be crucial, also to improve the information on patient paths. In a later step, care for chronically ill in the inpatient and outpatient sector 402 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options could be paid for by a joint pool of funds by SHI and the Land using a bundled payment system. Pilots could be set up for high -cost patients. When reducing hospital capacity, funds are needed in order to treat people elsewhere, while fixed costs in hospitals cannot be reduced at the same time. A mechanism could therefore be set up to compensate hospitals for a limited period of time for the money that might go to the extramural sector within the virtual budget between SHI and the Land. During this time, facilities either have to be wound down or their alternative use has to be implemented. Alternative uses will depend o n the regional requirements. Inpatient capacities can be transformed into long term care facilities, for which demand will presumably increase in coming years. Outpatient departments could accommodate primary care units or specialist group practices provid ing integrated care services. Summary of policy options to improve quality through contractual negotiations As outlined in Table 83, numerous policie s have been implemented in recent years to improve measurement and monitoring of quality within the healthcare sector. Despite this, Austria continues to lag behind international trends regarding quality management. In response, a number of policies to i mprove healthcare quality have been proposed. The first set of options relates to the role of \u00d6QMed, which to date has not been fully utilised given its placement with the Chamber of Physicians. Under our proposals, \u00d6QMed could retain its current structur e, however, it would sit as an independent body and be jointly funded by the Chamber of Physicians, and the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs. Alternatively, in addition to the \u00d6QMed, an independent quality committee could be developed, which would ha ve ultimate responsibility for monitoring physician quality. Under both options, we advise that information collected be used to provide physicians with regular feedback, better inform the public on healthcare quality, and potentially, in the long -run, lin k performance to financial incentives. The second set of options relate to the types of indicators used to measure physician quality. Following international trends, it is recommended that indicators focus on process and outcomes, and to a lesser extent s tructures. Ideally, process and outcome indicators would be linked, however, consideration should be given to the additional burden this would place on physicians. It is important to note that before outcome indicators can be introduced, physicians must r ecord patient diagnosis. Finally, to ensure the most appropriate indicators are chosen, we recommend that the existing the professional group for 403 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options supply processes take responsibility for designing and implementing additional process and outcome indicators. The final set of policy options concerns data availability. Specifically, we propose that instead of collecting and analysing quality data in silos, efforts be made to coordinate quality indicators across the spectrum of care. Demand and supply of phy sicians This section examines the future supply and demand of physicians working within the Austrian healthcare system. Specifically, through an examination of potential policies to increase the availability of physicians, as well as measures to enhance p hysician productivity. Measures to increase availability of physicians The calculations outlined within this section are based on a static model, for which historical developments have been combined with, for example, legally justified changes, and extrap olated until 2030. The results of the model are for illustrative purposes as several of the assumptions need to be further validated. This is particularly relevant for results regarding the under - or over -supply of physicians. Section 6.5.1 has been structured as follow ed: Follow a physician's education and employment path and discuss in a chronological order at which crossroads and in which situations inflows could be increased or outflows reduced, and which measures were already taken to achieve a higher supply of physician capacity, see Figure 124. In the figure, green arrows represent an 'ideal' physician's path from achieving the 'Matura' (A -levels), passing the entrance examination into medical school, working as a physician and finally to retirement. In the course of th is path, several 'control knobs' can be identified: Admission to medical school and continuing through the end. The annual number of graduates from public medical schools fell significantly around 2012 ( Figure 125). This is directly related to the introduction of more restrictive admission procedures at all three public medical schools in 2006, and perhaps to some degree already to the new Summative In tegrative Pr\u00fcfung (SIP, the final exam after each year which is necessary to pass in order to continue medical school) in 2002, at the medical school in Vienna. Since 2006, there has been a fixed maximum annual number of first -year students in all (then) t hree public medical schools. 404 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Due to unrestricted access to medical schools before introduction of these restrictions, output from medical schools was so high that availability of internships was a bottleneck, and waiting several years before achieving a po st as intern was quite common.83 Today, several hospital administration managers complain about too few applicants for internship vacancies. However, we do not know any hard data on such vacancies. Also the chronologically next joint, the transition from pr ofessional training to autonomous work as a physician, is today characteris ed by much fiercer competition for the best ap plicants, resulting, for example, in rural communities offering generous help for young physicians replacing the retiring GPs. Chronolo gically the last transition, from work to retirement, has not yet been a topic for public discussion apart from the general retirement discussion. Over the last couple of years, however, some regulations with immediate impact on retirement decisions have b een changed, which are discussed below. In Figure 124, the blue arrows symbolis e entries to and exits from the medical profession including education and training for the profession. These flows are in some cases of high and in most cases of not so large significance for the medical capacities in Austria. In most cases, hard data on these flow s are not available . The following paragraphs discuss the gr een arrows in Figure 124 as well as the most relevant ones of the blue arrows, i.e. drop -outs from medical schools and emigration after medical school . 83 As a consequence, oversupply of fresh graduates from medical school resulted in the perception of interns as \"cheap labour\", fulfilling many administrative t asks and tasks more suited to nurses than doctors. Payment was low, resulting in interns' desire for well -paid night -shifts and working many hours overtime. 405 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 124: A physician's path of education and employment Admission to medical school from Austria and other countries Austria has a long tradition of very open admission procedures at university, and this topic has been a hotly debated issue repeatedly in political elections. Due to high inflow of non -Austrian students - predominantly from Germany - who are expected to le ave Austria once they finished medical school, also Austria restricted the number of admissions to medical school in 2006. For admission in October 2017, the number of places in public medical schools is displayed in Table 86. The medical school in Linz is not only the smallest, but also the youngest public medical school in Austria. Since 2014 and in cooperation with the Graz medical school, Linz is the first medical school to apply the bachelor -master -system. It is planned to stepwise increase capacity in Linz from 120 to 300 places per year by 2022/23. Currently, Linz covers only the first four semesters of the bachelor program, for semester 5 and 6 st udents have to move to Graz. It is planned to also start a master program (6 semesters) in Linz in 2017/18.84 84 http://www.jku.at/ . 406 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 86: Capacities for first -year students in public medical schools, Austria, 2017 Human medicine Dentistry Total MedUni Wien 660 80 740 MedUni Graz 336 24 360 MedUni Innsbruck 360 40 400 144 1620 Universit\u00e4t Salzburg, however, this is tehcnicaly a private university. Together with upper limits for admission to medical school also specific admission procedu res had to be introduced. Realis ing that large numbers of German students outperformed Austrian applicants in these tests, admission to one of the public medical schools (Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck, Linz) furthermore has been linked to a quota. Per agreement with the EU Commission, the quota for Austrian students is 75% of each medical school's capacity, 20% for other EU students, and 5% for students with other nationalities . EU citizens with Matura from an Austrian school fall into the Austrian quota. The EU commission originally intended to phase out the quotas in 2016. B ut recently (2017) the application to medicine (not den tistry) was allowed to continue, subject to Austrian authorities providing proof for undersupply of physicians in Austria otherwise. In the initial phase of selective admission, medical school s applied different admission procedures. For example, in Innsbruck, the Swiss EMS test was applied as time for developing an own instrument was rather short. Graz medical school in contrast to this developed their own instrument, fully aware that the initial test lacked a validation phase and consequently was found to lack proper testing for social - emotional competencies (396) . Since 2013, all public medical schools apply a common test, MedAT -Z for dentists and MedAT -H for general medical school. The examination usually takes place on the same day, this year on 07.07.2017. Applicants have to pay a test fee of 110 Euro per appli cant in order to be allowed 407 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options to sit; this fee is meant to cover the medical school's test costs.85 Additionally, the test fee might serve as a deterrent for 'not so serious' applicants. The MedAT -H test is a multiple -choice test that in 2016 comprised 40% qu estions from mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry, 40% questions regarding cognitive competences, 10% of social -emotional competences, and 10% questions regarding text comprehension. The test for admission to dental medicine deviates and also includ es e.g. manual competences. Drop -outs from medical school Before 2006, in a very open admission regime, drop -out rates from medical school often reached 50% and duration at medical school often reached 9 rather than the scheduled 6 years, e.g. due to waiti ng times for labs (396) . As expected, drop -out rates from medical school fell since selective admission into medical schoo l, more students can finish in the scheduled time and performance in examinations improved. In Innsbruck, a comparison between 'open admission' (2002 -2004), and 'selected admission' (2006 -2009) showed a drop in the average annual number of study beginners from 602 in the open admission period to 349 during selected admission86. Despite this reduction, the number of students passing SIP 1 increased both in absolute and in relative terms. Seventy -one per cent of the admitted selected students passed SIP 1 comp ared with 49.1% of the unselected group. This effect, however, is restricted in so far as performance at SIP 3 seems to be closer related to performance at SIP 1 than to the admission test: 91.4% of the students with open admission who had passed SIP 1 wer e also successful in SIP 3, compared to 92.6% in the selected admission group (397) . Taking 'never trying to pass SIP 1' as the drop -out criterion, 36.7% of the students to Innsbruck medical school were regarded as drop -outs in the open admission group. In the selected admission group the number of drop -outs fell signif icantly to 17.5% (397) . Between 2006 und 2013, different admissi on procedures were applied, depending on the medical school. Graz applied a different test than Innsbruck, but also noted a significant decrease in drop -outs after restricting admission. Whereas only 20.1 -26.4% of openly admitted students completed the fir st two study semesters within the scheduled time of 1 year, this percentage rose to 75.6 -91.9% for the selected admission group (396) . Applying hazard rate models, a comparison between academic years 2002 -2003 85 https://www.medizinstudieren.at/ 86 This comparison was performed with regard to the then applied admission test, a predecessor of the current MedAT -H called EMS - Eignungstest f\u00fcr das Medizinstudium in der Schweiz. 408 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options to 2008 -2009 showed in openly admitted students a significantly higher risk for dropout in female students and in older students, whereas no such effects were detected a fter admission testing (398) . Transition between medical school and practical training Changed admission procedures including the limited number of available places for first semester students resulted in a dropping number of graduates approximately six years later. Students during unrestricted admission suffered from higher competition for lab plac es etc., which in many cases caused delays in their educational progress, and only few students managed to finish the program within the minimum time of 12 semesters. Due to this effect in combination with high drop -out rates, and perhaps also because ther e was no selection of the most suitable students at admission, we can perceive the effect of the changed admission rules on the annual number of graduates only at a high -level , see Figure 125. Figure 125: Number of medicine, 2002/03 - 2015/16 Source: Unidata (data -warehouse of the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy), IHS. We quantify the drop in graduate numbers as the reduction from the median of the period 2002/03 - 2011/2012 to the median of the period 2012/13 - 2015/16, which amounts to 1632 -1386 = 247 graduates or 15% of the open admission period. 409 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options High rates of emigrat ion after graduation can be perceived among medical graduates of all nationalities; among Austrian graduates those from medical schools have higher emigration rates than graduates from any other educational field. Statistics Austria calculated the percenta ge of persons without official residence in Austria in up to three years after graduation, with an increasing share of emigrants among German and Austrian citizens (399) . In school year 2012/13, 6.7% of Austrian graduates left the country within one year after graduation, while in year 2008/09 it was only 6.1% within three years. Highest rates of emigration can be observed among German graduates of the years 2010/11 and 2011/12 (and presumably also the following years), exceeding 80% within three years ( Figure 126). Note that in 2012/13 the first graduates after rest ricted admission finished medical school. It is therefore straightforward to assume similar rates of emigrants in the following years. This assumption corresponds to the idea that emigration among selected high -performers is systematically higher than amon g the not (or less effectively) selected students during the open admission period. Figure 126: Emigration of medical school graduates (2008/09 - 2012/13) Source: A dapted from Statistics Austria (2016) (399) . 410 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Board certification In order to practice medicine, graduates from medical school need a board certification which can be achieved after a practical medical tr aining program/internship consisting of 9 months basic medical training plus a minimum of 33 months (general practice) or 63 months (specialties) in pre -defined specialties and settings. It is not exactly clear how many graduates from medical school conti nue with a medical career in a broader sense. For Austria, OECD Health Statistics reports practicing physicians (including interns, excluding physicians working without direct contact to patients in Austria), but not physicians licensed to practice . Also a ccording to the Chamber of Physicians, the latter data are not collected in Austria. The Chamber of Physicians registers board certifications of physicians. Over the period 2010 -2015, we can observe a rising number of registrations for specialists, but a rather stable number of registrations for GPs (Figure 127). In 2016, however, preliminary data for GPs show a marked drop in the number of GPs, from 864 (median 2010 -2015) to 660 (2016). Some licenses to practice as GP achieved in 2016 might be added later because the respective physicians do not have their licenses registered at the Chamber of Physicians before they actually need it (e.g. during not pra cticing while on maternity break, or while practicing and perhaps also achieving a license abroad). We do not, however, assume that this effect will change the overall picture of a remarkable drop in the number of annual new GP registrations in 2016. Furth ermore, we should allow for the possibility that some of the registrations in 2016 are for persons who started medical school already before restricted admission, thus relating a constant number of 660 GPs per year to the fixed number of places in medical school is presumably an overestimation. We rather assume that 2016 signifies the shift of the annual number of GP registrations to a lower level, due to a combination of reasons: 2016 is the first year that graduates under the new admission regime on medical schools can achieve a registration as licensed physician in Austria (20 06 + 6 years medical school + 3. 5 years Turnus/ internship) . In spite of the large number of reform activities affecting the medical profes sion, GPs are still not recognis ed as specialists in Austri a, which reduces the incentive to choose this career . There is a high degree of dissatisfaction due to the lack of transparency concerning the internship in the practice setting ( Lehrpraxis ), including an insecure financing situation. Furthermore, there is some criticism that 6 months of training in a practice (out of 42 months) is not sufficient for independent 411 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options work in a practice. This again might draw some young physicians devoted to general practice to internships or even a career ab road. There is a high degree of dissatisfaction with the expected combination of workload, income and perhaps also appreciation during internship, especially when compared to internships abroad (this problem, however, is the same also for interns in specia lties). There are reports that interns could earn three times more (e.g. in Germany). And finally, there is a high degree of dissatisfaction due to the missing information about what work in primary care in Austria looks like , under what conditions, in wh ich teams, with which other health professionals in the near future. The combination of these reasons reduces the attraction of a career as GP in Austria. Figure 127: Number of board certifications by specialty group, head counts a nd median 2010 -2015 Source: Chamber of Physicians (personal communication), IHS. It should be kept in mind that some of these shortcomings apply also to the career as a specialist. The internship for specialists takes longer, and we do not have any data on the number of persons currently in internships for specialties. We assume that a somewhat less pronounced drop in specialist registrations will occur in 2018, compared to the drop in GP registrations in 2016. 412 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Retirement of physicians In 2014 following recommendations of the Austrian Court of Auditors (400) , a reform of the Wohlfahrtsfonds der \u00c4rztekammer f\u00fcr Wien reduced the level of mandatory contributions of active physicians and continued switching the basis of physician -specific retirement pensions towards the principle of equivalence, thus reducing the generosity of their retirement pension system. Also the Wohlfahrtsfonds der \u00c4rztekammer f\u00fcr Nieder\u00f6sterreich was reformed and contribution levels reduced slightly earlier. As some older physicians now expect lower income during retirement than anticipated before the reform, this might delay retirement decis ions somewhat. Physicians contracted by sickness funds can determine their contract conditions only to an extremely limited degree, as most conditions are laid down in general contracts ( Gesamtvertrag ) between the Chamber of Physicians and the respective s ickness fund. Until recently, retiring physicians could 'sel l' their practice including the documentation of their patients to their successors. The current Gesamtvertrag for Vienna and Lower Austria, however, stipulates that payments to the successor cann ot exceed 33% of the annual turnover. This regulation reduces possible payments considerably compared to usual payments for well -established practices before. This perceived 'income loss ' at retirement may further delay the retirement decision in some case s. According to AS VG \u00a7342, contracts87 between GKKs and physicians have to be terminated when the physician reaches the age of 70 years at the latest, but other regulations can be agreed upon to avoid undersupply. Summary of measures already taken to incre ase availability of physicians Restriction of admission to public medical schools reduced the average duration of time at medical schools and reduced drop -out rates to internationally comparable levels, but reduced also the average number of persons gradua ting from medical school . Opening a fourth public medical school (Linz) will make up for a fraction of this decline . A quota for national students at medical schools has been introduced . 87 This regulation applies to contracts drawn up after 31.12.2010, several sick ness funds added a phasing -out rule for older contracts. 413 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Changed regulations for the obligatory physicians' retirement funds and for 'selling' the practice to successors reduce financial incentives for premature retirement of practicing physicians, thus prolonging the active workings years per physician . Measures to increase the productivity of the available stock of phys icians88 While section 6.5.1 is devoted to discussing measures to increase the future number of physicians in Austria, this section discusses measur es to increase the productivity per professionally active physician. Ideally, productivity in this context would be meant as overall capacity to care for patients over the lifetime , but we cannot measure such a concept. We therefore refer to measures like patients seen per time unit for physicians contracted by sickness funds and working hours per person for physicians working in hospital. In this context, two groups of factors can be distinguished which influence the individual productivity: system -related factors and personal factors, see Figure 128. 88 In technical terms, productivity is measured in pure output/input terms, and does not take into account outcomes or quality. 414 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 128: Personal and system -related factors affecting the available capacity of physicians Source: IHS 2017. Personal characteristics The looming reduction of the physician capacity due to the age composition has only recently begun to fuel the health policy discussion in Austria. For instance, it was shown that the mea n age of contracted physicians89 rose from 53.1 years (2007) to 55.9 years (2014) (Hauptverband der \u00d6sterreichischen Sozialversicherungstr\u00e4ger -HVB 2017:28). The report highlights, that about half of all so -called \u00a72 - physicians will reach retirement age dur ing the next 10 -15 years (389) (HVB 2017:40). Therefore, retirement of physicians has come into focus, resulting in measures which might delay retirem ent somewhat as discussed above. 89 The report refers to so -called \u00a72 - contract physicians, which includes holders of contracts with GKKs (regional health insurance funds), BKKs (company health insurance funds) or SVB (farmers health insurance fund). 415 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Less is known, however, about the relative productivity of younger vs. older physicians in Austria. There is hardly any international literature on the relative 'productivity' of younger vs. older physicians. There are, how ever, studies on consultation length, which forms one of several elements of relative productivity. But this international literature is not clear on whether younger or older physicians have longer consultations per patient. In Slovenia, a survey among GPs found longer consultations for older physicians (401) , while a study in six European countries did not find any difference in consultation length between younger and older GPs. Furthermore, the study found that 55% of the variance of consultation length depends on factors on the patient level, with the remainder almost equally split between factors on the physician and on the country level (402) . Due to the lack of information in Austria, we do not incorporate any age -related productivity di fferences into our gap analysis. Referring to work in own practice, to the best of our knowledge there is no evaluation on whether the number of working hours changes when physicians reach retirement age or the end of their contract, how many physicians reduce their working hours only after they re turn their contract and keep working in private practice, and how many stop work altogether when reaching this point in time. We therefore assume in the model that starting at retirement age, physicians reduce their workload annually by 50% until they reac h the contractual retirement age. For employed (in contrast to self -employed) physicians, we assume that they retire completely at the legal retirement age. Even though early retirement has been quite common in Austria, Figure 130 supports our view of continued professional life after reaching retirement age for a considerable fraction of physicians in own practice, but hardly any employed physicians. We assume a conti nuation, if not a corroboration of this picture due to the recent policy changes which all in all made retirement more costly for physicians. 416 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 129: Age distribution among so -called \u00a72 - contract physicians in single -handed pra ctices, 2007 - 2014, excluding 2014. In addition to a de -composition by setting of work (in own practice or not), Figure 130 provides a decomposition by sex. We observe a high female share predominantly among younger physicians, and among those not (yet) working in own practice. Among physicians working in own prac tice, only in the youngest age group (up to 35 years) there are more women than men. Policy has responded to the low share of female physicians contracted by sickness funds. the current regulations governing the choice of candidates for the next vacancy a s a \u00a72 -physician in Vienna and in Lower Austria stipulate that in case of equal number of points, women are to be preferred over men. We have limited information about sex -related productivity in Austria. Whenever a physician wants to demand payment for a patient's treatment, the patient's eligibility is checked via her/his e -card. Taking these e -card contacts as a rough measure for productivity, we see that in most specialties, male physicians charge for a larger number of contacts per contract period than female physicians. We cannot say, however, whether this difference stems from longer actual practice hours or from shorter consultation 417 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options length or sex -related differences in treatment style. Psychiatry obviously is an outlier, with 39% more contacts for me n, presumably due to a female preference for a more time -consuming treatment style (i.e. more psychotherapy, less drug -only treatment). Figure 130: Practicing physicians by age and sex, 2015 Source: Adapted from (403) Figure 131: Average number of contacts per contract physician, 2015 Source: Adapted from (403) 418 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options System -related characteristics: Working hours In Austria, many stakeholders reacted only very late to the EU -working t ime directive limiting physicians' working hours to an average of 48h / week. This topic is mostly relevant for physicians in hospitals , as very few physicians with direct contact to patients are employed elsewhere. The Krankenanstaltenarbeitszeitgesetz (Act on working time in hospitals) allows under certain conditions, that for a limited time exceptions from the 48h -average can be agreed between employees' representatives and employers: Up to 60h/week until 31.12.2017, Up to 55h/week until 30.06.2021. According to a survey commissioned by \u00d6\u00c4K, actual average working hours among hospital physicians are already 48h/week, and 33% of physicians have signed an opting -out agreement (404) . There are, however, rumors that in some cases there was pressure for signing such agreements in order to fulfil - at least on paper - the regulations, or that predominantly young physicians were requested to refrain from documenting s ome overtime. Also the opting -out agreement will eventually phase out. We therefore assume that part of the adjustment process caused by the EU working time directive is still under way, but will not be a major effect. In our model calculations, we assume a further reduction of working time by one percentage point in 2016, 2018 and 2021 respectively, and a constant level of 97% compared to the base year 2015 from 2021 onwards. It has to be noted, though, that phasing out of these agreements might increase demand for physician capacity in times of high retirement rates among physicians. It is therefore extremely urgent to put measures in place to improve the productivity / capacity of individual physicians. Some of such measures are discussed in the followi ng paragraphs. System -related characteristics: Division of labour between health professionals The combination of unlimited access to medical schools until 2006 and absence of tuition fees at public medical schools has resulted in a high physicians/populat ion ratio in Austria, which among OECD countries has been exceeded by only one country (Greece) according to OECD data. The bottleneck at a prospective physician's career path was timely access to labs and other practice -related training forms, and especia lly into internship after medical school. Austrian hospitals and their managers could presumably take 419 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options advantage of the relative abundance of graduates from medical school: As supply was high, the ones filling the available internships were in a weak positi on and had to fulfill many tasks that in other countries are performed by other medical professions. We therefore assume that there has been a large (but to the best of our knowledge, still not quantified) degree of misallocation of physician capacity. This effect partly explains the Austrian paradox of high physician density and population -felt scarcity of physicians, accompanied by long waiting times for appointments with specialists in a growing number of regions and specialties. With the currently lower number of entrants into the medical profession, the traditional (inefficient) division of labour be tween professions is no longer sustainable. But it can be questio ned whether this constitutes a 'real' or an 'artificial' shortage of physicians, thus const ituting rather the necessity to re -allocate tasks between health professions (405) . Currently, many hospitals adjust to the fallen numbe r of newly registered physicians by re -organi sing work (e.g. new non -medical posts for documentation, newly organized procedures be fore operations or at discharge). To our knowledge , these are grass -root developments rather than a coordinated approach . Legally, hospital owners ( Krankenhaustr\u00e4ger ) are responsible for providing the suitable staff and skill mix, certain kinds of health workers are mentioned as necessary but without stating a required minimium quota . Human resources planning is delegated to 'suitable persons' in the individual hospitals or hospital groups, who annually report to the regional government.90 Also national and regional hospital plans (\u00d6SG, RSG) do not explain how the amount of necessary staff and their skill mix are to be calculat ed (406) . For the period 2006 -2015, a comparison of the develo pment of three groups of staff in publicly financed acute care hospitals ( Landesgesundheitsfondsfinanzierte Krankenh\u00e4user ) still showed the by far highest growth rate among physicians (15%), compared to all other health workers (6%) and non -health employee s (+3%)91. Thus, we see room for efficiency enhancing developments here, especially if sufficient transparency allows benchmarking and learning from each other. Unlike other countries, there has been no systematic process of creating or up -grading new profe ssions to support physicians (e.g. nurse practitioners, physician assistants), as has been the case in Germany, the 90 KaKuG \u00a7 8d. Die Landesgesetzgebung 91 http://www.kaz.bmgf.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Personal/4_G_Personal_LGF. pdf 420 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Netherlands, and UK. Also certain other health professions can work with more independence from physicians internationally, e.g. physiothera pists with respect to prescribing (407) . In Austr ia, some efforts were made, for example, by transferring the necessary educational path for some health professions from former 'academies' to universities for applied sciences, thus integrating the educational structure into the European Bachelor -Master system. Examples for these professions are physiotherapy, ergotherapy, speech therapy (408) . It is, however, not clear whether the perceived low esteem for other -than -medical health professionals could be also lifted in course of lifting the educational path on the academic level. A new law for the nursing education has been enacted in 2016. This law incorporates three supposedly permeable levels of education (one year/two years/ three years) and lifts the highest of these on the bachelor level. There is still some criticism that even in the brand -new law, the nursing profession is still very hospital -oriented and does not yet sufficiently reflect new roles like practice nurse, community nurse or school nurse. Several tasks that ar e planned for Primary Health Care Centers are tasks for specialise d practice nurses in countries like Australia, Canada, Netherlands, New Zealand, and UK, with comparable outcome and costs (IAMEV2016:122). But the newly regulated educational path for nurse s does not seem to incorporate these tasks into their realm, which might provide obstacles for the efficiency and long -term sustainability of the new form of primary care in Austria. Therefore, even though the concept for Primary Health Care Centers requir es nurses in the core team, there are still many questions open, for example, regarding their role in PHC, how they will be prepared for their role in PHC as opposed to hospital care, and last but not least the available number of properly trained practice nurses. System -related characteristics: Practice settings In general practice, Austria has a long and prevailing tradition of single -handed practices. There have been long discussions between the Chamber of Physicians and the sickness funds regarding part ly replacing single -handed practices by group practices. Technically, the law allows for group practices, but as physicians are under contract with sickness funds on a personal and individual level, and physicians are not allowed to employ other physicians , the creation of a legal framework that is attractive for many physicians has not yet been agreed upon. Difficulties seem to concentrate mainly on financial issues, but also on questions of liability. Therefore, 96% of all practices are still single -handed, as Figure 132 shows for physicians with \u00a72 -contract. Group practices are often formed when ol der physicians have sons or daughters who are also physicians 421 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options and plan to take over their parent's practice (and contract!) after their retirement: if they act as a partner in a group practice for a while, it is easier to achieve one of the few slots in th e 'Stellenplan '. Figure 132: Practice settings among so -called \u00a72 -contract physicians, 2014 Source: (389) Notes: spec. group practice = group practices with shared contracts, part -time contracts and other special forms. Includes general practice and a ll specialties, excludes dentistry. The predominance of single -handed practices is found all over Austria: In no Bundesland , the share of single handed practices lies below 93%. Special group practices are concentrated in Upper Austria and Salzburg, 'norm al' group practices in Vienna (389) . Summary of measured taken to increase productivity of physicians Reactions to accommodate the EU -working time directive were introduced extremely late. In most Bundesl\u00e4nder , negotiations betwe en (C hamber of) physicians and public hospital administration were started only one or two years before the transition period exp ired. The chance to better coordinate the skill -mix between health professions (including physicians) already on the educational level was largely ignored. The education for medico -technical professions like physiotherapist was elevated to the bachelor degree, which might serve as a means to improve cooperation between and acceptance of other health workers and physicians. Similarly, the compulsory education level for nurses was also elevated to bachelor level, at the same time introducing two schemes fo r nurse assistants. 422 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In our opinion, the raised educational level can form just one element of a necessary multi -pronged approach to improve such cooperation and mutual acceptance and respect. The health reform 2013 envisaged the implementation of new set tings of primary care, later defined as PHC units, which were planned to cover roughly 1% of the population in each Bundesland by the end of 2016, according to officially set goals ( Bundeszielsteuerungsvertrag Art. 6 ). This goal was missed, a fact that see ms closely related to missing clarity concerning financing, payment and ogranisational issues. Policy options: Demand and supply of physicians Policy options to increase availability of physicians To better cope with the rising share of women among physic ians and the increasing desire for a good work -life balance among both, male and female physicians, support measures to balance private life - especially care obligations for children as well as the elderly - and job demands. Considering the difficulties i n recruiting suitable physicians for remote areas, spe cial efforts will be needed, for example, in developing attractive models to provide out -of-hours care. Reduce ince ntives to emigrate from Austria. Provide clarity over the future working conditions as a physician in Austria. Make work at the start of the career as physician more attractive and more calculable, by offering working conditions (including payment, cooperation possibilities in teams, but also work -life balance) that is comparable to conditi ons abroad, especially Germany. This refers to the number of working hours during internship, but also to the payment. To reduce brain drain via migration at the transition between medical school and professional training as specialist, revise/improve tra ining programs and ensure that sufficient time for actual training - rather than care provision - remains for both, trainers and trainees. Check if working time directive compliance necessitates prolongation of training periods, especially for specialists who need also dexterity, not only knowledge. Policy options to increase productivity of current physicians Considering the low reputation of primary care as opposed to 'real specialists' in Austria, efforts need to be put into improving this reputation. Considering Austria's low achievements in primary care in international rankings (Kringos et al. 2013) it is worth checking whether additional training for GPs in order to fulfil their envisaged role in the new PHC units is necessary. Furthermore, a clear, well -aligned 423 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options and well accepted delineation of tasks between PHC units and hospital outpatient departments mi ght improve efficiency of service provision. We still perceive a lack of supportive health professionals for GPs and perhaps also specialists, who could free them from some workload in their practices, thus improving the efficiency of physicians' working t ime. The lack in supportive health professionals for GPs is not only an issue of quantity , but very much also a lack of adequately designed and aligned professional roles. Development of such professional roles (like advanced practice nurses, more respons ibilities for certain well -trained health workers) will necessitate that the physicians' job description will be redesigned, i.e. delegation of some relatively 'low skilled' tasks to other health workers, in order to enable physicians to focus more on core physician tasks, in hospitals as well as in practices. At the same time, this endeavor will necessitate that these professionals are adequately educated and trained. We do not see that the recently reformed nursing law already respects the special demands for nurses' roles in the envisaged PHC units, and therefore would support development of a clearer profile of the nurses' role in PHC. Obviously, professionals like nurses do not only need adequate skills, but also willingness to take over additional and responsible tasks. This includes also acceptance of the medical responsibility (where the task is suitable for this), while physicians need to be willing to hand over such responsibilities. To improve the acceptance of the new role by the involved professi onals, it might be helpful to involve all professions - not almost exclusively physicians - in the development of these roles. Seeing the large number of physicians nearing retirement age, we assume that such shifts in skill -mix in the overall health workf orce cannot be achieved by focusing exclusively on new entrants into the workforce. We rather assume that to some extent it will also be necessary to coach and motivate existing professionals to adjust to re -allocations of some tasks and responsibilities. Legal considerations Even though no particular constitution impediments have to be faced with respect to these options, some amendments to the professional law for nurses and similar groups (such as the Gesundheits - und Krankenpflegegesetz/GuKG) as well a s to the current system of contractual agreements would be required (see also Volume 2 - Legal Analysis (Chapter 7.4)). 424 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Demand and supply of physicians: inflow -outflow model In calculating potential future demand for and supply of physicians, we adjust a nd extend the inflow - outflow model applied for a gap analysis of psychiatrists in Austria (409) . We model three groups of physicians separately, general practitioners (GPs), and general speci alists92 (GS) and other93 specialists (OS) . for 2017 -2030. Figure 133: Inflow -outflow model for physician capacity in Austria Source: IHS. Data sources and assumptions - physician supply For physician supply, the Chamber of Physicians provided data segregated by age, sex, contractual status (exclusively employed physicians / physicians in practices: contracted and non -contracted), and medical field (general specialists: GS / other speciali sts: OS / general practitioners: GP). This detailed dataset was provided for the year 2016. Furthermore, the Chamber of Physicians provided the annual number of new 92 An\u00e4sthesiologie und Intensivmedizin, Augenheilkunde like radiology and lab medicine but also specialties with extremely low numbers. 425 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options registration as specialist or GP for the period 2010 - 2015 (GP: until 2016). For this info rmation, however, we have only a sing le number per year and specialis ation without any further stratification by age, sex, nationality, place of education, setting of work, or other characteristics. Measuring inflows All entrants were modeled as 30 years of age (GPs: 27 years) which is certainly inaccurate but does not pose any bias due to the short projection horizon. Sex of entrants was modeled proportional to the sex of medical graduates in 2015, which is close to 50:50. All inflow proportions are base d on graduates from public universities only. Our database does not include graduates from private medical schools (Salzburg, Sigmund Freud, Krems), which presumably does not pose serious biases as: (a) projections are retrospectively based primarily on ne w registrations in Austria, irrespective of the place of medical education, thus including graduates from the small94 Salzburg medical school: while (b) Sigmund Freud and Krems cannot contribute graduates from specialist training any sooner than in the las t two years of our projection period. For GSs95, the inflow into the pool of physicians was based on the median of observed registrations per specialty during the period 2010 -2015 ( Figure 127). Starting from this number, we model certain changes in the number of annual entrants: The introduction of strict admission regulation in 2006 reduces the number of registrations by 15% from 2018 onwards96. Taking nationalities of medical students into account, net migration reduces the number of registrations by 10% throughout our projection period (see Figure 126). Due to the envisaged promotion of primary care, we assume a shift of 5% of internship training capacities from specialist to GP - training. This is the only mere assumption which was not based on observed data. 70 additional GSs per annum are expected due to the new medical school in Linz from 2026 onwards. For these graduates, we assume the same proportions (sex, migration, specialties) as for other graduates. 94 50 students per year start medical school since 2002. 95 We do not calculate others specialists due to their heterogeneous structure and small number. 96 (median 2012 -2015) / (median 2002 -2011) = 0.85 426 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options For GPs, the inflow into the pool of physicians was based on the observed number of new registrations in 2016 (660) for the whole period 2017 -2030. In Figure 127, a sharp decrease in the number of new registrations between 2015 and 2016 can be observed, which we interpret as the result of the restricted admission to medical school since 2006. Note, th ough, that in the following years the number of new registrations might be somewhat lower since the observed 660 new registrations might include students who started before 2006 but could not finish medical school in minimum time. Further assumptions for modeling future new GP registrations are: An inflow reduction of 10% due to net migration. A shift from specialist to GP training places, increasing GP training capacities by 5%. Additional 57 new GP registrations per year due to graduates from Linz for the period 2024 -2030. Modelling outflows We do not have any hard data on outflow patterns; further, we cannot derive outflow patterns from age distributions of two consecutive years as we received the age distribution for 2015 only. Taking the - compared to o ther professions - late entry into fully autonomous professional activity into account, we therefore use the legal retirement patterns to model outflows. We do not model premature outflows from the physician workforce due to reasons such as migration, shif t to other work without contact to patient s, illness, disability, death . Because we do not model premature outflows, our projections might bias capacities upwards. As physicians often work in a private practice or with a sickness fund contract even after l egal retirement age, we assume that after retirement age, 'productivity' of physicians drops each year by 50%. We assume this drop in productivity starts at age 66 for men as well as women throughout the period 2016 -2030. Due to legal restrictions, we furt her assume that full retirement begins at increasingly lower age, starting at age 74 (2016) until age 70 (from 2019 onwards). Data sources and assumptions - physician demand Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to model true demand for physician capaci ty in the same way as economics textbooks would define 'demand'. Like most analyses of physician capacities, our calculations for physician demand are based on obser ved patterns of physician utilis ation. If current (or rather : most recently observed) utili sation was restricted by insufficient capacities, any calculated supply gaps would be underestimated. Considering that Austria currently still boasts higher physician/population ratios than most countries, we would assume that we need not worry about under supply for the base year on the 427 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options national level. Having discussed t he issue of demand versus utilis ation, however, we need to stress that undersupply can as easily be caused by wrong resource allocations as by low capacities. We have two separate data sourc es for service utilis ation in inpatient and outpatient care. For inpatient care , the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs provided information on the number of inpatient stays by function code. We model the future development of physician demand in the i npatient setting as depending on two factors : previous development of utilis ation, and future demography. The rationale for previous util isation as a determining factor is that existing capaciti es form an upper limit of utilis ation; thus also limiting futu re growth of the number of inpatient stays. Considering the high correlation between share of older population and number of inpatient stays, we assume that the number of inpatient stays (and thus demand for physician services) will pick up in line with th e increase in the share of the 65+ population in 2020. For outpatient care , the Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions provided the number of e-Card consultations at contracted physicians. We thus model the demand for physicians' outpati ent services in line with the past development of consultations and with the population forecast. To translate the demand for physicians' services into demand for physicians, we need to define physicians' productivity in terms of number of services or case load per physician and time period. We model these in accordance with observed productivity in past years. For future development of productivity, we adjust for two factors: First, the future stock of physician capacity contains increasingly more women, co mpared to the past. During their reproductive phase, women are more prone to absences from work and are protected by maternity laws limiting certain kinds of work like shift or night work. Furthermore, informal care work (child care, elderly care) traditio nally rests more heavily on women than on men, which might pose additional burdens on their availability for full -time work or overtime. Lower caseloads by female compared to male physicians are supported by the data on e -card consultations, see Figure 131. We therefore model female specialists with 0.93 FTE per person and female GPs with 0.85 FTE per person, while male physicians are modeled as 1.0 FTE per person. We apply this proportion to the outpatient and the inpatient setting alike. Second, the EU working time directive has not yet been fully implemented in Austria. As explained in 6.5.2 , we assume a further reduction of working time by one percentage point in 2016, 2018 and 2021 respectively, and a constant level of 97% compared to the base year 2015 from 2021 onwards. 428 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Results Applying the assumptions sketched above, we calculate projections for supply of and demand for physicians for two groups of physicians (GPs and general specialists) in two scenarios (Scenario 1: utilization in 2016 represents exactly demand, scenario 2: ut ilization in 2016 represents 3% undersupply). Figure 134 to Figure 137 show a graphical representation of the projection results. According to our projections, for the entire projection period (scenario 1) or starting from next year (scenario 2) there will be an over -supply of GPs which will keep gr owing throughout the projection period, amounting to almost 2,500 FTEs or about 21% of demand across Austria in 2030. For general specialists, we expect a far smaller over -supply, but only in scenario 1 and for about 7 years. For both scenarios we calculat e that supply fails to meet demand for general specialists in 2030, in scenario 1 by 9% (ca. 1700 FTEs) and in scenario 2 by 11% (ca. 2300 FTEs). Figure 134: Gap analysis FTEs 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 135: Gap analysis for GPs 2016 -2030, scenario 2, FTEs Source: IHS 2017 Figure 136: Gap 1, FTEs Source: 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 137: Gap analysis for general specialists 2016 -2030, scenario 2, FTEs Source: IHS 2017. Discussion It has to be kept in mind that these projections are purely quantitative and are calculated on the national level. Thus, they abstract from regional mismatches like simultaneous oversupply in urban and undersupply in rural areas97. Likewise, also mismatches between medical specialties are no t taken into consideration, for example, we do not ask if we will have a sufficient number of gerontologists in 2030. Furthermore and perhaps more important, we cannot judge in how far qualifications of physicians actually meet the qualification demands of their workplace and their patients' con ditions. The latter caveat applies not only, but especially to primary care. Another caveat applies to the setting of work. We calculate overall supply of physicians. For physicians with practice, we do not calculate separate models for contracted and non -contracted physicians, which can seriously affect their workload. For certain specialties, this problem is more serious than for others: 97 The issue of undersupply of physicians in rural Austria was discussed in the context of international best practice examples in Czypionka et al. (2012). 06000120001800024000 2016 2017 2018 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options for example, many women preferring female gynecologists do not find contracted ones with reasonable waiting times and therefore retreat to non -contracted female gynecologists (410) .98 Across Austria, 40% of all GPs and 63% of all specialists with practic e are not contracted. The high number of non -contracted specialists with practice needs to be seen in the context of typical working times in Austrian hospitals. In many hospitals, afternoons are not very busy, and many hospital -employed physicians run a p rivate practice alongside their full -time hospital job. This can make sense if they succeed in attracting patients with private insurance, who - if cared for by them in hospitals - can provide a handsome additional income for these physicians. Nevertheless , these physicians provide also outpatient care, even though their role in the excessive number of hospital stays per person in Austria remains unclear. We stressed already before that our calculations start from the assumption of more or less met demand in 2016. This assumption is made for technical reasons, which means that all interpretations regarding under - and oversupply are to be made with reference to the situation in 2016, and not with reference to 'optimal' supply levels. We are quite sure that we do not start from a situation with (overall) undersupply in 2016, but from a situation with significant misallocations in several dimensions: regional (urban oversupply, especially in the Vienna region, but also within Bundesl\u00e4nder ), regarding setting of work and presumably also contract -status, regarding specialties, but also regarding the overall health workforce, as was already explained elsewhere in this chapter. Monitoring and information needs E-Health in Austria Political and legal background Following international developments in the area of e -health, Austria has initiated work on an electronic health record system (elektronische Gesundheitsakte, ELGA) since 2006. The information system enables the electronic documentation of patient health records and facilitates communication between patients and health service providers. The aim is to improve the quality and efficiency of health care provision through a standardised documentation of information and prevention of duplicative care. As such, the 98 The question why in other countries a substantial p art of their work is included in general practice - thus a field with many women doctors - fits again the discussion of possible misallocations and problematic skill-mix. 432 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options application is of particular importance to the care of elderly and dementia patients, who experience increased difficulties in maintaining an overview of all treatments received. Therefore, a working group (Arge ELGA ) was set up by the Ministry of Heal th, together with the Main Associat ion of Social Security Institutions , the federal health commission ( Bundesgesundheitsagentur ) and the federal states, in order to conduct preliminary feasibility studies and a detailed planning of the project (411,412) . The collaboration between the federal government, the federal states and social security led to an agreement on the content and financial implementation of ELGA as part of the 15 -A framework treaty on the org anisation and financing of the Austrian health system in 2008, and was further substantiated in the Federal targets agreement ( Bundeszielsteuerungsvertrag ). The efforts culminated in the creation of the ELGA GmBH in 2009, an implementation organisation, wh ich is owned by the aforementioned collaborators (411) . To date, the ELGA project constitutes one of the lar gest harmonisation processes in the health care system to standardise the infrastructure and regulations pertaining to health data. In addition, the legal basis for the processing of electronic health data was specified in the ELGA Act in 2013, which cons titutes an extension of the Health Telematics Act 2005, EU Data Protection Directive, Data Protection Act 2000, Medical Law 1998, Law on Documentation and Federal Law on Hospitals and Cure Facilities, among others (411) . Implementation of ELGA ELGA GmBH The ELGA GmBH, established in 2009, is a non -for profit limited liability company owned by the federal gove rnment (represented by the Ministry of Health), federal states and social insurance (represented by the HVSV). The line of business includes the coordination and integration of all operative measures regarding the implementation of ELGA, the establishment of system components and support of pilot projects pursuant to the provisions of the federal health commission, as well as the quality - and acceptance management. The key tasks encompass the on -going development of the IT architecture and standards (includ ing standards that are in line with international developments), the overarching programme control over all necessary projects, the further development and control management of information security, as well as public relations. Therefore, the ELGA GmBH is dealing with the planning, monitoring and evaluation of all technical and organisational arrangements, including the monitoring of the individual implementation stages in accordance with the regulations and time schedule (412,413) . 433 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The financing of the company ensues in line with the agreement pursuant to A rticle 15a of the Federal Constitutional law on the financing and organisation of the health care system. Hence, expenditures for the establishment and operation of the central infrastructure are jointly borne by its owners and may amount to a maximum of E UR 60 Mio for the period 2008 -2016 (15a B -VG, Punkt 38 Article 30 Abs. 6). Furthermore, an additional EUR 41 Mio were allocated for the period 2017 to 2020 (413) . Implementation phases (1) In January 2014 the ELGA internet portal was set up, which enables insured persons to access, print and download their personal health records. In addition, the portal allows individuals to partially or fully opt out of the ELGA system, as well as to opt in again - either onl ine or via a written statement to the responsible authority. Furthermore, individuals can authorise and manage a health care professional's access, as well as duration of access, to the files. The authentication process to access the portal is done through the so -called Citizen Card ( B\u00fcrgerkarte ) or a transaction code via mobile phone (411) . (2) Following techn ical and organisational difficulties in the simultaneous initiation of ELGA across all nine regions, which had been foreseen for the beginning of 2015, a gradual phasing in was assented to. Given their previous advances in e -health, Vienna and Styria were announced to lead the pilot. Following, the connection between the affinity domains run by public hospitals, as well as nursing care facilities, and the central ELGA components was started in December 2015. (3) In 2016, the phasing in continued across the remaining regions, and by the end of 2017, all hospitals in eight regions are expected to be connected, except for Burgenland. (4) In the second term of 2016, the e -medication application testing phase was initiated in Deutschlandsberg, Styria. A full ro ll out of the application is expected by early 2018. Status quo To date, approximately 140 health care providers are connected to the system, including hospitals, nursing care facilities, physicians, dentists and pharmacies. This encompasses 100% of all p ublic acute hospitals and 90% of all acute hospitals in Austria. The step -by-step implementation across health care providers is specified in \u00a727 of the ELGA Act; it starts with public hospitals and care homes and continues to expand across pharmacies and physicians, as well as private hospitals. Dentists are expected to join in 2022 (414) . However, it must be noted that the intra - and extra mural sectors have a different focus when it comes to employing ELGA. The focus in inpatient care lies on discharge letters, while in the outpatient sector, it is the prescription of medications (i.e. e -medication). As such, there is currently no pr ovision in 434 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options the law that requires outpatient physicians to electronically store medical findings, similar to the discharge letters at hospitals. Therefore, gaps in the collection of health information prevail, also due to the fact that patients may decide t o opt out of the system. In order to proceed with the roll out of the system, a political commitment ruled that 80% of contracted outpatient physicians need to integrate ELGA functions into the physician practice -based software by the end of 2017. To date , the number of physicians having completed the integration of functions amounts to approximate ly 75%. As part of this process, to enable the expansion of the ELGA network across physician practices, the Chamber of Physicians has requested EUR 4,000 per do ctor in order to support the upgrade of the information system and software. Concurrent to the expansion of the system, an increasing number of ELGA patient advocates are taking up their duties at patient advocacy offices. By early 2017, already one o f five people in Austria (approximately 1.7 Mio) have already had contact with ELGA, while 3% of all possible ELGA users (approximately 260.000 people) have decided to opt out of the system. More than 4.1 Mio documents have been uploaded, which include physici an and nursing discharge letters, medication data, laboratory and image -based diagnoses. Further documents to be included encompass an individual's living will ( Patientenverf\u00fcgungen ), health care ( gese tzliche medizinische Register ), as well as a pathology report and a patient summary. Furthermore, the Minister of Health can order further types of information to be included in ELGA via regulations (414) . Currently not included is sensitive patient information that was noted and saved in a practice or hospital software, or information on health behaviours (413) . According to the Ministry of Health, data should only be ma de available in the ELGA system if it is of relevance to the present treatment of a patient, if it constitutes an important information basis for aftercare facilities, or if it serves the protection of patient rights or the improvement of patient safety (412) . Furthermore, a picture archiving syst em to store e.g. x -rays and other image -based data has not been implemented yet. Technical set up of ELGA IT architecture ELGA provides for a decentralised storage of health data by storing it at the respective sites of origin or so-called affinity doma ins (such as hospitals or GP practices), which are also referred to as the ELGA area (ELGA Bereich ). As such, the original documents are saved in so -called repositories that are found at the health care providers' practice or facility. In addition, there a re a number of central components that play 435 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options a role in the identification of patients and health care providers, as well as the management of access authorisation. A central database is also found in the e -medication application, i.e. the e -medication accou nt (411) . The technical implementation of ELGA is generally based on internationally recognised standards, s uch as those pertaining to safety (412) . The ELGA Act specifies that facilities need to store specific data in a specific struct ure, in order to render the data retrievable through ELGA, whereas it does not matter where the data storage is located. Even though the data could be stored in a single or two storage locations in the country, a decision ruled that each of the nine federa l states would set up and finance a storage site, in order to also establish an infrastructure for local telemedicine. By the end of 2017, all regions, except for Burgenland, are expected to have set up the storage sites and in addition, the AUVA and two p rivate providers have invested in their own data storages. As such, there are more than enough, if not too many, ELGA data storages to connect all health care providers in Austria. In practice, the system works as follows. In order to access health data e lectronically, a treating health care provider needs to enter medical findings (i.e. ELGA documents) into an electronic register. As such, an entry is recorded, which references the document and the location at which it can be found. This document registry only contains meta -data, as well as the links to ELGA documents, which are structured and classified according to the CDA levels (for further information, please see health data structure below). Other health care providers can then request access to a p atient's health records through their own software (e.g. Ordinationsysteme, Krankenhausinformationssysteme), while patients can request access via the online ELGA portal. These requests need to pass the Central Authorisation System, which uses unique patie nt and health care provider indices to confirm, whether (a) the patient exists and (b) whether the requesting health care provider has the rights to access the information. The patient identification proceeds via a Centralised Master Patient Index (C -MPI), which is also linked to the affinity domains. As such, the index contains both the demographic data of individuals and the record locator service that allows for the locating of the affinity domain that stores the health data. Similarly, health care provi ders can be identified through a Centralised Healthcare Provider Index (C -HPD), which constitutes a register of all health care professionals and facilities that have legal access to the health data (411,412) . The C -HPD is managed by the Federal Electronic Data Processing Centre ( Bundesrechenzentrum ). Please see Figure 138 for an overview of ELGA's IT architecture. 436 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 138: Technical set up of ELGA Source: Arge ELGA, 2007 Health data structure In order to render the health information usable across the different IT systems of health care providers (i.e. semantic interoperability), the documents and data must follow technical norms and semantic standards. Therefore, the Federal Health Commission has recommended the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) as the official document standard. CDA is an international standard for the storage and transfer of health data, based on XML, which also constitutes the reference standard for the public procurement directive of the European Union. As such, the CDA format allows for a standardised saving of documents that is accessible to all ELGA participants. This national harmonisation process of the health data structure, initiated in 2007, involved approximatel y 200 voluntary stakeholder representatives, such as health care providers and social security representatives, and constitutes a good example of coordination efforts to foster the nation -wide standardisation of content and technology. In addition, an ELGA reference style sheet has been developed to ensure usability, as CDA documents do not provide for any layout information themselves. The medical and administrative content within a CDA document are separated. For instance, the administ rative data is located in the CDA header, while medical information is saved in the CDA body. Currently all documents are standardised in an XML format. While the header information is fully standardised across all health care providers, some providers con tinue to embed the body content in form of PDF. With regards to the standardisation of the body content, the law Doctor (e-card) Data source ELGA Portal Provider index Patient index Authorisation system Document registry ELGA E-applications: e -medication, e -discharge letter, e -diagnosis (e.g. radiology), etc. Adaptor 437 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options outlines three different levels of ELGA interoperability, where level 1 is a reflection of the current situation, in which most providers conti nue to integrate body content in a PDF format. By contrast, level 3 specifies that all of the body content information is stored in an XML format. It must be noted that level 3 constitutes a prerequisite for the implementation of a patient summary. Meanwhi le, semantic operability can be further enhanced by embedding machine -readable data, which allows e.g. for single data to be imported into the health care provider's IT system and the automatic highlighting of risks (411) . Access to health data and data safety Health care providers generally have a period of 28 days, starting on the day of treatment or supervis ion (e.g. by scanning a patient's e -card), to access the relevant health data. The time period is intended for physicians to receive or read into additional information pertaining to the specific case and access can only be activated again in the case of r enewed treatment or supervision. By contrast, pharmacies are given a 2 -hour access to the list of prescribed medicines. However, individuals can modify these access provisions through their online ELGA portal, by either reducing the duration of access or i ncreasing it to a year (e.g. in the case of a fiduciary physician). Furthermore, as stipulated in \u00a720 ELGA Act, health data is to be de -centrally stored for ten years. In the case of e -medication, the storage of data runs for one year (412) . The protection of data and patient rights play a central role in the implementation of ELGA. For once, ELGA users have the opportunity to h ide and un -hide documents, such as in the case if they wish to receive a second, unbiased opinion, or to delete files entirely. Patients may always opt out of the system, given they are not legally obliged to save health data electronically. Furthermore, users can track any downloads or viewings of the files by health care professionals via a protocol system. Concurrently, health care providers may only access patient information in the case of concrete treatment or supervision of the patient, in order to prevent the inappropriate insight into user files and as such to protect patients' personal information (412) . The paragraphs 3 to 8 of the ELGA Act are specifically concerned with data security and specify necessary actions when required. For instance, the data transport is encrypted and the network security needs to be updated to the latest technical standards (413) . In addition, the storage system is decentralised and communication takes place via own health networks. To prevent the misuse of the system, high penalties were introduced, including fines of up to \u20ac10,000. 438 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options E-medication Another important part of ELGA is the e -medication application, which allows for the recording of prescribed and over -the-counter obtained pharmaceuticals in order identify and prevent contraindications and duplicate prescriptions (414) . Given that patients may be prescribed a number of drugs simultaneously and by different health care providers, which may interact with each other and lead to adverse events, the system aims to improve patient safety and quality of treatment. E-medication is an application (not a document) connected to ELGA, which offers an overview of all pharmaceuticals that have been prescribed and delivered to a p atient in the last 12 months. Similar to other ELGA applications, the information can be accessed by patients, physicians, pharmacies, and hospitals (413,414) . Furthermore, physicians can transfer the information into their own IT system. Therefore, it constitutes an important prescribing information basis on dosage , contra -indications and duplicative prescriptions, and allows for the electronic verification of possible drug -to-drug interactions, which can be particularly frequent during the simultaneous intake of OTC drugs. A database, which stores information on mo re than 13,000 combinations of active substances and their possible interactions, forms the basis of the analysis. The database also includes herbal medicine, such as St. John's Wort, that are known to interact with other drugs. The e -medication testing ph ase started in the second term of 2016 in Deutschlandsberg, Styria (411) . Prior to this, additional pilot pr ojects were conducted in Wels -Grieskirchen, Upper Austria and in Reutte, Tirol, followed by an independent evaluation by the medical university Vienna in 2012 (412) . By September 2016, the application had already been used by 11,000 people and encompassed approximately 57,000 prescriptions, as well as dispensing information on approximately 14,000 prescriptions and 9,000 OTC drug s (413) . An Austria -wide roll out of e -medication is expected by early 2018, however, the date may be pushed back due to delays. Policy options: Monitoring and information needs Identifying synergy potentials b etween data storage sites Currently each federal state, as well as the AUVA and a number of private providers provide access to ELGA data storage sites, which already constitutes a large, if not too large, number of costly storage sites that have the capac ity to connect all health care providers in Austria. Therefore, cost -effectiveness should be taken into consideration with regards to the number of storage sites and further site establishments 439 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options should be avoided. Instead, already established sites should b e evaluated, as to whether efficient use has been made of their data storage capacity, and areas of synergy should be identified. These evaluations could be performed by the ELGA GmbH, for example. Automated electronic prescribing and recall system for me dical adherence Currently not initiated as part of ELGA or E -Medication in Austria, an electronic prescribing (e -prescribing) system (EPS) enables health care professionals, such as physicians and nurses, to write, send and re -fill prescriptions electronic ally to a (participating) dispenser, e.g. pharmacy, rather than using handwritten or faxed notes. As a result, prescriptions can be processed more efficiently by reducing errors related to illegible handwritten notes or faxes. The system also allows for im proved control of prescriptions and reductions in time spent on prescription queries for health care professionals. For instance, patients could receive timesaving information on possible drug -to-drug interactions directly at the physician's office, rather than having to return to the practice for a renewed prescription in the case that interactions were identified by the pharmacist. Concurrently it enables dispensers to have better control of stock and to reduce the paper/administrative burden, while patie nts could directly collect (repeat -) prescriptions from a dispenser, without the risk of losing paper -based prescriptions, making the dispensing process both more efficient and convenient. In addition to transmitting electronic prescriptions, the system c ould be extended to include an automated recall system for patients to supp ort medical adherence. Similar to the already existent recall letter for the annual preventive check -up, a letter could be sent to patients if uncollected prescriptions were identif ied by the system. The letter would notify patients of uncollected prescriptions and may suggest further consultations with a physician, without naming the actual medication. As such, the recall letter could promote continuity of pharmaceutical care, while simultaneously ensuring confidentiality. The system could be further extended with additional applications that enhance convenience and continuity of care, such as the electronic scheduling of appointments. E-vaccination The vaccination status of resid ents living in Austria is often partially/not reported. Furthermore, documentation on immunisations, such as the paper -based WHO -compliant vaccination record, may get lost, in which case a vaccination database and electronic vaccine record may provide time - and site - independent access to information for both healthcare staff and patients. As such, individuals could obtain an optimised and more convenient overview of their immunisation status and vaccination schedule, while 440 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options preventing unnecessary or duplicat e immunisations and possible adverse events from drug -to-drug interactions. In addition, a recall system, similar to the existing recall letter for the annual preventive check -up, could be introduced to ensure continuity of the vaccination schedule and thu s ill-health prevention. Moreover, the introduction of a national electronic immunisation data collection system in Austria could improve the monitoring and evaluation of immunisation rates, which is currently based on a fragmented reporting system. Expa nsion of digital imaging and communications in ELGA At present, the ELGA database encompasses physician and nurse discharge letters, as well as laboratory and image -based diagnoses. However, a picture archiving and communication system to improve the utilisation of resources has not been fully adopted in ELGA, as the storage of image data is optional. Therefore, the creation of databases for digital images from different medical devices, including e.g. X - rays, MRI - and CT -scans, PC tomography and ultrasound , has the potential to improve site - and time - independent information sharing between medical professionals and health care enterprises, and as such to enhance operational efficiency. A structured representation of image data could facilitate the acquisiti on of image data objects from multiple sources and systems, in order to directly store these into ELGA. Concurrently, a digital imaging system could enhance patient care by preventing unnecessary repeat examinations, thus reducing radiation exposure for pa tients and costs to payers. Standardisation of the diagnosis classification system At present, the classification of diagnoses differs across different levels of care. For instance, hospitals employ the official WHO ICD -10 codes in order to specify inpati ent diagnoses. By contrast, outpatient departments use codes based on the so -called catalogue of outpatient department services ( Katalog ambulanter Leistungen, KAL ) and are only required to specify diagnoses in concrete cases, as stated in the law. Even th ough the cross -sectoral diagnosis nomenclature for outpatient departments (KAL) was recently initiated as part of the operative goal (7.2.1) in the Health Target Agreement 2013 (Bundeszielsteuerungsvertrag 2013) , it will take time for health professionals to get used to the new system. Furthermore, there are no defined rules on classifying diagnoses for general practitioners and specialists in the extramural sector. Therefore, the nomenclature differs across individual physicians, and notes on diagnoses may be drafted in the form of a general description, in Latin or a code (such as ICPC -2 codes). 441 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Consequently, diagnoses are currently only available for inpatient care, which comes with a number of limitations. Specifically , it does not provide for a detaile d overview of the patient's overall health condition, as hospital care is focused on the treatment of specific conditions that do not necessarily capture other health conditions, such as in the case of multi -morbid patients . For example, a surgeon is less likely to classify psychological diseases. Furthermore, elderly patients and those with de mentia may have difficulties recalling all previously diagnosed conditions by GPs and specialists. In addition, outpatient diagnoses tend to be more detailed and give an insight into a range of conditions that may have been diagnosed over a longer time period. Therefore, the inclusion of outpatient diagnoses may constitute a better representation of a patient's medical history and interoperability could be improved by standardising the diagnosis classification system. The latter would further allow for a faster search for specific diagnoses, in the case of the implementation of an ELGA search tool. Evaluation and monitoring of a patient's medical history The electroni c health records accessible via the ELGA online portal are currently saved in form of a chronological list. This list does not include a search function and users need to click on each file individually in order to get an insight into information. Given th at some patients may accumulate a large number of records over a longer time period, it is easy to lose track of information. The same applies to physicians and other health care professionals, who aim to make use of a patient's health data. As the body c ontent of the documents is mostly in PDF format, a patient summary or a track mode to monitor the developments of specific health parameters have not been implemented and there is a need to improve the usability of the record system for both physicians and patients. For instance, a patient summary would allow for a quick and concise assessment of the latest treatment status of patients, setting free more time during a doctor visits to e.g. clarify questions. Furthermore, a tracking system with a search func tion to monitor the development of specific parameters, such as blood pressure, may enhance patient treatment, as it provides for a more thorough overview of a patient's health status and needs. Alternatively, this task could be outsourced to the private s ector. The current challenges in monitoring and evaluating the development of treatment are also found in the e-medication application. Prescriptions are listed one by one and users need to click on individual files in order to open these. Therefore, a c ombined list of medications with the options to search for or track specific medications could provide for an improved overview to both patients and physicians. It must be noted however, that e -medication information is only stored for a maximum of 12 mont hs, which would 442 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options make it difficult to track long -term treatments and changes in dosage for e.g. chronically ill. Therefore an extension of information storage may be considered in the case of an introduction of a tracking mode. Expansion of data collection The present electronic patient record in Austria includes information on discharge letters by approved healthcare professionals, as well as laboratory and radiology diagnoses. Additional information approved for inclusion constitutes the living will of a patient, health care proxies and legal medical registers. As such, the database allows for an overview of the patient's medical history, however, does not provide further information on health behaviours, such as smoking, or family medical history, despit e their relevance to treatment paths and prescribing. A more extensive patient record could further improve patient -centred care, provided an insured person has expressed interest in the service. For instance, physicians could gauge patients' interest in t he sharing of information that is collected during the yearly preventive check - up, which could enable a more extensive monitoring of a patient's medical history and health behaviours and as such offer suggestions on interventions that are better tailored t o the individual. Immediate sharing of information on health care use Following a statutory mandate, statutory insurance carriers are obliged to annually inform their insured members about the individual's use of healthcare services since 2004. Since 2013, individuals only receive the annual letter upon an explicit request. Furthermore, an annual overview may not inform patients in times of actual information need. Therefore, providing information on health care costs in addition to the utilisation of services through ELGA's online portal could enable year -round access to necessary information for patients and prevent billing errors, provided this service has been requested by the patient. Dissemination of information on ELGA to health care providers For the moment, health care providers receive information brochures on ELGA, which, to the inconvenience of health care providers, may not always clearly and effectively provide information on the use of ELGA. An option would be to develop ELGA showcases t hat could be presented to health care providers, such as pharmacies, to facilitate and support the roll out of ELGA across as many health care providers as possible. 443 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Summary of policy options The ELGA project, including its application on e -medication, i s one of the largest harmonisation processes in the health care system to standardise the infrastructure and regulations pertaining to health data. Through facilitating the communication between patients and providers, the system supports the quality and e fficiency of health care provision, whilst preventing duplication of care. In addition, the e -medication app, which is based on a large database of inpatient and outpatient drugs (including herbal medicine), allows for the recording of pharmaceuticals to p revent contraindications and duplicate prescriptions. Therefore, the step -by-step implementation of ELGA constitutes a positive development, and one that is important from a European perspective, as many countries continue to face obstacles to the introduc tion and expansion of e -health. However, challenges to ELGA's full implementation remain, including the continued widespread use of PDF-based body contents as opposed to a full XML format, the complete integration of ELGA applications into physician pract ice-based software, and the different diagnosis codification systems across different levels of care. Against this background, a number of policy options were ou tlined in this section. For instance , synergy potentials should be identified between data sto rage sites, in order to make better use of current capacity potentials and to prevent the costly establishment of new sites. Furthermore, applications that facilitate the treatment process and overview for patients should be further expanded and developed, including an automated electronic prescribing system with an integrated recall system for medical adherence, e - scheduling, e -vaccination and e -mother -child -passport. In addition, the implementation of a more user - friendly patient summary, as is currently in development, is highly supported, as well as the expansion of digital image storage. A standardisation of the diagnosis classification system could further improve interoperability. In attempt to make further use of the system, additional patient data on, for example, health behaviours could be collected, while simultaneously the option to monitor and evaluate the development of specific health parameters for both patients and physicians could be introduced. Another possibility is to upload informatio n on health care use immediately, rather than sending out a yearly letter to the insured. Regardless of which options are introduced, easily comprehensible information on ELGA and its applications to health care providers should be further disseminated, s uch as in the form of showcases, to further promote the expansion of the system. 444 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Legal considerations No particular constitutional impediments have to be faced with respect to these options, apart from data protection issues that have to be considered. C ertain legal amendments as well as amendments to the current system of contractual agreements would be required, which might cause political impediments. Pharmaceutical expenditure and procurement Pharmaceutical expenditure Austria faces a situation that is increasingly common among the world's developed countries: rising healthcare costs, and related concerns over health system sustainability and affordability. Total spending on pharmaceuticals, in particular, remains lower than in other OECD countries (415) . In 2014 (latest available year), total drug sales in Austria equalled US$403.8 per capita (PPP -adjusted); this was lower than in 16 other OECD countries (416) . Per capita pharmaceutical spending, however, is comparable to other major developed countries, including Germany, Finland, Ireland, Belgium, and France (see figure below). While generic drug penetration is high in Austria \u2014acco unting for a large and growing volume of the reimbursed pharmaceutical market \u2014the available evidence suggests that branded medicine prices in Austria are high compared with many other advanced economies. We conclude by providing policy recommendations to h elp address this issue. Figure 139: Relationship between GDP per capita and per capita pharmaceutical expenditure 445 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Source: Taken directly from (417) Austria is experiencing a high rate of growth in pharmaceutical spending per capita. Among the OECD countries for which da ta exists, Austria ranks sixth highest in the compounded annual rate of growth (CAGR) in spending on medicines, with a 3.3% CAGR between 2010 and 2014. Notably, pharmaceutical spending appears to have accelerated over recent years: while increases in spend ing on medicinal products by insurance carriers increased by between 0.8% - 2.5% on an annual basis between 2010 and 2012, expenditures increased by 5.4% in 2014 compared with 0.9% in 2013 ( Figure 140) (418) . Figure 140: Change rates for expenditures for (419) 1.6%5.8%8.1% 7.5% 1.7% 0.8%2.3%2.5% 0.9%5.4% 0.0%1.0%2.0%3.0%4.0%5.0%6.0%7.0%8.0%9.0% 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Rate of change Average446 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options High rates of growth in pharmaceutical spending are occurring even as the share of generics in Austria's market continues to grow. According to a recent report, 52% of the volume, and 47% of the value, of the reimbursement market is associated with generic medicines (418) . Both figures have also risen steadily over time, suggesting proportionally greater use of, and expenditure on, generic medicine s (see figure below). 447 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 141: Prescribed generic products in the reimbursement market Source: Taken directly from (419) That a growing share of the value of the reimbursable market belongs to generics could owe to growing prices or volumes of this class of medicines. A range of evidence suggests that the latter is the predominant factor contributing to long -term pharmaceutical market value trends. First, while considerable price reductions have been observed in Austria between 200 5 and 2014, these have been lower than those observed in other major countries. Austria has, over the same period, witnessed a notable rise in the volume utili sation on medicines, though a smaller increase than that observed in several other European count ries ( Figure 142). Figure 142: Prescribed generic products in the reimbursement market Country (\u20ac/TD) Volume (TD/cap) Treatment cost IMPACT Germany -62% 153% -7% Impact of price decline > volume increase Decline in in overall treatment cost UK -64% comparisons and policy options Country (\u20ac/TD) Volume (TD/cap) Treatment cost IMPACT of price decline equal to volume increase Stabilisation of overall treatment cost Czech 33% Slovakia -63% 207% 9% Source: (417) Moreover, generics are slo wly obtaining a larger share of the volume of the reimbursable drug market (419) . Prices for medicines already on the market in Austri a have decreased annually since 1996, even as the broader consumer price index has consistently trended upwards (418) . Generics are also priced 66% lower in A ustria than the prices of originator med icines prior to generic entry (420) . There is evidence to suggest that this compares favourably with other countries in the region. In Finland, f or instance, generics are priced 59% lower than the prices of originator medicines prior to generic entry, ev en though generic entry is higher in Finland than in Austria (266) . These findings have led some to argue that the Austrian pricing s ystem appears to be relatively ' more efficient [in lowering] prices ' (420) . Although Austria performs well in extracting savings from generic medicine competition, off -patent effici ency in the generics drug market could be further improved when evaluated against a bro ader set of reference countries . 449 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 143: Savings from generic medicine competition by country Source: Taken directly from (417) . The Austrian experience in manag ing branded pharmaceutical spend is markedly different. Since the volume share of the reimbursable drug market in Austria associated with generics is high and continues to grow, rapid increases in total pharmaceutical spending appear driven in part by incr eases in the price of new \u2014branded, and increasingly specialty \u2014medicines. Indeed, a recent price survey of 60 high -cost medicines in EU Member States found that: 'For 80 percent of all 60 surveyed medicines Austrian ex -factory prices were above the EU medi an. For all 15 medicines of the survey that were attributable to the in -patient sector, ex - factory prices were above the EU median. Thus, Austrian ex -factory prices of the surveyed medicines ranged among the highest prices in EU context' (421) . Vogler and colleagues (2016) suggest that, in comparison to other European countries, the prices of medicines that are used in -hospital \u2014typically specialty medicines \u2014are rel atively higher than those given in outpatient settings (421) . For example, given hospitals purchase directly from manufacturers and receive significant discounts (422) . Research is needed to evaluate the impact on originator pricing from generic drug entry in Austria. Branded, off -patent originators must cut their price by 30% once a generic alternative becomes available for reimbursement in Austria. This stipulation for statutory price cuts however requires that at least one generic alternative enter the market, and is therefore not directly tied to pate nt expiration. Th is policy 450 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options context may incentivis e behaviours on the part of branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that are designed to restrict or delay generic drug entry (423) . It remains unclear whether branded drug manufacturers adopt similar strategies in Austria, and how this effects generic drug entry and originator drug pricing. Despite relatively high drug prices in the branded drug market, there is evidence to suggest that patient access remains strong, at least for certain medicines . With respect to Sovaldi (Hepatitis C drug) , IMS Health recently found that Austria had the fifth highest price for the medicine across 22 European countries, but also had the third highest amount of defined daily doses administered per 100,000 people ( Figure 144). Figure 144: Solvaldi uptake and price, by country Source: Taken directly from (417) . Procurement of pharmaceuticals: Tendering In light of rising pharmaceutical prices, governments and health care providers are increasingly concerned with ensuring access to and affordability of medicines. To achieve the goal of access and affordability, drug prices should reflect not only production costs but also their added social value (424) . Value assessments of existing and new pharmaceuticals through, for example, health technology assessment (HTA), price negotiations and tendering have been used as tools to achieve affordable prices (425) . 451 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The procurement process of pharmaceuticals is organised differently across Europe, which results in disparities in access to medicines (426) . Efficient and transparent management of procurement is key to ensuring cost-effective drugs are selected at the right quantities, needs are adequately quantified and product quality is high (427) . Tendering, which serves as a key mechanism during the procurement process, serves as a mechanism to stimulate competition and drive prices down to marginal costs of production (428) . The success of tendering processes is, however, se nsitive to a variety of factors, therefore, evidence of its impact on prices is not concrete (429) . This section introduces the concept of tendering and presents empirical evidence on its implementation across Europe. It highlights benefits of tendering, key legal and practical challenges and provides an outlook of tendering for th e future. Country examples have been from six European countries, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), Belgium and the Netherlands. Objectives of tendering Tendering refers to a concept whereby a payer (e.g. hospital association, insurance) p urchases pharmaceuticals on the basis of a tendering procedure, with the contract being offered to the manufacturer(s) offering the best bid (430) . Tendering can be used in both primary and hospital care, however, it is more common in the latter (430) . Tendering is used as a strategy for the reimbursement of pharmaceuticals as part of a country's social security system. Pharmaceutical reimbursement assumes the existence of a third -party payer at national, regional or local level who decides which me dicines to cover at what price and at what co -payments, taking various factors into account (431) . Public pr ocurement of pharmaceuticals is pursued by different contracting entities across Europe varying from governments, hospitals, and public insurance funds, for example (432) . In a tendering process, contracting entities purchase drugs from the manufacturer with the best bid, which includes criteria such as price, quality , reliability , and ability to service the ma rket (433) . Nevertheless, the best or lowest price is usually considered the key criterion. The manufacturer, or in certain cases (e.g. Germany), manufacturers, who wins the bid is then awarded the right to service the relevant market for a specific period of time (434) . Tendering is based on the economic theory that a firm sets its bid subject to its reservation price, the minimum price it is willing to accept for a product, which is likely to be close to marginal costs where the firm makes zero economic profit. Tendering thereby encourages close to competitive prices in the absence 452 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options of perfect information on firms' production functions (433) . However, it is important to distingui sh the impact tendering has on prices for generics and on -patent drugs . Specifically, tendering is more likely to achieve its intended effect (i.e. significantly reduced prices) within the generic market, given the presence of multiple manufacturers all of fering an identical molecule. In regard to on -patent medicines or those with market exclusivity, however, competition will be minimal if there is little scope for product substitution. In Europe, tendering is organis ed separately across countries (435) . The European Union legally regulates public procurement to ensure transparency and fairness in the tendering process and t o promote European cooperation in this reagrd. In 2014, the Eur opean Union implemented a new legal directive for procurement, the Directive on Procurement (2014/24/EU), which is mandatory for European Union member states to adopt into their legal system (436) . A common legal framework within the EU aims to improve efficiency through cross -border cooperation, for example, through joint procurement (425) . Benefits associated with tendering Tendering aims to reduce pharmaceutical expenditures in face of fiscal constraints by introducing competition (429) . Evidence from Germany and the Netherlands shows that in the short -run, tendering significantly decreases the price of generics leading to savings for national health insurers (437) . Tendering processes foster competition among suppliers thereby reducing prices to a level close or equal to marginal costs (428) . If the tendering process is managed well, it can succeed in drivi ng down prices sustainably without harming suppliers. Payers therefore gain power over the procurement process, which may limit price distortions caused by a concentration of suppliers in the market (428) . To ensure efficient and transparent management of the tendering process it is , however, key to identify the ' Most Economi cally Advantageous Tenders' (MEATs) (436) . This entails choosing cost -effect ive drugs, quantifying patient needs, monitoring procurement processes and drug quality (427) . When making tendering decisions, it is ess ential to consider the patients' interests and needs and not just prices . MEAT is part of the European legislative Directive on Procurement that states that both costs and quality need to determine procurement decisions (432) . When MEATs are successfully identified, tendering has the potential of reducing costs without decreasing quality of products. The scope of this benefit depends, however, on the implementation of tenders (424) . The organisation of tendering at a European Union level is of particular interest to smaller member states that otherwise lack bargaining power in the 453 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options tendering process but can gain substantial control over the procurement process and access to drugs through international cooperation (425) . Challenges associated with tendering Despite the potential benefits from tendering, the success of public procurement strategies in reducing costs without ha rming stakeholders depends on a variety of factors. One key criticism of tendering is that even though it may increase competition in the short -run, by forcing pharmaceutical firms to enclose their bids, competition in the long -run may be minimised. Specif ically, awarding a tender to one or a small number of manufacturers creates market power, which in long -run, may drive other manufacturers out of the market thus increasing supplier concentration (438) . For example, Germany has seen a substantial increase in market concentration of its top ten suppliers, w hich increases the risk of an 'o ligopolisation of the generics market' in the long -run (439) . The fact that on ly one or a small number of suppliers remains in the market carries an additional risk or supply shortages (428) . As was the case in the Netherlands, where s ubstantial gaps occurred, specifically, 3 -4% of preferred drugs were not readily available (440) . This effect depends par tly on the length of the tender, where l onger tender periods reduce the likelihood of other suppliers producing the product. This effect might hurt particularly smaller producers that leave the market as a consequence of not being competitive (438) . Price competition may also lead to a reduction in quality of the products if quality assurance is not monitored effectively (428) . The rapid decr ease in prices from tendering processes may lead to a shift in strategy for pharmaceutical firms. They may start specialising in areas with low price elasticities and smaller market segments. Tendering hence also reduces innovation incentives for preferred drugs (441) . Such general equilibrium effects may lead to the adverse effect of tendering of reduced supply of the preferred dru g and increased prices in the long -run. Tendering processes strongly depend on regulation and legal frameworks, the implementation of which is key for its sustainable success (428) . If the selection of products in the tendering process is not organised transparently and fairly and if there is discrimination among products in the selection process, this may reduce competition in procurement and lead to higher p rices (442) . Winning prices in the tendering process are not publicly disclosed. This lack of transparency in the tendering process is particularly critical in the European context and resembles a Prisoner's Dilemma (425) . Information asymmetries regarding prices between European countries makes countries reluctant to collaborate in procurement processes fearing that they would lose out on individually agreed dis counts even though joint procurement may lead to lower prices overall given the increased bargaining power of countries from cooperation. 454 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Outlook for tendering At times of rising health expenditures and fiscal strains, tendering has the potential to lower prices for both inpatient and outpatient medicine. From the perspective of public policymakers, it is essential to weigh both public and patients' interests by ensuring access, affordability and quality of drugs (436) . Incentivising innovation is another key rationale that needs to be promoted alongside price -reducing efforts. To achieve a sufficient level of innovation, research -based pharmaceuti cal companies should be considered in the procurement decision. It is essential to address the multiplicity of interests of various stakeholders in the procurement process. Tendering seems an attractive option for health insurances as it decreases costs s ubstantially. Manufacturers may, however, be disincentivised to produce generic medicines and innovate in areas that are particularly affected by tendering (428 ). Doctors and pharmacists are also key to the success of tendering. For example, tendering can impact patient -doctor relationships by forcing doctors to prescribe reimbursable medicines, which may not be the patient's preference (437) . The potential impact of tendering is subject to each country's regulation, thus policie s in this area must take potential negative implications into account (443) . Increasingly countries across Europe are turning to joint procurement, in particular, for medical countermeasures and orphan drugs. The European Directive on Procurement provides the framework for increasing joint procurement efforts. Joint procurement has the benefit of knowledge sharing, increasing bargaining power, preventing short -term supply gaps, and aiding price tr ansparency. Joint procurement is particularly beneficial for small countries, who are responsible for servicing a relatively low number of people (425) . Cooperation does, however, require effective communication, trust and commitment between member states, which can be supported by a well -designed legal framework for tendering (435) . International case studies: Procurement of medicines Netherlands In response to comparatively high generic prices, five health insurers in the Netherlands adopted tendering in 2005 as part of the Dutch Preference Pricing Policy . Tendering has since expanded significantly across the country. Tendering criteria in the Netherlands are primarily based on combination of low prices and the best offer. Pharmacists can enter into negotiations with insurers, which involves categories su ch as quality, medical 455 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options and therapeutic benefits and needs and further qualitative factors such as storage, supply conditions, payment terms and frequency of delivery (424) . Medicines are clustered according to active ingredient, dosage form and strength, and tenders are chosen accordingly (434) . In general, one company can win the tender a nd receive an exclusive contract for three to six months with the tender issuing company (444) . Evidence on tendering shows that competition increased resulting from the implementation of tendering and that prices of widely used generics collapsed. Prices in the Netherlands decreased by up to 92% compared to pre -preference policy prices (445) . This decrease generated savings of \u20ac355 million in 2008 and an average price concession of approximately 85% of the retail price before tendering (437) . There is no evidence that the market is more concentrated in response to tendering mechanisms due to e.g. withdrawal from the markets by firms. This may, however, be confounded by mergers in the pharmaceutical industry the Netherlands. Challenges fac ing tendering in the Netherlands include supply gaps, which was a result of inadequate timing between the announcement of winners and the implementation of the tender. For example, the drug supplier for pravastatin and simvastatin was unable to adequately supply the Dutch market for four weeks (428) . Addressing supply shortages within pharmacies resulted in costs of approximately \u20ac60 million per year and stro ng opposition to tendering, particularly by pharmacists (440) . Key stakeholders involved in the tendering process are manufacturers, health insurers, pharmaci sts and patients. As a result of tendering, health insurers have managed to increase their bargaining power, which has led to lower prices and expenditures. Pharmacists, on the other hand, oppose tendering given they have experienced reduced incomes, high transaction costs from complying with preference of nine different insurers, supply gaps and stocking issues. Given the impact of tendering on price reductions, the outlook for tendering in the Netherlands in strong. Specifically, fierce price competition , resulting from tendering, is likely to lead to additional saving for pharmaceutical expenditures. However, the success of tendering may be limited if supply gaps continue (440) . Finally, the effect of tendering on key stakeholders needs to be considered, in particular the remuneration model for pharmacists. One option would be to link remuneration of pharmacists to the number of packs sold and on the services p rovided, which is how it is organised in Germany (440) . 456 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Germany Germany imple mented tendering in 2004 under 'Rabattvertr\u00e4ge\"' which is characterised by fast up take and implementation (446) . Procured pharmaceuticals primarily include those in the ambulatory care, and are mainly comprised of generics. Through tendering, the contracting authority (sickness funds), have been able to increase their bargaining power (437) . The German tendering system relies on several criteria include quality, medical and therapeutic needs, and prices to determine the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT). MEAT does not presu me only one winner, rather up to three manufacturers can supply the market for a certain drug (428) . On average, the MEAT tender has the right to supply the market for approximately two years. Tendering was first implemented to lower drug prices that were not included in reimbursement schemes (429) . Pharmaceu tical prices in Germany are not published publicly, however, price reductions as a result of tendering are likely to be around 90% of the patent expiry prices and close to marginal costs. For example, i n 2007, rebate contracts led to a saving of \u20ac310 milli on to insurers, which is equivalent to 1.1% of total expenditures on drugs in Germany (193) . Tendering, however, has also led to market concentration, with a smaller number of manufacturers supplying the market. Specifically, concentration of the top ten German seller increased from 91.4 % in 2009 to 93.7% in 2010 to 97% until 2013 (428) . A reduction in the number of manufacturers, in the long -run, may led to price increases, however, evidence of thi s has not yet been determined (439) . Since 2007, pharmacists are obliged to prescribe the rebate drug unless the d octor specifically opposes . This right of doct ors to write 'do not substitute' on prescriptions potentially restricts the success of tender ing, particularly if patients are reluctant to switch medication (447) . Shortages also occurred in the German market due to logistic mismanagement (448) . The main challenge of tenderin g in Germany is the increased seller concentration and its potential impact on long -term prices. The fact that the German insurance market is dominated by one single provider, the AOK, which make up 41% of the total insurance market , further exacerbates m arket concentration. The AOK can determine stocking decisions and the concentration of supplier in the market (429) . Other than market concent ration, tend ering also increases administrative costs for dealing with rebate contracts, which potentially offset the savings gain from tendering (439) . These administrative costs resulted from legal challenges and litigation cas es that also increased administrative costs for pharmaceutical companies (439) . 457 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Since drug prices of successful tenderers a re only made available to sickness funds, the German pharmaceutical market lacks transparency, which is legally contentious (428) . The fact that individual sickness funds operate at a regional level and negotiate rebate contracts individually with pha rmaceutical companies exacerbates transparency issues (447) . An additional challenge to tendering in the German market is the fact that sickness funds have the right to provide a tender to three providers. The three preferred providers often differ in their sales force. This is often perceived as unfair competition and induces uncertainty to manufacturers about market uptake and penetration (428) . The impact of tendering on patient outcomes in Germany seems to be moderate. Seven per cent of patients and 11% of older patients reported problems (e.g. tolerance) with having to switch to alternative medicines in a survey of 2 ,500 individuals (428) . General practitioners report, however, that in 87.4% of all cases , patients experienced compliance issues when having switch product s (428) . This indicates that there may be information asymmetries between doctors and patients that prevent patients from switching drugs successfully. They key stakeholders in the German tendering process are sickness funds who are interested in maximising savings and the AOK as the main tendering body . Manufacturer s are guaranteed a ma rket when they win a tender, however, this win is subject to uncertainty given up to three pharmaceutical companies can supply the market. Manufacturers who are excluded from the tender may exit the market or shift manufacturing outside of Europe given the long tender periods in Germany. Pharmacists did not oppose to rebate co ntracts but still experienced stocking issues particularly with preferred drugs by AOK that needed to be stocked in large amounts. Patients did not oppose preferred drugs since other drugs included more co -payments and preferred drugs were discounted. The outlook of tendering in Germany potentially involves further cost savings. The increase market concentration can lead to a restructuring of the manufacturing market where manufacturer s redirect their research efforts to niche areas and stop producing prefe rred drugs. Manufacturer s potentially also shift their production to products, which are irreplaceable by generics. Abou t 80% of all drugs are sold as 'aut idem' meaning a doctor can replace prescriptions with another identical active agent. General equili brium effects may be problematic in the German market where in the long -run prices increase and supply decreases as supplier start focusing on areas with lower price elasticities (438) . Such adver se incentives would be contrary to the initial rationale of tendering to decrease pharmaceutical expenditure and incre ase access to preferred drugs. 458 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Belgium Tendering in Belgium was introduced in 2008 for pharmaceuticals in ambulatory care and hospital ca re. The focus of tendering was first on Simvastatin and hospital care including vaccines, specific therapeutic groups of pharmaceuticals , and pharmaceuticals for military and prisoner population. The main contracting authorities in Belgium are health insur ers, pharmacists associations, and trade unions (449) . Belgium issues tenders at a national level and is hence transparent (447) . The criteria for tenders inclu de prices but also further qualitative factors such as storage, supply conditions, payment terms, frequency of delivery and packaging. The winner of a tender receives a preferential reimbursement rate of 75% while other versions of the same drug received j ust 50% (449) . Tendering for Simvastati n was implemented in 2007 -08, which led to \u20ac 15 million reduction in costs due to direct savings on Simva statin, and to a lesser extent , indirect increase in spending. In response to the Simvastatin tender, physicians change d their prescription behaviour and switched prescriptions from Simvastatin to other medicines with a similar therapeutic indication that were not subject to the tendering procedure (447) . This adverse shift in demand increased total expenditures on statins by 6.5% thereby offsetting the savings from the Simvastatin tender (448) . Belgium experienced further legal issues with manufacturers since the regulation concern successful tenderer was initially unclear. Overall, tendering has been unpopular in Belgium since both generics and originator markets feared seve re losses. The key challenge of tendering in Belgium was the reallocation of demand from Simvastatin to drugs of equal therapeutic indication and resulting cost increases (447) . The overall budget impact of tenderin g in Belgium is ambiguous since marketing efforts were directed at high -cost alternative s of tender winners and prescribing patterns changed (449) . The Belgian case of Simvastatin illustrates the pot ential adverse effects of tendering mechanisms if they are not implemented in a well -established framework. Legal challenges and changes in demand can offset savings from tendering entirely (424) . Belgium withdrew its tendering policy for off -patent medicines due to its negative experiences in the Simvasta tin case (424) . France99 Drugs which are subject to market authorisation from the European Medicine Agency are subject to the following processes. First, They are assessed by the French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9, HAS), which provides advice to the Government on : a) whether the d rug should be included in 99 Information sources directly from D. Polton (2017). 459 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options the benefit basket and the level of reimbursement ; and b) the added value of the drug, that is, the drug's progress relative to existing treatments (with a score ranging from I (major improvement) to V (no improvement)). An economic evaluation (cost -effectiveness) is also performed for drugs claiming a high added value (I, II or III) and having a financial impact above a threshold. France is unique in that both the assessment and the appraisal are performed by the HAS and are scientifically drive. Second, the added value is used in the negotiation of the price by the Economic Committee on health products, that is, the Pricing Commi ttee. The committee is inter -ministerial, with members from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Economy, in addition to representatives from social health insurance and voluntary health insurance. Thus, the committee reflects different views about what should be a relevant price. Bargaining takes place in the framework of a four -year collective contract between the Committee and the organisation representative of the industry. One of the provisions of the current contract is that an added value of I, II or III leads to external reference pricing (specifically, using Germany, England, Italy, Spain). Besides the list price, the Committee negotiates managed -entry agreements (MEAs), which are essentially confidential rebates. Third, once an agreement has been reached between the Committee and the manufacturer, the Ministry of Health takes the decision to include the drug in the benefit basket with the list price set by the Committee. There may be an additional step if the drug which is being dispensed in i npatient care is very costly. Specially, under normal circumstances, the cost of a drug in inpatient care is included in the DRG system, that is, the lump sum payment by social health insurers to hospitals. However, for very expensive drugs, an additional payment is made on top of the DRG. Until recently these high cost drugs were appraised by a specific committee. Given the rapid growth of these expenditures, stricter rules have been issued in the recent years (i.e. only drugs with an added value of I, II or III, or drugs with a comparator which is already paid separately, can be on the list). This means that for a drug which has a modest improvement (IV) in comparison with a drug financed within the payment per case, the hospital will not receive extra mon ey if the drug is prescribed. United Kingdom Tenderi ng for hospital care in the UK has focused on the MEAT (most economically advantageous tenderer) approach since the 1950s , for both branded and generic drugs. MEAT in cludes considerations 460 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options of prices, quali ty, and medical and therapeutic needs. Low prices are, however, weighed more heavily in the tender decisions than other drug criteria in the UK. Procured pharmaceuticals include vaccines, pharmaceuticals against communicable diseases and pandemics amongst others. The contracting authority for tendering in the UK is the NHS. The healthcare system and the tendering system is very homogeneous in the UK due to the NHS, which can use its contracting authority for collective purchasing. Traditionally , tendering was mostly used for hospital medicines at end of patent life, bu t today is also used for general medicines earlier in the patent period (432) . Tendering procedures have led to cost cuts of around one third in 10 years without reduced access to medicines in specific pharmaceutical areas (436) . An example of such cost cuts are replacement blood treatments for bleeding disorders that were facilitated by increased technologies. A key challenge for UK tendering mechanisms in the UK is to ensure that it adopts the 2014 European Public Procurement Directive and complies with international cooperation in tendering , despite Brexit (436) . To incentivise innovation, it is essential that tendering criteria are not only based on lowest prices but also entail quality measurements as indicated in the MEAT approach. Centralisation in t endering is increasingly important in the UK system, which can result in cost savings and improved transparency. Norway Tendering in Norway is focused on hospital care. Procured pharmaceuticals mainly include pharmaceuticals defined in pandemic plans. The contracting authority is the National Procurement Agency that procures all medicines at a centralised level (450) . The Norwegian Drug Procurement Cooperation LIS procures for all publicly funded hospitals on a yearly basis. Tender criteria include criteria such as lowest price and best economic offer based on qualitative factors such as storage, supply conditions, payment terms, frequency of deliver and packaging (450) . Tenders are given to one winner. The public tender process involves a cross -functional group with representatives from procurement agencies, clinicians and technical staff (451) . The fact that pharmaceutical procurement is highly centralised in Norway increases buyer power and attracts new entrants into the market. Centralisation enables competition and circumvents problems of transparency when procurement is organis ed regionally. Centralisation by the LIS further enables cost savings since purchase and delivery agreements of pharmaceuticals are prepared jointly with state -owned hospitals (452) . 461 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options LIS tenders led to a price re duction of 28% on average for Norwegian hospitals compared to statutory maximum prices. Cooperation contributes to more efficient and better use of the medicines in hospitals (453) . The efficiency of LIS enables Norway to achieve lower prices compared to other European countries due to centralised tendering. Centralisation achieves more power for national procurement agency and Norway additionally implemented new tendering procedures (424) . Procurement of medicines in Austria Overview Austria's pharmaceutical system is character ised by the interplay of several actors. The Ministry of Health and Wome n's Affairs is responsible for reimbursement and pricing decisions within the country. The advisory councils and commissions in the pharmaceutical sector are also based at the BMGF . Figure 149 outlines the pharmaceutical system in Austria, which covers both the inpatient and outpatient sector (please note, this diagram has been ta ken directly from G\u00d6G). Authorisation and classification ( all drugs) The Austrian Federal Office for Safety in Health Care (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit im Gesundheitswesen, BASG) is subordinate to the BMGF and is in charge of granting market authorisation f or drugs, as well as classifying pharmaceuticals according to their prescription status. BASG sits within the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (\u00d6sterreichische Agentur f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Ern\u00e4hrungssicherheit GmbH, AGES). Specifically, within AGES Medizinmarktaufsicht (Austrian Medicines and Medical Devices Agency), which i s a subdivision responsible for the pharmaceutical agenda. A number of criteria are used to assess whether a drug is authorised or not, namely quality, safety, efficacy (as outli ned within the Directive 2004/27/EC) and the Austrian Medicines Act. AGES, in consultation with the Prescription Committee and the Restriction Committee (located within BMFG), has ultimate responsibility for decisions regarding prescription, dispensing re quirements, whether a medicine fulfills the appropriate criteria, as well as pharmacovigilance (i.e. detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse drug effects) (454). Pricing at ex -factory price level (outpatient) The BMGF, which receives assistance from the Pricing Committee, is responsible for pharmaceutical pricing activities. The Pricing Committee (see Figure 145), which receives support from the Pharma Price 462 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Information (located at G\u00d6G), is tasked with calculating the EU average price100 for pharmaceutical products reimbursable within the outpatient sector (Erstattungskodex, EKO) (using external reference pricing) . If the price of a drug is considered too high, the BMGF, according to the Price Act (Preisges etz), has the right to introduce an official price -fixing process. If the process does not begin withi n six weeks, the proposed manufacturer price will be implemented. Prices of drugs, which a submission for EKO has not been made, are notified to the BMGF. In this circumstance, the BMGF does not have control over the drug's price. Figure 145: Pricing Committee Role The Pricing Committee, which meets once a month, assists the BMFG in pricing medicines. Representatives The BMFG acts as the Chair of the Pricing Committee, which includes representatives from the following federal min istries: Economy, Family and Youth; Finance; Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management. Additional members includes, the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Labour, and the Presidential Conference of the Chambers of Agriculture. Law Activities undertaken by the Pricing Committee are governed by the Price Act (Preisgesetz). Source: (455) Amendments to the ASVG in May 2017 (made available on 24th April 2017) require the Pricing Committee to determine the EU average price within six months of receiving the application for inclusion in EKO (456) . The price is revised after 18 months, and again at 24 months. Despite entering into force in May 2017, changes to the ASVG have been applied to all new submissions into EKO since April 2017, with the exception of those in the 'No Box' category (i.e. where the manufacturer does not app ly for inclusion within EKO ) (described in subsequent section ). 100 The EU average price can only be calculated if the on -patent medicine is marketed in at least half of the EU member states, and in at least two member states for generics. 463 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Pricing at ex -factory price level (inpatient) For medicines outside the outpatient sector, manufacturers are free to set their own prices. The BMGF therefore does not have control over these prices, however, it is notified when prices changes occur or when a drug is removed from EKO (455) . Pricing at wholesale and pharmacy price level (outpatient) With respect to the wholesale pricing, the pricing is regulated by law and characterised by regre ssive mark -up schemes, which applies to a ll medicines. There exist two different schemes; one for medicines in the green and yellow boxes (see 'Reimbursement of pharmaceuticals (outpatient)') , and one for the remaining medication (as regulated within the Verordnung der (457) . For an overview of each scheme relating to wholesale mark -ups, please refer to Figure 146 and Figure 147, which have been taken directly from the PPRI/Pharma Profile 2012 docum ent authored by Zimmermann & Vogler (455) . Figure 146: Wholesale mark -up scheme for products within EKO's yellow and green boxes Ex-factory price Maximum mark -up as % of ex - factor price Pharmacy purchasing price (\u20ac) of \u20ac23.74 - Source: (455) 464 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 147: Wholesale mark -up scheme for remaining medicines (i.e. not within yellow and green box) Ex-factory price Maximum mark -up as % of ex - factor price Pharmacy purchasing price (\u20ac) of \u20ac30.52 - Source: (455) In addition, there are two regressiv e mark -up schemes which apply to community pharmacies. The first concerns 'privileged customers', for example, social health insurance carriers, L\u00e4nder, or not -for-profit hospitals. The second scheme ('basic scheme') applies to 'private customers', whereby an additional 15% mark -up is applied . Both schemes are regulated by the Arzneitaxe . As is the case for wholesale mark -ups, pharmaceutical mark -ups are staggered across different price brackets (455) . Pricing at wholesale and pharmacy price level (inpatient) Manufacturers launching a new medicine within a hospital only, are free to set their own price. The final price paid by individual or groups of hospitals (i.e. joint purchasing body , particularly for high -cost medicines ) is subject to a tender process (as previously described) (422) . Reimbursement of pharmaceuticals (outpatient) As previously discussed, drugs wholly reimbursable by social insurance must apply for inclusion within EKO. The final decision on whether a drug is reimbursed or not is taken by the HVSV, and is based on recommendations from the Pharmaceutical Evaluation Board ( Heilmittel -Evaluierungs -Kommission, HEK) (which includes representatives from social insur ance). Specifically, the HVSV must make a decision on 465 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options whether a drug is reimbursed within 90 days of receiving recommendations from the HEK. The HVSV is also responsible for publishing the reimbursement code (EKO) annually, with frequent updates made available online (279) . The EKO includes drugs that have been approved by the HVSV as being available and reimbursable by social health insurance carriers. Drugs within the EKO are assumed to have positive therapeutic effects on patients and can be broken down into the following groups: All new drugs applying for inclusion into the EKO first enter into the red box (\u00a731 Abs. 3 Z. 12 lit. a ASVG) which are then re -distributed to either green or yellow boxes within 90 days, unless price is also considered, in which case the time period can extend u p to 180 days . Insurees wishing to use drugs within the red box, must obtain prior approval from an insurance carrier's head physician. Finally, the drug will be removed from the red box if rejected by the HVSV. o The green box includes all medicines that quality for automatic reimbursement and can be prescribed by any contracted physicians (80 % of all drugs within EKO, as of 2015) (\u00a731 Abs. 3 Z. 12 lit. c ASVG) . Prices of medicines within the green box must fall below the EU average price. o The yellow box contains medicines considered to have additional therapeutic value. U nlike the green box, an ex -ante approval from the social insurance carrier's chief physician must be sought from the prescribing doctor (12 % of all drugs within EKO, as of 2015) (\u00a731 Abs . 3 Z. 12 lit. b ASVG) . The maximum price of a drug in this category is the EU average price. o The light -yellow box includes drugs which can be freely prescribed for certain conditions, however, prescription must be accompanie d by written documentation (8 % of all drugs within EKO, as of 2015) (279) . The maximum price of a drug in this category is the EU average price. o In addition to the 'boxes' outlined above, there exists a 'no box' category containing medicines manufacturers do not submit to EKO. For medicines within EKO, patients are required to pay a fixed flat -rate fee of \u20ac5.85 per drug packet, however, certain vulnerable groups, as outlined in section 5.3, are exempt. For non -exempt groups, OOP spending on pha rmaceuticals is capped at 2% of the individual's net income. 466 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 148: Breakdown of EKO codes by category (number of drugs) (n=5,002 in 2015) Source: Data based on Lesistungbericht (2015), HVSV In regard to 'follower' medicines (i.e. 'me too' drugs or generics) applying for subsequent inclusion in EKO, automatic price reductions are enforced. Specifically, The first follower must be priced at least 48% below the price of the original product The second follower must be at l east 15% lower than the first follower The third follower must be at 10% lower than the second follower. In addition to the above, the originator's pri ce must be reduced by at least 3 0% within three months of a generic enteri ng the market. Changes to EKO will be implemented from 1 January 2018. Specifically: The prices of medicines that did not apply for inclusion within EKO, will not be able to exceed the EU average price, given sales in the previous year were in excess of \u20ac750,000. If the drug price is found to be above the EU average price, the manufacturer will be required to pay back the difference upon requ est of a social health insurer within six months. If an EU average price does not exist, the manufacturer's price w ill apply on a provisional basis. For medicines within the yellow and red boxes (which cover most on -patent drugs), price reviews will be undertaken 18 months once an initial price has been set, and every two years from then on . The overall price reduction of generics will increase from 60% to 65%, while for biosimilars the price reduction will reach 52.5% Drugs within the green box cannot be priced 30% higher than the lowest -priced equivalent at ATC level 5 (458) . Green category 80%Yellow category 12%Light yellow category 8%467 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 149: Flowchart of Austria's inpatient and outpatient pharmaceutical sector Note: The Medicines Commission no longer exists. 468 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Reimbursement of pharmaceuticals (inpatient) As outlined in section 6.2, hospitals within Austria are reimbursed via DRGs (i.e. the LKF model). Reimbursement for medicines, with the exception of oncological drugs, are integrated into DRG lump sum payments. Oncological drugs are excluded given these medicines are classified wi thin their own diagnosis - orientated case group. Unlike the outpatient sector where a flat rate payment applies per packet, patients are not required to pay OOP for drugs (455) . No set list for the types of drugs to be offered in hospitals is provided. Rather, each individual hospital (or hospita l association) is responsible for developing their own formulary (455) . International collaboration within the pharmaceutical sector Rising healthcare costs and poor economic conditions have placed increasing strain on government budgets. Given health, including pharmaceuticals, comprise a significant component of public expenditure, there have been increasing efforts to reduce costs and stabilise spending on drugs. A popular method adopted by various European countries, including Austria, is to enhance collaboration with neighbo uring countries. Such relationships can increase economies of scale thus lowering transaction costs. It also provides countries with great er leverage during negotiations, which in turn lower drug prices. Although not considered a joint procurement initiati ve, in 2016, Austria entered into the BeNELuxA Agreement, along with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (459, 460) . The BeNELuxA encourages each of the aforementioned countries to collaborate across the following areas: negotiating drug prices, HTAs, horizon scanning, and exchange of information on pharmaceutical practices. The purpose of entering into this voluntary collaboration is to improve national drug security by ensuring sufficient quantity o f certain drugs at a fair price (i.e. vaccines, antivirals, antitoxins) (460,461) . 469 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: pharmaceutical expenditure and p rocurement of medicines Pharmaceutical expenditure Several recommendations are provided to help Austrian policymakers address growing pharmaceutical expenditures. These are either academic - or policy -oriented in nature. Please also see section on HTA, which also plays a role in containing pharmaceutical expenditure. Evidence on drivers of pharmaceutical expenditure The existing evidence appears to suggest that growing pharmaceutical expenditures are being driven primarily by increases in the price of branded medicines. Austrian health authoriti es should nevertheless prioritis e research efforts that are designed to further examine how different components of the Austrian pharmaceutical s market are contributing to growing pharmaceutical expenditures in the country. Such studies should examine cost and value trends for generic and branded pharmaceutical products, utilis ing unit -level pricing and volume data. Since medicines used in hospit als appear to be more expensive than those delivered through outpatient settings, such studies should also evaluate the impact from the prescription setting. This may involve quantitative, pharmaceutical pricing comparisons, with stratification by type of medicine and prescription setting, as well as availability and prescribing behaviour analyses that examine both the availability of medicines, and the reasons underlying pharmaceutical prescribing behaviours. Pharmaceutical prices are often given in terms of list prices, rather than transaction prices that are more directly relevant to payers and patients. Much of the existing academic evidence is in fact based on the former, raising questions as to how well it reflects the experience of payers and patient s. To the extent that it's possible, comparative pricing studies should therefore compare pharmaceutical cost trends based on list prices, as well as transaction prices. Policy initiatives There is growing recognition that external reference pricing (ERP) systems may incentivise initial entry in high -price markets, and delay or prevent entry in lower -income countries. This strategy may propagate high drug prices throughout referenced markets, and is further compounded by the fact that ERP systems often refe rence list prices rather than transaction prices that include negotiated discounts and/or rebates. 470 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options ERP systems should therefore consider the impact overlooking confidential discounts, which are now widespread in European and North America (462) . Austria should evaluate the design of its ERP system within this context, particularly since it s domestic ERP system , which operates within the outpatient sector, targets in -patent medicines that often have few if any competitors (463) . If they are to be used in the in -patent drug market, ERP systems should reference from a basket of countries that encompasses low and high pricing tiers. To the degree that it may be possible, Austria should also consider moving away from t he use of list prices in its ERP syste ms. This could be achieved by enhancing information exchanges with health insurance carriers in neighbo uring countries, particularly in regard to high -cost medicines. For example, through the BeNeLuxA agreement (as pre viously discussed), as well as the Medicine Evaluation Committee (MEDEV) of the European Social Health Insurance Forum. A move away from an ERP system may be of particular importance, given recent initiatives to rationalise spending on non -reimbursed medic ines by referencing against European average prices. Austria should consider modifying domestic regulations on statutory prescription drug price cuts so that they are linked to patent expiration rather than generic drug entry. By doing so, Austria may prev ent anticompetitive behaviours and increase efficiency in prescription drug spending. Finally, new medicines may not always bring additional health benefits to patients (464) . To increase efficiency in pharmaceutical spending, Austrian policymakers should consider the use of financial - or perfo rmance -based managed entry agreements (MEAs), particularly where there is uncertainty over the clinical benefits of new medicines. By providing a platform for developing special terms of reimbursement, these policy instruments can be used to improve therap eutic affordability, decrease any clinical uncertainty that may exist \u2014especially if coupled with stipulations for evidence development \u2014and, if linked with clinical activity, improve value -based health spending. Generic policies To enhance the role of gener ics in the Austrian outpatient pharmaceutical sector, several policies have been introduced. Namely, generic price links (as previously discussed), prescription monitoring by health insurance carriers, as well as educational campaigns for patients and pres cribers (465) . Despite these efforts, Austria is considered as a 'second tier' country in this regard, lagging behind countries such as the UK, the N etherlands, Germany and Denmark (466) . 471 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options It is therefore recommended that Austria consider implementing additional generic policies such as INN (International nonproprietary name) prescribing (i.e. where drugs are prescribe d according to their active ingredient as opposed to their brand name) and generic substitution (i.e. where prescriptions for branded drugs are automatically substituted for a generic, given one is available) . Generic substitution is the primary demand -side policy to enhance the use of generics in Europe, as evidenced by the number of countries in which it is compulsory or allowed (see Table 87). The pri mary objective of generic substitution is to contain costs by increasing the consumption of cheaper, generic products. However, it i s important to note that there exist other policies to enhance generic consumption, such as financial or non -financial incen tives for prescribers. For example, the UK, which has the lowest ex -manufacturer prices for generics and one of the highest rates of generic consumption, does not employ generic substitution, choosing rather to rely on other policies such as INN prescribin g (encourage, not enforce d), and incentives for prescribers (physicians and pharmacists) (467,468) . Table 87: Countries who employ INN prescribing and generic substitution Generic policy Compulsory Allowed INN prescribing France Greece Portugal Spain Belgium Germany UK Luxembourg Generic substitution Germany Sweden Spain Portugal Norway Finland Czech Republic Denmark France Hungary Italy Latvia Turkey Source: (467) Before such policies can be introduced, appropriate structures need to be put in place. Specifically, by increasing the role o f pharmacists to promote the 'safe, effective and efficient use of drugs', particularly for those with multiple chronic conditions (e.g. by reducing drug -related adverse events and promoting adherence) (469,470) . In the Netherlands, for instance, pharmacists are able to provide emergency prescription refills, renew and extend prescriptions, and change drug/dosage formulation. Furth er, England, which arguably is the most advanced in this area, also allows pharmacists to prescribe for minor 472 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options ailments (e.g. morphine, amphetamines, clonazepam) ,101 initiate prescription drug therapy, as well as order and interpret laboratory tests (469,470) . Increasing the role of pharmacists has the added benefit of relieving some of the bu rden placed on physicians who are required to keep up to date to changes in the EKO (e.g. changes in price) in order to prescribe economically (as outlined within the Richtlinien \u00fcber die \u00f6konomische Verschreibweise von 05). For example, INN prescribing could be handled solely by pharmacists. Advanced generic policies in the outpatient market can contain pharmaceutical expenditure. For example, without such policies, patients who are prescribed originator drugs within ho spitals are likely to continue using such drugs upon being discharged (i.e. within the outpatient sector) (465) . Procurement of medicines In addition to the polic ies outlined below, please refer to the section on HTA, given the role of HTAs in determining which medicines should be procured and thus reimbursed through social health insurance. Interface management The dual financing of healthcare also applies to pharmaceuticals where inpatient and outpatient drugs are financed by hospitals and health insurance carriers, respectively. This arrangement is problematic for many reasons, including: Fostering an environm ent that encourages cost -shifting between the two sectors, particularly for high -cost medicines (noting that this issue has been partly addressed by the establishment of the Medikamentenkommission (Healthcare Reform 2013) , who handles cases where inpatient and outpatient sectors cannot agree who is responsible for reimbursement; largely related to high -cost medicines) Poor coordination of pharmacotherapy for patients moving from the inpatient to outpatient sector (or vice versa) 101 Pharmacists can prescribe any controlled drugs on within Schedules 2,3, 4 or 5 (e xcluding diamorphine, dipipanone or cocaine 473 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Patient uncertainty given EKO and hospital formularies may not be aligned , however, in theory this should be the case ( as outlined within the 15a agreement of 2005 healthcare reform ; \u00a724(2) KaKuG ) (see Figure 150) (465,473) . Debates regarding issues arising from Austria's dual financing system, specifically in regard to its impact on pharmacotherapy, are not new. For example, Vogler et al. (2014) noted that there 'has been increasing awareness of the need to learn about hospital -related pharmaceutical policies and to improve the management of pharmacotherapy at the interface of the inpatient and outpatient sectors' (465) . It is therefore recommended that further effort is undertaken to improve 'interface management' between inpatient and outpatient pharmaceutical sectors (i.e. building upon strategies outlined in Figure 150). For example , by: Developing a joint budget for pharmaceuticals across the spectrum of care, however, as detailed throughout this report, this policy is unlikely to be implemented in the near future. As a first step, however, serious consideration could be given to a unified budget for high -cost medicines to avoid significant cost-shiftin g. Enhan cing the role of the Medikamentenkommission to include formal communications on all medicines, not just medicines which neither inpatient nor outpatient sector are willing to take responsibility for (474) . Ensuring information regarding drug prescriptions within in ELGA are digestible for potential prescribers (i.e. physicians working in either/ both inpatient and outpatient sectors) (refer to policy options regarding IT for further details). Figure 150: Projects to improve interface management between inpatient and outpatient pharmaceutical consumption Discharge letter Within the 15a agreement of 2005 healthcare reform ( \u00a724(2) KaKuG), when a hospital discharges a patient, they are required to take into account rules outlined within EKO and the R\u00f6V, as applied within the outpatient sector. Within the discharge letter, a comment that there is no objection for switching recommended pharmaceutical to a generic, if available. However, as outlined by the PHIS Report (2009) , failing to do so is not associated with a penalty. Hospital medical staff (Medical Service) 474 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Medical staff from social health insurance are placed within hospitals to provide assistance in regard to the provisions of drugs in the outpatient sector. This service aims to improve the transition of patient medical therapies between the inpatient and outpatient sector. Transition nursing (\u00dcberleitungspflege) Interface management is also enhanced by transition nursing , and case management coordinators. Source: (473) Summary of policy options for pharmaceutical expenditure and procurement In regard to pharmaceutical expenditure , the following three policies are recommended. First , efforts to build international relationships should be encouraged in order to gain a better understanding of transaction prices associated with drugs in the outpatient market (which currently relies o n ERP using list price s). Second , consideration should be given to modifying domestic regulation on statutory prescription drug price cuts so that they are linked to patent expiration as opposed to generic drug entry. Finally, to limit risk on behalf of the payer and to promot e efficient use of resources, the implementation of MEAs is advised. Further efficiency gains could be achieved through the implementation of more rigorous generic policies. To assist the implementation of generic policies and relieve administrative burde n from physicians, consideration could be given to enhancing the role of pharmacists, which would follow trends in countries such as the UK and the Netherlands. Example generic policies include INN prescribing, generic substitution, and could also extend t o incentives to encourage physicians to prescribe generics (e.g. linking payments to the proportion of prescriptions comprised of generics). Lastly, it is recommended that further efforts are made to improve interface management between inpatient and outp atient pharmaceutical sectors. For example, via joint budgets, enhancement of the Medikamentenkommisison, and ensuring ELGA is fit for purpose. Legal considerations Even though no particular constitutional impediments have to be faced with respect to thi s option, some legal amendments would be require d, for instance, pharmacists are not allowed to prescribe medicines themselves. 475 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 7 Public health and disease management Chapter 7 explores topics related to public health and disease management. Specifically, the chapter covers ill -health prevention, health promotion and health literacy, in addition to case and care management, as ways to improve patient outcomes. Health prevention, promotion and literacy Overview Health literacy is generally defined as the knowledge, motivation and competence to find, understand, appra ise and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health. By improving people's access to health information and their capacity to use it effectively, health literacy can play a significant role in the empowerment of individuals, improvement of quality of life and reduction of inequities in health (475 -477) . The following section summarises recent effort s in strengthening h ealth literacy in Austria and draws on good practice examples from the Netherlands and England. Health literacy in Europe The European Health Literacy Project Background Despite playing a key role in health promotion, t here is limited information about the status of health literacy in Europe (478) . The European Health Literacy Project (HLS -EU) was initiated in 2011 to address these information gaps. As part of the initiative, eight EU member states (Austria, Bulgaria, Ger many102, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain) took part in a survey to assess and compare health literacy competencies between countries (478) . The survey found that health literacy levels varied substantially between these member state s, reflecting health policy challenges of different degrees. Furthermore, the study highlighted a social gradient that needs to be considered in the design of effective public strategies. For instance, certain population groups, such as the elderly and tho se with lower education levels or social status, had higher proportions of people with limited health literacy (479) . 102 The survey only included the federal state North Rhine -Westphalia. 476 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Aust ria's performance in the HLS -EU Notably, Austria scored below the EU -8 average, with more than half of the surveyed population showing problematic or inadequate levels of health literacy in the areas of health care, disease prevention and health promotion (please see the figure below for an overview of the countries' performances in the HLS - EU). Specifically, only 9.9% of the Austrian study population had excellent general health literacy skills compared to the EU -8 average of 16.5%, and 25.1% in the Nether lands. Concurrently, 18.2% of the surveyed participants in Austria had inadequate general health literacy, which is significantly higher than the EU average of 12.4% and the Dutch score of 1.89%. However, significant differences also persist on a regional level in Austria. Findings show that merely 36% of residents in Vorarlberg had limited health competencies, as compared to almost twice as many in Styria (i.e. 63.3%) (479) . Figure 151: HLS-EU distribution of general health literacy levels across countries Health behaviours, health outcomes and health care use in Austria Limited health literacy skills can have a significant impact on health behaviours, health outcomes and health care use, which is also captured in the strong association between low health literacy and poor self-assessed health (480). Some of the detrimental effects of low literacy levels on health care use may be reflected in Austria's high hospitalisation rates. For instance, in 2014, 26,276 people per 100,000 inhabitants were hospitalised for at least one night, resulting in m ore hospitalisations than in Excellent HL Sufficient HL Problematic HL Inadequate HL477 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options OECD country (481) . In addition, the low health literacy levels may be associated with unhealthy behavio ural patterns. With only 11.5% of respondents reporting daily physical exercise, the rate is substantially lower tha n the European average of 26.2% (479) , However, in spite of the low competency levels in Austria, no significant deviations from the EU average were observed for a lcohol consumption and smoking among adults. By contrast, the share of adolescent smokers is signifi cantly higher in Austria than in other European countries. For instance, the relative share of 15 -year olds, who smoke at least once a week, is with 27.3% significantly higher than in other countries like Germany or Switzerland, where the share is 14.9% ad 16.9%, respectively. Figure 152: Alcohol consupmtion of individuals aged 15 years and older across European countries (litres per capits (15+)) Source: OECD Health Statistics 2016 Moreover, the share of men and women, who are overweight or obese, continues to increase. For instance, in 2012 17.9% and 9.7% of women have reported overweight and obesity, respectively, and the number rose to 10.7% and 20.6% in 2016. In contrast, the sh are of men, who are overweight, slightly decreased from 37.4% in 2012 to 37.2% in 2016, while the obesity rate decreased from 14.9% to 13.4%. However, compared to other countries, Austria has the lowest share of obese people in Europe (i.e. 20.2% of the p opulation compared to the EU average of 25.7%) and the average BMI tends to be in the normal range, with 45.5% reporting a normal BMI compared to only 38.8% in Europe (please see the figure below for a comparison with other European countries) (479) . 12.312.612 11 7.68 6.1 02468101214 Austria Belgium France Germany Italy Netherlands Norway478 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 153: Overweight or obese population (self -reported) across European countries Source: OECD Health Statistics 2016 Entities and practices promoting health literacy Austria With the aim to further promote health literacy competencies, some countries have established platforms and advisory bodies at a national level (482) . For example, in line with the National Health Goals and the Health Promotion Strategy, the Ministry of Health Federal initia ted, in collaboration with Health Commission, the Austrian Platform for Health Competence ( \u00d6PGK ) in 2014 (483) . The mai n objective of the platform is to support the nationwide and sustainable attainment of the third National Health Goal, which aims to improve health literacy in the population, as well as the framework conditions for it and the provision of information. Mea sures for the implementation of the third goal include the following: (1) measures to improve health competency among adolescents, people of working age and the elderly, with particular attention to vulnerable groups, were set up, (2) the aforementioned measures reach the respective population groups, and (3) the relevant institutions and organisations at federal, state and municipal level are connected in a structured form. In addition, the Health Target partners (Bundeszielsteuerungspartner ) have stipula ted that th e proportion of Austrians with 'adequate' and 'excellent ' health competences in the overall HLS -EU index should be improved to 55% (i.e. operative objective 8.3.2). As part of the overall framework of the health goals, it was promulgated that 50 % of the 01020304050 Austria Belgium France Germany Italy Netherlands NorwayPercentage of total country populationOverweight or obese population (self -reported) 2002 2006 2013479 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options financial resources of the Health Promotion Funds ( Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderungsfonds ) were to be used for prioritised goals, including health competency, for the period 2013 to 2016. The five key functions of the \u00d6PGK encompass the support and improveme nt of long -term health literacy in Austria; the fostering of joint learning, network structures, collaborations and exchange of knowledge; the bridging and alignment of measures between politics and society; increasing comprehension, knowledge transfer and innovation; and lastly, the development of measures for monitoring, reporting, transparency and quality control (484) . A prospective timeline until 2032 was foreseen for the \u00d6PGK, including regular evaluations of and adaptions for continuous development of the entity. For the year 2017, the following two areas were prioritised: qualitative written health information and quality of conversation in the health system. In addition, th e online self -information portal on health, Gesundheit.gv.at , was set up by the Ministry of Health to collate and provide an overview of relevant information on health promotion and ill -health prevention to the public. Information is available on healthy l iving, such as physical exercise, nutrition and mental health, as well as on specific diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Netherlands Similarly to Austria, the Netherlands have initiated a platform for health literacy in 2010. The goal s of the so-called National Alliance for Health Literacy are to improve healh literacy competencies and social inclusion (485) . The alliance comprises more than 60 member organisations that represent patients, providers, health institutions, insurances, academia and the business community. Vital parts of its strategy include the promotion of health literacy courses and training pro grammes among clients and patients. In addition, the alliance supports health professionals with identifying and addressing health literacy issues in patients. It is also involved in work on making written, digital and oral health communication understanda ble to the general public (485) . Notably, the Dutch strategy to improve health literac y involves multiple stakeholders. Besides the alliance, these include patient groups and the legislative body. The patient groups, which tend to form alliances based on specific diseases, are well organised and represented by an umbrella organisation for p atients (486) . This organisation has considerate negotiation power in relation to health care and insurance providers. For example, at an institutional level this is reflected in the negotiations regarding the implementation of patient -friendly measures between the patient councils and management of providers (486) . 480 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In addition to the active work and lobbying by patient groups and the association, legislation plays a vital role in strenghtening efforts to improve health literacy. For example, in the Netherlands patient rights are defined in legislation, which specifie s that health care providers must provide proper understandable information, e.g. regarding treatment (487) . Additionally, providers must receive a patient's approval before treatment can be provided. Legislation is continously enhanced through contributions by the patient - and consumer organisations. However, insurance providers can contribute to this development as well. For instance, health insurers can request in their contracts that providers pay particular attention to vulnerable groups and imrpove health communiaction, if it is associated with cost -reductions (487) . England Novel policies to foster health literacy are also underway in England. The NHS England and Public Health England have made investments in innovative projects to develop, test and implement a range of practical interventions to improve the former (488) . Some of these activities will include an evaluation of medical staff training in different setting s, as well as testing a module on health literacy in the higher education setting (488) . The NHS England also supports other projects in this area, such as funding the Health Litera cy Organisation. The aim is to curate a collection of health literacy resources in order to facilitate the access to information for practitioners (489) . In England particular emp hasis is placed on improving health communication. As part of these efforts, the so-called Information Standard Certification Scheme was introduced. The scheme aims to ensure that organisations produce evidence -based health care information for the public, which is clear, accurate, balanced and updated (490) . Furthermore, good health communication practiced by doctors plays a key role in helping patient s develop their health literacy skills (491) . Several studies have found that doctors do not necessarily adjust their communication, even though patients differ in th eir levels of health literacy (492) . Therefore, several concrete steps must be taken to improve communication between doctors and patients. These include, for example, making sure that doctors correctly establish the patient's level of understanding at the beginning of the conversation; speaking slowly, avoiding jargon and asking patients to repeat critical information ('teach back') (491) . Health literacy programmes for migrants and refugees Austria The clear provision an d dissemination of information could also play a significant role in reducing health disparities between population groups. For instance, findings show that persons with a migration 481 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options background living in Austria tend to report worse self -assessed health tha n native Austrians (493) . They are also less likely to make use of preventive and health promoting m easures. Instead, persons with a migration background are more likely to visit hospital outpatient departments than GPs or specialists (493) . This may be due to limited knowledge of the Austrian health system and access to primary care, language barriers, fear over discrimination, and lack of social networks, among other reasons. In order to improve acc ess to care for individuals with a migration background, 12 European countries, including Austria, have joined in a pilot project called The Migrant Friendly Hospitals Initiative . The initiative is a collaboration between health experts, NGOs, and hospital s with the goal to further create awareness of migrant -friendly, culturally sensitive health care and promotion (494) . It employs sim ilar culturally adjusted communication strategies, as described below in England and the Netherlands. Netherlands Given the similar concerns in the Netherlands, the Dutch National Centre of Expertise on Health Disparities (Pharos) focuses on strengthening the primary care system in disadvantaged neighbourhoods (495) . Concurrently, it also promotes the involvement of migrants and persons with lower education levels in patient organisation. Anoth er key focus of Pharos is fostering the safe and responsible medication use among migrant patients. For example, in collaboration with the Dutch Association of Pharmacists ( KNP), Pharos aims to complement pharmacist's guidelines in order to better equip pr ofessionals when issuing medicines to specific patient groups. This may also require additional education and training for pharmacists (495) . Furthermore, the Netherlands has gained extensive e xperience in special health communication for migrants and minority groups (496) . Policies include communicating health information, often in foreign languages, and employing information material, interpreters and trainers. One approach specifically designed for children with a migration background is based on making interventions and methods more culturally sensitive (496) . United Kingdom A similar approach has also been welcomed in the UK, as studies show that in order to make information more accessible, it needs to incorporate and consider culturally relevant idioms, references and visuals (480) . For instance, information on preventive measures is translated or delivered by persons with common cultural backgrounds. These initiativ es, like in the case of Netherlands and Austria, are introduced at the local level (495) . 482 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: Health literacy Improving the health communication between patients and doctors Goo d health communication practices by physicians are central to helping patients develop their health literacy skills. As patients differ in their levels of health literacy, it is important that physicians adjust their communications. Several concrete steps can be taken to ensure the former. For instance, ensuring that physicians correctly establish the patient's level of understanding at the beginning of the conversation, speak slowly, avoid jargon and ask patients to repeat critical information. The curren t evaluation criteria developed by the Chamber of Physicians already includes assessments on whether a patient can receive in advance information on foreign language speaking practitioners in a practice (1.6). Section 15 focuses on patient communication an d patient information, and includes for instance the evaluation criteria, as to whether relatives, attendants or other persons were made aware of the necessary information, in the case that a patient did not understand the contextual information (15.4). Th erefore, additional criteria that encompass the communication process per se, such as speed of speaking, avoiding jargon and asking to repeat information, could be introduced in the evaluation criteria or in contracts to ensure good health communication pr actices by physicians. Physicians could also be requested to pay further attention to vulnerable groups and where possible, cater to these by incorporating and considering culturally relevant idioms, references, visuals and information material in other la nguages. Ensure nationwide qualitative health information With the large amount of health information of varying levels of quality available online, patients may often feel overwhelmed or access unreliable, non -evidence based material, which may undermine treatment. Therefore it is important to introduce national information portals that provide access to evidence -based health and care information for the public. Several efforts have already been undertaken in this fiel d in Austria, including the set -up of an official self -information online portal and the \u00d6PGKs initiative on well -written health information. However, such information sites will only reach the right individuals if the written and digital information is understandable to the general public an d promoted across all various groups of the population. Therefore, efforts to render the information clear and easily understandable, while concurrently ensuring it is in line with the latest scientific standards, need to be upheld. Furthermore, providing additional language settings for the national self -information online portal, which is currently only available in German, could facilitate and increase access to health information for vulnerable groups, such as migrants. An additional option could be to develop a similar, interactive online portal for children and young adolescents that could be promoted at schools. 483 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Involvement of multiple stakeholders The involvement of multiple stakeholders constitutes a vital part to identifying those with difficulti es in health literacy and simultaneously ensuring, promoting and strengthening health literacy in the general population. One of the measures for the attainment of the third national health target on health literacy in Austria assesses, as to whether the r elevant institutions and organisations at the federal, state and municipal level are connected in a structured form. Therefore, the monitoring of the strength and maintenance of these coordination efforts should be continued and evaluated on an on -going ba sis. Furthermore, specific patient contact points should be further strengthened and promoted, such as patient organisations and patient ombudsmen, who could provide support and directions to individuals with difficulties in health literacy. Similarly, phy sicians play a key role in identifying individuals with limited health literacy skills and could therefore refer the respective individual to patient contact points, health literacy courses and programmes. At the same time, the role of pharmacists in estab lishing a patient's level of health literacy could be increased. This may require additional education programmes, such as case -based learning to teach pharmacy students health concepts and skills to manage patients with limited health literacy. Module on health literacy in the education setting The development of health literacy competency starts with primary and secondary education. Children and young adolescents may receive education on nutrition and exercise e.g. as part of a Biology and sports course s, however, topics concerning overall lifestyle and health behaviours and how these are linked to health outcomes are not cohesively covered. Therefore, an introduction of a more coherent coverage of this topic at high schools could expose children to healt h information and knowledge from an early age on, while ensuring that children across all population groups are reached, which could establish a solid and uniform health literacy knowledge basis. Summary of policy options The European Health Literacy Sur vey in 2011 has highlighted significant gaps in health literacy in Austria compared to other European countries. Since then, large efforts have been made to improve the health literacy competency across the population. For instance, the topic was defined a s a priority target in the 10 target controls and incorporated in the target control agreement, for which a project group was created to work on the quality of health communication. In 2014, the Ministry of Health Federal initiated, in collaboration with H ealth Commission, the Austrian Platform for Health Competence ( \u00d6PGK ) with the 484 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options objective to support the sustainable attainment of the third national health target. Furthermore, a national self -information portal was introduced to ensure nationwide access to reliable, evidence -based health information. Other initiatives include the Migrant Friendly Hospitals Initiative, which employs e.g. culturally adjusted communication strategies to facilitate access to care for individuals with a migration background. Following the introduction of these initiatives, an upcoming health literacy survey (HLS -Neu) is planned to evaluate as to whether these efforts have had an effect on health literacy levels in Austria. Although important developments have already taken place in Austria, the following additional practices are suggested to support the attainment of higher literacy levels. (1) Clear health communication between patients and doctors could be further improved by specifying explicit criteria pertaining to the commu nication process (e.g. 'teach back'; avoiding jargon) in the Chamber of Physician's quality evaluation criteria of physician practices. (2) In order to further expand the dissemination of health information, the national self -information portal could offer a number of additional language settings, other than German, and a child -friendly information site could be developed as well. (3) The role of various stakeholders in promoting health literacy should be increased. For instance, a point of contact for patients with limited health literacy levels should be defined to offer trainings and s upport, such as patient ombudsperson offices, while physicians could direct the respective patients to these contact points. Pharmacists could be further trained to identify and manage patients with lower literacy levels. (4) Last, a module on health liter acy in the education setting could be introduced. Legal considerations No particular constitutional impediments have to be faced with respect to these options. Disease prevention Overview Disease prevention focuses on prevention strategies to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases and other morbidities. There are three levels of prevention, which differ in the point in time when the preventive intervention takes place: primary preve ntion is initiated prior to the onset of a disease and is aimed at assisting in the elimination of health -damaging factors. For example, measures relate to hygiene, vaccinations, or preventive measures during pregnancy. By contrast, secondary prevention is focused on intervening existing health -damaging situations. Procedures in the area of secondary prevention include, 485 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options for example, the detection and treatment of pre -clinical pathological changes. Tertiary prevention concentrates on restoring health after t he medical condition occurred and hence refers to the management of long -term or on -going illnesses to avoid re -hospitalisation. As a result of tertiary prevention, consequential health -damages may be prevented and the rehabilitation of patients facilitate d103. Therefore, disease prevention plays an important role in supporting the general public health, whilst decreasing costs of preventable disease burdens. Based on WHO data (2014) on country -specific proportional mortality from preventable chronic disease s as a percentage of total deaths, and by comparing Austria's performance to other European countries, the following section has identified two key areas that require further attention. These include the disease prevention of cardiovascular diseases and di abetes, as highlighted in the table below. Furthermore, with regards to the prevention of infectious diseases, a comparison of childhood vaccination rates has revealed notably lower rates in Austria than in other European countries that can lead to prevent able burdens of disease. Therefore, this section will provide an overview of vaccination -preventable disease -, diabetes - and cardiovascular care in Austria and will outline policy options to improve performance in these areas. Table 88: Country -specific proportional mortality as a percentage of total deaths across European countries (498) Proportional mortality (% of total deaths, all ages, both sexes) Austria Belgium France Germany Italy Netherlands Norway UK Cardiovascular diseases Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Proportional mortality (% of total deaths, all ages, both sexes) Austria Belgium France Germany Italy Netherlands Norway UK Communicable, maternal, perinatal, Profiles, 2014 Vaccine -preventable diseases Vaccines are one of the most cost -effective strategies to prevent infectious diseases in populations (499) . Globally, an estimated 2 -3 million lives are saved each year as a result of vaccines (500) . Many developed countries have implemented robust child vaccination programmes and initiatives, and comprehensive vaccination coverage in childhood constitutes a main indicator for public health (501,502) . As immunisations play an important role in promoting public health, sever al countries have introduced policies to ensure or support vaccinations of children. These can either address the demand side, i.e. child's caretakers, or the supply side, including health care providers. For instance, in Germany a new proposal was passed to make kindergartens inform authorities, if parents fail to prove they have attended a doctors' consultation on child vaccinations. To date, authorities can already impose a fine of 2,500 euros on parents who persistently refuse to attend the vaccine cons ultations (503) . A more stringent approach was taken in Italy, where children must be vaccinated against 12 common illnesses before they can enrol in public schools. If children are not vaccinated by the age of six, which is the school starting age, their parents will be fined (504) . By contrast, the UK has shifted the focus from caretakers to health care providers. As part of the mass childhood immunisation programme (MCI), GPs receive payment for childhood immunisation through the PCT global sum and an additional target payment. More specifically, GPs receive a higher paymen t if they immunise 90% of all the children on the partnership list who are aged two. Lower payment is received if the average of courses completed is 70%, whilst there are no 487 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options payments for any target below 70% (505) . In comparison, no demand - and supply -side policies have been implemented in Austria to date, which is reflected in the relatively lower childhood vaccination rates. Immunisation rates in Austria Childhood immunisations In comparison to other OECD countries, childhood immunisation rates are noticeably lower in Au stria, which may be due to factors such as vaccine refusal due to personal beliefs and hesitancy, as well as barriers within the health care system (502) . The low rates are particularly evident in the case of immunisations against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP). For instance, in almost all OECD countries the proportion of one -year olds, who have received three doses of the combined DTP vaccine within the recommended timeframe, are greater than 90%, and in most countries the rates are equal to or above 95%. Merely three countries, namely Austria, Iceland and Mexico, reported vac cination rates at or below 90%, with Austria reporting the lowest rate at 83%, as shown in Figure 154 (506) . Figure 154: Childhood vaccination rates (%) for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) among one -year olds across a number of European countries (506) Source: OECD Health Statistics, 2016 The comparatively low rate for measles vaccines in Austria is particularly outstanding. Even though vaccination rates for measles immunisations tend to be marginally lower than those for DTP, which may be due to concerns about possible associations between measles vaccinations and brain damage, all OECD countries, except for Austria, Denmark, France, Ic eland and Italy, report rates that are above 90% or at least 95%. In fact, the proportion of children under the age of one, who have received at least one dose of measles -containing vaccine, is merely 76% in Austria, as depicted in Figure 155 (506) . 99 99 99 96 95 83 0102030405060708090100 Belgium France Poland Germany UK AustriaPercentage of children vaccinated488 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 155: Proportion (%) of children under the age of one, who have received at least one dose of measles -containing vaccine (506) Source: OECD Health Statistics, 2016 Immunisation programme in Austria Vaccination facilities and vaccine production There are no dedicated vaccination facilities ( Impfservice der Gesundheits\u00e4mter ) in Austria, except for the regional and district public health centres, which are primarily located in larger cities. These centres are de-centralised and may differ in the types of vaccines offered. Furthermore, units at these centres tend to be small, with only few people making use of these centres. Generally, vaccines are admin istered by doctors or pediatricians in their private practices. Most pediatric physicians store vaccines at their practice, given the predictable use of specific childhood vaccines. However, this is not necessarily the case for general practitioners treat ing adults. Except in the case of influenza vaccines, as some practices may buy these in stock during specific season, adults must usually make an appointment with a GP to first receive a prescription for a vaccine, which subsequently needs to be redeemed at a pharmacy, before being administered the vaccine during a second appointment at the physician practice. Contrary to recent international developments (507) , community pharmacies do not provide walk in vaccination services. Only a limited number of vaccines are produced in Austria, such as the vaccine against tick -borne encephalitis. However, there is no national vaccination company in Austria. 98 97 96 969390 76 0102030405060708090100 Poland Germany Belgium Netherlands UK France AustriaPercentage of children vaccinated489 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Coverage of vaccines The vaccination programme for children is organised within the public health setting and financed by the federal government, the federal states and social insurance funds, which share the costs of vaccines. As such, all childhood vac cines, as well as the physician service, are free of charge for children up to the age of 15. The general coverage for childhood vaccinations is relatively homogenous, except for in the case of the vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). In the c ase of adults, only the physician service is free of charge, not the actual vaccine. Vaccination schedules A national vaccination plan for the year 2017 has been defined and updated with the aim to provide physicians and those considering vaccinations a clearer overview of the recommended vaccines. This includes a special vaccination schedule for childhood vaccinations, which applies to all regions. In the case of adults, there exist guidelines for booster vaccinations. Furthermore, guidelines for travel -related vaccinations based on travel region and current risk are published as well. An advisory vaccination schedule is developed annually by the Highest Sanitary Council ( Nationaler Impfgremium ). In consideration of the advice, which is generally accept ed, the Ministry of Health publishes the official vaccination schedule, which is followed by all nine regions. Documentation of vaccination rates The regional level is given the task to provide vaccination coverage data to the national level, which is subsequently analysed and published. However, the vaccination status of residents living in Austria is often partially or not reported, and documentation may get lost. A nationwide, uniform collection of data has not been implemented yet. Policy options: V accinations Inclusion of vaccinations in the mother -child passport The Austrian mother -child passport ( Mutter -Kind Pass ) supports health -related prevention for pregnant women and young children up to the age of 5 years by outlining all recommended and impo rtant check - ups, and is accessible to all pregnant female residents living in Austria. Following a successful completion of a number of the listed check -ups, families are eligible for a mother -child allowance ( Mutter -Kind - Zuschuss ). Currently, the passport does not include recommended childhood vaccinations. By adding a number of recommended vaccinations to the list of services, more families may become aware of 490 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options important vaccines and feel incentivised to immunise children, which could increase the overall rate of the currently low childhood vaccination rates in Austria. Coverage of cost -effective vaccines for adults While both the immunisation and related physician service are covered by health insurance for children up to the age of 15 in Austria, in the case of adults, only the treatment by a physician, not the vaccine, is reimbursed. Therefore, an additional coverage of adult vaccinations, where cost -effective, could potentially increase adult immunisation rates of a number of important vaccine -preventa ble diseases. Introduction of vaccinations at pharmacies Most pediatric physicians store vaccines at their practice, given the predictable use of specific childhood vaccines. However, this is not necessarily the case for general practitioners treating adu lts. Except in the case of influenza vaccines, which some practices may buy in stock during specific season, adults must usually make an appointment with a GP to first receive a prescription for a vaccine. Following, individuals need to buy the vaccine at the pharmacy and return to the GP for a second appointment, during which the vaccine is injected - a process that is time intensive and inconvenient to many individuals. Against this background, an increasing number of countries have started to offer walk in vaccination services at pharmacies (507) . Therefore, by introducing walk in vaccination and injection services at community pharmacies, follo wing a prescription by a physician, the immunisation process could be rendered more flexible, time -saving and convenient to patients. E-vaccination to improv e monitoring and re -calling of - as well as data collection on - vaccinations The vaccination status of residents living in Austria is often partially or not reported. Furthermore, documentation on immunisations, such as the paper -based WHO -compliant vaccination record, may get lost, in which case a vaccination database and electroni c vaccine record may provide time - and site - independent access to information for both healthcare staff and patients. As such, individuals could obtain an optimised and more convenient overview of their immunisation status and vaccination schedule, while preventing unnecessary or duplicate immunisations and possible adverse events from drug -to-drug interactions. In addition, a recall system, similar to the existing recall letter for the annual preventive check -up, could be introduced to ensure continuity of the vaccination schedule and thus ill -health prevention. Moreover, the introduction of a national electronic immunisation data collection system in Austria could improve the monitoring and evaluation of immunisation rates, which is currently based on a fragmented reporting system. 491 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Summary of policy options Vaccines are one of the most cost -effective strategies to prevent infectious diseases in populations and even though a number of initiatives to support the immunisation of children are in place in Aust ria, including a national vaccination schedule, free vaccines for children up to the age of 15, and the dissemination of information on vaccines, the childhood vaccinations rates are notably lower in Austria than in other countries. These low vaccination r ates may reflect the absence of demand and supply side measures that have been introduced in other countries to ensure the immunisation of children, such as introducing legally binding consultations for caretakers, penalties for vaccination refusal or ince ntivising physicians to promote vaccinations. Furthermore, the Austrian care system primarily focuses on the immunisation of children rather than adults, which further increases gaps in the vaccination rates of the population. For instance, even though a p hysician's provision of a vaccine is covered by health insurance, the actual vaccines are not reimbursed for adults. In addition, the process to obtain vaccinations for adults is time -consuming and inconvenient, as most physicians do not store vaccines at their offices. Therefore, a number of measures may be introduced to decrease disparities in immunisation rates between children and adults, whilst concurrently raising the overall rate of immunised persons in Austria. (1) For instance, further demand -side incentives could be implemented, such as including vaccinations in the mother -child -passport to incentivise immunisation of children, as well as extending coverage of cost - effective vaccines for adults. (2) A walk -in vaccination and injection services at community pharmacies, following a prescription by a physician, could render the immunisation process for adults more flexible, time -saving and convenient. (3) In addition, a vaccination database and electronic vaccine record may provide time and site -indep endent access to information for both patients and health care professionals, allowing for an optimised overview of immunisation status and vaccination schedule, whilst preventing unnecessary or duplicate immunisations, as well as possible adverse events f rom drug -to-drug interactions. A recall system could further ensure continuity of care. Concurrently, a national electronic immunisation data collection system in Austria could improve the monitoring and evaluation of immunisation rates, which is currently based on a fragmented reporting system. Legal considerations No particular constitutional impediments have to be faced with respect to these options. 492 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic disease characterised by high levels of glucose in the blood. Type 1 di abetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, a hormone regulating the blood sugar. By contrast, Type 2 diabetes develops when the body cannot make effective use of the insulin it produces. As a consequence, untreated individuals with di abetes commonly have raised blood sugar, which can lead to serious damage over time. If left undiagnosed or poorly controlled, diabetic people have greater risks of developing cardio -vascular diseases, sight loss, renal failure, foot and leg amputation, as diabetes can damage several organs, including the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves (17,508) . Simple lifestyle measures are effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals. These include, for instance, the maintenance of healthy body weight through physical activity and healthy diet (i.e. decreasing intake of sugar a nd saturated fat), and avoidance of tobacco use (508) . Diabetes prevalence and trends in Austria Approximately 6% of the Austrian p opulation (i.e. 430,000 people) were diagnosed by a physician with diabetes (509) . When comparing self -reported diabetes data based on the Health Interview Survey (2014), Austria appears to perform rather well, with merely 4.9% of people reporting diabetes. This prevalence rate is half of that reported in France, namely 10%, which constitutes the highest preva lence rate across the European countries. It is also 2.1% below the EU26 average of 7%, as depicted in the figure below (510) . When looking at c hildren specifically, approximately 0.1% of 0 -14 year olds (i.e. 1,300 - 1,500 children) have been diagnosed with diabetes (509) . 493 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 156: Self-reported diabetes in Europe, 2014 Source: OECD Health Statistics, 2016 However, self -reported data on diabetes can be susceptible to under -diagnosis and reporting errors (510) . For instance, according to Federal Ministry of Health, approximately 8% to 9% of the Austrian population (i.e. 573,000 - 645,000) have diabetes. As such, an estimated 2% to 3% remain undiagnosed (i.e. 143,000 - 215,000). Furthermore, the rate of self -reported diabetes is particularly higher in those population groups with lower education, compared to those with higher education, as shown in the figure below. However, these differences are more pronounced in the female population. Furthermore, no differenc es in prevalence were found between genders, and between individuals with a migrant and a non -migrant background (509) . 4.64.8 4.95.3 5.45.877.2 02468 Denmark Sweden Austria Belgium Netherlands United KingdomEU26 GermanyPercentage of population aged 15 years and over494 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 157: Self-reported diabetes by level of education in Europe, 2014 Source: OECD Health Statistics, 2016 Even though the prevalence rate may not seem as high as in other countries, the proportional mortality from diabetes as a percentage of all deaths in Austria is 4%, which is four times as high as in the UK and twice as high as in Belgium or France, as highlighted in country -specific proportional mortality as a percentage of total deaths across Europea n cou ntries (see table 88 ) (498) . Diabetes care in Austria The treatment of diab etes patients takes p lace either through the recognis ed Disease -Management - Programme or the physician office. However, as highlighted in a report by the Federal Ministry of Health, the type and scope of these services may vary due to regional circumstances , regulations by federal states, variations in tariffs and training of personnel, as well as the in size of doctor's practices (509) . For patients with diabetes type 1, there are 95 diabetes outpatient departments for adults and 36 departments specifically for children and adolescents. These departments are within reach of 30 minutes for approximately 95% of the adult population (i.e. 19 years and older) and 79% of the children's population (15 years and younger) (509) . Disease -Management P rogramme (DMP) 'Therapie aktiv' To further improve the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 patients and with the aim to reduce costs in the long -term, the disease management programme (DMP) 'Therapie aktiv - Belgium Denmark Netherlands United KingdomEU26 GermanyPercentage of population aged 15 years and over High Low495 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options developed in 2004 by th e Styrian sickness fund and the Institute for Biomedicine and Health Science of Johanneum Research on behalf of Austrian SHI, and subsequently implemented in 2007 across most regions in Austria (511,512) . The programme has since then been adopted by other sickness funds (511) . In 2012, approximately 15.3% of eligible physicians participated in the DMP, which is voluntary and free of charge to both patients and physicians (511,512) . Before signing up to the programme, physicians receive a basic training to bec ome a so -called 'DMP -physician'. Upon completion of the training, DMP - physicians receive between 40 EUR - 72 EUR for each registered diabetes patient, as well as 21 EUR to 29 EUR per quarter104 for supervisory care, depending on the federal state. Further tr aining is also rewarded. The programme encompasses the implementation of evidence -based clinical guidelines, performance of necessary medical examinations on a regular basis, as well the recording of information on medical parameters, treatment, target ag reements and quality of life. Furthermore, patients receive lifestyle advice to improve health behaviours and both, the physician and patient agree on defining individual targets. To date, approximately 45,000 diabetic patients have signed up to the progra mme (512) . A number of studies have aimed to assess the impact of the programme on the patients enrolled. For instance, Ostermann et al. (2012) have found that the quality of outpatient care improved, while the rate of hospitalisations decreased for DMP -participants compared with controls in 2009 (513) . Furthermore, a recent study by Riedl et al . (2016) observed a significantly lower mortality rate in the DMP -group, compared to those in routine ca re. The number of days spent in hospital, as well as the mean annual hospital cost were comparatively lower as well, which is reflected in the lower mean annual total costs of EUR 8226.80 for DMP -participants and EUR 9 ,321.10 for the control group. When lo oking at the cost of health care services, the study noted slightly higher outpatient physician services costs and lower hospital costs for the DMP group (512) . Although these studies suggest a positive impact of the DMP programme on patients, it mu st be noted that the findings may be influenced by a number of confounding factors, such as severity of disease and education levels, which may affect whether a patient joins the DMP programme in the first place. As such, further evaluations of later stage s of the DMP programme should be assessed. 104 Some federal states only provide supervisory care benefits for a total of three quarters. 496 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Programmes and initiatives A number of initiatives to improve diabetes care have been implemented in Austria. For example, advanced training for diabetes counselling for physicians has been offered since the 19 90s and approximately 850 physicians have received further training to date. In addition, a forum for quality assurance in diabetology (FQSD -\u00d6) had been founded in 1996 to improve the structural, process and outcome quality in diabetes care. A diabetes reg istry has already been established in Tirol, which aims to optimise the monitoring of diabetes patients, whilst simultaneously collecting epidemiological data (509) . Furthermore, national action plans on nutrition Aktionsplan Ern\u00e4hrung, NAP.e) and physical exercise (Nationaler Aktionsplan Bewegung) have been introduced to focus on health risk facto rs to health, which also relate to diabetes. The Austrian Diabetes Association provides further information on regarding information events, and information contact points regarding diabetes care across the nine regions. Policy options: Diabetes Expansion of the diabetes disease -management -programme (DMP) At present, type 2 diabetes patients can receive diabetes care either by voluntarily signing up to the established disease -management programme (DMP) or through routine care at a physician practice. Howev er, differences in care and supervision between physicians within the DMP programme and those outside DMP prevail, as well as variations across non -DMP physician practices. For instance, two studies have found that outcomes, such as mortality, improved in the DMP programme, whilst concurrently decreasing costs compared to the control group (512,513) . Although the findings may be influenced by other factors, such as selective sign up to the DMP programme, the studies may nevertheless reflect strengths of t he programme, which is specifically outlined to rely on evidence -based practice and to offer patient -centred care with regular monitoring of patients. Therefore, in order to improve equity and quality of treatment, it suggested to further strengthen effort s in the disease management programme, which should be gradually expanded over time. Remuneration of DMP -physicians Patients with chronic diabetes require on -going care and supervision, in order to ensure adequate management of the disease. As a result, diabetic patients may constitute a comparatively more expensive patient group in a non -risk-adjusted contact capitation scheme, as is primarily the case in Austria, than single -case patients. Therefore, financial incentives have been introduced to further attract physicians 497 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options into the disease management programme. However, given the time -intensive treatment of diabetic patients, physicians may forfeit additional revenue. Therefore, the financial compensation should be assessed in order to ensure appropriate r ewards in line with the time taken to manage diabetes patients, and to incentivise more physicians to enter the programme. Training of physicians Following the completion of a medical degree, post -graduate medical students in Austria undertake 5 to 6 year rotation training at hospitals (Postpromotionelle Ausbildung). A grid certificate (Rasterzeugnis) specified by the Chamber of Physicians outlines areas and procedures that need to be completed by trainees as part of their rotation. However, the grid certi ficate category 'basic training' does not include diabetes -specific training or how to manage patients, even though the management of diabetic patients may become particularly difficult in the case of secondary disease, such as kidney damage, where more attention needs to be paid to additional factors like dosage of medications. Therefore, inclusion of diabetes specific -tasks in the grid certificate may further expose physicians to additional training and as such improve the management of patients with diab etes. Furthermore, continuing training constitutes an important factor to ensuring continuous high quality care. Consequently, a number of countries like Germany have introduced a re -certification of physicians e.g. every five years which may regulated by law and may even be connected to sanctions in the case of failed completion. In Austria further training is regulated through an ordinance (Verordnung) of the Chamber of Physicians . As such, physicians receive a diploma if 250 points are collected (or 150 points in specific cases). However, there are no specifications on follow -up measures in the case of incompletion. Therefore, it may be an option to make further training more binding by defining explicit follow -up measures in the case that physicians fai l to follow the training. Training of DMP -physicians If part of the DMP programme, physicians are required to refer diabetic patients to diabetes outpatient departments in the case that management efforts (e.g. managing blood sugar levels) fail. This may lead to the decision of some physicians not to enter the programme in the first place, due to possibilities of losing patients. Therefore, the introduction of a voluntary training and a confidential supervision by experiences diabetes specialists may help overcome this issue. 498 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Establishment of a national diabetes registry About 2% to 3% of the Austrian population are estimated to live with undiagnosed diabetes (i.e. 143,000 - 215,000), a number that may be further underestimated. Although a diabetes registr y has already been established in Tirol, which aims to optimise the monitoring of diabetes patients, whilst simultaneously collecting epidemiological data, fragmentation in the data collection prevails. By extending data collection efforts, a national dia betes registry could be implemented in order to improve the collection of data to monitor and evaluate trends in diabetes. Summary of policy options Even though the diabetes prevalence rate is below the EU average, diabetes constitutes a significant share of proportional mortality in Austria, after cardiovascular disease and cancer. A number of initiatives have been implemented since the 1990s to improve diabetes care in Austria, including a diabetes disease - management programme, diabetes counselling for p hysicians, a forum for quality assurance in diabetology, a diabetes registry, as well as national action plans for physical exercise and nutrition. However, a significant number of diabetic patients remain undiagnosed, which may lead to further health deterioration. Furthermore, the quality and scope of care varies between patients enrolled in the disease management programme and those receiving routine care. And even though initial findings suggest the cost-effectiveness of the disease management programm e, challenges to incentivise physicians to join the programme prevail. Therefore, (1) an expansion of the diabetes disease management programme, which takes into consideration adequate financial incentives for physicians, whilst also ensuring training sup port through experienced diabetes specialists, may further harmonise the provision of diabetes care in Austria. Concurrently, recent efforts to build additional primary health care centres (PHCs) will complement the multi -disciplinary based delivery of dia betes care in Austria. (2) In addition, the grid certificate for trainee physicians could be extended to incorporate exposure to diabetes specific -measures, in order to further improve the management of (difficult) diabetes cases. (3) A national diabetes r egistry that could build on the existing registry in Tirol has the potential to enhance data collection and monitoring of diabetes developments in Austria. (4) Furthermore, efforts in the harmonisation of benefits packages across insurance carriers could f urther mitigate inequity in diabetes care, such as variations in the scope of benefits for services, including diagnostic tests . 499 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Legal considerations Even though no particular constitutional impediments have to be faced with respect to these options, some amendments to the professional law (especially the \u00c4rztegesetz) as well as amendments to the current system of contractual agreements would be require d, which might cause political impediments. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and causes more than half of all deaths across the European region. Although cardiovascular -related mortality has been decreasing in many countries in the past decades, cardiovascular diseases remain the most common cause of death (514) . Yet, about 80% of premature heart disease and stroke is prev entable (515) . Prevention of CVD encompasses primarily the focus on reduction of risk factors that include tobacco consumption, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, and higher levels of alcohol consumption (514) . Furthermore, preventive strategies include medical screenings for population groups at risk, as well as medi cal treatment e.g. in the form of cholesterol - and blood -pressure - lowering medications, in which case the latter has shown to be effective in reducing heart attacks (myocardial infarction) up to 75% among high -risk individuals (515) . Therefore, the implementation and continuation of preventive strategies, including the management of blood pressure of patients at risks, is central to reducing morbidity and mortality of CVD. Against this background, th e community -based North Karelia Project was launched in Finland in 1972 to prevent cardiovascular diseases, and more specifically to assess the role of primary prevention in reducing observed coronary heart disease mortality. Based on previously identified risk factors in other large studies, including the British Medical Doctors Study and Framingham Study, the project targeted three classical risk factors of CVD, namely tobacco smoking, high serum cholesterol and high blood pressure. With the introduction of the project, several initiatives were taken to mitigate risks by focusing on behavioural change through community action and participation, in addition to screening of high -risk individuals and medical treatment. Furthermore, a systematic monitoring was introduced, with surveys being conducted on a 5 -year basis (514) . A key finding of the project is that population -based prevention programmes constitute effective tools to reduce the disea se burden and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD). Such programmes included active anti -smoking campaigns and legislation that even led to the lowest smoking prevalence in Europe 500 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options in 2016, promotion of dietary change to reduce cholesterol levels (e. g. transition from fatty milk to low fat milk, reduction in butter consumption, increase in use of vegetables), and a combined strategy of lifestyle change (e.g. reduction of high salt intake) and use of screening and pharmaceutical drug treatment to lower blood pressure levels. Notably, more than 80% of the decrease in cholesterol levels could be attributed to dietary changes, while only 20% were explained by the use of drugs, such as statins. Therefore, primary prevention aimed at reducing CVD risk factor s should be considered the main strategy to decrease the disease burden and mortality from coronary heart disease, while secondary prevention may confer additional benefit (514) . In additio n, a recent modelling study to estimate the global premature cardiovascular mortality in 2025 highlighted that the reduction of specific risk factors, namely systolic blood pressure and tobacco use, may have a more substantial impact on future scenarios th an other factors like levels of body mass index and fasting plasma glucose. Furthermore, a strategy focusing on multiple risk factors, rather than single factors, has a greater impact on reducing CVD -related premature death across all regions globally. How ever, in addition to focusing on combatting these major risk factors, decision -makers also need to take into consideration the capacity of the health care system to accomplish CVD reduction. This encompasses counselling patients with regards to e.g. glycae mic control and ensuring eligible high -risk patients receive drug therapy, as well as making affordable basic technologies and essential medicines (including generics) to treat NCDs available (516) . Prevalence and cost of CVD in Austria Notably, CVD -related mortality as a percentage of all deaths in Austria is with 43% comparatively higher than in other European countries, as shown in the table below (498) . For instance, in 2011 approximately 5,100 persons died because of a heart attack, 1,200 of a st roke and 500 of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Specifically, men and the elderly had a higher likelihood of mortality than women and younger individuals (517) . 501 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 89: CVD -related mortality as a percentage of all deaths in 2013 (498) Proportional mortality (% of total deaths, all ages, both sexes) Austria Belgium France Germany Italy Netherlands Norway UK Cardiovascular Profiles, 2014 Given the large burden of disease, CVD is associated with high direct and indirect costs. For in stance, in 2008 approximately \u20ac1. 3 billion in costs were attributed to CVD care in the inpatient sector. This constitutes about 13% of public health expenditures. CVD was also associated with high indirect costs, such as inability to work, invalidity or premature death. For example, in 2011 approximately 600,00 sick leave days were due to cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, about 15,000 pensions were granted as a results of CVD -related reduced workability or incapacity to work (517) . Cardiovascular care and prevention initiatives in Austria Given the high costs associated with CVD, the appropriate management of high -risk patients is paramount to preventing further morbidity, complications and hospitalisations. Individuals at risk are generally treated at general practices, and a recent trend in the development of primary healthcare centres allows for a multi -disciplinary management of CVD patients. Contrary to the management of diabetes, there are no disease management programmes for CVD in Austria. An evaluation in 2014 of cross -national and cross -regional measures and projects to reduce CVD -related risk factors found that only a limited number of such measures are in place in Austria. Of these, approximately 45% constituted a combination of behaviour - and environment -related interventions, while 44% accounted for health behaviour -based interventions only. The majority of these measures focus on nutrition and physical activity, while other preventive areas are significantly underrepresented, which may be due to the fact that areas like tobacco and alcohol consumption are not explicitly covered in current strategy papers, such as the strategy for child and adolescent health or the Framework Health 502 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Targets. Furthermore, the measures focus on multiple rather than single risk factors, and encompass workshops, trainings, information events, as well as coaching and consultations (517) . Policy options: Cardiovascular disease Large epidemiological studies have identified key risk factors of cardiovascular disease, including tobacco consumption, high systolic blood pressure levels, high serum cholesterol, obesity, physical exercise and diabetes mellitus. As previously highlighte d, Austria has the lowest share of obese people in Europe and BMI tends to be in the normal range, in addition, the prevalence of diabetes is below the EU average. No significant deviations from the EU average were observed for alcohol consumption and smok ing among adults . Furthermore, a number of initiatives with a multiple factor approach were introduced, as well as a national action plan on nutrition and physical exercise. Despite the above , the pro portional mortality of CVD -related deaths in Austria r emains comparatively higher than in other EU countries. This may be explained by the low number of cross -national and cross - regional measures and projects to reduce CVD -related risk factors, with limited focus on key risk factors like tobacco and alcohol c onsumption . Concurrently the number of adolsecent smokers is high compared to other EU countries, although it must be noted that policies were introduced recently to target tobacco consumption among adolsecents and adults (e.g. smoking ban for adoslecents below the age of 18 in 2018; smoking ban in public spaces initiated in 2009). In addition, the lack of coordination between primary and secondary care in Austria may further undermine effective treatment of high -risk and CVD patients. As highlighted in a p ioneering observational study in Finland, primary prevention aimed at reducing CVD risk factors should be considered the main strategy to decrease the disease burden and mortal ity from CV D, while secondary prevention may support the former. However, given the recent developments to strenghten primary care and establish more primary health care units, as well as Austria's comparatively good performance in risk factor levels, further investigations are needed to examine and identify underlying factors of the high CVD disease burden and mortality in Austria. Based on the findings, appropriate measures could be introduced to reduce CVD -related morbidity and mortality. Legal considerations No particular legal impediments have to be faced with respect to these op tions. 503 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Health promotion International initiatives to improve disease prevention and health promotion Developed countries in the EU are experiencing rising rates of chronic conditions caused by, amongst other factors, an ageing population. Challenges arisin g from conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, are recognised by governments as evidenced by the recent Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Health Ageing across the Life Cycle (JA -CHRODIS), which is funded by the European Commission (518) . JA-CHRODIS represents a three -year (2014 -17) European collaboration to 'validate, exchange and disseminate good practice' on policies related to chronic diseases, specifically, on health promotion and prevention, multi -morbidity and diabetes. Today, JA -CHRODIS is made up of representatives from 25 European countries, wh ich includes over 70 partners from national and regional health departments and research institutions (518) . To achieve the initiative's overarching objective of transferring knowledge among member states, a number of 'work packages' (WPs), outlining relevant activities, have been defined. An o verview of each of the seven WPs is provided in Table 90. Details on each how each of the WPs work together is outlined in Figure 158 (518) . Table 90: Work packages within JA -CHRODIS Work package Description WP1: Coordination Coordinate the overall initiative, including relevant programs outside JA -CHRODIS, and ensure the initiative's sustainability WP2: Dissemination Disseminate findings from activities undertaken within JA -CHRODIS WP3: Evaluation Evaluate activities undertaken at JA -CHRODIS to determine whether it has achieved its objectives WP4: Platform for knowledge exchange Implementing key JA -CHRODIS activiti es, that is, the platform where information on good 504 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Work package Description practices are pooled (i.e. repository of best practice principles) WP5: Health promotion and disease prevention To screen potential good practices for health promotion and disease prevention, with succe ssful programs being made available to stakeholders WP6: Multi -morbidity Similar to WP5, however, related to practices regarding multi -morbidity WP7: Diabetes Similar to WP5, however, related to practices regarding diabetes Source: (518) Figure 158: Overview of JA -CHRODIS work packages Source: (518) 505 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Relevant to this task, is WP5: Health promotion and disease prevention. As outlined above, only those programs considered 'best practice' are included within the PKE. For the purpose of this initiative, JA - CHRODIS have termed best practice as: 'Not only a practice that is good, but a practice that has been proven to work well and produce good results, and is therefore recommended as a model. It is a successful experience, which has been tested and validated, in the broad sense, which has been repeated and deserves to be shared so that a greater number of people can adopt it.' (519) Based on t his definition, the following 10 criteria have been determined to select which health promotion and disease prevention models are included in the PKE: 1. Equity 2. Comprehensives of the intervention 3. Description of the practice 4. Ethical considerations 5. Evaluatio n 6. Empowerment and participation 7. Target population 8. Sustainability 9. Governance and project management 10. Potential of scalability and transferability (519) . Today, over 40 best practice models have been identified in regard to health promo tion and disease prevention, which come from a range of countries including, Germany, the Netherlands, I reland, Iceland, Greece, Norway and the UK (519) . Best practice models take different a pproaches, however, in general, can be classified as either taking: A 'partnership approach', in w hich Departments/Ministries of Health are involved in developing and implementing health promotion and primary prevention policies and programmes, as well as non- governmental organisations . A 'Health in all Policies', as was used for the 10 Federal Health Targets in Austria (see section below). 506 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Austrian initiatives to address health promotion In line with European efforts to strengthen health promotion and disease prevention, Austria too has implemented a range of initiatives, as evidenced by policies within the 2013 healthcare reform. Specifically, the latest reform introduced the Federal Health Target Agreement, and aligning Federal and State Target Contro l Commissions as part of Target Control health ( Zielsteuerung Gesundheit ). In addition to Target Control H ealth, 10 Federal Health Targets were introduced, which refer to the healthcare system more broadly (with the exception of Target 10, which s specific to the d elivery of healthcare services). Structure of the Public Health and Health Promotion Working Group The concrete health strategies, operative targets, measures on a national and regional level, as well as on - going projects, are specified in the Fe deral Health Target Agreement. The 2017 agreement outlines the reform agenda up until 2021 and was proposed by the Federal Target Control Commission to the Curiae. The operationalisation on the national level is carried out via Federal Annual Work Programm es (Bundes - Jahresarbeitsprogramm). As such, the Federal Health Target Agreement and the Federal Annual Work Programmes form the basis for the work and mandate for action for the working groups (Fachgruppen), including the working group on public health an d health promotion. The Coordination Committee then assigns which targets and projects are covered by a specific group, as depicted in the figure below. 507 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 159: Organisational structure of the Federal Target Control Commission in 2017 Source: HVSV, 2017 Federal Target Commission Coordination Committee Politics Governance Health care supply structure Health care supply processes Public health e-Health (ELGA) Working Groups Commissioning Reporting Operative targets 1.

Q- measuremen t in outpatient care Operative targets 4. Health care children and adolescents 10. Health literacy 11. Health promotion and disease prevention Operative targets 5. Directed use of ICT Operation targets for which the respective Working Groups are responsible 508 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options As shown in the figure above, in 2017 there are four working groups that focus on specific topics, including structure of care delivery, delivery processes, pub lic health and e -health. This constitutes a significant reduction from the number of working groups for the previous years, which amounted to six and encompassed the areas innovation, planning, financing and control, quality, public health and health promo tion, and law. The responsibility of the working groups includes the set -up of project groups, although the final responsibility is with the Coordination Committee. For the years 2013 to 2016, two project groups were established under the Working Group on Public Health and Health Promotion. These include one group for the identification and development of a range of important indicators to measure public health parameters (Outcome -Messung), and a second group that looked into the quality of health communica tion. The new project groups for the period 2017 -2021 are yet to be established. These groups consist of four representatives each from the federal state, the regions and social insurance. This also constitutes a change to the previous group constellatio n, as efforts were made to have a uniform and balanced representation of stakeholders. The Curiae then choose the individuals who will participate in the working groups. Financing of the undertakings by the Federal Annual Work Programmes (Ma\u00dfnahmen des Zielsteuerungsverrtages) takes place on a project base via the individual Health Target Partners or via common resources made available by the Federal Health Agency (Bundesgesundheitsagentur). Based on the initial workings of the organisational structure of the Federal Target health (Zielsteuerung Gesundheit), the new structure aimed to consider lessons learned. For instance, this includes a reduction of the working groups from six to four in order to make better cost -effective use of resources. Furthermore, in the past specific target measures were allocated to working groups, however, these could sometimes overlap in content, which in some cases made it difficult to differentiate tasks across groups. Consequently, under the new structure, working groups are allocated on the basis of operative targets and the responsibility for execution of the tasks is clearly defined. Furthermore, the topic child health has been included as an area of focus. These changes in the organisation of the working group, in order to make processes more efficient, constitute positive developments, which are to be tried and evaluated once the new structure is implemented in mid -2017. 509 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Case and care management Introduction to case management Over the last two to three decades, case management has gained prominence in various health and social care systems within high -income countries. While the concept of case management originated in the 1970s in mental health care and the accident insurance industry, its expansion to other parts o f health care can be explained by a number of trends. As cost pressures have increased in national health care systems due to factors such as population ag eing, increasing patient expectations, and technological progress that expands treatment -eligible pop ulation groups, policy makers and payers have been looking for efficiency gains. With advances in biomedical science, health care has become increasingly specialised. As a result, medical research is now organised along disease -specific specialties and hea lth care delivery according to mutually isolated provider organisations, for example, hospitals that are designed to cure acute illness. Such a system is not well suited for patients who receive care from various providers. These patients also tend to acco unt for most of the cost in health care systems (see Figure 78). Policy makers, payers and providers have thus looked to case management as a means of coordinating service delivery and increasing efficiency. At a high -level, e fficiency is a ratio of outp ut to input. In the context of health care, efficiency can be increased by improving health outcomes, while simultaneously maintaining or reducing costs. Given the difficulty in attributing changes in health outcomes to specific services, health care outpu t is often expressed in terms of proxy measures, such as the volumes of services delivered. Case management is, in principle, expected to contribute to efficiency gains by making services m ore appropriate and effective, and /or by reducing costs caused by duplication of efforts and delivery of unnecessary services. However, as will be discussed below, case management is in itself a time - and resource -intensive process that can add financial cost to the delivery of health care. To the extent that case manag ement uncovers unmet medical need among patients, it can also increase the volume of health care services provided, leading to cost increases. The ultimate effect of case management on health care efficiency thus depends on whether positive effects can be achieved in terms of health outcomes and whether these effects at least outweigh effects on cost or, in other words, whether case management is a cost-effective intervention compared to alternatives. The aim of this section of the report is to describe th e international experience with case management, which is relevant to the Austrian context. It provides a brief overview of the academic literature on case 510 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options management, in health and social care in general and in rehabilitation and return -to-work (RTW) prog rams more specifically, and selected case studies from other European countries and North America. Definition of case management Health and social care literature There are varying definitions of 'case management' in the health and social care literature depending on the field of application. Terms such as ' care management ' 'managed care' or 'comprehensive care' have also been used in prior research to refer to similar concepts and indeed these different labels are often used loosely or interchangeably. However, across different studies and terminology, the consistent underlying concept of case management is the same. Case management makes the individual patient, rather than diseases, care providers or services, the basic unit of care delivery to ensure coordinated delivery of all services required by a patient, usually overseen by a professional who acts as ' case manager ' (520 -522) . This process usually also involves a for mal needs assessment and the creation of an individual care plan. Case management is often part of broader interventions that aim to improve the delivery or effectiveness of healthcare services (523,524) . The underlying idea of organising the delivery of modern, and often specialised, healthcare around comprehensive needs of individual patients has been traced back to the 1970s. In particula r, in a seminal article on the division between psychiatry and biomedicine, Engel (525) suggested the 'biopsychosocial model ' to avoid reducing the definition of disease to deviations from normal in biological variables and integra te social, psychological and behavioural factors. This is model is often seen as the basis for a patient -centred and comprehensive delivery of health care. In more practical terms, case management evolved in parallel in different areas of application. For patients with chronic diseases, for instance, the 'Chronic Care Model (CCM) ' was proposed in the 1990s and provided six core principles to move care from a fragmented and episode -based approach towards a coordinated process led by primary care (526,527) . One of the six principles suggests that the care delivery system be redesigned to encourage better collaboration and work in multidisciplinary teams.105 Principles 105 The other five state, 1 - that healthcare systems should endorse improvement of chronic care overall by supporting improvement at all organizational levels and by providing the necessary structures and incentives; 2 - that clinical decision - making be supported by the adoption of evidence -based guidelines and protocols; 3 - that clinical information systems be used to collect, summarize and review individual or aggregate patient data to support providers and patients and to facilitate the smooth delivery of care; 4 - that patients and their families receive support in self -management to improve the confidence and skills of patients in managing the challenges of living with and treating their chronic illnesses; and 5 - that community resources be activated and integrated with health care to expand support for chronically ill patients and fill gaps in needed services . 511 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options of the CCM have been extended to patients who suffer from multiple chronic conditions (multi -morbidity) or a combination of various health problems that makes their care needs complex. In the literature on mental health and psychiatry, the use of the term case management dates back to the 1980s and has been used to refer to patient -specific delivery of mental health services, usually in community settings for patients with severe mental health illness (528 -530) . Across health and social care services in general, case management is typically targeted at those patients who require support over long periods of time and who se care needs are complex. The 'Kai ser Pyramid' (see figure below ), initially proposed by Kaiser Permanente, an integrated healthcare provider consortium in California, is a widely accepted conceptual framework suggesting that the delivery of care should be adapted to the level of patient c omplexity. As complexity increases, service provision moves from supported -self management for low -risk patients to disease management for high -risk patients and to case management for complex patients (531) . Cases are co nsidered complex when they require services from various providers, which increases the risk of fragmented care. 512 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 160: Kaiser Pyramid Source: Adapted from Singh and Ham (531) Rehabilitation and return -to-work interventions Since the 1980s, case management has also appeared in occupational health l iterature and studies that examine rehabilitation and return -to-work (RTW) programs followin g injuries or absence from work, more generally (532 -534) . Case management has been introduced more recently in RTW programs in several OECD countries. In this context, case management typically aims to improve coordination between services of employment , services with health care , or services of social care providers with the overall goal of accelerating recovery and reintegration into t he workforce. One institution usually provides the case management service to coordinate remaining services. Another common and important element of case management in RTW programs is a formal needs assessment and the definition of a plan, the execution of which is monitored and followed -up on by the case manager. The level of formality of the process and the intensity of support provided by case managers, however, can vary widely between countries and different models. In Denmark for example, vocational re habilitation is co -ordinated by the municipal job centre and involves health care services, social services and the education sector to prevent disability benefit claims (535) . In co-operation with the mental health and welfare sectors, Flemish employment services in Belgium provide a 'job coach ' who acts as case manager and provides not only support in the job search but also Complex Patients Case Management High -risk Chronic Patients Disease Management Low-risk Chronic Patients Supported Self -Management Healthy Population Prevention513 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options coordination of services provided by a 'mental health coach ' and an 'empowerment coach' from welfare (536) . Accelerating RTW sh ould be a priority of social security systems given the two-way relationship between employment and he alth. While being healthy is a prerequisite for the ability to work productivel y, work can keep people healthy, further being out of work adversely affects physical and mental health . Evidence suggests that unemployment is associated with lower use of preventive an d curative health services, which has an adverse impact on health outcomes (537,538) . However, the positive impact of work is not present in poor quality, low paid and insecure employment (538) . Unemployment, on the other hand, has been shown to increase mental distress and deteriorates mental health status t hrough reduced social contact, a less defined social identity and through loss of structure in daily living (537) . This suggests that cash payments and similar unemployment benefits are insufficient to preserve the health of people who are out of work and th at services which integrate physical and mental health services with unemployment benefits are necessary. Case management in the Austrian context and legislation The 2008 agreement under article 15a of the Austrian federal constitution on organisation and financing of th e health system ( Vereinbarung gem\u00e4\u00df Artikel Gesundheitswesens ) made patient -oriented coordination of financing and service provision by various insurers and health service providers an overriding goal of a comprehensive medical service for the Austrian population. However, similar to the international context, there is no single and universally accepted definition of case management in the legislation or other sources of rules governing the Austrian health and social care system. A German monograph (539) has defined case management as, ' a method tailored for individual cases that can be applied by various persons in d iverse setting to realise patient focus and patient participation as well as outcome focus in complex and highly fragmented health and social care systems' (p.8). This definition has also been adopted in a prior review of case management in Austria by Czyp ionka et al . (540) , published by the HVSV . This paper positions case management as an approach to organise treatment for complex patients, as a complement to disease management, and breaks the process down into a cycle with six steps: 1 - identification of patients; 2 - assessment of psychosocial patient status and patient needs; 3 - definition of a care plan; 4 - implementation of the care pla n overseen by a case manager; 5 - monito ring of service provision by a case manager; and 6 - patient discharge and evaluation of the care plan (540) . 514 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options While legislation does not provide a definition of case management, laws governing health and social care and employment services refer to the term case management in the contexts of rehabilitation and RTW, maintaining the ability to work and long -term care. Case management is mentioned in the following three statutes. In the context of rehabilitation and RTW, \u00a7143b of the General Law on Social Security (ASVG) establishes obligations of sickness funds, the public employment service and pension funds to provide case management to persons who receive a rehabilitation allowance. This group includes persons who are temporarily, but not permanently, unable to perform duties that are part of their occupation, irrespective of their employment status. C ase management in this context comprises patient needs assessment, coordination of services and holistic support in rehabilitation to regain the ability to work. Patients face no OPP costs for case management services but are legally required to cooperate with service providers. The rehabilitation allowance may be withheld if patients are found not to cooperate. From 2017, the law also provides for part -time return to work according to a reintegration plan, if agreed upon between employers and employees. Du ring the reintegration period, working hours ar e reduced to between 25 and 50% of a full -time commitment and the employers pay a proportionate share of the salary with the rest covered by health insurance. Legislation establishes a clear hierarchy of respo nsibilities between insurers for costs related to rehabilitation measures. Costs for health care and RTW after workplace accidents and work -related illnesses are borne by accident insurance. Pension insurance bears costs of services to avoid early retireme nt or long -term care due to longer -term health problems. Health insurance bears supplementary responsibility for medical services to persons no longer entitled to pension insurance benefits. The law also provides for an interdisciplinary patient assessmen t team established by pension insurance, in cooperation with health insurance funds and the public employment service. Where these assessments establish that full recovery for RTW is not possible, the insured person can be eligible to claim benefits for incapacity to work or disability subject to a number of conditions. In this case, the person is no longer eligible for case management to support RTW. In the related context of maintaining the ability to work of employed and unemployed persons, \u00a71 of the Law on Work and Health (AGG) provides for the use of case management in early interventions to address health problems. 515 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In the context of long -term care, \u00a73 of the Law on the Fund for Long -term Care provides for the use of multi -professional care teams and case management, including services that 1 - involve planning of social and long -term care based on individual needs assessments; 2 - organise needed care; and 3 - manage provider interfaces. In Austria, there exist three prominent case management programs , namely Fit2Work, rehabilitation allowance, and Early Interventions. Brief case studies for each of these programs are provided below. For more detailed information, please see Volume 4 - Situational analysis. Figure 161: Fit2Wor k Services Fit2Work is designed for individuals who, due to a health impairment (defined by \u00a733a RRK 2005 ), may find it either difficult to find work (i.e. unemployed) , or to maintain their current job. Those who are employed and covered by GKKs, will be invited to participate if they have been away from work, due to illness, for 40 days or more over the past year. Those who are unemployed due to ill -health are invited by the Public Employment Services. In 2016, approximately 60% of participants were unemployed. Ultimately, the decision to participate in the program lies with the targeted individual. Fit2Work offers free of charge advisory/mentoring services, which can be broken down into the following five categories: 1) information phase; 2) the status -quo-survey; 3) the analysis and development of improvement measures; 4) the implementation phase; 5) and the evaluation -phase. Funding In 2012 , the Austrian Federal Government developed and implemented the Fit2Work program, which is funded by Public Employment Service Austria (AMS), GKKs, PVA, AUVA, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, and the European Social Fund *. Legal provision The Fit2Work program is ba sed on the Austrian Work and Health Law ( Federal Act on Providing Information, Advisory and Support Services in the Areas of Health and Work, AGG) (\u00a733a RRK 2005). Participation As of December 2016, approximately 17,000 participated in Fit2Work, covering 680 companies. The majority (70%) of participants were between the age of 40 -59 years, and the share of female 516 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options participants outweighed male clients, reaching 57%. The majority of disease diagnoses related to either psychological disorders (about 40%), or injuries and dam ages relating to the musculoskeletal system (also, about 40%).

Figure 162: Rehabilitation allowance In the case where an insuree (below 50 years of age) has a health impairment that is not permanent, and therefore only temporar ily unable to work for at least six months, the health insurance carrier will be required to pay a rehabilitation allowance. Those who receive the rehabilitation allowance will be assigned a case manager who provides assistance to the individual until the y have recovered. More specifically, the case manager, for example, will set individual health targets to either stabilise or improve the patient's health status. Services provided by the case manager are offered free or charge to individuals. The rehabil itation allowance is paid monthly and total 60% of the individual's salary, with a floor reimbursement of \u20ac889.84 per month (figure as of 2017 for single persons pegged to the equalisation supplement). After one year, the health insurance carrier will ass ess whether the individual the allowance should continue.

In this instance, the relevant GKK is responsible for inviting the individ ual to engage in a voluntary consultation as a way to analyse their health impairment and healing progress (\u00a734a RRK 2005). Consultations are 517 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options predominantly led by case managers, with the objective of informing the individual of existing prevention and reha bilitation measures, such as Fit2Work. The overall aim of the program is to identify individuals who are likely to retire early due to ill -health and assist them with their recovery process to raise the actual retirement age.

Summary of the evidence Case management in health and social care This section summarises prior literature on interventions that provide case management for various population target groups. Evidenc e on the effects of interventions that comprise case management has been synthesised in a number of recent literature reviews. Evidence reviewed in these studies comes predominantly from the United States, with some studies from Canada and only a very smal l number of studies from European countries, including the Netherlands, Norway, Italy and the United Kingdom. Populations targeted Recent literature reviews have synthesised the effects of interventions that comprise case management for the following patient target groups: Persons with multi -morbidity , defined as any combination of two or more chronic diseases, in reviews published since 2010 (542 -545) ; including an authoritative Cochrane review published in 2016 (545) Persons who have combinations of physical and mental health problems in reviews published since 2010 (546 -548) Frail elderly persons in reviews published between 2003 and 2004 (549,550) 518 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Persons who have terminal illnesses or receive palliative care in reviews published since 2013, including broad patient groups with any severe or advanced disease who no longer respond to curative or maintenance treatme nt (551 -554) and ca ncer patients (555) . Patients have also been targeted based on patterns in their use of services. Interventions have been targeted, for example, at frequent or repeated users of hospital and emergency department services (556,557) or at the point where elderly patients transition between healthcare providers, in particular at hospital discharge to avoid readmission (558) . Similar to other studies, evidence synthesised by these reviews was predominantly from the United States, but also included a small number of studies from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Interventions and services delivered Two literature reviews on multi -morbid p atients focused on interventions that were delivered in primary care or comparable community -based settings (542,545) while two other reviews included care delivered in any setting (543,544) . In addition to providing case management, these reviews studied interventions that included improved processes for cooperation between primary care physicians and other health care professionals (542,545) , other additional patient support services (545) or services following any of the five other principles of the CCM (543,544) . One literature review on patients with a combination of physical and mental health problems focused on care that was delivered in a primary care or comparable community -based settings (547) , while one included any coordinated and multidisciplinary model of care in any setting (548) , and a third did not explicitly specify the provider setting but included only interventions that aimed to improve cooperation between primary care physicians and other health care professionals (546) . One of the two literature reviews on interventions for frail elderly persons focused on studies of case management by a case manager only, usually a specialist nurse responsible for case finding, assessment, care planning, implementation, coordination and monitoring of care to prevent fragmentation and to optimise patient -centred care delivery (549) . The other review synthesised evidence on an intervention that included case m anagement but took a broader approach to integration of services between providers of acute and long -term care (550) . Two of the five reviews of interventions for patients with terminal illness or receiving palliative care focused on interventions similar to case management, with one (551) evaluating the effect of care coordination involving a palliative care specialist across provider settings and the other one (552) the 519 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options effect of team -based palliative care interventions delivered in patient homes. The three other reviews (553 -555) were broader and included any type of palliative care intervention, of which two (553,555) did not restrict the setting in which care w as delivered and one (554) restricted the setting to outpatient non - hospice care. Palliative care was usually define d as any approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with a life -threatening illness. This often includes case management and self -management but also components such as symptom management, educa tion and patient activation. The review of interventions for frequent health care users (557) synthesised evidence on the effect of quality improvements to care based on the CCM, including case management, changes to professional teams, promotion of self -management, provision of decision support, and better use of clinical information systems. Case management was included in interventions evaluated by 29 of 36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. The review of interventions for frequent emergency department users (556) included any kind of intervention aimed at reducing emergency department attendance, and seven of eleven studies included were on case management. The review of interventions to improve hospital discharges and avoid read missions (558) included studies of the effect of nurse - assisted case management including elements such as frequent follow -up and home visits or patient education by specialised nurses, with some var iation in the scope of the services provided. Impact The most recent of four reviews of interventions for multi -morbid patients concluded that evidence of the effect of such interventions was growing but was still limited and not of high quality (544,545) . Overall, the reviews of inte rventions for patients with any combination of chronic diseases found insufficient evidence or no effect of interventions on mortality and clinical outcomes related to physical health (542 - 545) ; some improvements to measures of mental health status, such as depression symptoms (545) ; some improvements in measures of functional status (545) ; some improvements in patient satisfaction (542 - 544) some improvements to process -measures such as medication and guideline adherence (545) ; and inconsistent effects on health care utilization or cost, with two reviews finding some evidence of reductions (542,543) while the other two reported insufficient evidence or found no effect (544,545) . The 2016 Cochrane review also concluded that interventions with a more narrow focus, for example on management of the risk factors of co -morbidity, medication management or improvement of funct ional limitations and similar areas of difficulty, were more likely to be successful than broader interventions, such as those that provide case management for all types of multi -morbid patients (545) . The Cochrane 520 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options review further concluded that interventions that are mainly patient -oriented and are not linked to changes in health care delivery are less likely to be successful (545) . Three reviews of interventions for persons with combinations of mental and physical health problems found no effects on mo rtality but some improvement in measures of mental health, such as depression symptoms, anxiety and mental health -related quality of life, and improvements in some measures of physical health status when targeting patients with specific chronic diseases, s uch as HbA1c levels in depressed patients with co -morbid diabetes or a short -term reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with depression and co -morbid coronary heart disease (546 -548) . None of these three reviews r eported effects in terms of process -related measures or utilisation. Only one review investigated economic endpoints but found no effect on costs (546) . The review of case m anagement for frail elderly persons found limited evidence of effects on health outcomes, with no effect on mortality and functional status and only one original study that was included showing improvements in cognitive status, depression and activities of daily living (ADL) (559) . Evidence of the effects on patient satisfaction and emerg ency department use was not conclusive and no effect was found on inpatient and outpatient hospital use (559) . The review of interventions to integrate acute and long -term care for frail elderly patients found inconclusive evidence of effectiveness in terms of health outcomes but found improvements in process measures, such as enhanced fe eling of empowerment among patients, increased appropriateness in the use of community -based services and reduced utilisation in other parts of the healthcare systems, including emergency department visits, specialist consultations and inpatient hospital o r nursing home stays (550) . The review that focused on coordination of care for patients with terminal illnesses concluded that there was moderate evidence that such interventions improved patient and caregiver satisfaction and a low level of evidence of improved quality of life and symptom control and reduced health care utilization (551) . Effects in terms of cost were not reported (551) . The review of home -based palliative care did report an increased likelihood of dying at home but remained inconclusive on effects in terms of health care utilisation and cost -effectiveness (552) . Two of the three reviews of broader palliative care interventions (553,554) found that palliative care is generally more effective than usual care at alleviating pain, distress or depression and can improve physical function, symptom control or quality of life. Palliative care also had a positive effect on patient 521 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options and caregiver s atisfaction (553,554) . Evidence on mortality is less conclusive but suggests that palliative care is at least equally as effective as usual health ca re near the end of life (553,554) . These two reviews (553,554) also reported that palliative care can be a substitute for usual hospital services and reduces costs through increases in use of end of life care , and reductions in hospital admissions, readmissions, emergency department visits and len gths of stays in intensive care units. One review that only looked at the effect of palliative care on emergency department use (555) found no clear evidence of reductions and concluded that substitution patterns were dependent on the designs an d availabilities of alternative services in each individual health system. Interventions for frequent users of healthcare were found to reduce hospital admissions among patients with chronic conditions but not among those with mental illness and also to r educe emergency department attendance among elderly patients (557) . The reviews also concluded that case management, chang es to teams of health care professionals, promotion of self - management and patient education were effective intervention components to reduce hospital admissions but that these specific components were not associated with reductions in emergency departmen t visits among elderly patients (557) . Authors speculated that the absence of an effect for patients with mental health co nditions may have been caused by the fact that most original studies included a coordination strategy in the care provided to the control groups. The review on interventions for frequent emergency department users concluded cautiously that such interventio ns may reduce emergency department use, but also that the quality of studies was limited and that regression to the mean may have biased non -randomised studies (only three of eleven studies included were RCTs) (556) . Case management was associated with reduced emergency department costs and improved health outcomes; however, cost analyses did not always include costs of the intervention so that, overall, case management may be cost neutral (556) . The review of nurse -assisted case management in hospital discharge found that the interventions could reduce hospital readmission rates and reduced lengths -of-stay in case of readmission within the first twelve months of discharge and, as a result, reduce cost, but only found this result in about half of the 15 trials reviewed (558) . The review was inconclusive as to which elements of the interventions were associated with the reductions (558) . Limited evidence was f ound that the interventions reduced emergency department visits and no effects in terms of mortality were found (558) . Case management in return -to-work interventions This section summarises prior literature on interventions that provide case management to persons who are temporarily on sickness absence from work. Several recent literature reviews have synthesised 522 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation or RTW interventions that include case management. Evidence reviewed in these studies comes from OECD countries, mainly in North America and Europe, and are less concentrated in the United States than on case management in health care for complex patients. Populations Targeted Evidence has been reviewed for persons on sickness absence in general, irrespective of their specific health problems or diagnoses, in two reviews published in 2012 (560,561) . One (560) of the two reviews, however, also investigated whether interventions for persons on sickness absence due to specific diagnoses were more effective than broader ones. Other reviews investigated the effectiveness of RTW interventions for persons on sickness absence due to musculoskeletal problems (562) , which was also published in 2012, and musculoskeletal or other pain -related conditions (563) , published in 2005. Interventions reviewed in these literature reviews typically target employees in the ir first two to eight weeks of sickness absence. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published public health guidance in 2009 on the management of long -term sickness absence and incapacity for work, which was defined as abse nce lasting more than four weeks (538) . No restriction is applied in terms of the reason for sickness absence. NICE guidance is based on a systematic review of evidence to underpin the recommenda tions. Interventions and services delivered One of the two reviews on persons on sickness absence in general, irrespective of their specific health problems or diagnoses (560) , synthesised evidence o n the effects of a broad range of interventions, including case management or other improvements to information exchange among service providers but also elements such as employee activation and counselling, physical therapy, support by occupational physic ians and workplace improvements. The other review of a broad group of persons on sickness absence (561) focused more narrowly on ' RTW coordination ', a process similar to case management and involving an assessment leading to an individual RTW plan implemented by a RTW co ordinator or team who coordinates services and communication among involved stakeholders. The review on persons on sickness absence due to musculoskeletal problems (562) synthesised evidence on the effects of any intervention delivered in a primary -care or workplace setting or conducted in collabor ation with primary -care providers or employers with the aim of improving work -related outcomes (sickness absence, job loss, RTW). These included physical, psychological, social and environmental 523 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options interventions directed at the person, such as physical therap y, the work or workplace, such as ergonomic adaptations, or health care and other services, including case management. The reviews on persons on sickness absence due to musculoskeletal or other pain -related conditions (563) included a broad range of workplace -based interventions that aimed at improving RTW outcomes, including disability management , education, organisational changes and case management. NICE guidance provides evidence -based recommendations for any type of intervention that aims to prevent or reduce moves from short - to long -term sickness absence (including the prevention of recurrin g short -term sickness absence); reduce recurring long -term absence; and support people on long -term absence or those with on incapacity or similar benefits with returning to work. Case management provided by employers is an element of recommended RTW inter ventions, if an initial assessment of the person on sickness absence establishes that case management can be beneficial. There are also literature reviews on RTW and rehabilitation interventions in general that make no explicit reference to case management or similar planning and coordination activities in service provision but include intervention elements such as personal exercise, counselling, education, psychological support or ergonomic adaptations (564,565) . Impact One of the t wo reviews on persons on sickness absence in general, irrespective of their specific health problems or diagnoses (560) , found that early - and multidisciplinary interventions are effective most of the time and that providing gradual exposure back to the workplace, such as progressively augmented work tasks or partial RTW, and making work -related adaptations, such as ergonomic improvements of furniture, were effective elements. Activating interventions that stimulate employees to RTW and interventions with a pre -determined schedule of activities were found effective for physical complaints (but not for psychological complaints). The review also found that broad interventions, not targeted to persons wit h specific diagnoses, show no positive effect. Evidence suggested that narrow interventions for specific diagnoses were more likely to be effective but were not always effective either. The review on RTW coordination for persons on sickness absence irrespe ctive of diagnosis (561) found moderate evidence that coordination resulted in small increases in the likelihood of RTW by disabled or sick-listed persons by the end of study follow -up, and associated small improvements in functional status and pain. 524 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The review on interv entions for persons on sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders (562) found that most types of interventions included in the review appeared to be effective in achieving RTW, avoiding job loss or reducing the length of sickness absence but that no type of intervention could clearly be iden tified as superior to others. No specific findings were reported on the effectiveness of case management in isolation. The review also found that effects were small and smaller in in larger and higher - quality studies, suggesting publication bias. No eviden ce was found of significant net economic benefits. The reviews of work -place based interventions on sickness absence due to musculoskeletal or other pain - related conditions (563) found that such interventions can reduce the duration of work disability and associated costs but found only weak evidence of effectiveness in terms of quality of life. The review found moderate evidence that case management reduced the duration of work disability and that this can also generate net cost savings within the first year of the intervention. It also found strong evidence that work disability duration was redu ced by the presence of work accommodation officers and enhanced contact between health care providers and the workplace. NICE guidance identified three main characteristics of interventions that were more likely to report positive results: early interventi ons, multidisciplinary approaches and interventions with a workplace component (566) . Guidance recommends that employers or their designa ted occupational health specialists should make initial enquiries about reasons for the absence and to make a prognosis for RTW within two to six weeks of the start of the absence, and appoint a responsible case manager if necessary. If necessary, case man agers are recommended to oversee a detailed assessment by specialists and produce a formal RTW plan that outlines the level, type and frequency of interventions and services needed. Such a plan can provide for gradual RTW in the original job or a return to partial duties. Finally, case managers are recommended to oversee delivery of the interventions, coordinate interactions with health care providers and other specialists and provide intensive support to people with a poor prognosis of RTW (538) . The reviews of RTW interventions that do not explicitly include case management generally found that interventions are effective when they are delivered early in the period of sickness absence, involve th e workplace and are multidisciplinary (565,567) . Similar to reviews of interventions in healthcare for comp lex patients, most of these reviews conclude that evidence is of low or moderate quality. 525 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options International case studies: case management The first three subsections of this section summarise experience in Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom with r eturn -to-work policies in general and with case management as a component of such policies more specifically. The fourth subsection provides three case studies from the Netherlands, the United States and Spain to illustrate the use of case management for p eople with complex needs in health and social care. Denmark: Broad return -to-work interventions Since the early 2010s, Denmark has restricted access to disability benefits in favour of programs that aim directly at reintegrating people into the labour market and expanded responsibilities of municipalities for monitoring and assessing sickness benefit recipients. Employers have relatively limited responsibilities relative to other European countries and Danish municipalities, which now bear much of the financial burden of sickness absence, play a strong role in RTW. Municipalities also provide case man agement and multidisciplinary support for rehabilitation (568) . Municipalities initially bear the costs related to such activities but receive reimbursement from the national government. To incentivise muni cipalities to support people in RTW, reimbursement by the national government for people who are out of work have been reduced, especially for passive benefit payments (535) . Municipal job centres are the single institution responsible all types of sickness absence an d RTW benefits and all people regardless of insurance and employment status (535,569) . Denmark also maintains a flexible working scheme that provides significant wage subsidies for people with reduced work capacity, which encourages companies to employ people for fewer working hours or at lower productivity at full hours (535) . The scheme was reformed in 2013 to improve targeting at people with limited work capac ity and avoid attracting those who are fit for work to less demanding jobs while not reducing the number of disability benefit recipients (535,570) . The reform also introduced multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams at municipal job centres (570) . Remaining weaknesses in RTW policies in Denmark are the insufficient systematic identification of people with mental health problems, who are overrepresented among the unemployed, and lack of support in RTW for such people (535) . The varying levels of reimbursement of municipal costs by the national government may also lead to strategic behaviour by municipalities and allo cation of beneficiaries to benefits that provide greater revenue to the municipality rather than those most suitable for the persons concerned (535) . 526 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The Netherlands: Return -to-work for people with mental health problems Several policies have been introduced in the N etherlands to prevent long -term absence, disability and the potential permanent exit from labour markets. These policies have devolved government responsibilities to other stakeholders in the system, in particular employers but also employees, and have gon e further than in many other countries in terms of legal obligations, financial incentives and potential sanctions (568) . People with mental ill -health have been identified as a group with a particularly high risk of sickness absence from work (571,572) . Employers are required to appoint a prevention specialist and conduct several activities to identify, assess and address risk factors for sickness absen ce. They are also required to formulate a sickness management policy (573) . In case of sickness absence, employers are requir ed to continue paying 70 to 100% of the salary of the absent em ployee for two years and the employee cannot be laid -off. Within six weeks of the start date of the sickness absence, employees must see an occupational physician at expense of the employer (568) . Occupation al physicians are responsible by law for analysing workplace problems and producing return -to-work plans. The provision of case management for return -to-work is also an obligation of employers, who are required to hire a case manager to oversee the return -to-work process. As is common in case management interventions, an action plan spelling out responsibiliti es in ensuring a quick return to work is part of the process, and has to be agreed upon between employer and employee within eight weeks of the start date of the sickness absence (568) . Employers, often thro ugh the return -to-work case manager, monitor the return -to-work process and must record actions undertaken. Some companies also employ a social worker to pro vide support, in particular for those with psychosocial problems that impact their ability to work. The Employee Insurance Agency (UWV) may penalise employers and employees for not collaborating in the return -to-work process. In case return to work is not possible , despite adjustments to the job by the employers, both the employer and employee are oblig ed to look for suitable work for the worker in another company. This is supported by public occupational health services, reintegration offices, and employer branch organisations (568) . It is not entirely c lear how successful these policies have been. Compliance by employers with their obligations has been reported to be low, especially but not only among small companies (573) . For example, fifty percent of employers have been found not to maintain guidelines for employees on when occupational physicians should be contacted in case of sickness absence and some twenty percent of 527 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options employers have been found not to meet their obligations related t o sickness absences longer than two years (568) . Although the independence of occupational physicians from treating physicians avoids conflicts of interest of the latter in sickness certification, the obliga tion of employers to fund consultations with occupational physicians has in turn raised concerns about their neutrality between employers and employees and assertions that these physicians primarily defend interests of employers (568) . Sickness absence rates in the Netherlands have decreased since the 1990s and are now close to the OECD average (574) . However, they remain high among people suffering from mental ill -health (568) . The lack of integration between mental health services and employment support is also a challenge. A more recent reform aimed at decentralising government responsibilities to reduce the fragmentation of services, including mental health, long -term care and employment support, and placing responsibili ty with municipalities (573) . Fit-4-Work is an example of an initiative for people with multiple psychosocial problems who are not part of the labour market to achieve integration of servi ces provided by social services, the UWV and the mental health care sector and accelerate return to sustainable employment (573) . Services are provided by a multidisciplinary team in an in dividually tailored approach. The initiative was introduced in 2012 in five large municipalities and found to be effective in achieving return to work in a two -year randomised control trial (575) .106 Another problem with policies relying on employers is that they do not support people with no permanent employment contract who do not have a wo rk place to return to (568,576) . United Kingdom: Early intervention and focus on fitness for work The relationshi ps between employment and health has been recognised in the United Kingdom with policies aimed at gradually improving integration of employment and health service s. Similar to other countries, reforms have included restriction of the disability benefits sy stem, efforts to identify and address work barriers early and to increase take -up of employment services by claimants of disability benefits (577) . The United Kingdom has also aimed to transform the role of general practitioners (GPs) in improving work - related outcomes by acting as gatekeepers to benefits and supporting patients in RTW. A policy was introduced in 2010 that requires GPs to provide stat ements of fitness for work (also referred to as the \"fit 106 At the time of writing of this report, detailed results of the RCT evaluating Fit -4-Work in the Netherlands were not publicly available. 528 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options note\") instead of the previous medical statement (\"sick note\") (578,579) . In this proce ss, GPs must describe the work patients who request sick leave can still do despite their health problems but go beyond certifying fitness and also take steps to help patients return to work earlier. Patients can be certified fit at various levels and GPs can request a phased return to work, amended duties, altered hours or workplace adaptations. Similar initiatives to refocus certification for sickness absence towards fitness for work have been implemented in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland (568) . An initial survey -based evaluation of the UK fit notes found that a majority of respondents considered the process helpful in discussing necessary changes with their employers and reported that the fit note had a positive impact on employers' willingness to make changes (578) . However, many fit notes were for short - term absences, stated that the patient was 'not fit for work' and did not recommend changes. Further, nearly half of respondents did not discuss changes with thei r employer (578,579) . In Scotland, the Early Access to Support for You (EASY) model was piloted with 11,000 staff of National Health Service (NH S) hospitals between 2008 and 2011 (580) . The model provided RTW support and monitoring very early in sickness absence, from the first day, including case management by occupational nurses. Staff satisfaction with the service was high and sickness absence rates declined following the implementation (580) . However, the pilot was conducted in the area with the highest absence rates in Scotland prior to the intervention, so that reductions could be related to regression to the mean, and declines followed similar trends to those the Scottis h NHS in general so these effects cannot be clearly attributed to the intervention. A similar intervention, based on intensive case management by occupational health staff but focussing on staff who were absent for at least four weeks, was implemented in 2009 at an NHS hospital in Southampton in England (Return2Health - R2H) (581) . The evaluation found a reduction in the rate of sickness absences that continued beyond eight weeks versus a control hospital but the methods used were also unable to attribute the effect to the intervention (581) . The Fit for Work Service (FFWS) program was piloted in England, Wales, and Scotland between 2010 and 2013. Its aim was to provide early -stage return -to-work support overseen by a case manager to reduce the drift into welfare benefits, including occupa tional assessments and multidisciplinary telephone advice. However, this program had difficulties in reaching the target group of employees at an early stage of sick leave, especially in the first year of operation. Initially, people who were still employe d used the service most frequently. A mong participants who were out of work, less than one -third had been off work for four to twelve weeks, which was the target group (568,582) . 529 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Permanent Fit for Work and national independent health and work advice and referral services have been implemented since 2014, based on best practices that were identified in the pilots (582) . These services provide a work -focused biopsychosocial assessment to employees early in sicknes s absence, in addition it offers advice to employers and employees on needs for rehabilitation and RTW support for workers on sick leave and those still at work. It thus inte grates advice to employers, particularly for small - and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), w hich were previously provided by the Occupational Health Advice Service (568) . Case management in health and social care for patients with complex needs As previously discussed, case management has been widely applied to improve the delivery of health and social care for comple x patients, who require services from various providers and whose care is at a particularly high risk of fragmentation. Between 2014 and 2016, LSE Health and the Commonwealth Fund, a private healthcare research foundation, led and international experts wor king group to identify good practices and innovative models of care delivery in care for patients with complex needs (583) . While not all of the models identified in this project have been rigorously evaluated in terms of effectiveness and c ost-effectiveness, they share a number of features. For example, they commonly use routine data, from sources such as electronic health records (EHRs) or insurance claims, to target patients most suitable for the intervention; they also use information sys tems, such as shared EHRs, to facilitate communication between different professionals and providers involved in the process of care; they provide case management across all types of services, including physical and mental health care as well as social car e, and usually embed case managers with primary care provider organisations; they support informal caregivers; and they make ensure that financial incentives for providers are aligned with the goals of the model. Figure 164 presents a case study of innovative models of care delivery for this patient group in Valencia, Spain. 530 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 164: Integrated Care Model for Complex Cases and Strategy for Chronic Care in the Valencia region, Spain Background : An evaluation of home care in Valencia conducted in 2005/06 identified fragmentation of care between different health care providers and barriers between the health and social se ctor for patients with advanced chronic diseases or in need of palliative care, a complex group associated with high level of need and use of resources. An initial pilot to integrate health care for complex patients was conducted between 2007 and 2010 and scaled -up subsequently. In parallel, policies were developed nationally and in the Valencia region to respond to an aging population and the rising prevalence of chronic disease and reorient the health care provision from acute episodes to chronic disease management. More recently, the Valencia region launched a comprehensive Strategy for Chronic Care, comprising an Integrated Care Model for Complex Cases and based on earlier experience. Objective : To improve care for complex chronic patients with multi -morbidity or in need of palliative care. Year established : Piloted from 2007 to 2010, with gradual scale -up from 2011. The wider Chronic Care Strategy was launched in 2014. Target group : The Integrated Care Model for Complex Cases targets patients at the apex of the Kaiser pyramid in need of complex chronic or palliative care. Electronic medical records (EMRs) are used to stratify the population monthly into \"Clinical Risk Groups\" (CRG) and id entify high -risk patients. EMRs cover approximately 4.7M people of an entire population of 5M in the Valencia region. Number of people enrolled : The model of care integration has been gradually expanded to cover approximately 1.2M patients in 2015 (26% of the population). Approximately 2.8% of general population covered are identified as \"complex cases\" using CRG, including palliative and multi -morbid patients. Profile of patients enrolled : Complex cases are typically characterized by: age 75 or older; pres ence of chronic complex multi -morbidity or in need of palliative care; polypharmacy; high use of hospital resources; use of assistive and vital technologies; functional dependencies; fragile family, low capacity for self -care, adverse social or economic ci rcumstances and high frequency of changes in clinical or nonclinical conditions. Key model features and main intervention(s) : The Strategy integrates hospital, primary and community -based health services, including hospital -at-home units and social workers , under a single management in each of the 24 health departments of the region. Social care, which is financed separately, is not formally integrated. Newly introduced hospital nurse case managers (HNCM) and community nurse care manager (CNCM) have joint responsibility for complex cases. HNCMs identify complex cases at hospitals and are responsible for planning hospital discharge to ensure continuity of care. CNCMs are responsible for mobilizing the collaborative care process in the community and for arrang ing care at home. This process starts with a comprehensive assessment of the \"case\" (patient, informal carers and the environment) by a CNCM. The assessment is shared with a multidisciplinary primary care team (GP, nurses and social workers) to draft a car e plan adapted to patient and family beliefs and preferences and including a medication review. Depending on the clinical and social complexity and acuity of the case, different resources, such as hospital -at-home, and other professionals are activated. Primary care physicians and their teams lead implementation of the plan with CNCM support. Both nurse care managers remain jointly responsible for monitoring the patient, interacting with multiple professionals and teams involved in the plan, ensuring approp riateness of care and continuity during transitions. HNCMs and CNCMs attend 100 hours of specific training and a month of on -the-job training as pre -requisite to start working as case manager. Other professionals receive ongoing training related to care i ntegration for complex cases. Financing and payment methods : The Strategy is financed by the region of Valencia through its ordinary health care budget. All providers are paid as usual and staff, including nurse case managers, are salaried. There are no financial incentives for providers or staff specific to the Strategy or the Care Model for Complex Cases. 531 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Information systems : An information system was implemented in the whole Valencia region in parallel to the Strategy. Each patient has a unique identifie r and care providers, mainly in primary care, use the system in their daily practice to share patient information through electronic medical records (EMR). Data generated by hospitals is in the process of being integrated. The system is also used for strat ifying the population and monitoring their conditions and drug use. Evaluation methods : The model was not formally evaluated in terms of effectiveness or cost -effectiveness. The Valencia Regional Health Ministry monitors process measures related to scale -up of the project and health care utilization. Evaluation results : Reduced unmet need through pro -active identification of complex cases, improved continuity of care, reduced emergency department visits and hospital admissions.

(585) State of the evidence In general, however, the evidence on the effectiveness of case management in improving outcomes and reducing costs remains weak. Furthermore, existing evidence also has to be interpreted with caution for a number of reasons. First, available evidence is often of poor quality. Rigorous methods, such as RCTs, are difficult to employ in evaluations of complex interventions. Reasons for this include , but are not limited to, the inability to conceal intervention versus control group allocation from patients and professionals, spill -overs or 'contamination' of intervention and control groups when services in both are delivered by the same provider orga nisations or professionals, poor protocol adherence, the effects of professional behaviour and local contexts on outcomes that are difficult to control for, or ethical and political reservations around having control groups and not providing an improved in tervention to all patients. Second, evidence is difficult to synthesise, interpret and to generalise to other settings or countries because interventions that include case management are often designed in unique local contexts and are heterogeneous across original studies. Control groups often receive 'usual care', which also varies significantly between countries; for examples, the roles and responsibilities of specific health care professionals involved in providing usual care are not the same between cou ntries. Most of the evidence is from the United States and only a small number of studies are available from Europe or other OECD member countries. This is a particular problem in applying evidence from the academic literature to the Austrian context becau se the United States health system relies on a mix of different private and public insurance and provider schemes and has, at the macro -level, little in common with Austrian social insurance and corporatist provider representation. 532 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Third, case management i s usually part of broader interventions designed to improve health care or health outcomes so that effects cannot be easily attributed to case management per se but, at best, to the entire intervention. These limitations of study quality and the evidence notwithstanding, recent literature reviews of the effectiveness of interventions for complex patients that include case management have generally concluded that case management has no effect on mortality and little to no effect on outcomes related to physi cal health. They have, however, found some evidence of positive effects on mental health status, functional status, patient satisfaction or process -related measures such as adherence to medication regimens and treatment guideline. Evidence of effects on he alth care utilisation or cost is even more limited and generally not conclusive, with some studies reporting savings and other studies no effects or increases. Evidence also indicates that interventions that include case management can be effective in spec ific subgroups of complex patients and when designed specifically for such subgroups. The 2016 Cochrane review of primary care -based interventions for multi -morbid patients, for example, concluded that narrow interventions were more likely to be successful than broader ones (545) . The body of evidence on case management in palliative care for patients with terminal illness is larger than for other patient subgroups and suggests that such interventions improve quality of life and symptom control, patient and caregiver satisfaction and can also reduce costs through reducing utilisation of curative care that may have limited effect near the end of life. Eviden ce also suggests that such interventions are at least equally as effective as usual health care near the end of life in terms of survival. Finally, studies of interventions that provide case management for patients who are frequent users of health hospital services or emergency rooms and aim to improve transitions between provider settings and care post -hospital discharge suggest that such interventions reduce utilisation and cost and can also improve health outcomes. Literature summarising the evidence on the effectiveness of case management in RTW interventions shows that case management, or, more generally, a formal assessment of the person out of work and personalised RTW plan, is a component of interventions that have a positive effect on work -related outcomes. Although the evidence shows that the effects achieved are small in magnitude, these studies also suggest cautiously that such interventions can be cost saving by offsetting costs of the service with accelerated return to work or increased employee productivity. Similar to health care for complex patient, case management it is usually part of broader RTW interventions and so that the effect cannot be easily attributed to case management per se based on these studies. Evidence shows that such RTW 533 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options interventions are more likely to be successful when they are provided early in the period of sickness absence, involve the workplace through elements such as improved communication between employers and care providers or adaptations to the workplace and are c omprehensive in their service coverage and multidisciplinary. Successful interventions for persons on sickness absence due to musculoskeletal problems also include increased physical activity. Evidence from the three case studies of case management in RTW interventions suggest that case management on its own may have limited effectiveness in terms of accelerating RTW or achieving sustained employment, especially when it is not targeted at and tailored for specific sub -groups of people who are out of work. It also needs to be pointed out that, based on the current state of research described above, policy makers should not expect quick and straight -forward efficiency gains from case management. Rather, case management can provide a means of improving the pro cess of care, is likely to improve satisfaction of beneficiaries and can achieve some improvements in health status or employment outcomes if provided to those people with the highest need. Particularly in the short term, however, it is also likely to requ ire additional investments for providing the case management service and, in the longer term, a sustained effort in changing established and provider -specific structures in care delivery. Although the evidence on the effects of case management on healthcar e costs is largely inconclusive as of yet, if targeted and executed appropriately, case management has the potential to reduce duplication and use of inappropriate services and can, together with improving the process of care or health outcomes, lead to efficiency gains. Such effects, can likely only be achieved in the longer run. This could also be a reason why many studies, that often use relatively short follow -up times of six to 24 months, do not find cost savings. Also, when case management is genuinel y and proactively targeted at the patients with the highest need, interventions can uncover unmet need, which might lead to additional health care utilisation and cost increases. Policy options: Case management There are several general implications for t he Austrian health and social care system that can be drawn from the international experience. These can be summarised as: 1. Target case management and other types of coordinated care based on need 2. Pilot new models, evaluate pilots rigorously and scale up s uccessful ones 3. Increase organisational and financial integration of providers 534 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 4. Ensure comprehensiveness of the range of services covered by case management 5. Include inter -disciplinary cooperation in education and training programs of professionals 6. Continue strengthening the role of primary care and embed case management in primary care 7. Provide workplace and return -to-work interventions early 8. Embed case management in broad return -to-work interventions Principles 1 through 5 apply to case management in general , regardless of whether it is used in health care for complex patients or by employment services to support rehabilitation and RTW. Principle 6 applies to case management for complex patients in health care only. The remaining principles apply to rehabilit ation and RTW programs only. For complex patients, the LSE Health and Commonwealth Fund International Experts Working Group on Patients with Complex Conditions provided a set of ten guiding principles (583) , one of which is care coordination . These ten principles are also relevant for Austria. It is also important to stress that the evidence clearly shows that success or failure of a given complex intervention that includes case management is highly context -dependent. Policy makers should the refore avoid copying successful models from other countries. Designing interventions specifically for the local context while taking into account factors for failure and success elsewhere and following some guiding principles is a preferable approach. Ther efore, these principles are relatively broad and do not provide ready -made solutions that can be implemented easily. Target case management and other types of coordinated care based on need Case management should be targeted at persons with the highest nee d who are most likely to benefit from such a service. Targeting according to need can increase equity and also efficiency of services, because evidence indicates that targeted case management interventions are more likely to be successful than broader ones . Although the agreement under article 15a of the Austrian federal constitution on organisation and financing of the health system provides a broad obligation for stakeholders in the health and social cares system to improve patient -orientation and service coordination, current legislation on specific applications of case management takes an entitlement -based approach and defines case management as an insurance benefit for specific groups of insured persons. In particular, case management is mentioned in th e contexts of services provided to persons, who are temporarily out of work and are eligible for rehabilitation allowance, employees who have health problems at work and for beneficiaries of long -term care insurance. Specifically , in the context of rehabilitation, the entitlement -535 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options based approach linked to the rehabilitation allowance, for example, implies that persons whose health status is too poor to be considered able to regain working capacity may not receive beneficial services . More generally, there is an inherent risk in this entitlement -based approach that other population groups who might also be amenable to case management, such as people with mental health problems, multi - morbid or other groups of complex patients, or the long -term unemployed and permanently disabled, are not prioritised as target groups. Evidence also suggests that targeted case management interventions are more likely to be successful than broader ones. Persons who can benefit from case management should be identified in a holistic and needs -based approach, using person -specific information on health status or service use, rather than a priori based on insurance status or the responsibilities of individual insurers. Generally, persons can be selected for case management, or other interventions, through screening, professional judgment or data -based algorithms. Each method of targeting has advantages and disadvantages and the selection of methods can influence the effectiveness of the intervention and equi ty in the distribution of services. Screening can achieve broad population coverage but might be impractical and expensive. Data -based algorithms offer an objective means of patient selection and equitable service distribution but are constrained by qualit y and availability of data. Professional judgment, on the other hand, can be more nuanced than data -based selection but is more likely to introduce bias and may lead to decisions in service provision that are based on factors other than need. However, data -based methods and clinical judgment can be combined sequentially to achieve a balance, for example, through automated analysis of patient -level data as a first step and subsequent decisions by professionals. Sources of routine data, such as claims databas es maintained by insurers or EHRs ( Elektronische Gesundheitsakte - ELGA ), should be used where possible for the purpos e of targeting case management. In addition to targeting case management to patients with the highest and most complex needs, other types of coordinated care delivery should be provided to appropriate population groups, as sug gested by the Kaiser Pyramid . This can include continued roll -out of disease management programs, which have been shown to be successful for patients with lower complex ity (586) but are not suitable for complex patients. It should also be noted that case management is not the only appropriate approach to care for patients with complex needs. Rather, case management is usually provided in combination with other changes to health care delivery and there may be a range of suitable interventions. The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) research group, for example, provides a recent and general taxonomy of ' interventions designed to improve professional practice and the delivery of effective health services ' (524) . The EPOC group distinguishes between four dom ains, 'delivery arrangements', 'financial 536 Volume 1: arrangements' and 'implementation strategies' , and provides a number of categories in each of them. The category, ' coordination of care and management of care processes ' in the domain of delivery arrangements includes case management. This principle of targeting should also apply to case management provided by employment services with the goal of accelerating rehabilitation and RTW. Persons can be targeted based on different criteria than for case management of complex cases in health care, but case management should als o be provided to those persons who can benefit most. Broad RTW interventions that provide the same service to all persons on sickness absence are less likely to be effective in terms of RTW than targeted services that can provide more intensive support to a narrower group of beneficiaries. Particularly in RTW programs where beneficiaries might not always have a regular contact with service providers in health or social care, persons who are most amenable to case management might often be difficult to reach. Achieving high enrolment rates among the target population, has, for example, been found to be a significant problem in the Austrian Fit2Work program (568) . This requires engaging in active outreach in addition to making services available to the appropriate target group. Pilot new models, evaluate pilots rigorously and scale up successful ones Given the limited evidence on the effectiveness of case management and the dependence on context, models should be piloted and accompanied by rigorous evaluations. They can be adjusted subsequently to reflect insights from early evaluations, retaining successful elements, and scaled up gradually. Policy should avoid funding isolated pilot projects without addressin g follow -on incentives or requirements that lead to adoption of successful models and the discontinuation or redesign of unsuccessful ones. The German Innovation Fund ( Innovationsfonds ) provides a useful example of how policy can encourage such an approach (587) . Innovative models are selected to receive financial support by a central committee based on a funding applica tion and a formal evaluation is required. Successful programs are required by law to be scaled up throughout the country. Increase organisational and financial integration of providers Linked to the first point on combining case management with other chang es to the delivery of health care, policy should aim to achieve greater integration in the organisation and financing of the Austrian health and social care system. Continued fragmentation is likely to present an obstacle to coordinated care for complex pa tients, including case management that comprises services from all sectors of the system (588) . In particular, separate financing streams for hospit als, office -based primary and specialist care and 537 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options social care services are not conducive to coordinated or integrated service delivery and provide no incentive for clinically meaningful substitution between services, for instance between hospitals and prim ary care providers. Also, the large number of separate insurers and corporatist stakeholders in the system have been identified as a barrier to a more strategic approach to integration and quicker take -up of initiatives at the state -level (588) . International experience with case management for complex patients indicates that financial incentives that encourage coordination are a necessary, but in an d of themselves an insufficient, condition for providers to adopt coordinated approaches to care. This includes compensating professionals who take on the role of case managers, such as primary care nurses or physicians, for the time spent with patient assessment, planning and execution of care plans, and removing fee -for-service payments in favour of pooled budgets across different provider settings that incentivise the provision of services in the appropriate setting. In the Netherlands, for example, ther e are bundled payments for chronic care, which comprise prevention, early detection, treatment and rehabilitation (588) . The lack of financial incentives has been identified as a barrier to success of prior case management programs in Austria, which were funded from the state health funds introduced in 2005 (540,588) . Ensure comprehensiveness of the range of services covered by case management Efforts to integrate care for complex patients need to take a genuinely comprehensive approach and do not ' carve out' specific services. In some countries, this has in the past often been the case with mental health or social care, which may be subject to separate financing mechanisms and constraints from physical health care or separated as a result of organisational and cultural barriers. Although mental health care is funded through the same arrangements as physical health care in many OECD countries (589) , it is often less prominent in policy debates and considered to be a field of medicine that is distinct from physical health. However, mental and physical health are strongly interrelated. Mental health problems frequently co -occur with physical illnesses and both types of illnesses may have mutually compounding effects. Moreover, people with mental health problems often receive poor care for their physical health need s. As a result, mental health patients have significantly higher mortality and morbidity related to physical health (590 -594) . For patients with complex needs , who, by definition, include a high number of people with a combination of physical and mental health problems, care for mental health needs to be integrated with physical health. The principle of comprehensiveness should also apply to case management pro vided by employment services with the goal of accelerating rehabilitation and RTW. Contrary to case management for complex 538 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options patients in primary care, case management for people who are temporarily unfit to work is often provided by public employment service s in other countries. However, even if the case management service is provided by employment service or disability insurance, it should cover the full range of health and social care services required to address all personal needs in the rehabilitation pro cess. This can help prevent jobseekers with health problems from slipping into reliance on longer -term disability or pension benefits. It also requires integration in the funding of various services to avoid shifting beneficiaries between benefit schemes, which is costly and unproductive for society and the person concerned. Include inter -disciplinary cooperation in education and training programs of professionals Effective case management requires that professionals who take on case management responsibil ities are adequately trained and that, more broadly, education for all professions involved in delivering health and social includes principles of interdisciplinary cooperation. Many prior examples of case management have relied on nurses to provide such s ervices, because they already possess sufficient knowledge of clinical care and the health care system and can be trained relatively easily to act as strong coordinators of services provided by other health professionals. This does not necessarily imply th at case managers have to be qualified nurses. However, successful models from other countries, such as those described in the case studies, usually establish formal job profiles for case managers and include training elements for case managers as well as o ther professionals involved. Continue strengthening the role of primary care and embed case management in primary care Coordination of care delivery should go beyond disease management that is implemented on top of current structures and aim to genuinely c hange existing structures in the delivery of care, particularly in the outpatient sector and in bridging in - and outpatient care. Evidence and the case studies reviewed in this section of the report indicate that interventions often suffer from insufficien t take -up or poor protocol adherence by providers. It is therefore important that case management, and other forms of care coordination, becomes in integral part of care delivery. This includes a continued effort to strengthen the role of primary care, enc ouraging multi -disciplinary primary care teams and moving away from the traditional model of the individual family physician practice and placing greater responsibility for the entire process of care with primary care providers. The responsibility for cas e management of complex patients should be placed within primary care. Experience from Germany and the United States suggests that case management and similar forms of care coordination provided by health insurers, often through remote coordinators, are no t successful in 539 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options improving care or outcomes for complex patients. If provided by a single insurer, such case management programs run the risk of focusing only on the services paid by the specific insurer rather than a comprehensive range based on patient ne ed and can add an additional layer of complexity to service delivery. On the contrary, case management can be more effective when case managers are embedded in provider organisations, in particular in primary care. Approaches that place case managers with insurance funds may thus not be the preferred approach. Rather, insurers could provide payments that provide appropriate incentives to primary care providers who take on the responsibility of case management. Although some prior examples of case management in the Austrian health and social care system (540) have focused on patient groups that can likely benefit, such as complex patients discharged from hospital, greater efforts should be made to identify and target the patients with the highest need proactively and embed case management in provider organisat ions rather than with insurers. Provide workplace and return -to-work interventions early Programs to reduce sickness absence should not only include reactive RTW programs, but be integrated into the work place and comprise preventive components, in particu lar for high -risk groups, such as employees with mental health problems. For people already on sickness absence, the probability of RTW is high early during sickness absence. Although there is no universal and precise definition in the literature of 'early ' in terms of days, weeks or months (538) , interventions should target such persons in the first few weeks of absence. Guidance by the UK NICE recommends that, if considered appropriate for the person based on an initial assessment, a case manager be appointed within the first two to six weeks of sickness absence (538) . Embed case management in broad return -to-work interventions There is no evidence that case management on its own improves work -related outcomes in RTW interventions. Rather, case management can be an element of successful interventions but these should also address a range of needs that cannot be addressed by improving the coordination of existing services. When provided by insurers, RTW programs should actively involve the employer and the workplace, for instance through adapting working conditions to allow for earlier RTW or permitting a phased RTW, and provide a range of needs -based support to persons on sickness absence, such as exercise for persons with musculoskeletal conditions or counselling for persons with mental health problems. 540 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Legal considerations No particular constitutional impediments have to be faced with re spect to these options, but some legal amendments would be required. 541 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 8 Additional efficiency potentials Chapter 8 outlines additional ways to improve efficiency within healthcare systems. Specifically, this chapter explores issues related to administrative costs, healthcare fraud and business processes. Typologies of waste in healthcare systems Berwick and Hackbarth (2012) identified six categories of waste in the healthcare system - failures of care delivery, failures of care coordination, overtreatment, pricing failures, fraud and abuse, and lastly, administrative complexity (see Table 91) (595) . Table 91: Forms of waste within healthcare systems (Berwick and Hackbarth, 2012) Form of waste Description Care delivery failure Poor delivery of healthcare services that fail to maximise patient outcomes with given resources Care coordination failure Failure to coordinate patient care across relevant healthcare providers within all levels of the system Overtreatment Provision of unnecessary services Pricing failures Where prices deviate from those expected within 'well -functioning markets' Administrative complexity Inefficient processes that led to unnecessary administrative tasks Fraud Costs caused by those who intentionally abuse the system for their own gain Source: (595) This report has previously discussed waste regarding care delivery (for example, see section 3.5), care coordination ( for example, section 6.1) and overtreatment (for example, see section 3.5). This chapter explores two outstanding forms of waste, namely administrative costs, and healthcare fraud . For each 542 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options category of waste, the financial cost in Austria has been compared with sim ilar coun tries. Based on these findings, a range of policy options have been developed to further reduce waste in the healthcare system. Administration costs Administrative costs within the healthc are system represent funds spent on activities not direc tly targeted at improving health outcomes (596) . At the health insurance level, administration costs can include claims processing, planning, management, regulation and collection of funds (596) . A relatively high proportion of healthcar e costs consumed by administrative tasks is viewed as wasteful, and is therefore often the first component governments/payers try to cut (597) . Such treatment of administrative costs should be approached with caution, given administration represents a core element of running any healthcare system. Further, additional administration is often required to meet new policy objectives targeted at measuri ng health performance. Therefore, higher administration costs can in fact assist improvements in healthcare quality (597) . For example, P4P schem es involve additional data collection, reporting and analysis, and thus lead to higher administration costs. For the reasons outlined above, it is not always appropriate to equate administration with wasteful spending. Thus any analysis of trends in healt h administration costs should aim to tease out administrative outputs that contribute little to no additional value (597) . Administration costs within Austrian social insurance Administration costs across all insurance types In 2015, administration expenditure within Austria's social insurance system totalled \u20ac1.2 billion, which on average, accounted for 2% of total income. The figure below outlines actual administration cost (in million euros) as well as administrations costs as a proportion of income for each of the three insurance pillars. Findings from the figure show that pension insurance recorded the highest gross expe nditure on administration at \u20ac596 million, followed by health (\u20ac459 million) and accident (\u20ac121 million). This order is reversed when measuring administration costs as a proportion of total income. Specifically, 7.7% of total income within accident insuran ce was spent on administration followed by health (2.7%) and pension (1.5%). 543 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 165: Administration costs (gross in millions, and % of income) by insurance type (2015) Source: Data from Verwaltungsstatistik (2015) and Fina nzstatistik (2015) = Left -hand side, RHS = Right -hand side. Administration costs by social health insurance carrier In 2012, a simplified more transparent system for setting administration cost targets, as a proportion of contributions paid, w as introduced (\u00a7441e ASVG ). Social insurance carriers as well as the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, and the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs must agree to these targets. An overview of actual (2015) and set (for 2017) adm inistrative costs for each health insurance carrier has been depicted in the figure below. The figure suggests that those carriers offering multiple forms of insurance (e.g. health, accident and/or pensions) have higher administration costs, which could ar ise from diseconomies of scope. The latest administration cost targets were calculated using historical administration costs as a proportion of contribution incomes (i.e. between 2008 and 2010 ). Specifically, the average historical administrat ion cost plus an additional 0.4 percentage points of the historical value, plus an additional amount to cover costs arising from changes to the law. Once the cap has been set, social health insurance carriers do not have the power to change Social insurance total Administration and accounting costs total (LHS) Administration and accounting costs in % of income (RHS)544 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Implementi ng simpler more transparent administrative cost caps is a positive move, however, efficiency potentials arising from this policy are not being maximised. For example, high (low) administrative costs are not linked to penalties (rewards), further, adherence to the cap is neither published nor analysed. Figure 166: Actual (2015) and set administrative costs (2017) as a proportion of contributions paid Source: Based on data from Verwaltungsstatistik 2015 and HVSV BSC 2017. Averag e administrative costs per person for individual social health insurance carriers has also be examined and outlined in the figure below (total figure including dependents) . Administrative costs pe r insure range between just \u20ac13 and \u20ac138 , with the average c ost equating to \u20ac75. It is important to note that the majority of administrative costs associated with BKKs is borne by the employer, and therefore not directly comparable with other health insurance goal (2017)545 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 167: Averag e administrative costs per person by social health insurance carrier (2015) (including dependents) Source: Data from Finanzstatistik 2015, Hauptverband and Handbuch der \u00d6sterreichischen Sozialversicherung, 2016. Caution should be taken when interpreting administrative costs per insurance carrier above. Specifically, lower administrative costs doesn't necessarily indicate greater efficiency given figures do not take into account relevant factors such as: Number of claims Differences in benefits Healthcare risks within the insured population Geographical distribution of insured population Administrative costs related to provision of services (e.g. hospitals, dental clinics, rehabilitation centres) . For th is reason, comparison of administrative costs is more informative when taken at the national aggregate level and compared to similar healthcare systems, that is, social health insurance International comparisons and policy options International administration costs within healthcare systems Methodology and caveats To compare healthcare expenditure and financing data across numerous countries, the OECD developed a System of Health Accounts (SHA), which is based on common concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules (598) . SHA therefore, in theory, provides a framework for uniform reporting which enables cross -country comparisons and analysis of trends over time (598) . Health administratio n activities, as defined by SHA, include 'planning, management, regulation, and collection of funds and handling of claims of the delivery system', and exclude administration from healthcare providers (598) . To date, OECD provides the highest -quality comparisons of healthcare administration costs, however, a number of caveats exist. Namely: Administrative costs are likely to be underestimated as they exclude healthcare provider costs Countries are not always cle ar on what should be included within 'administrative expenditure', however, the OECD have found that from 'limited feedback' most countries use similar methods Difficulty disentangling healthcare costs and costs within other forms of care (e.g. social car e) and general government activities, which can lead to non -reporting Identifying available data sources Administrative costs may be the responsibility of a different agency than the health ministry/department, and therefore may be omitted An appropriate level of administrative costs does not exist, therefore developing a goal level of administrative cost is difficult Administrative costs across countries are not necessarily directly comparable given health insurance carrier responsibilities differ (e.g. all healthcare, or just outpatient care, as in Austria) (597,599) . Social health insurance administrative costs Figure 168 provides an overview of administrative costs financing scheme as a proportion of current health expenditure (CHE),107 for countries with social health insurance systems - Austria, Belgium, Fran ce, 107 The following criteria were used within OECD SHA to calculate costs: Function - governance and health system and financing administration; Financing scheme - government schemes, compulsory contributory health insurance schemes/CMSA, and voluntary prepayme nt schemes; Measure - share of current expenditure on health (see link for relevant platform: http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA ) . 547 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland. This report has only explored these countries given the significant impact of organisational and financial structu re on administration costs (600) . Results from the data show that Austria, relat ive to other SHI countries, has low administrative costs at 3.7% of CHE. Of this amount, 54% can be attributed to compulsory health insurance, 42% to voluntary prepay ments and 5% to government schemes. These proportions differ across countries , for example, in Germany, 94% of administrative costs relate to those accrued within compulsory health insurance schemes. Lastly, the figure for France could be considered an outlier at 6.1%, which reflects the high proportion of people who purchase voluntary health insurance to cover OOP payments (i.e. approximately 95%).108,109 Figure 168: Administrative costs by financing scheme, % current health expenditure (2014) * Source: (52) Note: Government schemes - Administrative and operational services related to compulsory 108 Private health insurance is associated with higher administration cost, for example, due to administrative tasks to assess an individual's risk, set appropriate premiums, designing benefits packages, and reimbursing/refusing claims (7(602) ). 109 Private health insurance is associated with higher administration cost, for example, due to administrative tasks to assess an individual's risk, set appropriate premiums, designing benefits packages claims (7(602) ). 2.4%2.0%2.5%2.1%3.3% 4.6% 2.8%3.5%3.7%4.0%4.2%4.6%4.9%6.1% 0.0%1.0%2.0%3.0%4.0%5.0%6.0%7.0% Belgium Austria Switzerland Netherlands Luxembourg Germany France Government schemes Compulsory health insurance schemes Voluntary prepayment schemes548 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options governmental health delivery schemes, involving the provision of benefits due to sickness, childbirt h or temporary disablement.

The data from Figure 168 has been broken down in Figure 169 to show administrative costs for compulsory health insurance only. Similar to overall administrative costs, it is evident that administrative costs within Austria's s ocial health insurance sy stem are low (at 1.97%). Czypionka et al . (2017) noted that this is likely due to: a) the non -competitive nature of the insurance market (i.e. no choice of provider), which means insurance carriers do not expend funds on marketing/advertising; b) bundled transaction costs across service providers; and c) no upfront patient costs that require patient reimbursement and management of significant number of claims (as is the case in France and Switzerland) (603) . Germany recorded the highest administrative costs across the seven countries at 4.56%. Reasons for this may include: Low economics of scale due to the high number of sickness funds (over 100 competing sickness funds) The nature of the German health insurance system, which r equire sickness funds to negotiate prices and packages from individual service providers at both the regional and national level (603) .

Findings from the data show that amalg amation may not necessarily result in greater efficiency as measured by lower adm inistrat ive costs . Specifically, in Germany, administration costs continued to rise despite the falling number of sickness funds. Only legislative changes in 2004 were able to limit administrative costs within the country's social health insurance system. Figure 170: Number of sickness funds and administrative costs (% total expenditure) (Ger many, 1994 - 2015 ) Note: LHS = Left axis, RHS = right axis. Similar findings occurred in Switzerland where the number of carriers fell significantly between 200 6 and 2016 (i.e. from 87 to 57).

For example, within a competitiv e environment, although carriers may amalgamate, they continue to compete by trying to select insurees with good risks, which results in higher administrative costs (604) . Administrative costs across all healthcare system typologies Figure 172 maps out administration costs across the following types of health care systems - tax funded, health insurance (single payer), health insur ance (multiple insurers with no competition), and health insurance (multiple insurers with competition). In general, single funded systems have lower administration costs compared to those that have multiple insurers (payers). Differences in administrative costs between single and multiple payers may arise from differences in economies of scale (for example, multiple payers have multiple collection agencies, exemption policies and claims processing systems) (597,601) . Further, multi -payer systems require sophisticated risk -adjustment mechanisms to ensure all insurers are on the same 'level playing field'. Such systems are costly and require updating (597) . Multiple insurers with competition have the highest administrative costs, given the associated marketing and advertising costs, developing and executing multiple selective contracts, and keeping the list of insured people up -to-date. 2.5%2.4%2.5% 2.5%2.5%2.4%2.5% 2.6% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 00.511.522.53 2004 2005 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Switzerland551 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 172: Administrative costs across different types of healthcare systems (2014) Source: (52) Summary There exist systematic differences in administrative costs across different types of healthcare systems. Specifically, healthcare systems that have a single payer and/or in systems whereby insurers do not compet e have lower administrative costs. Austria, being a country with multiple healthcare payers (i.e. health insurance carriers) that do not compete, has neither high nor low administrative expenditures when compared to all forms of healthcare systems. Given significant differences across healthcare system types (see Figure 172), administration costs in Austria should only be compared with other social h ealth insurance systems, namely, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Using the latest available data from the OECD (2014), it is evident that across social health insurance systems, Austria has the lowest administrative costs at 1.97% of current health expenditure. Caution should be taken when interpreting results given there are numerous caveats associated with using and comparing this type of cost data across countries. 3.7% 0.0%1.0%2.0%3.0%4.0%5.0%6.0%7.0% New Zealand Ireland Canada Spain Australia United Kingdom Denmark Portugal Italy Finland Sweden Iceland Norway Luxembourg Slovenia Korea Greece Poland Hungary France Austria Japan Mexico Germany Israel Slovak Republic Netherlands Switzerland Belgium Czech Republic Government schemes Compulsory health insurance schemes Voluntary prepayment schemesTax funded health systemHealth insurance (single payer)Health insurance (multiple -no competition)Health insurance (multiple - competition)552 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: Administration costs Relative t o other social insurance systems, Austria has low administration costs. However, among social insurance carriers there exists significant variability, with administrative costs per insurance case (exclud ing dependents) ranging from \u20ac18 (BKK) to \u20ac188 (VAEB) (see Figure 167). It is unclear whether these disparities are justified by factors such as number of claims, differences in benefits and /or geographical distribution of insurees. For this reason, it is recommended that a detailed study into factors impacting administration costs at the individual insurance carrier level be undertaken. Based on the study's findings, a more appropriate system for developing administration cost caps could be implemented. Specifically , given targets are set a bove historical rates (i.e. 0.4 percentage points above), carriers have already achieved their target (see Figure 166), thus removing any incentive to reduce administrative costs. Instead of using historical values, administrative cost targets could be based o n potential economies of scale arising from mor e streamlined administrative functions. For example, by implementing structural models 1, 2 or 3, or by coordinating current activities, as proposed under model 4. If, however, the current calculation method is retained, it is recommended that health insur ance carriers be required to document how additional administration costs were spent. For example, to improve overall health system performance by collecting and analysing additional data to monitor quality of care. Such activities may in the medium - to lo ng-term increase overall system performance and savings, which could be used to enhance front -line services. Concurrently, it is advised that social health insurers be encouraged to implement practices that reduce other forms of administration costs, that is, those that do not directly enhance service provision. Legal considerations No particular constitutional impediments have to be faced in this respect. Healthcare fraud Definition of healthcare fraud A number of researchers and institutions have developed succinct definitions of fraud (also commonly referred to as corruption) within the healthcare sector. The definition used by the European Healthcare Fraud & Corruption Network (EHFCN) refers to that developed by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (USA), which differs according to whether corruption occurs in the public or private sector: 553 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 'Passive corruption in the public sector occurs whenever a public official, directly or indirectly, intentionally or in circumstances where it should have been known to him or her, requests or receives any undue advantage for himself or herself or for a third person, or accepts an offer or a promise of such advantage, in order to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her official functions' 'Directly or through an intermediary, requesting or receiving an undue advantage of any kind, or accept ing the promise of such an advantage, for oneself or a third party, while in any capacity directing or working for a private sector entity, in order to perform or refrain from performing any act, in breach of one's duties.' Source: (605) Transparency International, an international non -profit, non -governmental organisation dedicated to combating corruption, along with Vian (2007) define corruption more succinctly as misuses of entrusted power for one's private gain (606,607) . Types of healthcare fraud Multiple studies summarise types of fraud in the healthcare sector. Of most significance are the typologies developed by Vian (2007) and Transparency International (2016), which can be grouped by the following themes: Financial and workforce management Delivery of healthcare services Regulation Research and development Marketing Product distribution and storage Budget and resource management Governance (further details provided in the table below). Types of fraud in Austria's healthcare system include informal payments, favouritism, and instances of doctors in public hosp itals encouraging patients towards private health care facilities. For example, a report undertaken by Czypionka et al . (2007) found that 15% of respondents (nine in total) had been suggested that they visit a private clinic to ensure an earlier operation date (608) . 554 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 92: Types of fraud in the healthcare sector Type of fraud Examples Financial and workforce management Inappropriate selection for jobs, promotions and training Accreditation of health professionals Absenteeism Embezzlement and misuse of funds Up coding User fee revenue Delivery of healthcare services Informal payment from patients Unnecessary referrals and procedures Private use of public products, equipment, facilities or time Favouritism by healthcare providers for certain clients Overcharging for services or providing inferior services Manipulation of outcome data Unnecessary referrals and procedures Regulation Inappropriate approval of products Improper product quality inspection Improper approval of professional accreditation Inappropriate health facility/workers certification Abuse of power Research and development Abuse of researching funding systems Improper trial/study design 555 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Type of fraud Examples Misleading dissemination of results Conflict of interest Recruitment for trials Marketing Improper inducements to healthcare providers and facilities Improper advertisement Improper advertisement Improper post -marketing trials/studies False or misleading product claims Disease/fear mongering Product distribution and storage Theft and diversion of products Infiltration of falsified and substandard products (biased application of accreditation, certification or licensing procedures and standards) Re-packaged non -sterile and expired products Budget and resource management Payroll management Governance Abuse of power Source: (606,609) Causes of healthcare fraud Weak internal controls and minimal government oversight, foster fraud a nd error amongst citizens and agency employees within a social welfare system. For example, if there is a perception that the penalty for committing fraudulent behaviour is unlikely or minimal, individuals are more likely to engage in such behaviour. 556 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The h ealthcare sector is susceptible to fraud for a number of reasons (see figure below for the perception of corruption in a range of sectors) (610) . These include, but are not limited to: information asymmetry (where the provider has more information/knowledge than the patient), patient susceptibility, complexity of products and services, uncertainty (e.g. outcomes from treatment), significant amounts of public money, sector decentralis ation/fragmentation, opaque pricing (i.e. supply and demand do not determine the 'right' market price), and the high -level of private sector involvement (597,609) . Figure 173: Corruption perception across sect ors in EU OECD countries versus EU non -OECD countries (2014) Source: (611) Note: data not available at the country level. Consequences of healthcare fraud Measuring the financial cost of fraud and medical error has gained prominence among policy -makers and researchers over the last 15 -20 years. This is reflected by the growing number of agreements and studies estimating this type of waste. For example, the n umber of fraud and error measurement exercises increased from 25 to 268 between years 1997 -2001 to 2012 -2016 (612) . The majority of this work has been undertaken in the US with the introduction of the Improper Payments Information Act (IPA) (2002), 31% 55% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70% Political parties Politicians * Officials awarding public tenders Officials issuing building permits Private companies Inspectors Police, customs Officials issuing business permits Banks and financial institutions Healthcare system Courts Tax authorities Public prosecution service Social security and welfare Education sector Average of 20 EU OECD countries Average of 7 EU non-OECD countries557 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options which mandates US public authorities to: a) identify programs and activities that may be susceptible to improper payments (payment that should not have been made or that was of the incorrect amount); and b) to estimate the annual cost of the improper payment (613) . In Europe, no legal requirement to measure fraud and error has been implemented, however, in 2004, 28 EU member states agreed to the European Healthcare Fraud and Corru ption Declaration . The declaration outlines eight objectives, including the 'development of a European common standard or risk measurement, with annual statistically valid follow - up exercises to measure progress in reducing losses to fraud and corruption t hroughout the EU' (614) . In addition to financial consequences, fraud and error in the healthcare sector has both direct and indirect negative impacts on patients and h uman lives. For example, through provision of substandard medicines, inequality in access to care (e.g. through informal payments), distorted allocation of resources and poor quality care. In addition to these, fraud and error has an adverse impact on heal thcare budgets. For the purpose of this review, only specific information on the financial consequences of fraud and error have been explored. Cost of healthcare fraud As outlined with the OECD's 2016 paper, 'Tackling Wasteful Spending on Health', mea suring the frequency and associated cost of fraud and error in the healthcare sector is challenging (615) . Reasons for this are: the existence of multiple definitions for what constitutes fraud and error in the healthcare sector, the inability to define and contain fraud into one basic metric that can be adopted by different countries, and the f act that fraudulent activities are hidden. Despite these caveats, several international studies have been undertaken to measure the cost of fraud in the healthcare sector (see table below for further details). Using data from the various studies, it could be stated that approximately 5 -6% of all healthcare spending is lost to fraud (with estimates ranging from 0.01% in the UK to 10% in the US). Given the shortcomings outlined above, results from the studies are not comparable across countries. Further, cau tion should be taken when interpreting figures of detected healthcare fraud as these are likely to be underestimated (612) . 558 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 93: Overview of studies estimating the cost of fraud in the healthcare s ector Author Year Country Cost NHS Protect 2016 UK \u00a36.5 billion lost to fraud in 2015 -16 or 0.01% of NHS net expenditure National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance 2016 Belgium Health insurers unjustly billed \u20ac 11.6 million Gee & Button 2015 UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand 6% of total healthcare between 1997 -2013 CNAMTS (France) 2014 France \u20ac200 million lost to healthcare fraud in 2014 (or 1% of health insurance benefits) Ley & Button 2013 Italy 5.59% of healthcare expenditure, on average Association of Health Insurance Funds 2013 Germany Detected \u20ac43 million in fraud Accenture 2013 US Between 2 -10% of healthcare spending is lost to fraud (on average, this costs US$60 billion) 559 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Author Year Country Cost EHFCN 2013 EU countries \u20ac56 billion lost annually to fraud and error EHFCN 2010 Germany 5-8% of total healthcare in 2010 Source: See country profiles (in addition to (610) ). Multiple countries The most commonly referred to study on the cost of fraud and error in the healthcare sector is undertaken by Gee & Button, who provide frequent estimate s across a number of countries (616) . Within their calculations, the authors include the following area s to measure healthcare fraud: fraudulent sickness certificates, prescription fraud by pharmacists and patients, in addition to fraud and error concerning: capitated payments to GPs and doctors to manage a patient's care, evasion of dental charges by patients, opticians regarding eye tests, healthcare organisation employees, inpatient, long -term, home and community -based services, provision of services and s upplies, health insurance for children, foster care, and finally, childcare (617) . The latest available report is from 2015 and includes the following six countries: UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Australia, and Ne w Zealand. Results from the study show that, on average, 6% of total health expenditure (or \u00a3229 billion) was lost to fraud and error between 1997 and 2013 (see figure below ) (616) .110 110 The authors do not disaggregate betwee n the total cost by fraud and the total cost of medical errors. 560 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 174: Proportion of healthcare expenditure lost due to fraud and error (1997 -2013) Source: (616) Note: Data not provided at the country level. Belgium The Medical Evaluation and Inspection Department (MEID) within the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance in Belgium is responsible for ensuring the accountability of healthcare providers, and deter fraudsters and abusers. The latest available data show that healthcare providers inappropriately billed \u20ac11.6 million to health insurance. Of this amount, \u20ac5.3 million was r eimbursed by health insurance on a voluntary basis (618) . Italy In Italy there are 12 main drivers of fraud in the healthcare sector, four are associated with supply -side and 12 on the demand -side (see the table below for further details) (619) . A report undertaken by Ley and Button (2013) estimated that the average rate of fraud in the country's healthcare system is 5.59%, with a minimum and maxim um rate of 3.29% and 10%, respectively (619) . As a proportion of total health expenditure, this translates into \u20ac6 billion a year (619) . 0.60%6.19%15.40% 0.00%5.00%10.00%15.00%20.00% Lowest percentage loss Average percentage loss Highest percentage loss561 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 94: Drivers of corruption in Italy's healthcare sector Demand -side drivers Supply -side drivers Uncertain or weak regulatory framework Information gaps across health system users Fragmentation for the demand for health services Political interference in technical - administrative choices System complexity Far-reaching powers Low level of accountability Low ethical standards Information gap between health system and private suppliers Growth of private health care Pack of transparency in use of resources Germany A report undertaken by EHFCN estimated that between 5-8% of healthcare expenditure was lost to fraud and corruption, specifically from: Billing for series that were never rendered Providing unnecessary treatments or tests Up-coding (billing for a more expensive diagnosis than was provided) Falsifying or exaggerating the severity of a patient's illness Kickbacks for referrals Offering incentives to actual or potential referrals Counterfeit drugs (620) . The cost of fraud among social insurance carriers in Germany has also be calculated. In 2013 -14, for example, t he Association of Health Insurance Funds detected \u20ac43 million in fraud (615) . United King dom Each year NHS Protect, which works to protect NHS staff and resource from crime, publishes an annual report providing an estimate on the cost of fraud, bribery and corruption. In 2015 -16, NHS Protect 562 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options received 5,000 reports concerning fraud and corrupt ion, of these, 900 were investigated. Following the conclusion of investigations, NHS Protect in collaboration with Local Counter Fraud Specialists (LCFS) in 2015 -16 estimated the total cost fraud in healthcare at \u00a36.5 million. This figure equates to 0.01% of NHS net expenditure within the same financial year (621,622) . Finally, as noted in NHS Protect's 2015 -16 annual report, the organisation is currently investigating allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption that equate to over \u00a325 million (622) . Strategies to combat potential sources of healthcare fraud Findings from the literature Within the peer -reviewed literature on healthcare corruption, Vian, T. is one of the most cited researchers. In 2008, Vian released a paper outlining a conceptual model of corrupti on in the healthcare sector . Within this framework, six institutional factors that impact the level and opportunity for healthcare fraud have been identified, na mely: monopoly power, discretion, accountability, citizen voice, transparency and enforcement (606) . Each of these factors and aligning high -level strategies have been explained in detail in Table 95. Table 95: Institution factors impacting corruption in the healthcare sector Institution factor impacting level of corruption Description Example high -level strategies Monopoly power Monopoly powe r refers to a situation where there is only one provider of healthcare goods and services. Such a situation limits individual choice and increases the opportunity for corruption (e.g. the provider may demand bribes to access certain services). Reforms to separate payer and provider Privatisation Discretion Discretion describes the situation where a government agency has full autonomy over Create a system of checks and balances 563 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Institution factor impacting level of corruption Description Example high -level strategies key decisions in the healthcare sector. High levels of discretion increase the likelihood of corruption. across different people/departments Strengthening information systems Develop standard operation policies and procedures that all must follow Accountability Accountability ensures that providers are held accountab le to the objectives and services they are funded to deliver. Low levels of accountability encourage corruption. Robust information systems outlining how inputs are translated into outputs Incentives that rewards (penalises) good (bad) performance Citizen voice Citizen voice refers to mechanisms that allow individuals to actively participate in the planning and provision of services. High levels of citizen involvement reduce the possibility of corruption. Implementation of local health boards Patient surveys Complaint offices Transparency Transparency is closely related to accountability, and specifies that providers disclose information on decision making processes and performance. Legally enforced disclosure of information 564 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Institution factor impacting level of corruption Description Example high -level strategies Greater transparency lowers the possibility of corruption. Publically available information performance Detection and enforcement Detection and enforcement relates to the 'steps' taken to collate evidence on corruption and penalise those who are caught engaging in suc h practices. Better detection and enforcement policies lower the possibility of corruption. Surveillance Internal security Investigations Anonymous centres for reporting corruption Source: (606) 565 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 175: Conceptual framework of corruption in the healthcare sector Source: Taken directly from (Vian, 2008) (606) More recently, Gaitonde et al . (2016) undertook a review of interventions aimed at reducing corruption in the healthcare sector (623) . The interventions identified within the review can be broken down into seven categories, which largely overlap with those produced by Vian (2008). Specif ically, information dissemination, detection and enforcement, establishment of an independent agency, transparency and accountability, discretion, incentives, and monopolies (623) . Interventions within each of these categories were then assessed according to their impact on corruption (as well as adverse effects, resource use, and health and health outcomes). Results from this exercise show that informati on dissemination, detection and enforcement, transparency and accountability, and establishing an independent agency (who coordinates anti -corruption behaviour) had desirable effects on corruption. However, there was only high certainty of evidence for the impact of an independent agency. The impact of remaining factors on corruption had medium to very low certainty of evidence and have therefore not been reported in this review (623) . 566 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options International case studies: Strategies to address healthcare fraud This section outlines healthcare fraud and error strategies implemented within Australia, Belgium, France and the UK. Arrangements for each of the instituti onal factors, as identified by Vian's conceptual framework (2008), have been mapped for each of the countries outlined above. Although each country has adopted a unique approach to combating healthcare fraud, one component they all have in common is the e xistence of a specific institution/body responsible for addressing healthcare fraud. Australia In Australia, fraud against the Australian Government is defined as 'dishonestly obtaining a benefit, or causing a loss, by deception or other means' (624) . The Audit and Fraud Control Branch of the Austr alian Federal Department of Health is responsible for detecting and investigating cases of fraud within the healthcare system. Specifically, for fraud that occurs within Medicar e (universal healthcare system for Australians), the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) (government subsidises for eligible medicines, the Child Dental Benefits Scheme, and other health relative incentives programs (625) . Cases of fraud against healthcare providers within any of the above schemes can be reported by anyone using an online 'tip -off form', which allows user to confidentially report on any fraudulent or suspicious activity. A lternatively, users can call the 'Provider Compliance Tip -off Line' (since its establishment in February 2016, the hotline has received 850 tip -offs) (624,626) . Online links and resources are also available to those who wish to report against Australian Public Servants or to report cases of fraudulent behaviour occurring at the administration level of Australian healthcare programs (624) . In Australia, potential cases of fraud within the healthcare system are investigated at the state level. If serious enough, the Department will coordinate investigations with state or Federal Police. Such cases may also be referred to the Commonwealth D irector of Public Prosecution (CDPP) for consideration of criminal prosecution (624) . In 2015 -16, the department continued to deliver a range of fraud minimisation strategies. These included a whole -of-government fraud awareness eLearning package, as well as presentations to public healthcare sector staff on fraud awareness (626) . 567 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In the financial year 2015 -16, the Department undertook 190 investigations into fraud, up from 169 in 2014 -15. The Department referred 35 investigations to the CDPP, which included: 31 matters relating to corporate entities/employers, employees or their associations, thre e matters concerning health providers, one matter relating to pharmacists (626) . Belgium The Law Concerning Compulsory Healthcare and Disability Insurance (July 1994) (H&D Insurance Law hereafter), established the Nat ional Insurance for Health and Di sability Insurance (NIHDI), a public social security institution that manages and supervises compulsory health care and benefits in Belgium. Within NIHDI sits the Department of Inspection and Control, which can be broken down into two sub -groups, namely th e Department for Administrative Control and the Medical Evaluation and Inspection Department (MEID) (618) . MEID is a national institute with regional branches and is the most relevant body for tackling fraud and error within the Belgium healthcare system. Further information regarding the institution's role, mission, strategy, budget and staffing are outlined in Table 96.

Source: (618,627) To be specific, under the H&D Insurance Law, MEID has legal competences to investigate and prosecute the following eight forms of healthcare fraud:111 Billing for healthcare that has not been provided: fin e ranging between 5 -200% of the total amount defrauded Billing for healthcare provisions non -compliant with coding rules (i.e. incorrect pricing): fine ranging from 5 -150% Billing for healthcare provisions that cannot be considered preventative nor curati ve: fine ranging between 5 -100% Healthcare provisions that can be considered as unnecessary and/or unnecessarily expensive: a fine ranging between 5 -100% Prescriptions that can be considered as unnecessary and/or unnecessarily expensive: fine ranging between \u20ac500 -\u20ac50,000 Overprescribing of specific (expensive) medication: a fine between \u20ac500 -\u20ac20,000 Billing with documents that do not comply with administrative formalities: a fine between \u20ac50 -\u20ac500 Incitement of healthcare providers to provide or to prescri be unnecessary and/or unnecessarily expensive provisions: fine between \u20ac1,0 00-\u20ac250,000 (618) . Since 2016, MEI D has begun reporting frequency of fraud by healthcare profession according to a 'waste typology matrix', which distinguishes different types of infringements. Within the matrix there exists four categories, namely: error (benefiting by unintentionally bre aking a rule), abuse (benefiting by 'stretching a rule', thus taking advantage of limited rules/guidelines), fraud (benefiting by intentionally breaking a rule), and corruption (benefiting from abusing power with third party involvement) (618) . 111 Information taken directly from Vincke. P (2017), within Healthcare Fraud, Corruption and Waste in Europe: National and academic perspectives . Edited by Mikkers et al. 569 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Between 2014 and 2015, the number of infringements sanctioned by MEID increased by 93% (i.e. from 635,325 to 1,225,5 85). Of these infringements, 887 led to investigations which found that \u20ac11.6 million of healthcare providers unjustly billed; of this amount, 60% (\u20ac6.9 million) was voluntarily refunded, while an additional 46% was paid after receiving a warning (4% was not re-paid) (618) . Although fraud -related investigations only comprise 8.4% of all investigations (i.e. 75 of the 887), these cases made up 38.57% unjustly billed costs (as a result of billing for services not rendered, or performing unnecessary care) . Of this amount, just 32.53% of was voluntarily refunded, highlighting the difficulty associated with recuperating healthcare fraud costs .112 An evaluation into the long -term impact of MEID revealed that the institution has been successful in changing people's attitudes towards healthcare fraud. For example, action to reduce the number of redundan t restorative fillings in 2011 continues to save approximately \u20ac8 million annually. Further, in 2010, action to ensure correct use of evoked potentials (i.e. measures the time taken for nerves to respond to stimulation), on average, save s \u20ac7 million each year (618) . In addition to MEID, in 2014, the Anti -Fraud Commission for healthcare was est ablished. NIHDI and the seven mutual health funds are represented within the Commission, which aims to combine efforts to address fraud involving patients and providers (e.g. certificate theft, billing for healthcare not provided) (618) . France At the national level, the Audit Department and Counter Fraud Office (DACCRF, Direction of audit, control and sanctioni ng of fraud), which is attached to the CNAMTS, is responsible for 'investigating, prosecuting and preventing fraud' by developing a national strategy. The strategy is then defined within a set of guidelines, which are disseminated to local health insurers (see the table below for an overview of healthcare fraud responsibilities at the national, regional and local level). 112 Data provided directly from NIHDI. 570 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Table 97: Healthcare fraud responsibilities by level of government (France) Level Responsibilities National DACCRF responsible for investigation, prosecution and prevention of fraud Regional Coordinates investigation programs at the national level, in addition to local and regional activities Local Implemented fraud prevention policies (e.g. handling of fraud reports) Source: (618) To undertake healthcare fraud related activities, CNAMTS is provided with a bud get of approximately \u20ac104 million (as of 2014). Part of this budget is used for staffing, which includes statistical experts, legal experts, and administrative and medical expert investigators. There are approximately 1,572 full -time employees within sickn ess insurance who are involved in activities directly related to investigation, prosecution and prevention of healthcare fraud (618) . Prevention of healthcare fraud was identified as a key priority within the 2004 Assurance Maladie (sickness insurance) Law. The importance placed on healthcare fraud is also evident from changes to Social Security Law, which are o utlined in Table 98. Table 98: Changes to Social Security Law to combat healthcare fraud (France, 2004) Measures Example act ions* Administrative Warning to the provider Range of financial penalties Prior authorisation for prescriptions provided by targeted physicians Physicians with unusual prescription behaviour must accept to change his/her practice, if not prior authorisation will be implemented 571 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Measures Example act ions* Legal Referral to the Chamber of Doctors Referral to the court (with criminal sanctions of up to seven years in jail, and a financial penalty of \u20ac750,000 Source: Data provided by IEC member. The specific action taken by social health insurance depends on how the act is classified, that is, as either fraudulent, wrongful or abuse. Fraud , which involves intentionally com mitting an illegal act results in a financial penalty and legal consequences; wrongful unintentional activities that are irregular lead to financial penalties; while providers who abuse services or their prerogatives are notified to their relevant professi onal body (618) . By intensifying and professionalising efforts to combat healthcare fraud, the total amount of fraud and abuse detected and stopped, in terms of undue payments by sickness funds, increased from \u20ac13 million in 2005 to \u20ac231.5 million in 2015 (see figure below ) (618) . Figure 176: Amount of fraud and abuse detected and stopped (in 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015In millions572 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options England NHS Protect is the agency responsible for tackling fraud, bribery and corruption, w ithin NHS England and NHS Wales (628) . NHS Protect takes a multi -faceted approach to tackling fraud in the healthcare sector, which is both proactive and reactive (629) . Within the current NHS Protect Strategy (as of October 2016), three 'key principles for action' have been defined to deal with incidences of crime (including fraud and corruption). At a high -level these are to 'inform and involve', 'prevent and deter', and 'hold to account' (further details provided in the table below Table 99). Table 99: NHS Protect's principles for action Principle Description Inform and involve NHS Protect is to inform and involve NHS staff on fraud, bribery and corruption in order to increase understanding of the impact of crime against the NHS. Prevent and deter NHS Protect works to remove opportunity for fraudulent behaviour to occur and dis courage those who may commit such crimes (e.g. by reporting on successful prosecutions). Hold to account NHS Protect professionally trains specialists to tackle crime (including fraud, corruption and bribery). This assists in ensuring crimes are detecte d and investigated, and where appropriate, suspects prosecuted. Source: (629) 573 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In 2015, NHS Protect launched a new online fraud and corruption reporting tool. The online tool113 allows anyone to report concerns of fraud within the NHS (i.e. when fraud led to loss of NHS funds); reporters can choose to provide their name and contact details, or report anonymously (630) . Information on fraud within the NHS i s also collected through data sharing arrangements with the wider NHS, public sector bodies, and professional regulatory bodies. Investigations into instances of fraud are undertaken by Local Counter Fraud Specialists (LCFSs) who are nominated and accredi ted by NHS Protect. All LCFSs receive university accredited training, which ensures they have nationally recognised qualifications. LCFSs are supported by NHS Protect Area Anti -fraud Specialists (AAFSs), who are the link between NHS Protect and NHS commiss ioners and providers. A key role of these specialists is to ensure investigations into allegations of fraud follow legislative guidelines and are of the highest standard (631) . NHS Protect also plays a role in education NHS staff and the public on fraud, bribery and corruption within the healthcare sector. For example, NHS Protect in 2015 -16: Produced an aide -memoire for the Department of Health and NHS Improvement on anti -fraud safeguards in the provision of agency staff Developed guidance for providers within the NHS and NHS commissioners, as well as employment agencies, on pre -employment checks and invoicing for age ncy staff as a way to reduce fraud in these two areas Developed material on agency fraud that is made available on the NHS employers online tool for NHS managers Provided university -accredited training and key skills development training to 266 LCFSs and Local Security Management Specialists (LSMSs) working for NHS health bodies Produced significant material for the media to inform the public and NHS staff on their anti -crime message (over 34 million opportunities to view anti -crime adverts); a further 4 16 media articles were published on successful anti -crime work undertaken by NHS Protect Ran a total of six workshops on anti -fraud standards to NHS commissioners which explained the role of the commissioners under NHS Protect standards 113 See: https://www.reportnhsfraud.nhs.uk/ 574 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Required 251 NHS pr oviders and 190 NHS commissioners to undertake self -reviews of fraud, bribery and corruption standards (622) . In the financial year 2015 -16, NHS Protect received 5,000 reports relating to potential fraud and corruption within NHS England and NHS Wales. Of these, the AAFSs authorised investigations into 900 of these cases. In the same year, nine criminal prosecutions were carried out successfully following investigations into the most complex cases of fraud, bribery and corruption.114 A further 258 civil, disciplinary and other internal sanctions were applied by NHS Protect, other NHS organisations and professional bodies following successful investigations (622) . In terms of financial costs, in 2014 -15, the value of fraud, bribery and corruption in the NHS amounted to \u00a311.9 million, of which \u00a32.4 million was recuperated by NHS Protect and LCFSs (618) . The Austrian situation When assessing possible types of fraud, one must differentiate between fraud committed by providers or consumers of health care. Consumer -related types of fraud encompass the evasion of paying health insurance (or social insurance) contributions (e.g. via illegal work in the private sector, fictitious self - employment, illeg al occupations or dummy concerns) and misuse of healthcare (or social insurance) services. Examples of the latter include subreption of social insurance coverage (e.g. via complaisance), identity fraud and use of services by non -entitled parties (e.g. use of other persons' e -cards), fraudulent use of services due to wrong depiction of earning capacity or pretense of place of residence. By contrast, provider -related fraud includes, amongst other, the submission of false claims, corruption (e.g. acceptance of informal payments), and misuse of working hours (632) . To date, there has been limited research into the types and costs associated with healthcare fraud in Austria. As a result, only two forms of healthcare fraud have been quantified (2014) , specifically within the Special Eurobarometer Report on Corruption (611) . Results from the survey identified two forms of provider -related healthcare fraud in Austria. The first, relates to informal payments (or gifts ) to providers to skip waiting lists. Specifically, 3% of those surveyed stated that they provided their physician/nurse with a gift or made a donation to the hospital. Although this figure may be considered low, in the same survey, 19% of interviewees fel t that such additional 114 It is not clear whether the nine criminal prosecutions were those relating to cases received in the same financial year or previous years. 575 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options payments were necessary after care has been provided (which is 3 percentage points above the EU15 average) (611) . Figure 177: Proportion of interviewees who, in addition, to official fees provided an extra payments or gift to their nurse of physician, or provided a donation to the hospital (2014) Source: (611) The second relates to the provision of additional services within private practices in order to be treated within a public facility. In this regard, Austria performed poorly with 28% of interviewees acknowledging that this occurred (compared to 13% across EU15) (611) . Caution, however, should be taken when reviewing results. Specifically, the context of the Austrian healthcare system should be taken into account whereby patients have significant access to private specialists; therefore, it is not clear to what extent patients have been encouraged to engage in a follow -up consultation or whether this was asked within the initial consultation, and there fore not considered Sweden Spain UK Netherlands Luxembourg Ireland Portugal Belgium Austria Italy France Germany Greece576 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 178: Proportion of interviewees who were asked to go for a private consultation in order to be treated in a public hospital (2014) Source: (611) In addition, there is anecdotal evidence of various other forms of fraud. However, such claims have not been substantiated. Nevertheless, they are reported as the current environment enables such fraudulent behaviour to occur.

E-cards People illegally using e -cards that do not belong to them to access healthcare services. For example, un -registered migrants who do not formally have access to the insurance system. Strategies to combat healthcare fraud in Austria Combatting fraud plays an important role in securing the financing system of social benefits, ensuring a comprehensive social protectio n of the insured, guaranteeing fair competition in the economy, prevent ing external influences on the social insurance system and maintaining the trustworthiness of the social insurance system (632) . Therefore, a range of strategies and initiatives have been implemented in Austria to prevent, detect and prosecute fraud. For instance, some activities defined as 'fraudulent' may arise due to errors rather than actual fraud. In order to prevent misunderstandings, efforts are undertaken by the social insurance to effectively and transparently inform insured persons and contractual partners of their responsibilities. Moreover, to prevent identity fraud and use of services by non -entitled parties, it was ruled that new E -cards will include a photo of the card owner, starting in 2019 (633) . To prevent further fraud arising from dummy concerns and to create an overview of the problem, a website was established, which reports all dummy concerns involved in social insurance f raud. However, the collection of data on and monitoring of fraudulent activities to inform policies and to estimate the actual scope of the problem remains a challenge. Therefore, initiatives have been introduced to harmonise the monitoring infrastructure across carriers to support a transparent quantification of fraud in the social insurance system (632) . In order to detect fraud pertaining to the payment of contributions, both the social insurance carriers and finance authorities conduct collective checks on the declaration of income and contributions by individua ls. Furthermore, in the area of provider -related fraud, the social insurance has introduced mystery shopping, which is conducted on a random basis, as well as in suspected cases. However, the scope of this strategy remains unknown, as it has only been imp lemented in 2016 and was countered with 578 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options significant resistance by the medical chamber. In addition, the individual carriers aim to increase initiatives for the detection of fraud. For example, the WGKK has established a working group on the detection and prevention of fraud in 2008, which primarily focuses on the submission of false claims by physicians. In 2013, 597 cases of fraudulent or erroneous claims by contracted physicians have been identified, whereby EUR 307,135 were claimed back successfully by t he WGKK. Contracts with physicians were terminated in five cases, and in three cases a criminal charge was placed (632) . In order to effectively persecute social insurance fraud, a legal base for the combat of fraud was established recently. This includes the law on Combatting Social Insurance Fraud (Sozialbetrugs bek\u00e4mpfungdgesetz, SBBG), which came into effect in January 2016 to regulate the combatting of fraud, particularly the evasion of contribution payments, and to strengthen the cooperation between authorities. Furthermore, the law on Combatting Wage - and Soc ial Dumping (Lohn -und Sozialdumping -Bek\u00e4mpfungsgesetz, LSD -BG) was introduced in January 2017. In addition, the Directives for the Implementation, Documentation and Quality Assurance of Controls of Contractual Partners (Richtlinien f\u00fcr die Durchf\u00fchrung, Do kumentation und Qualit\u00e4tssicherung von Kontrollen im Vertragspartnerbereich (RLVPK) were established in April 2016. Different authorities are responsible for the persecution of offences. For instance, minor crimes are governed by administrative criminal la w and therefore involve the federal and regional administrative courts, as well as the financial police. By contrast, major crimes are dealt with by the Anti -Corruption Agency and the public prosecution department. The cooperation between national authori ties is central to combatting fraud. In addition, efforts have been made to expand cooperation across other countries, in order to exchange best practice examples and analyses pertaining to the combat of fraud on an international level. For instance, Aust ria is a member of the EU platform on informal labour, as well as the international anti -corruption academy to improve the exchange of data and information (632) . Policy options: Combating healthcare fraud As previously outlined , comprehensive studies into the extent and cost of fraud within the healthcare syste m are limited. For example, only two forms of healthcare fraud have been confirmed and quantified . To gain a better understanding of the types of healthcare fraud that exist within the system, and their associated cost, it is recommended that first and for emost, a review of fraud in the Austrian healthcare system be undertaken including all a payers, providers and patients. To the extent possible, the cost of healthcare fraud should be quantified, with the final figure used to determine future level s of funding into 579 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options anti-fraudulent activities. In the absence of this information, it is difficult to a) prioritise activities, and b) determine an appropriate level of investment. Federal and L \u00e4nder governments, and social health insurance could jointly fu nd the study, given all - inclusive approach to healthcare fraud should be taken . Finally, we are cognisant of the challenges associated with identifying and calculating healthcare fraud, therefore, as a starting point, it suggested that information be draw n from patient ombudsmen run by health insurance carriers, Chamber of Physicians, as well as patient attorneys implemented at the state level (see Figure 179). Figure 179: Patient ombudsman within social health insurance Social health insurance carriers employ patient ombudsman, however, there is no legal provision for them to do so under the ASVG (for example) . Ombudsman for h ealth insurance carriers deal with a variety of complaints, however, it is not under their remit to legally represent clients. For example, ombudsman may deal with complaints regarding waiting times or prices. Ombudsman within the Chamber of Physician's pe rforms a similar role. The only patient ombudsman/attorney to be defined by law is that offered by each Land. Patient ombudsman/attorney's in this context perform a variety of roles including informing patients of their rights, mediating disputes, investi gating failures within the healthcare system, and assisting patients when malpractice settlements are made outside of court. Source: (68) Once there is a better understanding of the types and cost of healthcare fraud within the system, appropriate strategies, which target problem areas, can be developed. For example, if the problem is significant, a Joint Specialist Centre (should model 4 be employed, see section 4.1.2 ) or competence centre (under current arrangements) could be dedicated to combating healthcare fraud. Finally, digitali sing patient healthcare records, as is being done under ELGA, improves transparency within the system therefore minimising the possibilities to engage in fraudulent behaviour. For example, ELGA will allow patients to map services that were referred for, ac tual services performed and services recorded as being completed. Therefore, patients are able to easily identify instances where a physician overbills. Given low co -payments within the system, there is limited incentive for patients to report such behavio ur. For this reason, health insurance carriers should encourage insurees to report overbilling, which would 580 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options require them to provide relevant links and services on how to report physicians. In addition, as ELGA becomes more sophisticated (e.g. providing in formation in a digestible format), health insurance carriers will be able to juxtapose healthcare consumption patterns over time for each insuree. This will allow carriers to more easily identify instances of e -card fraud, by juxtaposing past and current u tilisation. Summary of policy options for combating healthcare fraud To understand the types of healthcare fraud and their associated cost, a comprehensive study into the topic is required. By collecting this information, policy -makers will have a bette r understanding of where anti-fraudulent activities should be targeted and associated cost -savings. Given the problem is significant, social health insurance carriers could dedicate a Joint Specialist Centre or competence centre to combating healthcare fra ud. Finally, enhancing digisalition within the system will continue to improve transparency and limit the opportunity for healthcare fraud to occur. Given patients can more readily identify instances of healthcare fraud, carriers should encourage insurees to report such behaviour, whic h may act as a deterrent. Legal considerations No particular legal impediments have to be faced with respect to these options. Business processes with respect to IT systems Introduction The study conducted by Hausermann in 19 92 on the organisational analysis of the Austrian social insurance system pointed out that the different EDV should be harmonised and the lack of cooperation among the providers is a central challenge in the context of administrative activities. It was ide ntified as an obstacle that this would initially incur costs to the provider, and that it would not directly benefit them. With the 52nd amendment to the ASVG. The coordination function in the field of automation -assisted data processing was transferred to the Main Association of Social Security Institutions (HVSV) under the 52nd amendment to the ASVG. The guidelines for the cooperation of the social security providers amongst themselves and with the main association in automation -assisted data p rocessing, that were issued by the main association following \u00a7 31 para. 5 clause 4 ASVG, intend a step -by-step production of compatible computer structures to the extent that this is necessary for the joint development, procurement and application of the software. 581 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In the study carried out by KPMG Consulting GmbH in 1998, it was stated that due to standard products (IT applications used by several social insurance funds), as well as due to the creation of competence center s, positive examples of harmonis ation of comp uter science were created. KPMG Consulting GmbH also criticised the fact that at the time many synergy potentials across providers remained underutilised since cooperation was based on the individual initiatives of providers and did not always include all providers whose cooperation would be useful. The image has changed considerably in this sector. A collaborati ve structure was created due to the foundation of subsidiaries across providers, the consolidation of the data centre and a joint IT -management, wh ich contained costs and could reduce parallel tasks. The following chapter describes the organisations and their division of tasks for electronic data processing, as well as the developments in the IT business processes and work process facilitation throu gh IT solutions in Austria, and considers potential efficiency potentials. Further detailed information on this topic and possible efficie ncy potentials can be found in chapter 2.5 in Vol ume 4 - Situational Analysis . Organisations and their division of work into electronic data processing The process of the division of labour between the HVSV, the IT services of the social insurance GmbH (ITSV GmbH), social insurance chip cards provider and GmbH) and SVD office management GmbH (SVD GmbH) are based on the binding directives agreed by the HVSV on the cooperation of the social security funds and the main association in electronic data processing (REDV), which are valid for all social insurance funds. 582 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 180: The Austrian social insurance funds including subsidiaries, own research ITServices of the Social insurance GmbH (ITSV GmbH) ITSV GmbH was established at the end of 2004 by the HVSV in accordance with Section 31 (4) 3 lit. A ASVG as the central coordinating company of the main association and the social insurance institutions for the field of information technology. In accordance with the founding purpose, 20 further social insurance fun ds other than HVB also participated of the foundation of the I TSV GmbH, AUVA and PVA decided not to purchase any owner shares. 583 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Both funds still draw benefits from the ITSV independent from this decision. These include standard products which all funds need in all divisions (e.g. standard product PERS - Personnel Mana gement). As business purpose and according to point 3.1 of the shareholder agreement, ITSV GmbH was provided with the control and coordination of the IT services, the development of strategies and standards as well as the provision of services for the part ners in the areas of information technology and communication under consideration of promoting business efficiency. According to point 3.5 of the shareholder agreement, this objective particularly incorporates the creation of compatible IT structures and t he joint software development, procurement and application considering the fundamental principles of business efficiency and practicality. In a first phase, ITSV GmbH consolidated the 18 computer centres of the social health insurance that existed at the time of the founding period almost completely, in accordance with \u00a7 23 (2) no. 1 REDV, into a target data processing centre operated by ITSV GmbH. After the successfully executed consolidation of computer centres of the social health insurance, the focus o f the ITSV GmbH is now, according to \u00a7 12 REDV concentrated on the coordination of the software landscape of the Austrian social health insurance. The objective of this intervention is cost saving from establishing a license management across providers and from creating joint software engineering architectures. In addition, the IT -controlling across providers is to be supported by the ITSV GmbH and according to \u00a7 6 REDV a central project controlling has to be ensured. In addition, the call centers, which we re originally required for internal technical purposes (service -desk system), are increasingly used for important tasks such as breast cancer screening, electronic health care, thus assumes central health policy tasks. Furthermore, the call centre, which w as originally required and established for internal technical purposes (service desk system) across providers, is increasingly also used for important content -related tasks (e.g. breast cancer screening, electronic health record service line, e -card servic e line for insurees and contract partners etc.) and thus assumes central health policy tasks. In this business area, a cooperation between the Federal Government and ITSV GmbH is currently being developed and strived for, for reducing administrative costs for the federal government and social security. A further co -operation between the Federal Government, the L\u00e4nder and the social insurance is being pursued in the area of the mutual provision of cost -effective storage space meeting the high -security requ irements. 584 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The IT governance model of the IT services of the social insurance GmbH (ITSV GmbH) IT Governance is an instrument that supports the implementation of the strategic IT goals and aligns the IT with the strategic company objectives. The IT Governan ce model encompasses the entire IT value chain and applies to HVB, all social insurance providers (except AUVA and PVA), ITSV Gmbh and the social insurance chip card company m.b.H. (SVC GmbH) with respect to all company -wide IT issues and also to architect ure, infrastructure and standards within each segment. This IT Governance model of the social insurances applies to AUVA and PVA only in the standard product area and ELGA. The alignment of additional IT Governance structures of AUVA and PVA can be underta ken in a further step. The normative and strategic level is the responsibility of IT management and the operational level that of the IT coordination. The IT strategy applies according to the IT Governance model to social insurance providers (for AUVA and PVA in the case of standard products and ELGA), the HVB and all IT subsidiaries. The IT control is responsible for the creation and further development of the IT strategy. The IT governance model therefore provides a common approach. SVD Office Management GmbH (SVD GmbH) The SVD Office Management GmbH (SVD Gmb H) was founded in 2003 and has four nationwide insurance providers as owners (BVA, SVB, VAEB und SVA). The SVD GmbH offers a broad range of services to its members such as procurement, facility management, construction industry, printing company and IKT. Even the ITSV GmbH and the SVC GmbH use the cleaning and supplementary facility services of the SVD GmbH at the office locations in Vienna, which could save administrative costs in comparison to previous suppliers. By bundling the services at SVD GmbH, the company was able to build up know -how in the business areas. The SVD GmbH is interested in expanding its services across further providers and to offer the know -how gained more widely. The SVD GmbH supports approximately 4 ,500 user in the ITK area. Regarding the range of services offered, i t should be mentioned that it can be regarded as comprehensive with a few exceptions for the owner providers (in the area of outpatient clinics). The social insurance chip card provider and operator m.b.H. (SVC GmbH) The social insurance chip card provider and operator m.b.H. (SVC) was founded by the HVB on the basis of the \u00a7\u00a7 31 a bis c ASVG. According to point 1 of the company agreement, the business purpose consists of the introduction, operation and further development of an electronic administration sy stem (ELSY) for the entire social security administration. 585 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The task of SVC GmbH is to make the processes between insurees, service providers, doctors' offices, hospitals, pharmacies, other health service providers, ELGA health service providers, as well a s social insurance carriers IT -based to a large extent paperless, to ensure and continuously improve the operability. The SVC GmbH g uarantees an availability of 99. 7% for the e -card data processing centres. SVC GmbH also operates the Social Security Intern et Portal, which receives around 1.8 million hits a month. The main products of SVC GmbH are technological solutions in the healthcare sector. Some examples are the e -card system, ELGA, e -medication within the framework of ELGA or eSV. Developments in the area of IT business processes in Austria Harmonisation of IT systems by standard products Before the harmonisation by standard products, each provider had its own systems in operation. Many operations were carried out parallel because of that. The new phi losophy is that applications are developed (for example, by competence centres) and made available to the remaining providers. With the standard products (STP) / competence centers (CC) across providers, the legacy systems (Host) at the end of the life cyc le of providers were/will be replaced and processes will be also standardised. The business processes to the customer are considered across providers, e.g. by eS V ('electronic social insurance' ) or rather e -innovation. The IT hence creates the basis for th e subject area to implement further optimisation measures. Based on the IT master plan, all standard products, their commissioning and releases are controlled for all providers. The IT master plan is used for controlling the project and program management. The competence centres of prov iders, the ITSV GmbH and the HVSV are involved in the development of standard applications. The tasks will be assigned to the most suitable body for the project. Given that the compentence centres program standard products, i t can be guaranteed that the end product meets the required requirements and that the know -how in social insurance can be upheld and does not need to be purchased. This further ensures that the system remains safe and stable, as well as that only a minor dependence on third -party providers. This approach also reduced the number of externally purchased developer by more than half. Know -how can hence be ensured sustainably in the social insurance. Joint use of data processing centres The Austrian social insu rance has decided to reduce the number of data processing centres step -by-step from previously 18 to maximally 5 data processing centres. Since the end of 2013, 5 physical data 586 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options processing centres are run by the Austrian social insurance: Geiselberg, Wiener berg, Neu, AUVA, PVA and SVD. Furthermore, a customer relation to ITSV GmbH and SVC GmbH in the areas SAP, internet connection, web hosting of the website, video calls, MDM solutions for Apple products. The server for the e-card system and eSV (On line presence of all social insurance providers) are operated by the SVC GmbH at the d ata processing centre location 'Geiselberg' and at the 'T -Centre' . The IT cost cap In connection with IT costs, the so -called IT cost cap was introduced in 2008. The res ult since the introduction of the cost cap is that the IT costs remained nearly constant since 2007 despite massive challenges (roll out of standard applications) and even fell to the lowest absolute value of the last ten years in 2015. The audit division confirms that the overall IT costs only increased by about 1. 7% since 2007 and could hence be kept constant. Simultaneously, it could be observed that the proportion of IT costs of administration costs constant ly fell (from 17.9% - 2007 to 14. 2 %- 2015). Th is development proves the functioning of the IT cost cap as cost containment instrument. Developments in the area of work process facilitation through IT solutions in Austria E-nnovation A program ('e_nnovation' ) was implemented between 2014 and 2016 with the objective of providing the insured with a wide range of up -to-date electronic interaction facilities around the clock and via all relevant channels. This facilitated the interaction of the insured and relieved the administration of social insurance fu nds. A key c omponent of this programme was 'My social insurance' ('Meine SV' ): The internet portal that exists since 01.04.2015, in which all services for insured requiring authentication can be bundled. All Regional Health Insurance Funds, all employer -based health insurances, PVA, SVA and VAEB and from mid -2017 also SVB an d BVA currently participate in 'Meine SV' . A further relevant topic for IT support and facilitation of work processes is Cognitive Computing: Cognitive Computing describes technical platforms, which are based on the scientific disciplines of artificial intelligence and through which computer programmes can act in a similar way as the human brain. In 2017 it is planned to carry out a tender for cognitive computing, so that from 2018 co ncrete implementation projects can be carried out. 587 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The electronic medical record (ELGA) The electronic medical record (in short ELGA) is a joint project of the federal government, the social health insurance and all federal states. ELGA has the objective t o connect the health data of patients and to create a location - and time -independent access to ELGA health data through the ELGA portal. Detailed information about this topic can be found in section 6.6. Accounting of medicines (HEMA) The 'Accounting of Me dicines' HEMA operates the accounting of the public pharmacies and the primary care pharmacies. The basis for the accounting of pharmacy data are the electronic data of the public pharmacies, which are transferred by the general salary fund of Austrian pha rmacists (Pharmazeutische Gehalts kasse f\u00fcr \u00d6sterreich) to the HVSV . The division into the corresponding insurance providers occurs through the HVSV . Data is sent to insurance providers via the data hub (DDS). The data of the pharmacies submitted electroni cally (via data media or ELDA) or in paper format. The master data (physicians, insured, reimbursement code - EKO) will be played in once per month. The administration of pharmacy master data occurs in HEMA. The HEMA data will be transferred in further disp ositive systems (BIG, FOKO, LIVE, ALVA Insurance) for various analyses and evaluations. In HEMA, a prescription economy evaluation can be made (frequency of prescription medicines, quota of generics, contract partner control). The evaluations of the prescr iption economy are transferred to the providers. Further, it is up to the providers to decide whether they contact their contract partner and point to possible peculiarities. All evaluations are risk - and age -standardised. The data of HEMA can also be used as basis for buying decisions, but there are no procurement functionalities. Reimbursement of optional physician Patients have the right to submit bills of optional physicia ns. A technical solution about 'My SV' is already in use at most health insurance providers. Currently, the diffusion is supposed to be increased through an information campaign. As basis for an automatic cost reimbursement, online services for cost reimbursement for regional health insurance funds were already created in 2015: The in sured can transfer bills to the responsible social insurance provider as PDF online for the reimbursement. An important prerequisite for an automatic bill of optional physicians, which is that data must exist electronically, is hence satisfied. 588 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Potential e fficiency potentials The IT of the social insurance experienced in the last years and will also in further future a strategy of consolidation, both regarding costs and processes, which are constantly becoming standardised and jointly usable for the joint needs of social insurance providers. After all, the social insurance managed to perform this big IT transformation mainly with the engagement of its own employers. According to this, the potential for efficiency gains is identified and already being implem ented Expiration data transfer (e.g., application) between the providers Insofar as applications and data transmissions are not already submitted electronically by the applicant (insured, employer and contract partner), applications are electronically rec orded and / or forwarded to the responsible provider. Through the universal service, applications, notifications and notifications can be submitted to each insurance institution, in any state, irrespective of the actual jurisdiction. All insurance provider s that are organised according to the general ASVG as well as the Social Insurance Institution of the commercial economy and the Social Insurance Institution of the farmers participate in the universal service. The data hub is available for the electronic transfer of data between social insurance providers. It standardises the communication channel between the involved IT products. The data hub takes care of the ordered technical data communication, but the organizational processing is within the competence area of the individual partners / providers. In the area of rehabilitation as well, particularly in the case of rehabilitation allowances, the processing between the PV and the CP is now largely electronic. There are applications of the electronic act at almost all providers, albeit with a different focus. The N\u00d6GKK, for example, has implemented the contract partner record, the medical record and a customer record electronically, the PVA the personnel record and the patient record and the TGKK has impl emented a regress and legal record electronically. The transferability of the applications for the electronic act is secured through the application of standard products. Particularly in this regard the STP ECM (Enterprise Content Management) should be not ed: The majority of work processes that occur at the social insurance are document - and information -driven. The solutions for the ECM cover the processes of recording, administration, storage, preservation and provision of documents and their contents for the support of professional as well as organisational processes. With an overall concept, different ECM activities and ECM projects will be implemented in the years 2016 to 2018, and technological aspects as well as the independent single solutions will b e 589 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options strategically bundled. There exists also the possibility for a better coordination and coordinated procedure. IT-Strategy Within the framework of the IT governance model, the IT strategy is defined as an essential component of the IT governance. It is t he responsibility of the IT control team to develop those under consideration of relevant environmental conditions. Starting from the defined scope of the IT governance, the IT strategy is valid for all SV providers (for AUVA and PVA in the case of standar d products and ELGA), the H VB and all IT subsidiaries. The IT-strategy is influenced by different environments such as the strategy of the social insurance, developments in technology, framework conditions, etc., but also by findings from the control mecha nisms of the operative implementation of the strategy. An examination and potentially adaption of the IT strategy and hence also of the guiding principles is to be executed regularly. The electronic management system (ELSY) implemented by the ASVG \u00a731a is already designed as efficiency model by the legislator. Its objective is to consolidate processes between social insurance providers and the 'outside world' (insured, employer, contract partner, health care provider). The efficiency potentials have been id entified and remain to be increased. A challenge in the increase of efficiency potential is the coalition pressure with the contract partners through which sensible process changes can be blocked for general political reasons. Digitalisation of administrat ion tasks in the social insurance Through the use of standard products and provider -internal workflow and software support, a large number of social insurance companies could be digitized and thus structured cost -efficient. The main focus in digitalisation lies now with the processes with insured and contrac t partners. The initiatives of 'My SV' and the further expansion of e -card functionalities (eBS, e -medication, e - prescription, etc.) with physicians, pharmacies, hospitals and other contract partners ser ve this purpose. Efficiency potentials exist mainly in administration processes in this area, which can be digitized. To increase these potentials, the agreement of the contract partners needs to be obtained. The internal administration processes run main ly electronically. For example for: Standard products FIWI (Finance and economy of the social insurance providers) : Already digitised: Transmission of orders, material lists of supplier to the social insurance provider 590 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Work flow supported audit and approval and release processes within social insurance funds To be digitised: Transmission of electronic bills of suppliers to the social insurance providers Exchange of electronic bills between social insurance providers. Standard products PERS (Human Res ources): Already digitised: Use of ESS (Employee Self Service) and MSS (Manager Self Service) scenarios to support of business processes between employers and managers or rather employers and the human resource department To be digitised: Administration of applicants across providers. Enterprise Content Management (ECM): The following institutions use ECM (Enterprise Content Insurance service for commerce and industry (SVA) Pensionsversicherungsanstalt (Pension Insurance) Social insurance institution for farmers Austrian railways insurance institution 591 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Public Servant Insurance Corporation Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions ITSV GmbH. In addition, there are solutions implemented in SAP, SharePoint or other technologies. The complete alignment of workflows is difficult to implement due to different internal processes. Depending on the provider size, the work sharing is differently pronounced. An adjustment of the workflow systems is not possible without the alignment of the internal organization. Automatic difference asses sment/reimbursement of contributions The different assessment/reimbursement of contributions are relevant in the are a of multiple insur ance. A multiple insurance in health insurance occurs when one exercises multiple employments that are subject to compul sory insurance simultaneously and/or receives cash benefits, which are also connected to health insurance. An automatic solution would result in a facilitation of processes for the insured. Currently, professional questions are being clarified concerning t his matter. Both is technically possible and partly already exists (reimbursement of contributions in the ASVG in STP -MVB). The effort can currently not yet be estimated. Reimbursement of the optional physician As basis for an automated cost reimbursement, online services for cost reimbursement for the Regional Health Insurance Funds were already created in 2015. One can expand this process even further. In addition, additional requirements or rather alternatives for an automatic optional physician bill wil l be evaluated: Treatment of the incoming PDF bills by means of OCR (text recognition) to transform the picture of the bill into characters Replication of activities that are currently carried out by the administration employers in a suitable software; thi s is a potential area of application for cognitive computing Obligation of optional physicians to collect the data that is necessary for the reimbursement (requires the nationwide cooperation of optional physicians and is hence not feasible in the short -run and just by the social insurance) Imprint of a QR code on the related forms so that they can be automatically assigned to a health insurance provider; if the form is filled out online by the insured, the QR code could even contain this information. 592 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options The automatic optional insurance bill is online accessible since April 2015 and currently generates 50.000 access monthly. In Vienna, circa 25% of optional physician bills are processed online. In total, it can be stated that in the area of EDV significant adv ancements towards a standardisation and an intensified coordination have occurred. There exist further efficiency potentials, which can be increased. Currently, the issue of a joint licence management is processed, which one could have probably already started earlier. Among the individual EDV companies, the coordination and the division of work could be developed further since here tasks are partly administered or rather executed parallel. In the area of the Regional Health Insurance Funds, this occurs thr ough the IT SV, at the special insurance provider through the SVD and at the AUVA and PVA independent. Further, the EDV effort could be reduced if the individual organisations standardised the internal processes before the implementation of standard produc ts to be able to reduce the complexity of the EDV applications. 593 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options 9 Conclusion A review of the Austrian social insurance system revealed that the system is both complex and fragmented due to multi -level governance structures and dual financing arrangements. This find ing is not unique to this review , as evidenced by numerous reports undertaken by Austrian institutions and organisations who also come to this conclusion. In response, policy -makers in recent years have implemented various policies to enhance coordination and align incentives. These efforts should be recognised and commended, however, ultimately, major constitutional reform, enhancement of joint responsibilities between social health insurance and the L \u00e4nder, or joint budgets are req uired to streamline the healthcare system. Given the extreme difficulty in passing such reforms, this review has chosen to take a pragmatic approach by developing a range of policy options to improve efficiency and equity within the current system. Policy options have been designe d to in creased efficiency, equity and possibly outcomes within the Austrian social insurance system. As an example , key policy options to enhance the use of generics, primary care and vaccinations , as well as harmonis ing benefits, introducing value -based user charges , enhancing the role of pharmacists , and improving coordination between states and social health insurance have been mapped on a cost -efficiency plane ( please see figure below ). The figure outlines the medium - (red box ) and long -term (grey box) impact of each of the aforementioned policies has on cost, outcomes and outputs (navy blue boxes indicate both medium - and long -term) . This exercise demonstrates that each of the options put forward are, theoretically, efficient, given they fall to the left of the efficiency line. For e xample, enhancing primary care will increase outcomes, outputs and costs within the medium -term, however, in the long -term, this policy will reduce costs by decreasing the number of inpatient admiss ions. 594 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Figure 181: Cost -efficiency plane Note: Red boxes = medium -term , Grey boxes = long -term, Navy blue boxes = medium - and long -term. Source: Author's own creation 595 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options It is important to highlight that the remit of this review was limited, given it was restricted to the social insurance system. However, given the complex nature of the healthcare system , where directly applicable , consideration was given to health care und er the jurisdiction of federal and L \u00e4nder governments. Finally, and as previously stated, when developing future options to enhance efficiencies within the healthcare system, policy -makers and stakeholders should: Ensure that development and implementation of policies is transparent and inclusive . Be aware that no healthcare system is perfect, and that any changes should build upon strengths within the current system. The remainder of this chapter outlines, at a high -level, a range of policy options to enhance efficiency within the system. For detailed information on each policy option, it is highly recommended that readers view the relevant sections within the main body of the report. For each topic, multiple policy options have been provided, further, no option has been ranked as superior given , ultimately, it is the responsibility of Austrian policy makers and stakeholders to make decisions regarding the direction of the healthcare system , however, we briefly outline sever al advantages and disadvantages of different options . Finally, we recommend that policy options within this report are viewed in conjunction with previous research undertaken by Austrian experts , as well those outlined by stakeholder views in Volume 3 of t his review. Policy options: Structure of the social insurance system Four alternative models have been proposed to improve efficiency and equity within the system . Models 1 -3 involve structural change to the social insurance system through an amalgamatio n of carriers. Amalgamation, in the short -run, can lead to cost increases given the expenses associated with structural change and implementation. However, in the medium - to long -term, if implem ented correctly, these models c ould lead to efficiency gains, for example, through economies of scale and scope, and enhanced knowledge transfers. It is important to note that sub -options for models 1 -3 have also been developed, however, they have not been included in this summary (please see section 4.1.2 for further details on these sub -options). Model 4 c ould increase efficiency and equity by extending risk-adjustment and enhancing coordination within the cu rrent structural model. 596 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Model 1 (partial amalgamation): one national accident insurance carrier, one national pension insurance carrier, one employed health insurance carrier (GKKs, BVA, VAEB, BKKs and KFAs) and one self -employed health insurance carrier (i.e. SVA and SVB) Model 2 (limited amalgamation): one national pension insurance carrier, one self -employed hea lth insurance carrier, one employed health insurance carrier (excluding civil servants , i.e. BVA, VAEB and KFAs ), one accident insurance carrier (excluding civil servants), and one joint accident and health insurance carrier for civil servants Model 3 (health and accident amalgamation): one national pension insurance carrier, one health and accident insurance carr ier divided by each of the nine states Model 4 (insurance coordination): model 4 aims to improve the current social insurance system by enhancing risk -adjustment between health insurance carriers, as well as improving coordination between carriers through Joint Specialists Centres. Joint Specialist Centre 'themes' would be defined by a joint Working Group (including HVSV, and both the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, and the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection), however, it wi ll be the responsibility of carriers who takes on each theme. Although not compulsory, carriers will be incentivised to actively participate in the scheme to minimise duplication. Policy options: Risk -adjustment Given model 4, as outlined above, is intr oduced, the following five risk -adjustment options have been proposed to improve equity and efficiency within the system. RA1 and RA2 are considered the most comprehensive and thus mutually exclusive, RA3 -5, however, could be implemented in unison. RA1: All funds received by social health insurance carriers to be risk -adjusted through a central agency (i.e. HVSV). Alternatively, a step -wise approach could also be considered, whereby the proportion of funds risk -adjusted are increased over time until it is felt there is an equitable distribution of funds. RA2: This option would involve a simultaneous reduction to contribution rates and the implementation of an earmarked levy dedicated to risk -adjustment across social health insurance carriers. 597 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options RA3: RA3 wo uld amalgamate existing risk -equalisation schemes into one pool of funds to be used for risk -adjustment purposes. Using the most recent data, risk -equalisation schemes amount to \u20ac3 billion annually (including the Hebes\u00e4tze, or \u20ac1.4 billion, excluding the H ebes\u00e4tze). RA4: Under this option, social health insurance carriers would subsume responsibility for hospital outpatient departments using an appropriate level of funds from State Health Funds. A central agency (i.e. HVSV) would be responsible for redist ributing funds to carriers based on a range of risk - adjustment factors. Funds could be used, for example, to enhance primary care and hospital outpatient departments. RA5: Finally, RA5 would pool a proportion of contributions into a central fund (managed b y the HVSV), which would then be used to reimburse GPs on a capitated risk -adjusted basis. Given the significant cultural change associated with this policy (i.e. by registering with one GP), this policy is should only be considered in the long -term. See section 4.2.7 for further details. Policy options: Collection of contributions The following policy options relating to the collection of contr ibutions are provided below: Collection of contributions Base SVB contributions on actual income : a shift in taxation base towards actual income promotes an alignment between BSVG and ASVG funds in regards to the collection mechanism of contributions, an d improves equity in the financing system. Introduction of a proportional fiscal system with maximum contributions in the SVB : a shift from the regressive to a more proportional fiscal system in conjunction with the introduction of a maximum contribution a mount could promote a more equitable collection of contributions, which can be rendered fiscally neutral. Aligning the BVA contribution base with that of regional carriers : lower BVA's employee contributions, whilst raising employer contributions to harmo nise the collection of contributions across funds, which could be rendered fiscally neutral. Gradually lower user charges for BVA insured to the regional fund level (GKK) to foster equity in the collection of contributions across funds. 598 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Multiple insured p ersons in Austria Single collection of contributions without a choice of carrier : introduce a single location for the collection of contributions, in addition to keeping maximum contribution bases in place. This can either be in the form of an independent entity or by nominating regional funds to collect contributions on behalf of all funds, in order to simplify the administration process. As such, the refund for excess contributions could be automatically calculated through an official channel, without the need for manual applications. An absolute hierarchy, or a hierarchy based on the main income source of an individual could be introduced to determine the carrier membership of an individual. Further studies on the financial impact on carriers need to be c onducted prior to application of this option. Single collection of contributions with a choice of carrier : similar to the option presented above, with the main difference that insured persons could choose their carrier of preference, based on their profess ions. While this option does not entirely eliminate inequity in the system, it may reduce the former, as insured could only switch carriers on an, for example, yearly basis, rather than intermittently charging different carriers. Multiple collections of c ontributions without a choice of carrier : insured individuals continue to pay to multiple carriers, however, the insured would be automatically assigned to a default carrier. This constitutes the carrier for which the insured pays the largest share of cont ributions and the insured is only entitled to benefits of the default carrier. All carriers receiving contributions for the insured would re -direct these contributions to the respective default carrier. In addition, the refund process for excess contributi ons could be automated, in order to reduce the administrative burden of manual applications and to eliminate inconveniences to the insured. Multiple collections of contributions with a choice of carrier : similar rationale to the option presented above, wit h the main difference that individuals have the option to choose a default fund to access services from, while the second carrier will conduct transfers of funds to the former. However, this would only lead to partial improvements in equity. Retrospective payments between carriers : one of the carriers conducts retrospective payments to the second insurance carrier, which was predominantly used by the insured person to access services. This system constitutes a modification of the current mechanism in that i t adds a compensatory mechanism to ensure the financial stability of funds. However, it must be noted that 599 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options this option may be more difficult to implement and does not render the system more equitable. See section 5.1.8 for further details. Policy options: Defining and harmonising benefits The following the policy options to define benefits within the healthcare system are proposed. Outpatient drugs : disclosure of outpatient drug assessments would render the current process more transparent. Inpatient drugs: enhance and strengthen coordination and procurement policies across regions and introduction of a transparent decision -making process for inpat ient pharmaceuticals. Establishment of an independent, arm's length HTA body : transition into an independent, arm's length HTA body that undertakes HTA for different types of technology and provides advice to relevant decision -makers in order to increase transparency. Promote a full HTA for a subset of technologies , particularly those that have important resource implications (high cost/high volume). Formal evaluations should be introduced across costly technologies and a threshold for this purpose should be established. Establish clear parameters regarding the conduct of HTA , such as type of evidence requirements and the types of evidence that can be admitted into assessment and appraisal. Provide guidance on methods of assessment and criteria (beyond c osts and effects); the role of stakeholder involvement; the appeals process and associated timelines; timelines for assessment and re -assessment for rapid reviews, full HTAs and multiple HTAs; and, the monitoring and implementation of decisions. Provide i nformation on the structure and composition of the relevant committee (technology Appraisal Committee - TAC), which needs to reflect the stakeholder complexity in the context of each technology type and the national -regional -local trade -offs that exist in different circumstances. The following the policy options to harmonise benefits within the healthcare system are proposed. Estimated cost of harmonising a specific set of benefits : initial costs of a harmonisation for specific goods and services (i.e. medical aids and therapeutic devices; dentures; health care services including psychotherapy, physiotherapy and logopedics) were estimated by increasing the per 600 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options capita expenditure lev els of those funds that are (1) below the average per capita expenditures across all funds and (2) below 70% of the highest per capita expenditure across all funds. Total additional costs per year of harmonising specific benefits across all funds : o (1) \u20ac171.075.130 (Risk -adjustment (age and gender) for medical aids and therapeutic devices: \u20ac176.988.291). Percentage change in expenditure of SHI for these benefits: 19.4% (20.1). o (2) \u20ac390.177.440 (Risk -adjustment (age and medical aids and the rapeutic devices: \u20ac394.090.543). 42.8% (43.6). While this study provides initial cost calculations, the harmonisation of benefits is a political decision to be taken by the government and stakeholders. Even though a harmonisation of benefits is central t o ensuring equity, it is noteworthy that Austria has one of the lowest levels of unmet need in Europe. Data collection : a unified collection of high -quality data that is comparable across funds is of central importance to supporting the harmonisation of b enefits. Further efforts are required to ensure uniform data storage and structure. Financing options in the case of a political decision to harmonise benefits: o (1) Partial funding could ensue through a risk -adjustment scheme, or enhanced risk - adjustment scheme o (2) Alternatively, or in addition, government funds could be directed to insurance carriers that offer a slightly less comprehensive benefits package compared to other funds. o (3) Further funds could be directed to the project by improving efficienc y in the system. For instance, a reduction in hospitalisations could lead to significant savings. However, significant investments in outpatient and primary care are required in the first instance to maintain high -quality care, whilst simultaneously reduci ng hospital admissions, meaning that savings to be used for a harmonisation could be generated in the mid - to long -term. o (4) In addition, better coordination and consolidation could also lead to efficiency gains, which could be directed in the form of sav ings to increase coverage of benefits in Austria. See section 5.2.6 for further details. 601 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: User charges The following policy opti ons to enhance efficiency and equity via user charges have been proposed. Please note, none of the policy options recommend an increase in user charges, rather a change in their composition to maximise efficiency within the system. Pharmaceutical cap: under this option, the universal 2% net income pharmaceutical cap would be replaced by a three -tiered cap, with insurees being allocated to caps according to their total income. Those in the lowest income band would be subject to a lower cap (i.e. 1.5%), m iddle income earners would see no change in their cap (i.e. remain at 2%), while high -income earners would see their cap increase to 2.5%. Depending on the success of the cap, consideration could be given to expanding the cap to all inpatient and outpatien t healthcare services. Value -based user charges : once a robust HTA system is in place, it is advised that rates of user charges be linked to HTA findings, with insurees paying less (or nothing) the more effective a product/service is. Ideally user charg es would take into account individual circumstances, however, this is associated with high -levels of administrative burden. Therefore, it is recommended that value -based user charges be linked to the effectiveness of products/medical devices/services (i.e. inverse relationship between effectiveness and co -insurance/payment rate). In the interim, policy - makers could encourage 'softer' value -based user charges, following the lead of the SVA and VAEB. Convergence of user charges to the lowest level: finally, i t is recommended that current trends continue by encouraging convergence of user charges across health insurance carriers to improve equity within the system. See section 5.3.8 for further details. Policy options: Investment in healthcare services Three policy options to enhance investments in healthcare services are proposed. These relate to accounting practices, reserves, and whether carriers should make or buy healthcare services. Accounting : to improve clarity, it is recommended that carriers only term liquid assets as 'reserves', that is, monies which can be used for investment purposes. Enhance use of reserves: to improve access to healt hcare services for all, it is advised that the use of reserves be enhanced, for example by: a) pooling all or a part of a carrier's contributions into 602 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options one fund for investment purposes (e.g. to enhance primary healthcare), b) encourage joint investment acro ss carriers (without pooling reserves), or c) encouraging carriers to open up their facilities to all individuals, not just their insured population. Make or buy : before investing in healthcare services, carriers should be encouraged to undertake a compre hensive analysis before investing, to determine whether it is most appropriate to make or buy (or concurrently source). However, to improve capacity within each health insurance carrier, it is encouraged that carriers invest, at least partly, in their own healthcare services. See section 5.4.3 for further details. Policy options: Broadening the social welfare base Austria is a strong economic p erformer, with a relatively high level of employment and GDP per capita. Economic growth is expected to grow over the next few years, however, consideration should be given to current and future challenges facing the economy including an ageing population, and a rise in self - employment, digitalisation and automation. Based on these challenges, the following policy options have been developed to ensure sustainability of the social insurance system. Education and skills : Align education with future skills re quired within the workforce, and encourage lifelong learning. Retirement policies : encourage further efforts to increase the actual retirement age (i.e. encourage people to stay in the workforce for longer). Workforce participation : continue efforts to increase the proportion of women working within the formal economy. Taxation policies : after 'softer' policy options, as those outlined above, have been introduced, consider changes to the tax system if further funds are required. Sp ecifically, by using total income as opposed to earned income as the basis for contributions, raising company contributions, and/or introducing additional earmarked health taxes. See section 5.5.4 for further details. 603 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: Contractual agreements To improve efficiency within the healthcare system via a change to contractual agreements, the following policy options are recommended. Thes e policy options have been broken down according to broad timelines, which reflect their relative importance. Short -term: Arbitration: to ensure a level playing field during contractual negotiations, the following option is proposed; allow the Federal Arbitration Committee to postpone the termination of contracts from three to six months, after six months an external arbiter would be intr oduced to facilitate negotiations. Given no agreement is reached, the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs would set the contractual agreement based on feedback from the external arbiter. Selective contracts: If certain items cannot be agreed upon in t he general contract, allow social health insurance carriers to selectively contract (e.g. to fill physician vacancies). Structural plans: if current regional structural plans fail to achieve their desired objective, it is advised that an independent com mittee be developed to provide recommendations on the number and locations of physicians. Recommendations would form the basis of contractual negotiations, with a requirement to justify any deviations to the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs. Harmon isation among specialists: Harmonise naming of services/items across outpatient specialists to improve transparency. Primary and outpatient care: given the high number of hospital admissions, it is clear that primary care within the healthcare system requ ires improvement. Multiple policies could be introduced to achieve this, for example, by encouraging group practices, primary healthcare units, and extending hospital outpatient departments and disease management programs. It is important to note that efficiency gains from enhancing primary care are only realisable in the medium - to long -term given fixed supply -side costs within the inpatient sector (e.g. buildings, labour). Medium -term: Bundled payments: to enhance coordination and continuity of care, so cial health insurance and L\u00e4nder could implement joint budgets for chronically ill patients who frequently access healthcare services. Such an approach would avoid patients 'wandering' the system and ensure that appropriate care is provided. 604 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Rural and rem ote GP remuneration : to increase the number of physicians working in rural and remote areas, it is recommended that GPs in these areas be paid on a risk -adjusted capitated budgets, which takes into account the unique circumstances of working in these areas . To further incentivise physicians, flat rate payments could be introduced to complement capitated budgets, such payments should be linked to actions/services that promote overall improvement in healthcare quality (e.g. smoking cessation programs). Long -term: GP remuneration : if the capitated system amongst rural and remote GPs is successful, consideration could be given to extending the scheme to urban GPs, who would also receive additional flat rate payments. Role of GPs : it is recommended that the ro le of GPs in the healthcare system be enhanced to relieve the burden placed on inpatient care, specifically, by encouraging individuals to register with a single GP who would take responsibility for the individual's overall healthcare plan. Such a system w ould be voluntary, and only realisable once appropriate structures and processes have been put in place (e.g. more advanced GP training, greater number of GPs). See section 6.3.8 for further details. Policy options: Healthcare quality Policy options to improve healthcare quality within the system have been grouped into three categories. First, changes to the role \u00d6QMed, second, changes to data availability and quality indicators, and third, changes to hospital admissions, readmissions a nd discharge management. In regard to the role of \u00d6QMed: Retain \u00d6QMed and create an additional independent quality committee responsible for monitoring the quality of care among contracted and non -contracted physicians. Relocate \u00d6QMed to the Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, and give the organisation control over monitoring the quality of care among contracted and non -contracted physicians. Maximise the value of data collected through quality indicators through, for example, providing physician feed back and sharing best practice principles. 605 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options In regard to data availability and quality indicators : Develop a coding system for outpatient diagnosis, this would allow outcome indicators to be implemented. Increase focus on outcome indicators, and where poss ible link them to aligning process indicators. Link quality indicators across all levels of care to develop patient pathways. Allocate responsibility for developing and implementating indicators to the relevant professional group within the St\u00e4ndiger Koord inierungsausschuss. However, any new indicators should be developed in consultation with the medical community. In regard to hospital admissions, readmissions and discharge management: Research is needed to investigate the causes, as well as clinical and policy implications, of high rates of hospital discharge and readmission in Austria (outside remit of this review). In order to outbalance political benefits and costs, federal government funds to L\u00e4nder should be based on objective criteria that reflect the needs of the population. Apply additional pressure from the financial targets within the Zielsteuerung Gesundheit and the stability pact (i.e. using real values instead of nominal values). Austrian Structural Health Plan to base its forecasts on epide miological data and best practice of service provision, rather than using current demand as a proxy for need Further integrate secondary care units in the outpatient sector with primary and hospital care In regard to payment of care, for hospitals, the LKF system could be linked to quality of care, while in the first instance, a DRG system within the outpatient sector is advised, given this would improve information on patient pathways. Finally, and as pre viously mentioned under 'medium term' contractual agreements, bundled payments using funds from a joint budget (between L\u00e4nder and social insurance) could be introduced, with pilots first being run for multi -morbid, high cost patients. See section 6.4.6 for further details. 606 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: Demand and supply of physicians Policy options to increase the availability of physicians include: Improving work -life balance for both male and female physicians, especially in regard to child and elderly care (with a specific focus on those working in rural and remote areas). Reducing incentives for physicians to emigrate , for example, by providing c larity over future work conditions, ensuring working conditions are compatible with those abroad in regard to hours worked and reimbursement. Reducing the 'brain drain' occurring during the transition phase between medical school and professional training , for example, by improving training programs and ensuring these programs are allocated sufficient time. Checking if working time directive compliance necessitates prolongation of training periods , especially for specialists who need also dexterity, not o nly knowledge. Policy options to increase the productivity of physicians include: Improving the reputation of physicians working in primary care , for example, via additional GP training requirements to fulfill their responsibilities within newly establis hed primary healthcare units. Delineating physician roles within primary healthcare units and those performed within a hospital outpatient department . Free -up time of physicians by allocating relatively 'low -skilled' tasks to other healthcare professiona ls (such an approach may require additional education training for other health care professionals). Training and motivating existing professionals to adjust to re -allocations of tasks and responsibilities given the number of physicians nearing retirement age. See section 6.5.3 for further details. Policy options: Monitoring and information needs The following policy options relating to e -health are provided below: Synergy potentials in data storage : identify synergy potentials between data storage sites, while avoiding the construction of new sites, in order to make efficient use of existing capacity. 607 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options E-prescribing and recall system : introduce automated electronic prescribing and a recall system for medical adherence to reduce prescribing -related errors, while concurrently improving control of prescriptions, reducing time spent on prescription queries and promoting continuity of care. E-vaccination : implement an e -vaccination application with a reca ll system in order to create an optimised overview of immunisation status and vaccination schedule, whilst preventing duplicate immunisations and possible adverse events from drug -to-drug interactions. A national electronic immunisation data collection sys tem could further improve the monitoring and evaluation of immunisation rates in Austria. Digital imaging in ELGA : expand the database for digital images from different medical devices to improve site - and time -independent information sharing between medic al professionals and health care enterprises to enhance operational efficiency and to prevent unnecessary repeat examinations. Standardisation of the diagnosis classification system : inclusion of outpatient diagnoses may constitute a better representation of a patient's medical history and interoperability could be improved by standardising the diagnosis classification system. Evaluation and monitoring of a patient's medical history : a tracking system with a search function to monitor the development of s pecific parameters, such as blood pressure, may further enhance patient treatment. Further efforts should be undertaken to implement a patient summary. Expansion of data collection : a more extensive patient record, which, for example, includes information from the yearly medical check -up, could further improve patient -centred care, provided an insured person has expressed interest in the service. Immediate sharing of information on health care use : providing information on health care costs in addition to t he utilisation of services through ELGA's online portal could enable year -round access to necessary information for patients and prevent billing errors. Dissemination of information on ELGA to health care providers: develop ELGA showcases that could be pr esented to health care providers, such as pharmacies, to facilitate and support the roll out of ELGA across as many health care providers as possible. See section 6.6.2 for further details. 608 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Policy options: Pharmaceutical expenditure and procurement The following three policies are recommended in regard to pharmaceutical expenditure: Enhance international relationships to gain a better understanding of drug transaction prices within the outpatient market. Currently, external reference pricing, which draws upon list prices, is used, which doesn't necessarily reflect actual prices paid for drugs. Austria should consid er modifying domestic regulations on statutory prescription drug price cuts so that they are linked to patent expiration rather than generic drug entry. Limit the risk faced by payers and promote efficient use of resources by introducing managed entry agreements. To enhance the use of generics, the following policies are suggested: Given the increasing demand for healthcare services, we recommend increasing the role of pharmacists within the healthcare system, which would enhance efficiency and reduce the burden placed on physicians. Incentivise physicians to prescribe more generics, where appropriate . Finally, to enhance procurement policies: Effort should be directed at improving interface management between inpatien t and outpatient pharmaceutical sectors to limit cost -shifting and improve coordination of patient treatment. For example, by developing a joint budget for all pharmaceuticals, enhancing the role of the Medikamentenkommission, and /or enhancing ELGA so tha t information regarding a patient's drug treatment (in both inpatient and outpatient settings) is easily understood by prescribers. See section 6.7.5 for further details. Policy options: Health literacy, disease prevention, health promotion The following policy options relating to health literacy and disease prevention are provided below: Health literacy Improving health communication between patients and doctors : Clear health communication between patients and doctors could be further improved by specifying specific criteria pertaining 609 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options to the communication process (e.g. 'teach back'; avoiding jargon) in the Chamber of Physician's quality evalu ation criteria of physician practices or in contracts. Expand the dissemination of health information : the national self -information portal could offer a number of additional language settings, other than German, in order to increase use of the site. A child-friendly, interactive information site could be developed as well. Increase role of different stakeholders : the role of various stakeholders in promoting health literacy should be increased. For instance, a point of contact for patients with limited he alth literacy levels should be defined to offer training and support, such as patient ombudsperson offices, while physicians could direct the respective patients to these contact points. Pharmacists could be further trained to identify and manage patients with lower literacy levels. Module on health literacy : a module on health literacy in the education setting (e.g. primary or secondary education) could be introduced to establish a solid and uniform health literacy knowledge basis across population groups. Disease prevention Immunisation Inclusion of vaccinations in the mother -child passport : create awareness and incentivize immunisation of children to increase low childhood immunisation rates. Coverage of cost -effective vaccines for adults : an additional coverage of adult vaccinations, where cost-effective, could potentially increase adult immunisation rates of a number of important vaccine -preventable diseases. Walk -in vaccination and injection services at pharmacies : by introducing walk in vaccination and injection services at community pharmacies, following a prescription by a physician, the immunisation process could be rendered more flexible, time -saving and convenient to patients. E-vaccination to improve monitoring and re -calling of -, as well as data collection on vaccinations : implement an e -vaccination application with a recall system in order to create an optimised overview of immunisation status and vaccination schedule, whilst preventing duplicate immunisations and possible adver se events from drug -to-drug interactions. A national electronic immunisation data collection system could further improve the monitoring and evaluation of immunisation rates in Austria. Diabetes 610 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Expansion of the diabetes disease -management -programme (DMP) : in order to improve the equity and quality of diabetes treatment in Austria, it is suggested to further strengthen efforts in the disease management programme, which should be gradually expanded over time. Remuneration of DMP -physicians : the financial com pensation of DMP -physicians should be assessed in order to ensure appropriate rewards in line with the time taken to manage diabetes patients, and to incentivise more physicians to enter the programme. Training of physicians : inclusion of diabetes specific -tasks in the grid certificate may further expose physicians to additional training and as such improve the management of patients with diabetes. Another option is to render further training more binding by defining explicit follow -up measures in the case that physicians fail to follow the training. Training of DMP -physicians : the introduction of a voluntary training and a confidential supervision by experiences diabetes specialists may increase physician participation in the DMP programme. Establishment o f a national diabetes registry : By extending data collection efforts, a national diabetes registry could be implemented in order to improve the collection of data to monitor and evaluate trends in diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases Comprehensive study: Unde rtake a comprehensive study into the underlying factors of the high CVD disease burden and mortality in Austria. Based on the findings, appropriate measures could be introduced to reduce CVD -related morbidity and mortality. See sections 7.1.3 , 7.1.5 and 7.1.9 for further details. Policy options: Case and care management A total of eight policy options to enhance case and care management within Austria have been proposed: Target case management and other types of coordinated care based on need Pilot new models, evaluate pilots rigorously and scale up successful ones Increase organisational and financial integration of providers Ensure comprehensiveness of the range of services covered by case management Include in ter-disciplinary cooperation in education and training programs of professionals 611 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options Continue strengthening the role of primary care and embed case management in primary care Provide workplace and return -to-work interventions early Embed case management in bro ad return -to-work interventions. See section 7.2.7 for further details. Policy options: Administration costs The following policy option relating to administration costs is provided below: Administration caps: link caps to potential economies of scale arising from more streamlined activities, as opposed to historical allocations. Alternatively, require health insurance carriers to justify higher administration costs, given such costs are often required to improv e equality (e.g. performance measurement). See section 8.2.3 for further details. Policy options: Healthcare fraud Healthcare fraud leads to a significant amount of waste in healthcare systems across the world, including Austria. To combat healthcare fraud and limit waste within the system, the following two policy options are recommended: Comprehensive study: Jointly undertake a comprehensive study into the types of healthcare fraud within the system, including an es timate of their associated costs based on findings within the study, implement appropriate policies to create an environment that limits the opportunity for fraud to occur Digitali sation: enhance the sophistication of ELGA to enable health insurance carriers to better identify instance of healthcare fraud See section 8.3.8 for further details. 612 Volume 1: International comparisons and policy options References 1.
