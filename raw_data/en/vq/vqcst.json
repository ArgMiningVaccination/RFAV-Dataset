Plans and expectations for 2020 have been put aside and priorities redirected to our present challenges during this chaotic time. We are working long hours. At times, we are tired and need some rest and relaxation. As I reflect on my personal experience and those of fellow IPs, I am extremely proud and grateful. We are the backbone of infection prevention and control strategies that are more critical than ever within our healthcare institu - tions. We advocate for healthcare providers and patients to keep them safe during this unprecedented time. Our day-to-day work is never the same and largely focuses on the critical needs, which seem to change from moment to moment. I suspect your days are much like mine, filled with incident command discussions; multiple meetings with colleagues to address the current changes in guid - ance; addressing the shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and disinfectant; educating healthcare providers and the community; and\u2014most importantly\u2014listening to and addressing the understandable fears of healthcare providers and community members who want to be safe and healthy. People are looking to us for our opinions and expertise. IPs are stepping up to the plate and giving tirelessly of themselves by doing interviews and providing educational programs for the web or TV in efforts to address questions and educate. Many of us are helping the extended healthcare community by reaching out to post acute-care settings such as nursing homes and physician practices to support their needs. APIC is supporting us through its COVID-19 resources site ( apic.org/covid19 ) and continues to advocate for needed access to PPE and other supplies. As we address the unknowns of COVID-19, I encourage you to con - tinue supporting each other. Along with accessing the APIC COVID-19 resources site, APIC members are using IP Talk to ask questions and garner wisdom from their fellow IPs. The Corporate IP Director group is actively offering a forum for the exchange of information. These opportunities to stay connected remind us we are not alone. We are better together! I also encourage all of you to focus on the positive and take pride in successes. Every day we review data regarding the number of new cases and mortality. We can celebrate the number of infected patients and health - care providers who are fully recovered! We can contemplate the number of avoided cases due to the implementation of infection prevention and control efforts to mitigate risk! Let us take time to recognize and honor the good that is resulting from our efforts. Me? I'm in terrible need of a haircut. I miss hugging my children and grandchildren. I want to go out for dinner with my husband at our favorite restaurant. But I am energized by our shared work and the comradery I feel every day. In closing, I urge you to remember self-care. Take some time away from the chaos and renew your spirit. Stay connected to your loved ones with phone calls and Facetime. A few weeks ago, during a particularly stressful day, my colleagues looked at me and said, \"Connie, go home. We've got this!\" I needed some respite from work\u2014and I am sure my colleagues needed some respite from me! I deserved a break. And you do, too. Thank you for your service to the healthcare organizations where you work and to the communities where you live. As APIC president, I remain proud and grateful.

It is with a full heart and gratitude that I thank all of you\u2014members, volunteers, strategic partners, exhibitors, sponsors, partner organizations and agencies, and all stakeholders. Your positive regard, loyalty, and generosity are deeply appreciated. I have enjoyed our time together. As CEO, there are three very special groups of people, the professional staff, the committees, and the board of directors, that have continually inspired me and helped me grow. No leader accomplishes anything alone or perhaps anything at all. It is the professional staff, committee members, and members of the board who make what matters most happen. My sin - cerest thanks to the many people over the many years who have served and continue to serve in these positions. I applaud and celebrate your creativity, dedication, expertise, and future-oriented thinking! I also want to express my heartfelt appreciation to every elected presi - dent and especially those with whom I had the privilege to co-lead APIC during my tenure. This partnership is a special relationship that develops throughout the year, and I am truly grateful for each unique experience and for our time together. I wish you all the very best, and I know that APIC will soar to greater heights and strategic impact! I look forward to checking in on you from time to time to hear all about it. In closing, I celebrate all that we have achieved together. And, I say to myself a quote often attributed to Dr. Seuss, \"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.\" Katrina Crist, MBA, CAE APIC CEOPrevention On behalf of the APIC Board of Directors, I would like to thank Katrina for all that she has accomplished during her nine years of service as CEO.

While these past few months have cer - tainly been challenging times, I commend infection preventionists (IPs) and those Certified in Infection Prevention and Control (CIC\u00ae) for rising to the occasion as industry leaders. This is not the first IPC challenge we have faced, and it will not be the last. I encourage all members of the IPC community out there to trust in one another! Thank you to everyone\u2014IPs and CICs alike\u2014for all your hard work in keeping the public safe. An update on CBIC's new initiatives My first column as the 2020 Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology (CBIC) president addressed the incredible growth and progress made by the CBIC Board of Directors and CBIC staff in launching recertification by Infection Prevention Units (IPUs) and the Associate\u2014Infection Prevention and Control (a-IPC) entry-level examination. Over the past couple of months, CBIC has developed a number of resources to help recerti - fying candidates navigate the new recertification by continuing education submission process. This includes recording an instructional IPUs webinar, continuing to make updates to the IPUs Manual and FAQ page, and collaborating with CBIC's partner organizations to best communicate with CICs and answer questions about IPUs. I encourage all of you to check out these resources on our website: cbic.org . I am pleased to announce that the a-IPC examination will officially launch sometime in summer 2020. I am looking forward to identifying new target markets for this entry-level offering, which should help pave the way for individuals interested in learning more about IPC or pursuing a career in IPC. Stay tuned for updates on the a-IPC by visiting cbic.org/CBIC/Get-Certified/Get-Started/a-IPC.htm . What's on the horizon In addition to recertification by IPUs and the a-IPC, CBIC is working on conducting a practice analysis of IPC professionals. Upon completion of the practice analysis, the CIC examination will be updated to accurately reflect the responsibilities and expectations of those working in IPC. The goal is to have this completed by September 2020. Finally, although we will not have the opportunity to meet with you in person at the APIC 2020 Conference, CBIC is working hard to identify new, virtual ways of connecting with our CICs.

She has a bachelor's degree in applied health science from Bowling Green State University and a master of public health degree (focused on epidemiology) from the Northwest Ohio Consortium for Public Health. She is currently the IP at Dublin Methodist Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital and serves on the board for the Central Ohio APIC Chapter 53. What inspired you to become an IP? While I was in graduate school, I focused on working within the public health sector, and I knew I wanted to do research or continue working within the healthcare setting. I stumbled upon a surveillance tech job with the infec - tion prevention team at Riverside Methodist Hospital. During my time in that position, I focused on case monitoring and reporting for the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), which meant I was able to learn more about what infection prevention was and how each day was something unique. When a position opened up within our health system to be an IP supporting Dublin Methodist and Grady Memorial Hospitals, I knew that this was the right move for me. I love that I can put my interest in data and educational background together to continue best-practice work. What were some of your challenges when you first entered the field? My biggest challenge was knowing where to start. I was lucky when I became an IP that I had a background doing NHSN surveillance, so I knew that small part of the IP world. But there is so much that you do not realize you need to know about, and that was overwhelming. I had to figure out who followed which guidelines, and where those guidelines lived. That was my biggest challenge. My next challenge was overcoming the idea that I have to know everything on the spot. When I started in my current role, I thought that I needed to have the answers quickly because I was the only IP for my facilities. I have since learned that it is okay to say, \"I am not sure right now\u2014let me go do some research and get back with you.\" You can't know what you don't know, which I feel is the hardest hurdle to overcome. We all want to be the heroes in our field, but even heroes need sidekicks sometimes. What has helped you most as you have progressed in your role as an IP? I could not be where I am today without my IP team, my quality leaders, and my local Central Ohio APIC Chapter. We rely on each other's experiences and subject matter knowledge to get through unusual situations that arise. I can call on any of them for assistance with a question or a project without feeling self-conscious that I should already know the answer.A conversation with an infection preventionist LEANN WHITE, MPH, CIC SENIOR CONSULTANT, INFECTION PREVENTION PRACTITIONEROHIOHEALTH DUBLIN METHODIST AND GRADY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL \"I could not be where I am today without my IP team, my quality leaders, and my local Central Ohio APIC Chapter. We rely on each other's experiences and subject matter knowledge to get through unusual situations that arise.\"18 | SUMMER 2020 | Prevention How has your background helped you in the infection prevention and control profession? My background has helped me view multiple sides of situa - tions. I can come at problems with a very quantitative mindset and show you all the data to support or dispute ideas. However, I also have floor-staff experience, so I know something about the struggles that I am asking staff to overcome. I am able to take what I have learned from my different educational opportuni - ties and apply them to a range of experiences to show what the outcomes have been. Why is maintaining the CIC credential important to you? Studying for and obtaining the CIC helps validate that I am competent as an IP. It provides an avenue for professional growth and demonstrates my commitment to continued learn - ing. Having the CIC is a badge of pride and should be viewed as a major accomplishment. How did you prepare for the CIC exam? The first thing I did was set a goal with my manager to take my exam. Once that was set, I researched all of the different resources available. I ended up selecting the APIC Study Guide and following CBIC on Facebook for Micro Monday and Tuesday test questions. When I would miss quiz questions, I would go back to the regulatory resource and read more on the topic for clarification. If you are a hands-on learner, my best advice is to do rounds with your different area directors. I spent a lot of time rounding in all of the different depart - ments so that I could see how what I had been reading is put into action. What is the best advice you ever received? My favorite piece of advice is that there is no such thing as failure. In my experience, most people feel pressured to get the best results the first time. I include myself in this group\u2014I always have to remind myself that we may not have achieved the results we wanted, but we learned through the process, and maybe we can use our findings to answer another question. If you define outcomes as a failure, you learn nothing. What advice do you have for others who are new to the field or considering becoming an IP? Keep asking, \"Why?\" The first thing I learned coming into the field is that you will repeatedly hear people say, \"Well, we have always done it that way.\" Keep investigating and discuss - ing the \"why\" until you get to the root of the problem; taking this approach helps guide you away from the quick fixes. 1005370_Diversey.indd 1 03/04/2020 gured and expandedSTARC provides fast and fl exible options to create surge capacity in existing hospital spaces STARC is the leading temporary containment expert trusted by top healthcare organizations around the country to prevent infection spread.

We felt we had an exceptional program and were the leader in Washington, D.C., and the sur - rounding region. The team had seasoned, educated, certified infection preventionists (IPs), and we were mentoring a new IP, so we really felt like we were ready to go for it. Jan said a good word, penetration . We always felt the infection prevention pro - gram permeated throughout the hospi - tal. It wasn't just the six of us within the department. It was really a hospital-wide/ system-wide integrated program. What are the top three things you would recommend to future Program of Distinction applicants? What should they do before they hit \"send\" on the application? Mary: 1. Ensure they have the appropriate level of staff competency in their program. 2. Make sure infection prevention per - meates every aspect, division, and person within the organization, from the CEO to the environmental service workers. 3. Believe that they truly are a Program of Distinction, meet the highest Mary, as a member of the first cohort of facilities recognized by the Program of Distinction, tell us about your decision to bring this program to your leadership. Mary McFadden: Our infection pre - vention department started thinking about the Program of Distinction des - ignation as soon as it was announced by APIC and again when we heard about Vanderbilt's designation. Georgetown is a high-reliability organization, working and striving for excellence in patient quality and patient safety. We had many discus - sions within the department and included the chief of infectious disease, Princy N. Kumar, MD, and we all decided that our program was robust and integrated, and we were prepared to begin the journey to a Program of Distinction designation.Jan, you were part of the core team that designed the APIC Program of Distinction. Tell us about the intent of the program. Jan Frain: The intent is to recognize facilities that have shown a track record of excellence in infection prevention and control. We originally designed the program to assess policies and proce - dures based on the APIC Program of Distinction Standards of Excellence for Infection Prevention and Control, and during the onsite assessment, we assess the penetration of infection prevention within the organization\u2014the support IPC has from the administration and staff. The designation is like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for meeting the high IPC standards set by APIC.What is it like to pursue the APIC\u00ae Program of Distinction? BY KATE DETWEILER MEDSTAR GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY Hospital achieved the APIC\u00ae Program of Distinction designation in 2019 by meeting the Standards of Excellence for Infection Prevention and Control (IPC). They were commended for demonstrating a culture of open communication and interdepartmental collaboration that fosters patient safety, with noted engagement and support for their IPC program found at all levels of the organization. To learn more about how organizations achieve this honor, we talked with Mary McFadden, RN, MHA, CIC, FAPIC, former director of Infection Prevention at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and Jan Frain, RN, CIC, CPHRM, past president of the APIC Board of Directors (2008), clinical subject expert for the APIC Program of Distinction Core Development team, and member of the APIC Program of Distinction Assessment team.www.apic.org | 21standards of infection prevention, and set an example to other programs in the country. Jan: 1. Read the Standards of Excellence. 2. Identify gaps. If you need to bolster one area, polish it up first. 3. Don't apply unless you're ready. When you feel like you have a document to support each standard, go for it! Jan, tell us about the value of the application process and the feedback that is given to facilities, whether or not they pass that phase. Jan: The application review process is rigorous. We admit that. The goal of the application process is to get as much information as possible ahead of time to make sure that what we're looking at in the policies and procedures reflects the quality we are looking for. It's like a Joint Commission survey solely focused on IPC. If the organization doesn't pass the application phase, there is great value in identifying any gaps in the infection prevention program. Jan, tell us about the onsite assessment. Jan: The assessment team is prepared by the application review, which includes a detailed review of all infection preven - tion policies and procedures, and an exchange with the facility before coming on site, so you [the assessors] know where you're going to start when you land at the organization. It's such a privilege to visit hospitals like MedStar Georgetown and see the great work that's being done. We don't expect facilities to be perfect, but it's clear that IPC works very hard at that facility. When you walk through the halls and everyone calls the IPs by name, you know that they don't do their work sitting behind a com - puter in an office. The ownership that the staff took of their data, performance improvement, and improving patient safety was very impressive. They passed the litmus test of the document review and onsite they had an incredible focus on infection prevention and patient safety. Mary: I'm glad that Jan said noth - ing is perfect. If you're perfect, you have nothing to strive for. We are constantly trying to improve, constantly looking inward and seeing what we can do to promote patient safety. We were left with recommendations about things we could improve upon. Jan, what are the top items that you look for when conducting an onsite assessment for a Program of Distinction designation? Jan: First, do people know who the IPs are? It's one thing to do surveillance sitting in an office, so I look for that personal recognition. Next, the staff's willingness to engage with the assessment team. When we were onsite at Medstar Georgetown, no one hid, and everyone was willing to talk to the assessment team. Finally, we evaluate knowledge\u2014and more than just bedside knowledge. What are your data? What is your CLABSI rate? What is your hand hygiene rate? We look to see if what we see in the documents is reflected in practice. What is the real return on investment of the Program of Distinction? Why should facilities pursue this designation? Mary: There were lessons learned through the entire journey. One of the most valuable things was to take an inter - nal, in-depth, evidence-based review of the program. I've been in infection pre - vention for decades, and we are always looking for what can we change and what can we improve. The journey and pro - cesses really allowed us to identify gaps and improve. We talked about the Program of Distinction throughout the organiza - tion and learned a lot from everyone's questions. Our C-suite has always been engaged and interested in IPC beyond the infection prevention rates. Going through this process allowed the C-suite to really see what our infection prevention program entails and what we do within the organization. Jan: Hospitals go through multiple surveys, but having an IPC subject matter expert come in and look at your program is much more valuable than a generic survey. It really adds value to the organization. Mary, what was the response from hospital staff and stakeholders when MedStar Georgetown was awarded the Program of Distinction designation? Mary: They were thrilled. Georgetown associates are accustomed to surveys\u2014we go through surveys for transplant, oncol - ogy, neurology, and other programs to get accreditations. We have an international flair, so we are used to dealing with people from all walks of life and are accustomed to visitors and surveyors. Georgetown had just achieved their fourth Magnet designation [from the American Nurses Credentialing Center]. Achieving the APIC Program of Distinction further validated that we are truly committed to high-quality, safe patient care and everyone is empowered to speak up for patient safety. It's nice to have that recognized.

On January 21, the U.S. confirmed its first COVID-19 patient in Washington state. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a Public Health Emergency, allowing CDC to tap the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund to prepare for a poten - tial COVID-19 outbreak. This fund was established in 2019 to have money available immediately in case of an infec - tious disease outbreak. The funds were meant to be a bridge for health entities to begin responding until Congress could appropriate necessary funding. When this outbreak began, the reserve had a little more than $100 million to begin a response to the COVID-19 threat.more than a dozen countries reported cases of COVID-19 by the end of January. On March 11, 2020, WHO announced that COVID-19 was a global pandemic; by this time, the United States was in the early stages of an outbreak. In this Capitol Comments, we review key developments from the first reports out of China until mid-April 2020. The administration's early response As the number of COVID-19 cases increased in China, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started to call attention to the infec - tion by warning Americans traveling to China to be careful and announcing its ON DECEMBER 31, 2019, China alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) of unusual cases of pneumonia appearing in Wuhan, a port city in the Hubei province. Within a week, Chinese officials ruled out a recurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from 2002-2003 and identified that this outbreak was associ - ated with a new virus. The novel pathogen was identified as a coronavirus and named 2019-nCoV. It was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, and the infection it causes is known as coronavi - rus disease (COVID-19). Within a few weeks of the initial reports of infection, travel was heavily restricted in Hubei to help prevent the spread of the virus. Despite these efforts, CAPITOL COMMENTS The initial U.S. response to COVID-19 BY RICH CAPPARELL, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS; NANCY HAILPERN, DIRECTOR, REGULATORY AFFAIRS; AND LISA TOMLINSON, VICE PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND PRACTICE GUIDANCE \"Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\" \u2014Winston Churchill FERHAT/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMwww.apic.org | 27Shortly after the CDC tapped the fund, President Donald Trump appointed a federal Coronavirus Task Force, whose objectives were leading the \"United States government response to the novel 2019 coronavirus and ... keeping him apprised of developments.\" The president would later appoint Vice President Mike Pence to head the U.S. response to coronavirus. On January 31, the president announced he would no longer allow foreign nationals who traveled to China within the last 14 days to enter the U.S. Over the next several weeks, the admin - istration would expand the travel ban to include Iran, South Korea, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. These travel bans did not apply to U.S. residents or their families. Legislative actions First COVID-19 Supplemental In February, the president requested that Congress make available $2.5 bil - lion in new and existing funds for the coronavirus response. APIC had some concerns about this approach because it allowed the transfer of funds from other infection control programs within the CDC to the coronavirus response. APIC sought to have the coronavirus efforts funded independently without undermin - ing existing programs. Congress quickly moved on a funding proposal and increased the amount to $8.3 billion. The legislation, which was signed by President Trump on March 6, allocated most new funds for programs to help Medicare providers administer tele - health services; state and local prepared - ness grants; research and development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; and procurement of pharmaceuticals, per - sonal protective equipment (PPE), and other medical supplies. This measure was largely expected to be only a first step in funding to fight the coronavirus. Families First Coronavirus Response Act As the number of COVID-19 cases continued to climb in March, concerns about the ability of the healthcare system to care for an influx of patients came to the forefront. To enforce \"social distanc - ing\" and slow the spread of the virus, many states closed businesses deemed nonessential and prohibited or discour - aged activities that involved groups of people, such as eating in restaurants. Schools and universities shut down or shifted to remote learning; sporting events, concerts, and other social gath - erings were canceled; and employees who could work from home were encouraged or required to do so. These developments would all greatly impact the economy, forcing Congress to focus the next two large stimulus bills on the economy. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed by President Trump on March 18, provided a variety of supplements to the social safety net. It focused on programs to help sick and quarantined workers have access to emergency paid leave and tax credits for employers to provide paid time off for protracted absences from work. The act also provided funding to state programs for food security, unemployment, and Medicaid, and it included funding for uninsured Americans to be tested for coronavirus. Another Family First Act item that caught the attention of APIC was a requirement for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue an Emergency Temporary Infectious Disease Standard within 30 days. The standard must require healthcare employers to develop and implement a comprehensive infectious disease expo - sure control plan based on the guidelines established during the previous SARS outbreak in 2003. CARES Act Shortly after the passage of the Families First Act, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which President Trump signed into law on March 27. Similar to the Families First Act, this measure was largely focused on reliev - ing the economic impacts of the virus. The CARES Act provided more than $2 trillion in funding to a large swath of the U.S. economy. Much of the fund - ing supported industries affected by the economic slowdown and covered direct payments to households. Health-related funding in the CARES Act included support for public health data surveillance; reimbursement to hospitals and healthcare providers for COVID-19-related expenses and lost revenue; procurement of PPE, ventilators, and other medical supplies; and expand - ing the capacity of healthcare facilities to respond to medical events, including those involving populations vulnerable to severe illness from coronavirus. Regulatory responses to COVID-19 Initiatives to supply PPE As the possibility of a coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. loomed, one of the first concerns expressed by the infection prevention and control (IPC) commu - nity was the need for PPE. These con - cerns were magnified by a recent recall of certain gowns and awareness that many pieces of PPE are manufactured in China, which also has an increased need for PPE due to its own outbreak. States began searching for PPE while awaiting help from the federal government. To date, PPE production has not kept up with demand, despite efforts by the Trump administration, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), CDC, OSHA, state governments, private industry, and individuals all working to alleviate the PPE shortage. FDA FDA was one of the first agencies to take action to expand the supply of PPE. The agency relaxed its regulations to allow the use of respirators that were certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for industrial use but not approved by FDA for use in health - care settings. Additionally, FDA issued a letter to healthcare personnel (HCP) rec - ommending strategies to conserve masks when supplies become stressed. FDA's Emergency Use Authorization permitted the agency to rapidly and 28 | SUMMER 2020 | Prevention temporarily relax regulations to allow use of unapproved medical products to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious diseases during public health emergencies. Using this authority, FDA relaxed regulations related to laborato - ries testing for COVID-19 and testing requirements for diagnostics and treat - ments of the virus; provided guidance for compounding facilities on how to make hand sanitizer to replenish a dwindling supply; approved rapid diagnostic tests that could get COVID-19 results to patients more rapidly; provided guidance on allowable meth - ods of cleaning N-95 respirators, which were in short supply; and provided flexibility on the manu - facturing of ventilators and other respiratory devices by allowing modi - fications to existing devices and allow - ing non-medical-device companies to produce ventilator parts, without trig - gering a premarket review. CDC Since the first reports of the novel pathogen, CDC continually provided updated guidance as more became known about the virus. Guidance was both gen - eral and specific to care settings, pro - vider types, and patient populations. To ensure CDC was providing the guidance needed on an interim basis to deal with the COVID-19 crisis, CDC leaders also had frequent calls with leaders of APIC and other stakeholder organizations to hear about the needs and concerns of HCP in the field. CMS At the request of APIC and other healthcare allies, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) invoked on March 22 the Extraordinary Circumstances Exception to suspend reporting requirements for health - care facilities and clinicians par - ticipating in Medicare Quality Reporting, Value-Based Purchasing, and Healthcare-Acquired Condition Reduction programs. Additionally, CMS suspended non-emergency inspections of healthcare facilities and would only focus inspections on complaints alleging infec - tion control concerns. OSHA In recognition of the need to conserve PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic, OSHA issued on March 14 Temporary Enforcement Guidance to provide health - care facilities some leniency around annual fit testing requirements for N-95 respirators under certain circumstances. EPA In an effort to supplement the stretched supply chain, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used its author - ity to accelerate the arrival of certain key products to the market. The EPA acti - vated its emerging viral pathogens guid - ance for antimicrobial pesticides. Under this guidance, the agency provided pesti - cide registrants with a voluntary process to enable the use of certain EPA-registered disinfectant products against COVID-19, giving hospitals and households a wider range of products to clean and disinfect surfaces. APIC's role As the premier organization repre - senting infection preventionists (IPs), APIC focused its efforts on several key areas: providing the public with infor - mation about the virus, making sure the voices of IPs were heard, and giving IPs the resources they needed during the pandemic. (For more details on APIC's response, see pp. 46-49.) Educating APIC members and the public Providing updates to the public and APIC members became the association's top priority during the pandemic. From the start, APIC President Connie Steed sent regular email updates to APIC mem - bers about the outbreak. These emails were an important way to summarize the latest breaking news around COVID-19 and highlight resources available from APIC and others. To supplement these efforts, the Public Policy team regularly updated the \"What's New\" section of the Public Policy website and sent information to APIC members who subscribed to the Action eList. APIC's Facebook and Twitter platforms were continually used to deliver similar messages. Finally, IP Talk provided many members with a platform to ask for advice from colleagues and sometimes just vent about issues. IP Talk was also a key resource for APIC advocacy efforts, as it was an excellent way to learn about what IPs were experiencing on the ground. As media attention focused on COVID-19, APIC leaders were impor - tant sources of information for the public. APIC President Steed and other APIC leaders consistently reinforced to the public the importance of hand hygiene and social distancing, the need for PPE, and the difference between disinfection and cleaning. Their media outreach spanned from quotes in local print media to appearances on national TV shows such as \"Good Morning America.\" These media opportunities not only provided IPs with a prominent voice during these uncertain times but also highlighted the expertise and spe - cialized knowledge of IPs. Making resources available As the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. grew, APIC made resources available to members and the public. One of the first actions APIC took was provid - ing free access to chapters of the APIC Text covering outbreak response. (See the APIC Text Spotlight on pp. 22-23 for more information about this.) APIC also created fact sheets to help inform the public about the virus. These fact sheets answered important ques - tions such as what is a coronavirus, how to prevent transmission, and whether masks were necessary for the public. Additionally, APIC aggregated the names of IPs who were willing to assist areas hardest hit by COVID-19. As the number of resources grew, APIC created a website ( apic.org/COVID19 ) to aggregate relevant information, including resources from APIC as well as updates CAPITOL COMMENTSwww.apic.org | 29 BLT Best Legionella Test.

Advocacy efforts It is unfortunate that policymakers focus the most on IPC issues when wide - spread outbreaks occur and IPs are at their busiest. While APIC members were working overtime to mitigate the spread of infection, policymakers were look - ing for IPC experts and answers from the field. For this reason, email traffic from APIC and the Public Policy team to members increased as the outbreak grew. Many of the emails from APIC informed IPs about the latest regulatory updates, while others requested members to take action. A robust response from APIC advocates is always essential to ensure policymakers understand and prioritize effective IPC measures. Even as IPs were responding to the national emergency, many of you continued your advocacy by sending emails to legislators about the basics of COVID-19, having virtual meetings with policymakers to tell them what is needed during a crisis, and taking other actions.Thank you! Although these have been trying times for all healthcare workers, we know this unprecedented national emergency has been especially hard for IPs. So, from all of us on the Public Policy team, thank you for all you do! We will learn from the experiences of this crisis to better prepare the field of IPC and the nation for future infectious disease threats.

Hospital outbreaks are reported more often in the medical literature than occurrences in the long-term care (LTC) or behavioral health setting. By studying and learning from outbreaks in the LTC/behavioral health setting, infection preventionists (IPs) can glean additional knowledge and apply this information to hopefully prevent future infections and infection clusters in their facilities. This quarterly column helps the IP heighten awareness of appropriate interventions to prevent outbreaks.BY STEVEN SCHWEON, RN, MPH, MSN, CIC, FSHEA, FAPIC Ford and coauthors1 investi - gated an outbreak involving residents living in a 30-bed community living center's nursing unit. During a nearly four-week time period, 10 male residents, ranging in age from 59 to 84 years, developed respiratory illnesses. Concurrently, five healthcare personnel (HCP) developed upper respiratory infections. Of interest, after the index case became ill, one healthcare pro - vider became ill and continued to work. One resident required hospitalization due to pneumonia. There were no deaths. KATERYNA KON/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMwww.apic.org | 33 Based on your knowledge of potential causes of a new onset of respiratory illnesses occurring in an adult community living center, you suspect the outbreak is due to: a. Legionella pneumophilia b. Parainfluenza virus c. Widespread respiratory reaction to an unknown environmental agent d. Staphylococcus aureus The case definition included a resident with a new onset of respiratory complaints and a positive, nasopharyngeal respiratory viral, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel. Laboratory findings were positive for the human parainfluenza III (HPIV-3), one of four parainfluenza sero - types. The clinical and epidemiological features for each subtype can vary.2 For example, HPIV-1 infections are more com - mon in odd-numbered years, while HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 occur annually. HPIV, despite its name, is not related or similar to the influenza virus.3 The prefix \"para\" is derived from the Greek preposi - tion para, meaning \"along the side of, in comparison with, or during.\"4 HPIV infection can result in croup, common cold syndrome, laryngotracheo - bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia.5 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),2 Signs and symptoms may include runny nose, fever, cough, sore throat, sneez - ing, wheezing, ear pain, irritability, and decreased appetite. HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 are most often asso - ciated with croup. HPIV-1 often causes croup in children, whereas HPIV-2 is less frequently detected. Both types can cause upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses. People with upper respi - ratory tract illness may have cold-like symptoms. HPIV-3 is more often associated with bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. HPIV-4 is not recognized as often but may cause mild to severe respiratory tract illnesses.HPIVs commonly infect infants, young children, and individuals with weakened immune systems; however, anyone can become ill, during any time of the year.2 Individuals may develop repeat HPIV infections.2 Older adults with reinfection have an increased risk for severe infections.Transmission occurs by direct contact with infectious droplets or through the air when the infected individual breathes, coughs, or sneezes. The virus may remain in airborne droplets for over an hour and linger on environmental surfaces for a few hours, thus highlighting the importance of an effective environmental hygiene program. The incubation period is two to seven days.2 There is no HPIV vaccine or proven antiviral medication. CDC recommends Contact Precautions and handwashing to prevent additional transmission.2 Patient education to help prevent trans - mission should emphasize staying home when sick, avoiding close contact with oth - ers, practicing respiratory etiquette, and keeping surfaces clean and disinfected. 6 Treatment focuses on symptom manage - ment (e.g., fever and pain control). HPIV is not a reportable condition to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDS).7 However, local and state department of health regulations may require outbreak reporting to the public health authorities, regardless of the pathogen. Ford and colleagues1 managed the out - break by: Temporarily closing the nursing area to admissions Maintaining a high index of suspicion for symptomatic residents with obtaining PCR testing Implementing social distancing and ask - ing ill residents to stay in their rooms Teaching respiratory etiquette Enforcing hand hygiene Asking ill residents to wear a mask when leaving the nursing unit Terminally cleaning virus-contaminated surfaces and objects Minimizing the floating of staff Directing ill employees to stay home Steven Schweon, RN, MPH, MSN, CIC, FSHEA, FAPIC, is an infection prevention consultant with a specialized interest in acute care/long-term care/ behavioral health/ambulatory care infection preven - tion challenges, including outbreaks.

TAKE-HOME MESSAGES When a respiratory pathogen is suspected, initiating empiric transmission-based precautions (e.g., both Contact and Droplet Precautions) will reduce the transmission risk to others.8 Reviewing the correct technique for obtaining a nasal pharyngeal specimen with frontline staff may be helpful. The laboratory may already have a policy and procedures in place in their laboratory manual. The specimen collection process may result in patient coughing and irritability. HCP should wear personal protective equipment when collecting specimens. Consider developing an outbreak policy and procedures and documenting them in a stand - ing reference, including any requirements to notify the local health department and facility administrator of an outbreak. To reduce the considerable safety risks associated with presenteeism (i.e., when an employee goes to work despite being ill, potentially impairing their performance and transmitting patho - gens to residents and other staff), it might be helpful to review sick-time policies to ensure they encourage employees to stay home when ill, and do not penalize sick employees for their time away from work.34 | SUMMER 2020 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION to the specimen container. We had also implemented a nurse-driven protocol to allow nurses to order C. diff tests without a provider's order. We had provided countless educational sessions, newsletters, and flyers related to timely collection of specimens and true CDI criteria. However, we continued to struggle\u2014our data were headed in the wrong direction. Compounding this problem, Rhode Island had been ranked as having one of the high - est hospital-onset LabID C. diff rates in the United States. In 2018, we decided to form a multidisciplinary team to reverse our trends for hospital-onset C. diff . To develop a plan of action, we performed a detailed case review of each of our 12 cases of hospital-onset C. diff in 2017. We clas - sified each case into one of four categories: Antibiotic-associated Late specimen collection Colonization Hospital-acquired The antibiotic-associated classification was assigned to those cases that we thought were strictly a result of antibiotic use and were true cases of hospital-onset C. diff . We believed our antimicrobial stewardship com - mittee could address those issues. The late specimen collection group included the cases where we did not collect a specimen in a timely manner and therefore had to take \"credit\" for a hospital-onset case even though we believed CDI was present on admission.virtually always responded to early enough to prevent catastrophic consequence\" 1). ASSESSING THE DATA AND CLASSIFYING CASES When our rate of hospital-onset LabID C. diff cases reached historical heights in 2017, it became apparent that our cur - rent C. diff strategies were insufficient. Our interventions at that time included nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for C. diff with criteria for the lab to reject formed specimens that did not conform South County Hospital is a 100-bed, independent, nonprofit, acute care hospital that offers a range of medical and surgical services, including orthopedics, urologic, women and newborn care, telemetry, and intensive care, as well as an emergency department. We have more than 6,000 admissions and 27,000 emergency depart - ment encounters each year. We are currently working to become a high-reliability orga - nization (i.e., an organization that aims to \"create an environment in which potential problems are anticipated, detected early, and In 2017, South County Hospital in Wakefield, Rhode Island, had the highest number of hospital-onset laboratory-identified the facility's history: 5.3 per 10,000 patient days. We suspected that the LabID results might be skewed, leading us to report colonization and community-onset cases as hospital-onset C. diff infection (CDI), but we also knew that any corrective actions must ensure patient safety. This article describes our journey to address this challenge.Improving hospital-onset C. diff rates: Lessons from one organization's journey to success BY LEE ANN QUINN, BS, RN, CIC, STEPHANIE PARENTE, MSN, RN, CIC, AND MARY ELLEN CASEY, MSN, RN, MED, CIC CDC/JENNIFER OOSTHUIZENwww.apic.org | 35 The colonization classification represented cases that were not true CDI based on the symptomatology of elevated white blood count, abdominal pain, and so on, but were identified as colonized cases by our sensitive testing modality (NAAT). Examples of cases in this group included patients who received laxatives or bowel prep or had diarrhea as an adverse effect of medication. The fourth classification, hospi - tal-acquired CDI, would be assigned to cases that were a result of secondary transmission within the hospital. Such cases would likely occur due to poor hand hygiene, inadequate isolation precautions, or insufficient environ - mental cleaning. Fortunately, after review, we did not have any hospital-acquired cases. TARGETING COLONIZATION AND COMMUNITY-ONSET CASES We decided to target the colonization cases first. To do this, we implemented a soft-stop screening measure built into the electronic health record to prevent inap - propriate C. diff orders from being entered. We quickly recognized that the soft-stop process did not work and that it was nec - essary to implement a hard stop. Once a specimen was submitted, if the patient had been hospitalized for more than three cal - endar days, a microbiology tech would call the antimicrobial stewardship pharmacist to have the testing approved. If the pharmacist thought the test was inappropriate (based on evidence-based criteria), he would have a discussion with the ordering provider. Our C. diff rates dropped 68%, to 1.7 per 10,000 patient days, after initiation of this hard stop. Next, we focused on late specimen collec - tion. After reviewing those cases, we found that nursing often sent a specimen simply because it was \"ordered.\" These orders often originated during admission, when it was unclear what was going on with the patient. To remedy this issue, we implemented an auto-cancellation of C. diff orders that occurred if a specimen had not been col - lected within 24 hours. This prevented inappropriate specimens from being sent to the lab days after admission to fulfill this order request. After implementation of the auto-cancellation, we had a 100% decrease in hospital-onset cases as a result of late specimen collection.TWO-STEP TESTING Although we had dramatically reduced our hospital-onset C. diff rates in 2018, we knew there was still room for improvement. Our review of the 2018 cases determined that 50% appeared to be colonization and not true CDI based on findings such as lack of risk factors, symptoms, or documented medication side effects. Then, after reading the \"2017 Update of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Clostridium difficile Infection in Adults and Children by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA),\"2 we decided to take our C. diff prevention to the next level by mak - ing changes to our testing practices. In 2019, we adopted a two-step C. diff testing algorithm. This algorithm includes testing all specimens with NAAT and then moving to an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) toxin test if the NAAT result is positive. We believed the implementation of this two-step testing would help providers determine whether a patient had a true CDI or if they were likely colonized. Once our two-step process was implemented, it was determined that the cases that were identified as hospital-onset were true CDI (we did not have to take \"credit\" for C. diff colonization). Once again, when looking at our cases, we found that 53% of the C. diff specimens that were tested in 2019 using the two-step process were true CDI (positive for both steps). Therefore, using the two-step pro - cess prevented approximately 47% of the tested patients from being categorized as hospital-onset cases and unnecessarily treated with antibiotics.To ensure that we were appropriately treat - ing our patients and not overlooking any patients who were truly infected but had negative EIA toxin tests, providers were edu - cated to use clinical judgment when deciding whether to treat those deemed colonized. We also monitored the patients with positive NAAT and negative EIA toxin results to ensure they clinically improved. We contin - ued to monitor 12 cases without treatment, and in all 12 cases, the diarrhea resolved on its own. We are confident that we have appropriately treated all patients who needed a course of antibiotic therapy as a result of a true CDI. KEYS TO SUCCESS Our journey with hospital-onset C. diff reduction was successful for many reasons. We used a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) method to create small tests of change with continued analysis of our processes. The interventions we implemented to drive suc - cess were effective because they were now hardwired. With the hard-stop process, we performed real-time audits of appropriate - ness of testing and addressed inappropriate orders immediately. We automated the can - cellation within 24 hours for C. diff orders to minimize the need for critical thinking and reassessment of appropriateness of the order. The two-step testing gave the provid - ers more information about their patients' C. diff status and helped with treatment decisions. These actions worked because they were more aggressive than the typical edu - cational sessions or nurse-driven protocols. We certainly faced barriers during imple - mentation of our small tests of change. Initially, with the hard-stop process, Members of the South County Hospital C. diff team (left to right): Stephanie Parente, infection prevention clinical leader; Melissa Fleck, microbiology team leader; Lee Ann Quinn, director of infection prevention; Andrew Ross, pharmacy team leader; and Mary Ellen Casey, infection preventionist. COURTESY OF SOUTH COUNTY HOSPITAL.36 | SUMMER 2020 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONproviders were not pleased that they had to justify their orders or be told that a test was not medically indicated. The two-step testing was the remedy to this challenge. It allowed us to continue the hard-stop process but also provided more leniency in regard to what could be tested due to the additional layer of protection with the EIA toxin test. Microbiology was initially concerned about the cost of adding the second step as well as the time it would take to complete a second test. Initially, the desire to do the right thing for the patient was the driving factor for the microbiology team. However, as the program was implemented, we found that the additional testing costs were mini - mal and money was saved by not administer - ing unneeded antibiotics. Furthermore, the time component of the additional test ended up being insignificant because the microbiol - ogy team batches their C. diff tests and their workflow was easily adjusted. The batching of C. diff testing was ben - eficial for both the hard-stop screening pro - cess and the addition of two-step testing. It allowed the pharmacist time to review a patient's record and contact the provider when the hard-stop was needed, and it pro - vided a more fluid workflow without notably increasing the time it took to perform the additional testing. LESSONS LEARNED We learned many lessons during our jour - ney to reduce the number of cases identified as hospital-onset CDI. The importance of culturing stewardship and partnership were evident. Culturing stewardship decreased the number of cases we were penalized for, and it prevented our patients from being unnecessarily treated with antibiotics for an infection they did not have. Culturing stew - ardship is something we can take beyond C. diff and apply to other initiatives, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infection prevention, and we believe we will see cost savings by reducing unnecessary testing and \"pan culturing.\" A beneficial outcome was the partner - ship that infection preventionists achieved with providers, the lab, and pharmacy. The partnership stemmed from a shared value of appropriately identifying and treating patients for true CDI and recognizing that our testing modalities should be reliable and accurate. This line of thought kept us aligned with the antimicrobial stewardship initia - tives of appropriately treating our patients with the right antimicrobial for the least amount of time necessary to combat anti - microbial resistance and CDI. LOOKING FORWARD The best thing about this improvement project is that it can sustain itself. Certainly, we will always look for opportunities for improvement, but the processes we have put into place were built into practice. To our knowledge, we are currently the only hospital in Rhode Island to implement the two-step C. diff testing algorithm. To help our colleagues at other facilities, we have shared our lessons learned and success stories with our statewide coalition. Now that we have differentiated true hospital-onset CDI cases from cases misidentified as a result of late specimen collection and cases of colo - nized patients, we know which cases and trends we truly need to focus on through our antimicrobial stewardship initiatives.

Effective application of this model equips IPs for the challenges of the future across the continuum of care. In the following articles, APIC Professional Development Committee members share tips, tools, and insights for using the model to develop your team and for your own professional development and growth. For more information on the Competency Model, visit apic.org/profesional-practice/infection-preventionist-ip-competency-model .www.apic.org | 41re you and your team, as well as IPs in your network and local chapter, actively using APIC's Competency Model for the Infection Preventionist? In conjunction with other resources, such as the APIC Professional and Practice Standards and the APIC Fellows program requirements, the following are key professional development tools IPs can use to progress throughout their careers and advance in the profession. All can be accessed by visiting apic.org/Professional-Practice . INTERACTIVE COMPETENCY MODEL The interactive nature of the online model allows users to move throughout each component to review content and definitions. IPs can use the model to understand each of the six future-oriented competency domains and the subdomains they encompass, the four career stages (see Table 1), and the CIC\u00ae credential, as well as their relationships to the core of the model: patient safety across the continuum of care. The model is relevant to IPs in all career stages and practice settings. COMPETENCY SELF-ASSESSMENT TOOL Self-assessment is crucial for career growth. This APIC self-assessment tool focuses on the Certification Board in Infection Control and Epidemiology (CBIC) core competencies and future-oriented competency domains and subdomains in APIC's Competency Model. It supports IPs, especially at the Novice and Becoming Proficient levels, in identifying knowledge gaps, assessing their level of confidence, and developing goals and questions to further their knowledge. ROADMAP FOR THE NOVICE IP The Roadmap for the Novice IP can be used by both those new to the profession and those working to orient and train new IPs. Now online and interactive, the updated roadmap helps guide new IPs through the core competencies, providing definitions, links to educational and evidence-based best practice resources, and suggestions for outreach to possible colleagues and collaborators. IPs can use it while advancing through the Novice and Becoming Proficient career stages and to prepare for the CIC exam. Figure 1 shows an excerpt from one of the checklists in the roadmap. PROFICIENT PRACTITIONER BRIDGE IPs who have passed the CIC exam must continue to expand their knowledge base and maintain a focus on professional advancement. Recently updated, the Proficient Practitioner Bridge (PPB) is an important online, interactive self-assessment tool (and, like the roadmap, it is an exclusive APIC member benefit). The PPB enables Proficient IPs to identify personal strengths and weaknesses, helping them set goals that move them toward the Expert career stage and the APIC Fellow designation.Key Competency Model Professional Development TOOLS AND RESOURCES BY ANGEL MUELLER, MPH, CIC, FAPIC NOVICE The Novice infection preventionist (IP) has very limited knowledge, skills, experience, and basis in which to have situational awareness in infection prevention and control (IPC) and epidemiology. The Novice must rely on rules and concepts to guide their practice and begin to develop their knowledge/skills in the core competencies. BECOMING PROFICIENT At this stage, the IP continues to build on their knowledge/skills in the core competencies while developing into an independent practitioner. The Becoming Proficient practitioner is able to briefly move beyond rule-based thinking to identify common trends that need to be addressed to ensure patient safety. Their knowledge and proficiency level will vary based on their previous training, setting, role, size of their team, and the extent that they have opportunities to experience and apply specific areas of IPC practice. PROFICIENT In this stage, the IP can demonstrate proficient knowledge of the core competencies through successfully achieving the CIC\u00ae credential. The CIC\u00ae indicates that the IP has knowledge required for competent performance in IPC. During this stage, the IP begins to apply the core competencies independently and deepens their knowledge and application of the future-oriented competency domains in APIC's Competency Model. The proficient IP is able to use past experiences to shape future thinking about a situation. EXPERT The Expert IP consistently and reliably demonstrates professional expertise (and at times very advanced levels of mastery) in the IPC core competencies and future-oriented competency domains. The Expert IP shares their knowledge and skills through mentoring, research, publication, collaboration, leadership, and educating other IPs. The expert is able to analyze more rapidly than any other stage and guide future decisions based on experience and perceptual acuity to achieve defined outcomes. Identification of Infectious Diseases : Novice Learn infectious disease processes: _____Describe how to interpret diagnostic/laboratory reports. _____Know the following terms and information that are related to the infectious disease process: _____Identify appropriate practices for specimen collection, transportation, handling and storage (e.g., blood, wound, respir atory, and urine specimens) _____Review facility policies/procedures for specimen collection and handling. _____Understand the basics characteristics of microbiology/virology (bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses) _____Differentiate normal flora versus pathogenic flora by site: _____Identify appropriate reasons for environmental culturing _____Identify inappropriate reasons for environmental culturing Figure 1. Sample checklist content from the Roadmap for the Novice IPTable 1. Definitions of the stages in an IP career42 | SUMMER 2020 | Prevention SIX WAYS TO USE THE COMPETENCY MODEL to Develop IP Staff BY HEATHER BERNARD, RN, DNP, CIC, FAPIC I am the director of infection preven - tion in a health system in central New York, responsible for six IPs at differ - ent levels. The following are concrete ways I have used APIC's Competency Model for the Infection Preventionist for several years to grow and develop IPs who come from varying backgrounds, with varying degrees of competency. #1: WRITING JOB DESCRIPTIONS The APIC professional and practice standards,1 CBIC core competencies,2 and the APIC Competency Model3 guided job description development at my orga - nization. The CBIC core competencies were used as the core competencies of all IP job descriptions. The practice stan - dards were used as the foundation of the core job responsibilities, with different percentages of time spent and weights on each element for each IP level. For example, as the career stage advances, the percentage of expected practice that is applied to the leadership-related prac - tice standards increases. My organization also incorporated future-oriented domain competencies into IP job descriptions, with greater emphasis given in the more advanced career-level descriptions. #2: DEVELOPING A CAREER LADDER APIC's Competency Model can be used as a guide to develop a career lad - der within your healthcare facility. IPs may leave the profession if there is no advancement potential or growth oppor - tunity. A career ladder allows the IP the opportunity to grow and be recognized for their growth within the profession. I have developed a career ladder for the six IPs in my organization. The lad - der has three levels: level 1 IP (Novice/Becoming Proficient), level 2 IP (Proficient), and level 3 IP (Expert). To advance to the next career stage, IPs must meet all the required crite - ria, including educational, competency, certification, and project requirements. The annual performance review is the point at which the IP is formally evaluated for performance for that level. Once an IP meets all criteria in one stage, human resources are notified to move the staff member to the next level. Movement from one career stage to another results in an increase in salary. #3: ONBOARDING NEW IP s My organization provides an orienta - tion checklist for the new IP. This check - list and the Roadmap for the Novice IP are used to guide new IPs as they onboard into the IPC department. The roadmap not only serves as an orientation guide for IPs during their first few years of employment but also guides them along the pathway to CIC certification. The online interactive version of the roadmap includes printable checklists, activities to support growth in each core compe - tency area, a supervisor plan for tracking assignments and tasks, and certificates of completion that can be used to verify completion of roadmap sections. I meet with new IPs at least weekly to review their onboarding progress, and we use the orientation and roadmap check - lists to help them prioritize next steps. Each new IP is also assigned someone more experienced in the department as a mentor who can assist in the onboard - ing process.#4: SELF-ASSESSMENT FOR NOVICE AND BECOMING PROFICIENT IP s At least once per year during the annual assessment, level 1 IPs complete APIC's competency self-assessment tool. This activity helps IPs prepare for the CIC exam and develop an individual profes - sional development plan. After level 1 IPs complete this tool, we review it together and decide which core competencies will be a focus of growth over the next review period, identifying specific activi - ties related to gaps in their knowledge and skills. See Figure 1 for an excerpt from this tool. #5: SELF-ASSESSMENT FOR PROFICIENT AND EXPERT IP s APIC's Competency Model can assist IPs in Proficient and Expert career stages with professional development. The online Proficient Practitioner Bridge (PPB) can be used to guide IPs at all competency levels, but it is especially designed for IPs who have demonstrated proficiency by obtaining the CIC. Upon completion of the PPB self-assessment, a results report can be downloaded showing responses for each competency domain, a percentage (grade) of self-reported knowl - edge in each area, and a list of resources for further learning. Figure 1. Selection from the competency self-assessment tool for Novice or Becoming Proficient IPswww.apic.org | 43We use the PPB in my department on an annual basis for all level 2 and level 3 IPs to assess competency and assist in development of individual professional development plans for the next review period. A comparison of the prior com - pleted self-assessment to the current one allows us to analyze self-assessed improve - ment in competency. #6: CREATING AN ANNUAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN To progress through the career stages, IPs must work with their supervisor to focus growth on areas that are specific to that IP's current level of competency. Self-assessments and results from the annual performance review provide both subjective and objective evidence of com - petency and allow the IP to identify areas for professional development. One size does not fit all. IPs enter the profession with different backgrounds and compe - tency levels; therefore, it is essential to develop a plan that fits the individual's needs and interests. The professional development plans for the IPs in my department are similar to the annual infection prevention plan. Each IP's plan identifies their learning needs, their individual goals, and the spe - cific activities that the director and the IP have set as requirements, with due dates. The formal document is individualized to the IP and has sections for documenting when activities are completed, any contact hours received, evaluation of the activ - ity, and supporting materials verifying completion. IPs are also encouraged to keep a professional portfolio to further document their growth. This evidence is reviewed at the IP's next performance review or sooner if necessary. References 1.

Janet Conner: I am required by my organization to complete an annual competency assessment that is based on APIC's professional development model. This provides a career growth ladder for IPs within our organization. The model engages new as well as seasoned IPs, pro - viding avenues for growth in expertise and advancement in scope of practice. \"The model engages new as well as seasoned IPs.\" Mackenzie Weise: I personally review the interactive model several times each year to stay on track of my own needs and goals\u2014it's such a quick and user-friendly tool. Overall, the model has encour - aged me to become more proactive and effective at identifying areas for growth components to become a more astute IP and public health practitioner. Angel Mueller: I use the model to per - form a self-assessment every year. I con - nect those identified areas of opportunity with my current role, responsibilities, and interests to focus on areas of growth for the year. My personal and professional goals are then developed with these areas in mind. \"I use the model to perform a self-assessment every year.\" For example, as a new future-oriented domain, Professional Stewardship is an area to be better explored by many IPs, including myself. Developing goals to enhance my knowledge in ethics, popu - lation health, and ensuring safe, quality care throughout the continuum of care will allow me to grow and advance in the infection prevention and control (IPC) HOW ARE YOU USING THE COMPETENCY MODEL TO ADVANCE YOUR OWN CAREER? WHAT PARTS OF THE MODEL ARE MOST HELPFUL TO YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU USE THEM? Laura Buford: I periodically go through the Competency Model to assess my current level as an infection preven - tionist (IP). Using the self-assessment tool helps me prioritize my goals and areas for improvement. Having been an IP for 20 years, this tool is a wonderful guide to validate where I am and where I want to progress. Ericka Kalp: I also review the Competency Model components peri - odically throughout the year. I use the self-assessment tool to critically evalu - ate my current state of knowledge and experience within each domain. I align my professional goals with the model 44 | SUMMER 2020 | Prevention aligned with the current and future state of our profession. Heather Bernard: I use the Proficient Practitioner Bridge (PPB) as a self-assess - ment tool to guide my growth path. I use the references in the PPB to build my knowledge base and identify a project to commit to in that category for the year. For example, Advocacy was a category where I lacked confidence. I reviewed the definition and the resources within the PPB and then began to become active with my local political parties, participating in lobbying for certifica - tion legislature. \"I use the Proficient Practitioner Bridge as a self-assessment tool to guide my growth path.\"Beverly: I plan to use the Novice Roadmap to build a more thorough onboarding and orientation for new IPs hired at my organization. \"This new model is so helpful with the onboarding process of new IPs.\" IS THE COMPETENCY MODEL RELEVANT TO ALL HEALTHCARE SETTINGS? Mackenzie: I've worked in public health, acute care, a health system, and private industry settings as an IP. While each role has been very different, they've all focused on patient safety and high - lighted the vastly complex and dynamic nature of our field. The Competency Model can serve as a developmental compass no matter which area of IPC you work in. \"The Competency Model can serve as a developmental compass no matter which area of IPC you work in.\" Janet Glowicz: As the Certification Board in Infection Control and Epidemiology (CBIC) liaison to the Professional Development Committee, I think an important trend in the field is the increasing number of healthcare systems with facilities serving individu - als across the continuum of care. IPs are leaders who ensure the safe delivery of healthcare in all settings. CBIC is cur - rently undertaking a practice analysis to ensure that the exam represents the job duties of IPs in all settings in which they practice. Board certification objectively demonstrates competency in all domains of the model and can help IPs lead with confidence. \"Board certification objectively demonstrates competency in all domains of the model and can help IPs lead with confidence.\" WHAT DOMAINS AND SUBDOMAINS DO YOU THINK ARE MOST RELEVANT TO EMERGING TRENDS IN IPC? Angel: No domain is less important than another, but a few stand out to me as being of interest in the coming years. Enhancing IPs' skill sets in the Leadership and Professional Stewardship domains will be critical for linking IPC goals with strategic organizational, healthcare system, and national goals related to patient safety and public health. These two domains will promote the continu - ing advancement of the profession and support the ever-growing importance of the IP's role and efforts. Janet Conner: I think IPC Informatics and IPC Operations are the most up-and-coming domains within the model. Clinical informatics and busi - ness intelligence can provide data in real time to frontline staff, driving compli - ance with evidence-based prevention bundles with the ultimate result of decreased healthcare-associated infec - tions (HAIs). IPC Operations stands out because we're witnessing the formation of healthcare systems across the continuum of care and the need to coordinate IPC Tasks, knowledge, skills, abilities, and resources to take an infection preventionist from day 1 on the job through passing the Certification in Infection Prevention and Control (CIC) exam. Beverly Sturgill: Utilizing the inter - active model has enabled me to identify strengths and weaknesses in my own professional development path. I have realized that with over 20 years of experi - ence in this field, there are still multiple opportunities in several domains that I will need to focus on to stay current and knowledgeable in the profession. \"The interactive model has enabled me to identify strengths and weaknesses in my own professional development path.\" HOW ARE YOU USING THE COMPETENCY MODEL TO HELP OTHER IP s ON YOUR STAFF? Stephanie Holley: This new model is so helpful with the onboarding process of new IPs. It allows the new IP with or with - out IPC experience to developmentally conceptualize where they are, see into the future, and set realistic goals. In addition, I have recently been tasked with developing a career path in our program to address the challenges of retention and job satisfaction. The model's framework will serve as the foundation to build this career ladder.www.apic.org | 45principles across acute care, ambulatory care, long-term care, and other healthcare models. IPC is becoming its own special - ized field, equal and lateral to quality improvement and clinical care. Also, the organization of IPC operations is para - mount in successful system IP programs. Laura: I also think that the IPC Operations and IPC Informatics domains contain key future trends for IPC. Emerging technologies, which are covered in IPC Operations, are essential to provid - ing more scientific ways to prevent HAIs. Under the IPC Informatics domain, \"Application of Diagnostic Testing Data and Techniques\" and \"Data Management, Analysis, and Visualization\" are the sub - domains that focus on future trends. As healthcare advances, new or revamped testing methodologies arise that may help detect or even prevent HAIs. Also, advancing are data technologies may lead to earlier identification of HAIs. The IP must stay up to date in these areas to continue to move the profession forward. \"The IPC Operations and IPC Informatics domains contain key future trends for IPC.\" Mackenzie: The \"Application of Diagnostic Testing Data of the IPC Informatics compe - tency domain stands out for me as an area of particular importance. Specifically, the area of rapid diagnostic testing continues to evolve faster than most of us can keep up with. Clinical teams continue to place a high demand for diagnostic tests that are faster, simpler, automated, accurate, reliable, informative, and affordable. In addition, there is a strong focus on lever - aging rapid phenotypical testing along with genotypic testing for drug suscep - tibility information. It's important that IPs remain up to date with the changing landscape of various diagnostic technolo - gies that continue to impact patient care, data mining, pathogen identification, risk prediction, HAI surveillance, and anti - microbial stewardship. Heather: Comparative effectiveness research is an area that will grow in importance in our increasingly sophis - ticated profession. With the level of involvement of IPs in product review and selection, being able to effectively compare products in a scientific way will become more and more important in the coming years. Ericka: The Leadership subdomains are critical to the current and emerging state of the IPC field. Amid emerging infectious diseases and outbreak situ - ations, it is imperative that IPs possess critical thinking skills and are confident in communicating with others (such as with public health partners) to quickly strategize, identify, and contain epide - miologically significant organisms. \"The Leadership subdomains are critical to the current and emerging state of the IPC field.\" Beverly: The domains I find of partic - ular interest and urgency for the field are Professional Stewardship and Research. As delivery of healthcare has continued to advance, access to healthcare has taken on many forms with the focus on the outpatient arena, as well as long-term care and ambulatory surgery centers, not to mention community/population health. These are all areas of learning for IPs that will need to be incorporated in our work, now and in the future. Research is another area that IPs will need to better understand in order to contribute to the body of knowledge for epidemiology and IPC. Tools that enable IPs to conduct small to large performance improvement projects and studies are imperative for creating or revising evidence-based stan - dards/practices that enhance IPC, reduce HAIs, and ensure patient safety.

For Your Commitment to Infection Prevention We extend gratitude to our 2020 APIC Strategic Partners, for their support and commitment to APIC, our members, and the eld of infection prevention. Our Strategic Partners play an important role in supporting many of the programs and services that make APIC membership so valuable. Through their involvement as a Strategic Partner, these organizations join with APIC to show their dedication to advancing our vision of healthcare without infection. APIC STRATEGIC PARTNERS AS OF APRIL 2020THANK YOU 2020 APIC 1 3/30/19 1:34 PM48 | SUMMER 2020 | Prevention On January 26, 2020, the APIC Board of Directors approved redirecting staff time and resources to respond to what was, at the time, a newly emerging threat: the novel coronavirus outbreak. Since then, the outbreak has been declared a national public health emergency in the United States and a global pandemic. The following are highlights of actions, communications, and resources APIC has provided to support members, healthcare workers, patients, clients, and residents, as well as the general public, in response to COVID-19. COVID TASK FORCE A task force of subject matter experts was appointed to discuss ways APIC can support our members during this public health emergency. Task force members participate in weekly calls, review content and communications for relevancy and impact, and serve as faculty on COVID-19-related offerings. The members of the COVID task force are: Angela Vassallo, MPH, MS, CIC, FAPIC Health Services Advisory Group, Inc. Glendale, CA Barbara Smith, RN, BSN, MPA, CIC, FAPIC Mount Sinai St. Luke's/Mount Sinai West Hospitals New York, NY Jill Holdsworth, MS, CIC, FAPIC, NREMT, CRCST Emory University Hospital Midtown Atlanta, GA Kathleen McMullen, MPH, CIC, FAPIC Christian Hospital Saint Louis, MOPamela Falk, MPH, CIC, FAPIC Northside Hospital Sandy Springs, GA Rebecca Alvino, RN, MS, CNS, CIC University of California, San Francisco Health San Francisco, CA Sharon Williamson, MT(ASCP)SM, CIC, FAPIC Texas Health Resources Arlington, TX Terri Rebmann, PhD, RN, CIC, FAPIC Saint Louis University Saint Louis, MOFEATURE APIC's ongoing COVID-19 response BY ELIZABETH HARTKE, MPS APIC Text collection on outbreak preparedness and response Especially in times of crisis, it is important for IPs to have relevant infor - mation at their fingertips. To support IPs, APIC is providing complimentary access to portions of the online APIC Text through September 30, 2020. The Outbreak Preparedness and Response provide one place for IPs to find the most up-to-date information. It includes links to the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), information on free APIC resources (including publications, position papers, webinars, and fact sheets), and links to World Health Organization (WHO) and other outside information sources.EDUCATION AND RESOURCES COVID-19 website APIC understands how vital it is for infection preventionists (IPs) to have access to the latest resources and infor - mation, especially with new guidance being continually released. To meet this need, APIC launched a COVID-19 website ( apic.org/COVID19 ) in February to LIGHTSPRING/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMwww.apic.org | 49 chapter collection includes two key chap - ters on how to prepare for and respond to a variety of events involving infectious diseases, including outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, bioterrorism, pandem - ics, and natural disasters. These chapters address the principles of successful emer - gency management\u2014mitigation, pre - paredness, response, and recovery\u2014and the pivotal role of the infection preven - tionist in coordinating multidepartment and multiagency efforts. (For more infor - mation on this collection, see the APIC Text Spotlight on pp. 22-23.) Special \"5 Second Rule\" podcast episode In late February, the APIC team recorded and released a special epi - sode of the \"5 Second Rule\" MPH, CIC, CSSGB, discussed the current state of COVID-19, the supply of personal protective equip - ment (PPE), and preventive measures to be taken by healthcare workers and the public. While an episode on outbreaks was always in the plans, the schedule was changed so this episode could be produced in the early days of the out - break as information about the disease and guidance about how to respond to it were being updated almost daily. Education and practice guidance As the infection prevention experts, APIC sponsored our own webinars on the appropriate use of PPE; we also partnered with other organizations to present or copresent education to their members for free during this global health emer - gency. This approach helped us reach more than 100,000 individuals with criti - cal education. The webinar, \"Healthcare Preparedness for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19,\" with Terri Rebmann, PhD, RN, CIC, FAPIC, covers the epidemiol - ogy of the disease, as well as best practices and CDC guidance on how to manage an influx of infectious patients. We partnered with the American Nurses Association to present \"Be Confident Protecting Yourself and Providing the Best Care to Your Patients during this COVID-19 Pandemic.\" This webinar covers modes of transmission, implementing critical infection control standards to minimize the spread of COVID-19 while maintaining health - care worker protection, and best-practice recommendations to achieve optimal pro - tection while maximizing a limited supply of PPE during the time of patient surge. APIC also partnered with American Industrial Hygiene Association for \"Ventilation, Surface Disinfection, and PPE Considerations for the IP and IH.\" Roberta Smith, MSPH, RN, CIC, COHN-S, CIH, and Lewis Johnson, MS, CIH, CIC, addressed questions about ventilation, surface disinfection, respira - tors, construction issues, and occupational health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. APIC also provided education in partnership with the Building Owners and Managers Association, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, and the Virginia Nurses Association. Downloadable resources At the same time IPs have themselves been learning about COVID-19, they have also needed to provide guidance in their facilities and to the public. APIC curated resources from other organiza - tions and created new fact sheets on basic information about COVID-19, wearing masks in public, and on how gloved hands may spread germs.Long-term care resources The direst of COVID-19 symptoms disproportionately affect older adults and individuals with preexisting conditions. IPs working in long-term care (LTC) facilities, including skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, need information and support to combat this deadly virus and keep residents safe. In March, APIC created a webpage with resources specific to the LTC setting to help IPs working with this particularly fragile community (apic.org/free-ltc-resources ). Adding to the list of resources for which APIC is providing complimentary access is the APIC Text LTC chapter collection. This selection of 32 chapters provides an overview of infection prevention and control (IPC) for those working in LTC or long-term acute care centers. Chapters on hand hygiene; standard precautions; cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization; and environmental services have been identified as the most relevant overall for responding to COVID-19 and are included in the collection. (For more information on this collection, see the APIC Text Spotlight on pp. 22-23.) The second edition of the Infection Preventionist's Guide to Long-Term Care is also available to download for free through September 30. Though this book does not address COVID-19 specifically, it addresses more generally the basic IPC principles in an LTC setting, including general guidance on outbreak prevention and management. COMMUNICATIONS AND ADVOCACY APIC President Connie Steed, MSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC, has sent regular com - munications to members to keep you informed about the evolving COVID-19 outbreak, as well as to acknowledge and thank you for your tireless efforts to fight this virus. Steed's messages include updates on APIC's response as well as links to new CDC guidelines. PPE survey To secure national attention for the dire shortages of PPE and other critical items, APIC conducted a survey and launched a media relations and advocacy campaign. The results of the survey painted a grim picture: As of March 27, 2020, nearly half (48%) of U.S. healthcare facilities surveyed were either already out of or almost out of respirators to use in caring for patients with COVID-19. The online survey asked APIC's U.S.- based members to categorize their sup - ply of PPE and other items, including hand sanitizer and cleaning products, on a 5-point scale from having \"plenty\" to \"none.\" Of the 1,140 IPs who completed the survey, 20% reported their facilities had no respirators; an additional 28% said they were almost out. Using the survey data, APIC launched an advocacy campaign to urge Congress 50 | SUMMER 2020 | Prevention and the White House to take immediate action to obtain more PPE and distribute it to healthcare facilities throughout the U.S. as quickly as possible. IPs can join the campaign by visiting apic.org/covid19 and clicking the TAKE ACTION buttons to contact their elected officials. Media relations Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, APIC has fielded nearly 100 requests from media outlets for inter - views with APIC President Connie Steed, APIC Immediate Past President Karen Hoffmann, and APIC President Elect Ann Marie Pettis. In their media outreach, APIC leaders are educating reporters and the public about IP roles and APIC. They have been quoted by The New York Times , USA Today , US News and World Report , \"Good Newsweek , and AARP, to name just a few. On March 27, 2020, APIC held a national press briefing to share the PPE shortage survey results. APIC also published a report about the data and created a \"Running on Empty\" info - graphic to illustrate the urgency of the PPE shortage. Steed, Pettis, and APIC CEO Katrina Crist spoke to the press as part of the briefing. Media coverage about the survey results and quoting APIC leaders appeared in The New York Times, Bloomberg News , and many other news outlets, including CNN's \"Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\" APIC also engaged with members and the public on social media, promoting evidence-based information and high - lighting the role of our members through a #WeLoveOurIPs campaign. With IPs working around the clock, saying thank you was essential. The caped hero below is one of several fun images meant to encourage and promote the work of IPs everywhere. Advocacy/public policy APIC's Advocacy and Public Policy team continue their efforts to share infor - mation in two directions: advocating for IPs to lawmakers and sharing guidance from the CDC and other government agencies with IPs and healthcare work - ers. Their efforts in the first quarter of 2020 included: Sending a letter to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requesting a waiver of reporting requirements for the Medicare Quality Reporting, Value-Based Purchasing, and Healthcare-Acquired Condition Reduction programs. CMS granted this request, allowing healthcare facili - ties additional time to provide their reports. Participating in weekly meetings with CDC, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to share APIC issues and concerns and learn more about interim guidance. Communicating to APIC members about new guidance from CDC and other relevant federal agencies as it is released. Sending fact sheets and APIC-branded hand sanitizer/tissues to the New York Senate to advocate for passing a law requiring IPs in hospitals to be certified in IPC. Using the member survey, national press briefings, and calls to action on the COVID-19 website to drive advo - cacy to increase production of PPE and cleaning/disinfection supplies. (For further information on APIC's advocacy efforts and federal policymak - ing related to COVID-19, see Capitol Comments on pp. 26-29.) APIC Consulting APIC Consulting is responding to numerous requests to assist health - care facilities and municipalities with COVID-19-related infection control assessments and emergency preparedness plans. The work of APIC consultants has been especially helpful to facilities that are short-staffed or anticipating a surge of COVID-19 patients in the near future. Elizabeth Hartke, MPS, is director of Practice Resources at APIC.
