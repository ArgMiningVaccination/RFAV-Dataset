The word homeopathy derives from the Greek word homeo, meaning \"similar\" and pathos, meaning \"suffering\". In homeopathy, an extremely diluted substance that produces symptoms similar to the symptoms of disease is introduced to the body to elicit a physiological healing response. These substances are so diluted that there are no negative side effects and no interactions with the drugs your pet may already be on. In Europe, homeopathic medicine is so common it isn't even considered to be \"alternative\"! In fact, even some conventional practices in medicine use homeopathy's \"principle of similars\". Some examples are common vaccines, modern allergy treatments (in which use small doses of allergens to create an anti-body response), radiation to treat cancer and amphetamine-like drugs to treat hyperactivity. Unlike in western medicine, homeopaths use micro-doses that are intended to re-balance and heal the whole body rather than to simply treat the symptoms of disease. One of the main goals in homeopathy is to recognize disease patterns and to support the whole body by strengthening the body's natural defense mechanism. In essence, homeopathy helps the body use its natural resources to heal itself. The ingredients in homeopathic medicine are all natural and derived from plants, minerals or animals. Homeopathic medicine is regulated by the FDA and is available in pellets, creams, gels, syrups and eye drops. In veterinary medicine it is always important to look at the whole picture, rather than just the symptoms of disease. Often your pet's symptoms represent an imbalance in the body, and are a signal of something larger. At Paz Vet we strive to foster whole body health, rather than just treat ailments. While homeopathy can have its limitations, it can be very effective when used in conjunction with conventional medicine.
