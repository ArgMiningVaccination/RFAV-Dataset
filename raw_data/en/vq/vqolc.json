The top inventors include Shiver, Barnett and Ertl. 2 Value Added Features This Report enhances previous Pierce Law Patent Landscape Reports Series by adding innovative capacity buildi ng features including: 1. Greater in depth technical expert-based needs assessment (open and frequent communication with Dr. Kerri Cl ark of PIPRA) from the outset of the project, in light of the tight project schedule, complexity of the s ubject and the projected used of the data as a Web based publically accessi ble HIV Vaccine Database. 2. Sub-categorization of patent documents in th e Master Spreadsheet to facilitate future indexing in the Web based publically accessible HIV Vaccine Database. 3. Utilization of HIV DNA clinical trials res ources to identify key non-patent literature leading to top inve ntors and assignees. 4. Greater utilization of the Derwent World Pa tent Index classifica tion system and re- written titles and abstracts due to the obfuscation of HIV-related nomenclature in patent documents. 5. Greater utilization of key inve ntors and assignees to yield mo st relevant classifications used in hybrid searches (e.g., combining cla ssification codes with keywords for powerful coordinated search strategies). 6. Introduced use of new patent analytic tool s (e.g. IPVisions that enables building and extracting enhanced value from your innovations and patents). http://www.ipvisioninc.com/kiosk/ 3 1 The project is to provide a patent literatu re landscape of DNA Vaccines against HIV. As a first step, generally, recombinant DNAs (rDNA ) based on the genes from various strains of HIV are generated within the context of other DNAs commonly employed in vaccine development, and used as a vaccine by a direct administration to a host, where the injected DNAs are expressed and eventually produce an tibodies against HIV. The DNA vaccines are often optimized at the DNA sequence level or may require the use of a special delivery system for better efficacy as a vaccine. 1 3dscience: HIV, http://www.3dscience.com/3D_Images/Biology (last visited April 16, 2008); PatentDocs: DNA, http://patentdocs.typepad.com/patent_docs/2007/05/implications_of.html (last visited April 16, 2008); Australian Motor Neuron Disease DNA Bank: Antibody: http://www.dnamnd.med.usyd.edu.au/ (last visited April 16, 2008). 4 SEARCH SUMMARY Search Logic Flow Diagrams Researcher 1: Researcher 2: 5 Researcher 3: Researcher 4: 6 DISCLAIMER This is an educational report and is neither in clusive nor comprehensive. Rather, it is an informational resource to facilitate a better unders tanding of the internatio nal patent literature landscape with regard to DNA vaccines for HIV. This report is not a list of all potentially releva nt patent documents. It is not a Freedom to Operate (FTO) opinion. Furthermore, this report does not reach the level of a FTO analysis, but instead constitutes an educational presenta tion of potentially relevant information. While the search engines utilized in this proj ect are extensive, it is likely that the entire spectrum of patent documents was not obtained utilizing the various s earch strategies and methods articulated herein. Therefore, it is not the supposition of this te am that all relevant patent documents were discovered du ring the creation of this report. As the team members are not experts in th e field of DNA vaccines for HIV, it is also highly possible that the categorization of the patent documents found, coded and compiled are incomplete. The team cannot guarantee that these patent documents were evaluated at the level of expert scientif ic sophistication. Due to the limited time frame imposed upon this project, the number of patent documents evaluated was established by this constrained sc hedule, the overall semestrial demands, and the general press of business. As such, additional patents may have been available for evaluation, but without the necessary time, they may not have been considered. Again, this report should not be viewed as FTO analysis but is instead constitutes an educational report. 7 1. Overview of Immunology2 Immunity is the body's biological defense against disease, infection and biological invasions or abnormalities. The two mechanisms of immunity are termed nonspecific, innate immunity and specific, acquired immunity. While these two mechanisms can work together to eliminate or prevent infectious organisms, each has its own method of accomplishing this goal. A specific immune response works to stop particul ar types of organisms; whereas, nonspecific protection repels all orga nisms in the same way. 1.A. Nonspecific, Innate Immunity Nonspecific, Innate Immunity works to provide protection th rough various defense mechanisms such as chemical barriers (i.e. anti microbial proteins that eliminate or damage invaders), physical barriers (i.e. epidermis, mucous membrane linings of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts), and specific cells (i.e. cells which attack unfamiliar cells and body cells containing infectious orga nisms). Each of these defense mechanisms operates in a specific manner to provide protection to the body. 1.A.1 Barriers 1.A.1.a. Physical Barriers The body's physical barriers are the first step in its defense against infectious organisms (refer to Figure 2 for an illustration of the body's physical barriers). The skin, for example, is constantly being shed and renewed in a process that serves as a mechanical defense to infection. Additionally, the skin can secrete certain disease destroying substa nces such as an oily matter containing oleic acid which can de stroy some bacteria and lysozyme which can cause the outer wall of certain bacteria to deteriorate. Th e mucus membrane linings of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinar y tracts also provide an exampl e of physical barriers against infectious organisms. Like the skin, these lini ngs provide a mechanical defense against disease as they are constantly being renewed. Additi onally, the linings have various other mechanisms harmful to infectious organisms: secretion of phlegm by the respiratory tract which traps small particles; cilia in the respiratory tract which fo rces mucus and any ensnared particles up and out of the nose and throat; secretion of mucus by the gastrointestinal tract which ensnare potentially infectious particles or prevent them from connecting to cells comprising the lining of the gut; secretion by the gastrointestinal tract of protective antibodies; and the stomach's secretion of hydrochloric acid potent enough to kill many microorganisms. 1.A.1.b. Chemical Barriers The body's next defense against infectious or ganisms is the chemical barriers contained within it. If the body's physical defenses are unab le to subdue the foreign particles, it is then up to the chemical substances to prevent their gr owth. The protective chemical substances are chemicals whose primary duty is to damage or e liminate infections organisms, chemicals formed by naturally occurring bacteria, a nd chemicals whose shielding eff ect comes second to their main role in the body. Chemicals whose protective du ty is second to their primary function include: 2 The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 773-88. (Chicago Encyclopaedia Britannica) (2005). 8 chemicals which hinder the harmful digestive enzy mes freed from body cells that have died in the natural course of events a nd can hinder similar enzymes produced by bacteria thus inhibiting bacterial growth; and blood protein transferri n which when bound to the infectious organism prevents it from obtaining the nece ssary iron to grow thus stunti ng the growth of the organism. Proteins are another substan ce which can contribute to the chemical defense system (refer to Figure 2 for an illustration of proteins in ch emical defense system). One example of such defensive proteins is, as mentioned above, interf erons. This protein group seeks to inhibit the replication of a large number of, though not all, viruses. Virus-infected cells produce interferon which signals other cells to prevent viral grow th. Interferon seeks to accomplish this goal by \"interfering with the transcrip tion of viral nucleic acid,\" regulating the degree to which cells express certain molecules on their surface membrane s, and stimulating the activity of natural killer cells. Different cells pr oduce different types of interferon. For example, lymphocytes, produce gamma interferon, leucocytes produce alpha interferon and fibroblasts produce beta interferon. Another example of defensive prot eins is called complement which works in conjunction with other defense mechanisms in th e body to help eliminate infectious organisms. Complement proteins operate with other cells to lyse harmful or ganisms which lack a protective coating. 1.A.1.c. Cellular Barriers If an infectious organism evades det ection and destruction from the physical and chemical barriers, the body's next defense agai nst infectious organisms is cellular (refer to Figure 2 for an illustration of the body's cellu lar barriers). These defensive cells include scavenger cells and natura l killer cells. Natura l killer (NK) cells indi rectly attack body cells which contain infectious organisms. These cells consist of granules which contain cytotoxic chemicals. The NK cells attack infectious cells by binding to the infectious cell, inserting its granules through the cells' outer membrane and into the cytoplasm. The end result of this attack is the cells' death. Scavenger ce lls, on the other hand, attack the in fectious cells directly. The two main types of scavenger cells are macrophages and micr ophages. Macrophages are the mature form of a monocyte which is created by stem cells in the bone marrow and travel through the blood. Monocytes become macrophages up on differentiation. Macrophages identify and consume infectious cells in a slow and incomp lete method. The second category of scavenger cells is microphages which can be referred to as polymorphonuclear leukoctyes or granulocytes. Granulocytes are continuously being produced from precursor cells in the bone marrow. Microphages can be grouped into three categorie s according to shape and dye stain. These categories are neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils (refer to Figure 1 for a illustration of the differences between these three categories). These cells may ha ve granules storing digestive enzymes which are able to break down proteins or bacteriocidal compounds which kill bacteria. The drawbacks to granulocytes, however, are th at many organisms produce toxins poisonous to the granulocytes and thus evade destruction. Ot her infectious cells avoid death by the simple fact that granulocytes ar e unable to digest them. 9 Figure 1: Illustration of the Differences between Eosi nophil, Basophil and Neutrophil3 1.A.2 Additional Responses to Infection In addition to protective barriers formed by the body to combat infectious organisms, there are also a number of nonspecific means of fighting infection termed early induced responses (refer to Figure 2 for an illustration of the body's additional responses to infection). These responses seek to either stall or elimin ate the infection and include the inflammatory response and acute-phase response. The effect of these responses may not be long-term but they do happen in a rapid manner as compared to acq uired immune responses. These responses are effectuated by chemical signals called cytokines which induce fe ver, acute-phase response and inflammatory response. The acute-phase respon se is a general innate defense method of the body which initiates the increased temperature in the body (i.e. fever). Since most bacteria survive at a lower than normal body temperature, this increased temperature is effective in eliminating those bacteria. In a ddition to fever, acute-phase protei ns are secreted by the liver to bind to the infectious organism and thus, trig ger complement proteins which eliminate the bacteria. 3 Sportron Info, http://www.sportron.info/english/health_issues/images/immune_system.jpg (last visited April 2, 2008). 1 0 Figure 2: Synopsis of Non- specific, Innate Immunity4 1.B. Specific, Acquired Immunity The concept of specific, acquired immun ity, also known as adaptive immunity, arose from the knowledge that people who have survived certain infections do not contract such diseases again. This immunity is strictly dependent upon lymphocytes, specialized white blood cells. The defenses acquired by contracting such an infection are specific to that disease. Many diseases, however, seem to contradict the noti on of acquired immunity. Such infections as the common cold do not bar a person once infected from becoming infected again. However, the key is this situation is to unde rstand that there are many infec tious organisms that cause the symptoms of the common cold. As such, even though infection with a certain organism does prevent re-infection with that same organism , it does not prevent infection by a different organism which may cause the same symptoms. As is mentioned above, adaptive immunity relies upon lymphocytes. These cells are responsible for the body's capacity to react and identify any number of unknown organisms. Lymphocytes remain dormant until called to action. There are over 2 trillion lymphocytes in the body of an adult human with only a small fraction of that number found in the bloodstream. The 4 Indian River Community College, http://faculty.ircc.edu/faculty/tfischer /images/non%20specific%20defenses%20 summary.jpg (last visited April 2, 2008). 1 1 rest of these cells are locate d throughout the body's lymphatic system. Organs or tissues containing large qualities of lymphocytes are termed lymphoid. These lymphocytes are restricted in movement to the lymph capillaries located in connective tissues which guide the lymphocytes into contact with other cells (i.e. macrophages). 1.B.1. T cells and B cells Lymphocytes are created from stem cells in the bone marrow and continue to divide. This division causes the release of immature lymphocytes into th e blood stream where they can travel to various organs. Those immature lym phocytes which travel to the thymus to multiply and divide are termed T cells. Upon leaving the thymus, these mature T cells continue to multiply and divide as they circulate through the bloodstream to other lymphoid organs. The second type of lymphocytes is te rmed a B cell. B cells are ly mphocytes which remain in the bone marrow during differentiation and then travel directly to the lymphoid organs. B and T cells each perform separate functi ons to identify and destroy unknown particles. T cells directly attack the infectious organisms. This type of immunity is termed cell-mediated immunity. T cells can only identify infectious organisms wh ich have entered body cells. On the other hand, B cells secrete antibodies. This t ype of immunity is termed humora l immunity. B cells, with their antibody secretion, only attack cells whic h remain outside the cells of the body. One of the important features of lymphoc ytes is their ability to identify unknown particles within the body. Receptor molecules ar e located on the surface of the lymphocyte or secreted into fluids of the body. These recepto r molecules are responsib le for the ability of lymphocytes to recognize foreign particles. The shape of a receptor molecule complements a specific foreign molecule which allows the receptor and foreign molecule to fit together. While both B and T cells have receptor molecules, only B cells produce antibodies which are unattached receptor molecules. Foreign molecules that attach to these receptor sights are termed antigens. Antigens include a wide range of mol ecules such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, dust, pollen, transplanted tissue and pr otozoans. When the binding of an antigen to a receptor molecule elicits an immune response, the response is termed an immunogen. 1.B.2. T cells There are two main types of mature T cells: cytotoxic and helper T cells. Cytotoxic T cells eliminate cells which pres ent a threat to the individual (i.e. cells with infectious microorganisms and cancer cells) and primarily recognize target cells containing antigens associated with class I MHC molecules (molecu les which are present on the surface of most body cells with nuclei). Helper T cells, on the ot her hand, activate other wh ite bloods cells (i.e. lymphocytes and macrophages) and recognize un known antigens associated with class II MHC molecules (molecules which are limited to the surfaces of most B cells and some T cells, macrophages, and macrophage-like particles). Als o, T cells have a co-rec eptor location on their surface to which the MHC molecule bind to pr ovide added support to the bonding between T cell and foreign molecule. This co-receptor location is termed CD4 for helper T cells which bind class II MHC molecules and CD8 for cytotoxic T cells which bind cla ss I MHC molecules. In addition, T cells can be divi ded into two subcategories, T H1 and T H2. T H2 cells' primary duty is to synthesize interleukins IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, a nd IL-13 and aid in the 1 2 production of antibodies by stim ulation of the B cells. T H1 cells' primary duty is to produce tumour necrosis factor-beta, in terleukins (IL-2), and cytokines gamma interferon and to stimulate macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. 1.C. Immunization through Specific Immunity Immunization through specific immunity can be divided into two types, active and passive immunization. Passive im munization refers to the transf er of preformed antibodies or lymphocytes from an individual whose immune sy stem has been stimulated by the particular antigens. This type of immunization is very effective in situations where a person's immune system is unable to respond quickly enough to fight the infection. Examples of situations such as this include snake bits, botulism and tetanus. Active immunization, on th e other hand, refers to the immunity protection conferred by a vaccine which stimulates the immune system to fight infection by production of antibodies and lymphocytes. Vaccinat ion seeks to front load the victim with a supply of antibodies or T and B cells which figh t whatever infectious organism is encountered before infection occurs or upon inte raction with the infectious organism. The primary component of a vaccine is a sufficient amount and persistence of antigens to produce an immune response analogous to the natural infec tion. Killed vaccines (vaccines which comprise an entire microbe which has been killed without altering it significantly) have been effective in situations such as influenza, typhoid, and the plague. Attenua ted vaccines (vaccines which comprise a weakened strain of bacteria or virus) may cause a number of symptoms of the disease it is seeking to eliminate; howev er, the introduced infectious organism never becomes virulent. This type of vaccine has been useful agai nst yellow fever, measles and tuberculosis. 2. HIV Overview 2.A. HIV Biology HIV/AIDS is a pandemic. The figures are overwhelming. As of 2006, 39.5 million people worldwide are estimated to live with HIV.5 The World Health Organizaton (WHO) projects that worldwide deaths from HIV will rise from 2.8 million in 2002 to 6.5 million in 2030 and be among the 4 top causes of death in 2030.6 Since its identifi cation in 1981, AIDS has claimed the lives of more than 25 million people.7 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) adversel y affects the immune system of the host it infects by specifically infecti ng cells expressing CD4 molecu les which are found in immune cells for both cellular and i nnate immunity - T cells a nd macrophages, respectively.8 HIV belongs to a group of viruses called retr ovirus and a subgroup called lentiviruses, or \"slow\" viruses. It contains 2 copies of single stranded (+) R NA as a genome from which it synthesizes DNA, and then the DNA gets integrated into the host genome, becoming part of the 5 WORLD HEALTH STATISTICS 11 (2007), available at http://www.who.int/whosis/en/index.html . 6 Id. at 12. 7 HIV/AIDS Factssheets Introduction, http://oversight.house.gov/features/hivaids (last visited April 17, 2008). 8 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, How HIV cause AIDS , available at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/howhiv.htm (last visited April 22, 2008). 1 3 host system. This is exactly the reverse of normal cellular process, which is reflected in part of its name \"retro~.\" Another very notable featur e of HIV is that it is highly error prone when replicating, i.e., synthesizing a DNA copy of its RNA genome and therefore highly mutagenic/variable. This leads to high strain variability among different hosts and regions, and even within an infected host. 2.B. HIV Phylogeny The HIV strains may be classified into type s, groups and subtypes based on its genetic makeup. 9 There are two types of HIV: HIV-1 a nd HIV-2. Despite their divergent genetic sequences, they share many similar characteris tics including mode of transmission (by sexual contact, through blood and from mo ther to child) and clinically indistinguishable symptoms- AIDS. However, HIV-2 is less inf ective, particularly early in the course of disease. Thus, it is less easily transmitted and the latent period is longer than HIV-1. Geographically, HIV-2 is rarely found except in West Africa an d the predominant type is HIV-1.10 HIV-1 strains are further classified into three groups based on the envelope gene: M (major), N (new) and O (outlier) (see Figure 3). M group is most prevalent and responsible for more than 90% of reported HIV/AIDS cases, while O and N groups are found very rarely. Group M is further divided into 9 distinct subtypes (or clades) based on HIV's whole genome: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J and K. Each subtype is geographically distinct (see Figure 4). Group N and O also have subtypes; however, they do not give distinct cl ades like group M group using a similar method to the M group. Intersubtype reco mbinants known as \"circulating recombinant forms\" or \" CRFs \"- new hybrid viruses created by a geneti c recombination of different subtypes- have also been identified. 11 9 Avert, http://www.avert.org/hivtypes.htm (last visited April 3, 2008). 10 Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention, CDC Fact sheet HIV Type 2, available at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/reso urces/Factsheets/hiv2.htm (last visited April 22, 2008). 11 Marcia L.

ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY HIV is spherical in shape having a diameter of about 0.1 M, and can be divided into two structural parts: viral membrane (envelope) and viral core (see Figur e. 5). The viral envelope is the outer coat of HIV enclosing viral particles. The envelope originated from the membrane of a human cell which HIV infects and later buds off fr om. In addition to proteins from the host cells, embedded in the envelope are comple x HIV glycoproteins called Env, glycoprotein (gp)160 or \"spikes.\" The spikes consist of a cap made up of three molecules called gp120, and a stem made up of three gp41 molecu les that function as an anchor. It is involved in the entry of HIV into a cell by binding and me mbrane fusion of the virus part icle to the cell. Thus, the envelope proteins have been the major focus of much of the research to develop a vaccine against HIV. Encompassed by the viral envelope is the matrix, made up of the viral protein p17, and the viral core or capsid, made up of the viral protein p24. Inside th e viral core are 2 exact copies of viral RNA and viral enzymes which are required for HIV replication- reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase. Figure 5: The structure of a HIV virion.15 14 See HIV/AIDS Factssheets Introduction : How HIV cause AIDS, supra note 7. 15 Teen Aids-PeerCorps, http://www.teenaids.org/Portals/0/Images/whatIsAIDS-pic3.gif (last visited April 16, 2008). 1 6 2.D. HIV Genes16 HIV's RNA genome is 9 kilobases in le ngth which contains 9 genes encoding 15 different proteins and a control sequence called long terminal repeat (LTR) at both ends of each genome, which are involved in the HIV replication (Figure 6). The HIV genes are divided into 3 groups based on their functions-struc tural, regulatory, and accessory genes. Three of the genes called gag, pol and env belong to the structural group; the genes called tat, rev and nef belong to the regulatory group; the vpr, vif and vpu genes belong to the accessory group. The structural genes encode proteins for making new virus partic les, which have been the major target in the HIV vaccine development. The latter two groups of genes are involved in the control of various aspects of HIV life cycle from the ability of HIV to infect a cell, replic ation inside a cell or causing disease. Specifically, the pol gene encodes several different proteins, reverse transciptase, protease, RNAseH p17-matrix protein, p7-nucleocapsid, and p6, which are the building blocks for the viral core. The env encodes envelope protein gp160. The tat encodes TAT protein essentia l for HIV replication of its genome. The nef encodes a regulatory protein that dir ects the host cells when to make RNA copies from the integrated HIV DNA to produ ce viral RNA. The rev encodes a regulatory protein which promotes the production of vira l proteins. The vpr enc odes VPR protein which accelerates production of HI V proteins and promotes integrat ion of the viral DNA into the host genome.

Vaccines to HIV18 Scientists have been struggling to deve lop a vaccine against HIV since the first identification of HIV and its etio logic role in AIDS more than two decades ago. Currently, no vaccines have been produced that can produce st erile immunity. The bi ology of HIV infection poses the unique problems for vaccine development. First, HIV is highly variable/mutagenic. It has a very high error rate when replicating viral genome coupled with a high replication rate (~10 9 - 1010 virions per day) results in many variants of the initial infecting HIV within a host. Second, HIV infects immune cells central to the immune system, CD4+ cells and macrophages and thus, depletes them. Third is the latency. HIV infects the CD 4+ cells of a host; however, HIV only can replicate when the CD4+ cells become activated to divide to produce more T cell clones. Until then, the HIV is essentially invisi ble to the immune system and thus , this pool of latently infected CD4+ T cells is never cleared even with antiretroviarl treatment. Thus, an ideal HIV vaccine would need 1) to induce a sterilizi ng immunity including neutralizing antiboides and mucosa l immunity to prevent infection and cyottoxic T cells to clear virus that has evaded the antibody, 2) to prevent infection of CD4+ cells, 3) to be cross reactive with all groups or clades in a group at a minimum, 4) to ha ve a low cost for production and vaccination; to be safe and tolerable, 5) and to be easy to administer. 3. HIV Vaccines Several types of vaccines against HIV have been developed during the past three decades including live vector based vacci nes, glycoprotein vaccine, peptide vaccines and DNA vaccine. HIV vaccines have been tested in man since late 1980.19 The earliest approach of HIV vaccine is attenuated live virus vaccine, such as vaccinia virus or poxvirus vaccine. The vaccinia virus ecific CD4+ T-cell responses. Weak CD8+ CTL responses could also be generated when us ing a prime-boost combination of vaccinia virus and recombinant gp120 vaccines. However, the viruses caused serious diseases in healthy testers; thereafter, the replication-competent v accinia vectors have been replaced by replication- deficient vectors because of safety concerns. These replication-deficient vectors have been evaluated in human trials but no positive results have occurred. For example, a research plan for a prime/boost vaccine approach of canarypox vector priming and gp120 boosting was performed by HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) duri ng year 2001 and 2002. HVTN later decided to abandon its phase III trial and further study because the result showed that this kind of vaccine plan did not generate a high level of CD8+ T cell response. 20 18 See HIV/AIDS Factssheets Introduction , supra note 7. 19 Paul Spearman, Current Progress in the Development of HIV Vaccines , 12 C URRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN 1149 (2006). 20 Id. 1 8 More studies on live vector-based vaccines c ontinue. The scientists never give up this approach because live vectors can generate st rong and long-lived cellula r immune responses. However, we have to consider the balance betw een virus safety and the capacity to generate immune response. Wildtype viruses are no l onger acceptable. Most of these live vector approaches are highly attenuated or are viral vector systems that are competent for only a single round of infection in the host. There are several types of live vector-based HIV vaccines used in current human trials including adenovirus vaccine, poxvirus vaccine, alphavirus vector vaccine, adeno-associated virus (AAV), stomatitis virus (VSU)- based HIV vaccine a nd poliovirus vector vaccine. None of these report good results as yet. The adenovirus vaccine is the leading CTL vaccine candidate. It can produce poten t cellular immune response but it won't work for people already immunized from it. Almost one-third of Nort h American volunteers have preexisting immunity for adenovirus. 21 The other live vector vaccines have common problems of high production cost, low stability and limited serotypes. The current HIV vaccine approaches include DNA, peptide and glycoprotein vaccines. Usually these vaccines are not used in isolation; they instead would be arranged in a prime/boost regime such as DNA prime and protein boost. 22 The primarily goal for these vaccine approaches is to elicit HIV-specific CD8+ CTL responses and to genera te a population of supportive HIV- specific CD4+ T cells. Monomeric gp120-based vaccine was another fo rm HIV vaccine in the early study. This vaccine was safe and could generate neutraliz ing antibodies to gp120. However, this kind of vaccine behaved differently for laboratory-adapt ed HIV isolates and naturally occurring HIV isolates. Results of two phase III trials showed that this a pproach did not produce relevant antibodies in human subjects. Scientists then stopped pursing this approach. More studies show that the monomeric gp-120-based vaccine would fail because the native structure of HIV envelope glycoprotein is in a trimeric conformation. The new approach of glycoprotein vaccine is to generate neutra lizing antibodies against HIV virus by using the glycoprotein which maintains its native conformation of the trimeric complex. See Figure 7. 21 Id. at 1157. 22 Id. at 1154. 1 9 Figure 7: Trimeric Conformation of the HIV gp120 Envelop Glycoprotein23 As of yet, no positive results occurred for the trimer glycoprotein approach. One approach using an oligomeric gp140 vaccine is being investigated at Chiron. Progenics Pharmaceuticals and Cornell University are al so pursuing a disulfide-stabilized, modified trimeric protein vaccine. The other two HIV vaccine approaches are DNA vaccine and peptide vaccine. These two approaches share several common characteristics: they all have great potential, they have achieved good results in animal tria ls and all are safe in human trials. However, studies so far have reported that these a pproaches only generate weak immune response in humans. DNA vaccines use a plasmid DNA vector to ge nerate HIV proteins or protein subunits within host cells. 24 The HIV proteins are antigens and induce immunization response against the HIV virus. The first step of DNA vaccine is to allow the plas mid DNA vector being taken up by host cells. This might be procured by simply intramuscular injection. However, there will not be enough antigens if the cellular uptake is inefficient. Ways to improve the cellular uptake include the use of gene guns, formulation into mi cro-particles and the use of adjuvants that may increase uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs). 25 Some data shows DNA vaccines for HIV can generate cellular and humoral immune res ponses. Several reports indicated DNA vaccines 23 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: How HIV causes AIDS, available at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/howhiv.htm . 24 See Spearman, supra note 18, at 1154. 25 Id. 2 0 elicit reasonable levels of HIV- specific immune responses in mice and one report showed that a DNA/MVA vaccination approach provided longstanding pr otection from SHIV 89.6P.26 However, there were no convinc ing conclusions resulting from human trials of DNA vaccines against HIV. Only weak CD8+ CTL responses were reported. The concept of the peptide vaccine is simple- using the peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or clas s II molecules as the antigens to trigger the immunization responses against HIV virus. See Figure 8. Figure 8: Structure of a MHC Molecule27 The peptide vaccine can be designed to produce particular immunogens for a special target which may produce combinations of T- helper and CTL epitopes representing specific conserved regions of HIV.28 Another advantage of peptide va ccines is that it can direct the immune response toward subdominant epitopes that may not elicit responses of viral infection or other broad immune responses.29 Positive results were reported in small animals. However, a human trial using a live virus pr ime/peptide boost vaccine showed only weak and transit cellular immune responses were generated inside these healthy volunteers. How the scientists could improve the peptide-based HIV vaccines is still unclear. 26 Id. at 1155. 27 Tao, Mi-Hua, at .26, available at http://www.sinica.edu.tw/~hispj/program/doc/tao-mi-hua.pdf . 28 Spearman, Paul, Current Progress in the Development of HIV Vaccines , Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2006, 12, at p. 1155 29 Id. 2 1 4. DNA Vaccines for HIV 4.A. Vaccine Overview A vaccine may be defined in basic terms as a preparation which is used to improve immunity to a particular diseas e. The term is derived from Edward Jenner's use of cowpox (\"vacca\" means cow in Latin), which, when admi nistered to humans, pr ovided them protection against smallpox, the work which Louis Pasteur a nd others carried on. Vaccines are based on the concept of variolation originating in China, in which a person is deliberately infected with a weak form of smallpox. Jenner realized that milkmaids who had contac t with cowpox did not get smallpox. The process of distributing a nd administrating vaccines is referred to as vaccination. Since vaccination was much safer, smallpox inoculation fell into disuse and was eventually banned in England in 1848. Vaccines can be prophylactic (e.g. to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g. vaccines against cancer are also being investigated). Over the years of research, various types of vaccines have been researched, discovered and used for preventing and curing diseases. Di fferent types of vaccine s are discussed below: Traditionally, there are f our types of vaccines: Vaccines containing killed microorganisms - these are previously virulent micro- organisms that have been killed with chemi cals or heat. Examples are vaccines against flu, cholera, bubonic pla gue, and hepatitis A. Vaccines containing live, attenuated virus microorganisms - these are live micro- organisms that have been cultivated under cond itions that disable thei r virulent properties or which use closely-relate d but less dangerous organism s to produce a broad immune response. They typically provoke more durable immunological re sponses and are the preferred type for healthy adu lts. Examples include yellow fever, measles, rubella, and mumps. The live tuberculosis va ccine is not the contagious strain, but a related strain called \"BCG\". Toxoids are inactivated toxic compounds in cases where these (rather than the micro- organism itself) cause illness. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diptheria. Not all toxoids are for micro-organi sms; for example, dogs ag ainst rattlesnake bites. Subunit vaccines, rather than introducing an in activated or attenuated micro-organism to an immune system (which would constitute a \"whole-agent\" vaccine), a fragment of it can create an immune response. Character istic examples include the subunit vaccine against HBV that is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus (produced in yeast) and the virus like part icles (VLP) vaccine against human papilloma virus (HPV) that is composed of the viral major capsid protein.30 Other than these four traditional vaccines, new and modern vaccines have also been discovered which are in various stag es of development but have been put to application as well. These are: Conjugate vaccines are those wherein, certain bacteria have polysaccharide outer coats that are poorly immunogenic. By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g. toxins), the immune system can be led to recognize the po lysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen. This approach is used in the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine. 30 R.Wolfe et al., Anti-vaccinationists: Past and Present, BRITISH MEDICAL J., Aug. 24, 2002, at 430-432. 2 2 In Recombinant Vector vaccines, by comb ining the physiology of one micro-organism and the DNA of the other, immunity can be cr eated against diseases that have complex infection processes DNA Vaccination is a technique which has been developed in recent years and has been created from an infectious agent's naked DNA . It works by insertion (and expression, triggering immune system recognition) into huma n or animal cells, of viral or bacterial DNA. Some cells of the immune system th at recognize the proteins expressed will mount an attack against these proteins and cells expressing them. Because these cells live for a very long time, if the pathogen th at normally expresses these proteins is encountered at a later time, they will be attacked instantly by the immune system. One advantage of DNA vaccines is that they are very easy to produce and store. As of 2006, DNA vaccination is still experimental. 31 This report looks in detail into the third ki nd of innovative vaccines, i.e. the DNA vaccines. These DNA vaccines may be defined as pr eparation of a portion of the pathogen's structure that upon administrati on stimulates antibody production or cellular immunity against the pathogen but is incapable of causing severe infection, or mo re specifically as DNA sequences that code for immunogenic proteins located in appropria tely constructed plasmids which include strong promoters, which when injected into an animal are taken up by cells and the immunogenic proteins are expressed and elicit an immune response. Simultaneously, Genetic/ DNA immunization may be defined as a novel technique used to effi ciently stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses to prot ein antigens. The direct injec tion of genetic material into a living host causes a small amount of its cells to produce the introduced gene products. This inappropriate gene expressi on within the host has importa nt immunological consequences, resulting in the specific immune activation of the host against the gene delivered antigen. 32 4.B.1. DNA Vaccine Overview The use of genetic material to deliver gene s for therapeutic purposes has been practiced for many years. Experiments outlining the transf er of DNA into cells of living animals were reported as early as 1950. Later experiments using purified genetic material only further confirmed that the direct DNA gene injection in the absence of viral vectors results in the expression of the inoculated gene s in the host. There have be en additional experiments that extend these findings to recombinant DNA molecule s, further illustrating the idea that purified nucleic acids could be directly delivered into a host and proteins would be produced. In 1992, scientists Tang and Johnson reported that the deliv ery of human growth hormone in a expression cassette in vivo resulted in production of detectable levels of the growth hormone in host mice. They also found that these inoculated mice de veloped antibodies against the human growth hormone; they termed this immunization proced ure \"genetic immunization\", which describes the ability of inoculated genes to be individual immunogens.33 Since its early applications in the 1950's, DNA-based im munization has become a novel approach to vaccine development. Direct in jection of naked plasmid DNA can induce strong 31 Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine . 32 H. Koprowski et Vaccination , SPRINER -VERLAG HEIDELBERG , 1998, at 198. 33 Id. 2 3 immune responses to the antigen encoded by the ge ne vaccine. They offer a new opportunity to immunize with materials that are entirely gene-b ased, expressed by the recipient's own cells. This means that there is greater control over th e immunization process, because the investigator determines which antigens and co-s timulants to use, where to e licit the response (e.g., skin or muscle), and which cytokines or in nate controls (if any) to use. The duration of the response can be controlled by repeated exposure to the genes, which are expressed tran siently, by a variety of delivery mechanisms such as: direct injection; electroporation; gene gun; mucosal delivery, etc.34 Once the plasmid DNA construct is injected the host cells take up the foreign DNA, expressing the viral gene and producing the co rresponding viral protein inside the cell. This form of antigen presentation and processing can induce both MHC a nd class I and class II restricted cellular and humoral immune responses.35 The ability to make DNA molecules strictly by rational design makes it possible to bypass months of development for the production of effi cacious vaccines. In addition, numerous DNA-based biopharm aceuticals are able to control disease progression by induction and/or i nhibition of genes. These poten which cleave RNA substrates in a sequence-specific manner, have been studied as potentia l therapeutics to target pathogenic mRNAs, and may yield drugs that are safer than those currently available.36 4.B.2. DNA Vaccine Construction The construction of viral/bacterial plasmids with vaccine inserts is accomplished using recombinant DNA technology. Once constructed, the vaccine plasmid (see Figure 9) is transformed into virus/bacteria, where viral/bacte rial growth produces multiple plasmid copies. The plasmid DNA is then purified from the virus/ bacteria, by separating the circular plasmid from the much larger bacterial DNA and other vi ral/bacterial impurities. This purified DNA acts as the vaccine.37 The figure given below shows an ex ample of a sample DNA vaccine plasmid construct. DNA vaccines are composed of viral/bact erial plasmids. Expression plasmids used in DNA-based vaccination normally contain two units: the antigen expression unit composed of promoter/enhancer sequences, followed by antige n-encoding and polyadenylation sequences and unit viral/bacterial sequences necessary for plasmid amplification and selection.38 Biology by Design, http://www.natx.com/DNAVaccines.html . 35J.

CHEM. 543-52 (2001). 2 4 Figure 939 Other factors to be kept in mind while constructing a DNA vaccine might include those mentioned below. To develop a successful protein therapeutic, effective DNA delivery technologies are required that induce high and sustained leve ls of protein production in appropriate targets sites, whereas robust and long-lasting immune responses need to be induced by a DNA-based vaccine. Vectors for gene ther apy and DNA vaccines must be resistant to degradation and attack by the immune system, have a satisfactory safety profile, and be able to express the therapeutic protein for the desired pe riod of time. Effective non-viral vectors, which can express the proteins of intere st at high levels, are available. However, since most of the DNA delivered in vivo is degraded before it ca n enter the nucleus, proper formulation and delivery are critical to the devel opment of effective gene-based therapeutics and vaccines. These systems must be safe for human and veterinary cl inical applications and yet ensure that the DNA survives the extra- and intracellular environment and is capable of entering the appropriate cellular compartments. In experiments in seve ral laboratories various potential and proven non- invasive chemical, mechanical, physical and biological DNA delivery systems for therapeutic and vaccine applications have been explored. A few of these approaches have been evaluated and proven to be promising in target species. 40 4.B.3. DNA Vaccine Mechanism A plasmid vector that expr esses the protein of interest (e.g. viral protein) under the control of an appropriate promoter is injected into the skin or muscle of the host. After uptake of the plasmid, the protein is produced endogenously and intracellularly processed into small antigenic peptides by the host pr oteases. The peptides then en ter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (E.R.) by membrane-associated transporte rs In the E.R., peptides bind to MHC class I molecules. These peptides are presented on the cell surface in the context of the MHC class I. 39 Margaret A. Scuderi, DNA Vaccines for the Prevention and Treatement of Hepatitis B Vaccine L.V. DEN HURK, NOVEL METHODS FOR THE NON-INVASIVE ADMINISTRATION OF DNA THERAPEUTICS AND VACCINES 3-15 (Bentham Science Publishers 2006). 2 5 Subsequent CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL's) ar e stimulated and they evoke cell-mediated immunity. CTLs inhibit viruses through both cy tolysis of infected cells and noncytolysis mechanisms such as cytokine production41. The foreign protein can also be presented by the MHC class II pathway by APCs which elicit helper T cells (CD4+) responses. These CD4+ cells are able to recognize the peptid es formed from exogenous protei ns that were endocytosed or phagocytosed by APC, then degraded to pept ide fragments and loaded onto MHC class II molecules. Depending on the the type of CD4+ cell that binds to the complex, B cells are stimulated and antibody production is stimulated. This is the same manner in which traditional vaccines work.42 See Figure 10. Figure 1043 The DNA vaccine, introduced into the person to be immunized, can be via injection or delivery by a \"gene gun\", with muscle typically the targeted tissue. Transcription and translation occur from the vaccine plasmids that find their way into the nucleus of the muscle cells, to make the pathogen-derived protein. Some of this protei n makes it outside of the cell, where it is either bound by antibody molecules on B cells or phagocytosed by macrophages. Either way, the protein gets digested inside these cells into sm all peptides and placed in the binding groove of a cell surface protein called th e class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) 44. (See Figure 10) 41 J. Encke, supra note 35. 42 mplates/student_resources/0030223180_ garrettgrisham/images/hottopics/VaccineMechanism.gif . T-Cell responses DNA immunization is able to raise a range of T H responses, including lymphoproliferation and the generation of a variety of cytokine profiles. A major advantage of DNA vaccines is the ease with which they can be manipulated to bias the type of T-cell help towards a TH1 or TH2 response.45 Each type of response has di stinctive pattern s of lymphokine and chemokine expression, specific types of i mmunoglobulins expressed, patterns of lymphocyte trafficking, and types of innate immune responses generated. T cell receptors (TCRs) on the surface of helper T cells can recognize these pep tides as being foreign to the body, and therefore from an invading pathogen. The helper T cell, then, releases a variet y of interleukin (IL) proteins to stimulate both arms of the immune sy stem (humoral and cellular) to kick into gear. This IL release has a number of effects. The fi rst is to auto-stimulate the helper T cell that detected the foreign protein, so that it can proliferate to fight off the disease. Another secreted IL protein ramps up humoral immunity by causing the B cells whose membrane-bound antibodies were able to bind the foreign protein to diffe rentiate (multiply and change) into antibody- secreting plasma cells for the production of massi ve quantities of serum antibodies reactive to this pathogen's protein. The last effect of the IL release is to promote the cellular arm of the immune system. The cytotoxic T lymphocytes (C TLs) are activated by the IL proteins released by the helper T lymphocytes, and thei r job is to search for and dest roy any cells that have foreign matter inside them, such as proteins from a replicating virus. These cells of the immune system that have become activated by in troduction of foreign matter from an infection or vaccin e, whether B cell, helper T cell, or CTL, also create \"memory cells\" when they proliferate. It is these memory cells that prot ect you later in life from infection by the same pathogen you were once exposed to. It is this protection that vaccines seek to offer, with the introduction of innocuous proteins derive d from a harmful pathogen, so that they bring forth the cellular and molecular arsenal agai nst the foreign matter and leave behind these memory cell sentries to d eal with future invasion. Different types of T cell helps may be raised. The type of T-cell help raised is influenced by the method of delivery and the type of immu nogen expressed, as well as the targeting of different lymphoid compartments. 46 Generally, saline needle injections (either IM or ID) tend to induce TH1 responses, while gene gun delivery raises TH2 responses. This is true for intracellular and plasma membrane-bound antigens, but not for secreted antigens, which seem to generate TH2 responses, regardless of the method of delivery. 47 Topics/DNAVaccines.html&h=396&w= 325&sz=19&hl=en&start=4&tbnid=pu 3x2FkBlteZ4M:&tbnh=124&tbnw= 102&prev=/images%3Fq%3DDNA%2Bvaccines%26gbv%3D2%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG . 45 D.M.

OF VIROLOGY 5295-03 (1997). 2 7 It is not understood how these different me thods of DNA immunization, or the forms of antigen expressed, raise different profiles of T-cell help. It was thought that the relatively large amounts of DNA used in IM injection were resp onsible for the induction of TH1 responses. However, evidence has shown no diff erences in TH type due to dose. It has been postulated that the type of T-cell help raised is determined by the differentiated state of antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells can differentiate to secrete IL-12 (which supports TH1 cell development) or IL-4 (which supports TH2 responses).48 pDNA injected by needle is endocytosed into the dendritic cell, which is then stimulated to di fferentiate for TH1 cytokine production49, while the gene gun bombards the DNA directly into the ce ll, thus bypassing TH1 stimulation. One of the greatest advantages of DNA vaccines is that they are able to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) without the inherent risk associated with live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes 50, as well as subdominant CTL epitopes, in a manner which app ears to mimic natural infection. This may prove to be a useful tool in assessing CTL epit opes of an antigen, and their role in providing immunity. Cytotoxic T-cells recognise small peptides complexed to MHC class I molecules. 51 These peptides are derived from endogenous cytoso lic proteins which are degraded and delivered to the nascent MHC class I mol ecule within the endoplasmic reti culum (ER). Targeting gene products directly to the ER (by the addition of an amino-terminal insertion sequence) should thus enhance CTL responses. This has been successf ully demonstrated using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing influenza proteins52, but the principle should be applicable to DNA vaccines too. Targeting antigens for intracellular degr adation (and thus entry into the MHC class I pathway) by the addition of ubiquitin signal sequences, or mutation of other signal sequences, has also been shown to be eff ective at increasing CTL responses. 53 4.B.5. Humoral (Antibody) Response The other type of immune response i nduced by DNA based vaccines is the Humoral response. Antibody responses elicited by DNA vaccinations are influenced by a number of variables, including type of antigen encoded; location of expr essed antigen (i.e. intracellular vs. secreted); number, frequency and dose of immunizations; site a nd method of antigen delivery, to name a few. Humoral responses after a single DNA injection can be much longer-lived than after a single injection with a re combinant protein. Antibody res ponses against hepatitis B virus 48 J.

Antibody-secreting cells migrate to the bone marrow and spleen for long-term antibody producti on, and are generally localis ed there after one year.54 DNA immunization-induced antibodies show gr eater affinity to native epitopes than recombinant protein-induced antibodies. In other words, DNA immunization induces a qualitatively superior response. Antibody can be induced after just on e vaccination with DNA, whereas recombinant protein vaccinations generally require a boost. As mentioned previously, DNA immunization can be used to bias the TH profile of the immune response, and thus the antibody isotype, which is not possible with eith er natural infection or recombinant protein immunization. Antibody responses generated by DNA ar e useful not just in vaccination but as a preparative tool, too. For exam ple, polyclonal and monoclonal an tibodies can be generated for use as reagents. 55 4.B.6. DNA Vaccine Administration Several possible routes of plasmid deliv ery have been found. Successful immunization has been demonstrated after delivery of pl asmids through intramuscular, intradermal and intravenous injection. The skin and mucous membranes are considered the best site for immunization due to the high concentrations of dendritic cells (DC), macrophages and lymphocytes. Cutaneous gene therapy and DNA vacci nation are potential app lications of plasmid delivery methods where a gene for an antigen or a therapeutic protein is in serted in the plasmid and applied to the skin. However, the delivery of the DNA plasmid is a major challenge due to the unusual physicochemical prope rties of the DNA, the tissue and cellular barriers and expression difficulties. Even though the skin is the most accessible organ of the body and it is an ideal target for gene therapy, th e delivery of plasmid DNA across th e skin is very difficult due to the specific barrier function of the stratum corneum and the inconsistent transfection rate of keratinocytes and other epidermal cells. To date there is no gene delivery system that was shown to be optimal for cutaneous gene therapy. In order to develop an e fficient non-viral delivery vehicle there is need for a system that prov ides the combined properties of effective DNA condensation, cutaneous permeati on, cellular transfection and suffi ciently sustained expression, for example, the formulation approaches and delivery methods for DNA through the skin in the context of the barriers both at the tissue and cellular levels for both vaccine and gene therapy applications 56. Intradermal injection of DNA-coated gold pa rticles with a gene gun have been used, it leads to keratinocyte and dendritic cell trans duction. A gene gun is used to accelerate the transdermal passage of microscopic gold beads co ated with DNA plasmids (about 600 copies per bead) into the epidermis, where some are taken up by resident dendritic (Langerhans') cells. Alternatively, a soluble antigen toge ther with an adjuvant, is app lied to the skin (transcutaneous 54 D.M.

Some antigen reaches the ep idermis and also undergoes endocytosis by Langerhans' cells. The foreign DNA is expressed, a nd the antigens are degr aded to polypeptides, some of which bind to major-histocompatibility complex antigens. These activated T cells can interact with an activated B cell to induce a humoral response.57 See Figure 11. Figure 1158 The plasmid DNA can be diluted in distilled wa ter, saline or sucros e. There has also been positive demonstration of proinjection or co delivery with various dr ugs. Administration of DNA associated with liposomes is less efficient, but allows for delivery of DNA vaccines to gastrointestinal or respiratory mucosal epithelia. 4.B.7. DNA Vaccine Advantages DNA vaccines may have significant advantag es over standard vaccines. They can express antigenic epitopes which mo re closely resemble native vira l epitopes and could therefore be more effective. With live attenuated vaccine s and killed vaccines th e manufacturing process can alter the secondary a nd tertiary structure of the proteins and therefor e the antigenicity of the vaccine; with naked DNA vaccines the host cell is manufacturing the viral epitope. DNA vaccines would be safer than live virus vaccine s, especially in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with HIV. DNA vaccine s may be constructed to include genes against several different pathogens, thus decreasing the number of v accinations necessary to fully immunize children. Construction and manufacture of DNA vaccines would be simple. Finally DNA vaccines may hold promise in treating those alre ady infected with chr onic viral infections (i.e., HCV, HIV or HSV). Rapid and large-scal e production are available at costs considerably lower than traditional vaccines, and they are also very temper ature stable making storage and 57 Health Professionals On-Line Resource Centre, http://www.immune.org.nz/?t=919 . 58Health Professionals On-Line Resource Centre: http://www.immune.org.nz/site_resources/ Making_DNA_vaccine.gif 0 transport much easier. The continuous expr ession of the viral antigen caused by gene vaccination in an environment containing ma ny APCs may promote successful therapeutic immune response which cannot be obtained by other traditional vaccines.59 4.B.8. DNA Vaccine Limitations Although DNA can be used to raise immune responses against pathogenic proteins, certain microbes have outer capsids that are made up of polysaccharides. This limits the extent of the usage of DNA vaccines because they ca nnot substitute for polysaccharide-based subunit vaccines. Difficulties include identifying the antigenic peptides, the potential to develop autoimmune responses and se lection of viral vectors. 60 4.C. DNA Vaccines, HIV and AIDS Developing a vaccine to protect against HIV in attempt to gain control of the AIDS pandemic is a top priority for researchers thr oughout the world. Extensive testing has been conducted with live vaccines to determine if im munization would be eff ective at prevention, but they are not suitable for human use due to the pote ntial that the vaccine viruses could mutate and reacquire the ability to cause disease. Th e human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome induce account for over 40 million deaths in the past 20 years. Given that the currently available treatm ents to prevent HIV transmission and disease are not effective in eradicating the virus, vaccina tion likely represents the only efficacious adapted response to the global imp act of this infection.61 Faced with the challenges in developing an HIV vaccine, international cons ortia and new methodologies have been proposed in order to accelerate the development and screening process of new candidate HIV vaccines. Moreover, in the absence of a protective vaccine, the impact of a vaccine that confers partial protection needs to be seriously considered. 4.C.1. Difficulties in HIV development62 The development of effective human i mmunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines and immunotherapies has been an elusive goal ever since the virus was firs t identified. There are several contributing factors that ha ve resulted in the failure to generate a protective or therapeutic HIV vaccine. HIV is highly variab le due in part to the two erro rs made per replication cycle by reverse transcriptase during the replication proces s. This high mutation rate facilitates the virus in evading the adaptive cellular and humoral immune response. Exposed parts of the envelope can mutate up to 35% of their amino acids wi thout losing their function allowing for a large variety of mutations that can act as decoys for immune respons es. Traditional vaccines rely on the generation of neutralizing antib odies to confer protection. On the other hand, viral mutations that allow the virus to escape detection by cyto toxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) correlates with a 59 Encke, supra note 35. 60 American Academy of Microbiology .

IMMUN ., 2006, at 267-79. 3 1 decline in health characterized by a decrease in immune func tion and an increase in viral replication, thereby concluding that antibodies playing only a very limited role in viral control post infection. CTL responses are able to ta rget internal epitopes that ar e not accessible to antibodies, resulting in the destruction of in fected cells. However, HIV is able to eventually evade these CTL responses through incorporation of new muta tions, resulting in th e selection of escape variants that are not recognized and survive. The selec tive pressures of both antibody and CTL responses keep the virus in a continual state of change while the immune system is undermined through the destruction of CD4 + T cells both by direct lysis du e to infection and through the destruction of infect ed cells by CTL. The infection pattern of HIV is likely to play a role in hindering the development of effective immunotherapies. In orde r for a vaccine to be effective on a global scale, it must elicit CTL responses directed against conserved regions of HIV. Fu rthermore, immune responses directed against single epitopes in crease the likelihood that the virus will be able to mutate and escape immune recognition. Therefore, the br eadth of the immune res ponse will likely be as critical to developing an efficaci ous vaccine as the type of imm une response that is elicited. Traditional vaccines rely on the production of an tibodies through the injection of live attenuated virus, killed viral par ticles, or recombinant viral protei ns. Killed viruses and recombinant proteins tend elicit humoral imm une responses directed toward va riable regions of the virus, rendering them ineffective. Live attenuated viru ses are better able to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity the than their non live co unterparts. One important focus has been the use of recombinant viral vectors. On the other hand, DNA-based immunizations offer conceptual advantages compared to recombinant vi ral vectors. Unlike viral vectors, they can be boosted in theory infinitely, and there is no issue with pr eexisting serology. DNA-based vaccines are inherently conceptually safe because of the absence of a live vector and simple quality control issues. However their major drawback is that compared to recombinant adenoviral vectors, the best DNA vacci nes are \u00bd as immune potent. One of the more popular methods of immunizat ion involves the use of multiple strategies in a heterologous prime-boost regimen. While immunization with DNA vaccines alone has had limited immune potency, priming with 2-3 rounds of DNA immunizations followed by a viral vector boost has been demonstrated to generate enhanced immune responses over that seen with homologous viral vector prime-boost alone. 63 In addition to heterologous prime-boost regimens has also been examined. These vaccines have consisted of a DNA prime, a viral boost, and a second boost consisting of protein mixed with adjuvant (D-V-P). One study demonstrated the ability of D-V-P immunizations to induce the secretion of antibodies at mucosal surfaces, particularly when the prot ein was conjugated to mannan64, suggesting this vaccine approach may be particularly effective at pr eventing infection. Vaccination st rategies would be simpler and more effective if we can improve the overall potency of DNA vaccines. 63 Santra S. Seaman et al.

Clinical Studies65 Nonhuman primates (NHP) SIV and SHIV mo del, while not perfect, remain the best models for the preclinical evaluation of HIV vacci ne efficacy due to a disease progression that is similar to that seen in humans. Looking at a few experimental studies reported, in 2005, Su et al.66 reported five conserved Gag CTL epitopes usi ng a model in rhesus macaques. The study demonstrated these epitopes are maintained l ong into viral infection and even appear to be relatively conserved in several strains of SIV. In another clinical study, Baroch et al.67 demonstrated the ability of DN A immunization to elicit CTL res ponses against both dominant and subdominant epitopes in an SHIV model, s uggesting DNA may be useful for eliciting broad CTL-based immune responses which are desi red for control of HIV infection. DNA vaccines have performed poorly at induc ing antibody responses. This is likely due to the lack of soluble antigen access to B cells. In July 2005, Rosati et al. 68 examined the use of a DNA vaccine encoding Gag and Env fused to either MCP3 or -catenin to target the transcribed antigens to secrtory or degradat ion pathways, respectively, and these animals developed stronger antibody respons es. There has been particul ar interest in the use of heterologous prime-boost strategies for HIV/SIV. Boyer et al.69 reported partial control of SIV239 after a DNA/ Listeria prime-boost regimen. The combination of DNA prime-boost and Listeria -boost resulted in enhanced cellular immunity to virus over that seen with either agent alone. There have been many vaccine strategies designed to test elicitatio n of immune responses to HIV in humans, with more than 30 human trials currently underway. Thus far, the two immunization methods demonstra ting the highest level of imm unogenicity include the use of recombinant Ad5 adenoviral vectors either alon e or in combination with plasmid DNA in a heterologous DNA/Ad5 prime-boost regimen. This is perhaps the most efficient of all the methods tested do far. In concluding we can say that thus far, no correlates of protection have been found for HIV. However, there is strong evidence that CD8+ T cells play an important role in controlling HIV infection. Currently the most important method for assessing vaccine efficacy is the measurement of the number of IFN- -secreting T cells by ELISPOT. Adenoviral vectors have performed well in primate models and can be fu rther improved if an animal has been primed using a DNA vaccine. While DNA vaccines alone ha ve proven to be relatively nonimmunogenic, the addition of encoded molecular adjuvants as optimized IL-15 and IL-12, has been almost as effective as viral vectors. It is likely that further exploration of potential molecular adjutants 65 See Hokey, supra note 62. 66 J Su et al., Novel Simian Immunodeficiency Virus CTL Epitopes Restricted by MHC Class I Molecule Mamu-B*01 are in et al., Elicitation of High- Frequency Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Against both Dominant and Subdominant Simian-Human Immunodeficiency virus Epitopes by DNA Vaccination of Rhesus Monkeys , 75 J.

Thus, further studies are clearly important and will continue to mold and cha nge this evolving field. 5. Patent Search Methodology and Results 5.A. Patent Search Methodology The Intellectual Property Research Tools c ourse project started on January 17, 2008 with a referral from PIPRA. C ecilia Chiham, Director Biotec hnology Resources at The Public Intellectual Property Resources for Agriculture (hereinafter PIPRA) was the contact and coordinator. During several te lephone conferences, the scope of this project was defined by Cecilia Chiham, Kerri Clark of PI PRA, Prof. Jon Cavicchi, and Dr . Stanley Kowalski. Initially, after discussions on the topic of the project to be undertaken, the team unanimously decided to conduct an HIV vaccine patent landscape analysis . The team was provided with flow charts indicating the levels of research on the subject, and the optio n of choosing what level of patents to work on. We chose to work on DNA Vaccine s and thereafter launched into the 4 month pursuit of searching and coding. The goal of the team search was to find relevant patents encompassing construction, optimization and deliver y methods of DNA vaccines for HIV. The search methodology was devised to initially generate a broad set of patents and then narrow down the results using the \"Iterative A pproach\" as promoted by Prof. Cavicchi. The search was divided into a preliminary search r ound and then subsequent 4 rounds. The searches utilized keywords derived from the primary sear ch and the US Classifications and Sub-classes that came forth after this round were used for carrying out further searches. The main concepts used in the primary search were Vaccine $, DNA, recombine$, plasmid, HIV, AIDS, Human immune$ virus, Poxvirus, Deliver$, Prim$, boost, backbone, promoter, peptide$ for the USPTO search, and DNA, plasmid, Vaccine *, HIV, human immune* Prim*, ation, gene gun while searching in Delphion. This primary search on Delphi on also involved search ing by classes of US Classifications 424, 435, 536, 514, 530. The search th en utilized keywords derived from the Primary Search to obtain relevant United States Patent Classification Codes (herein after USPC) codes in the United States Pate nt and Trademark Office database (herein after USPTO) as well as broad number of patents in US & EP app lications and patents, WIPO PCT publications through the Delphion database. With the results obtained subsequent , four rounds of search were carried out. For finding patent literature, we searched the following database platforms: 1. USPTO: Using the list of relevant class/su b-classes obtained from the primary search and combining it with the initial list of key words, utilizing the USPTO Seven-Step Strategy (http://www.uspto.gov/go/ptdl/step7.htm), we performed a series of hybrid searches encompassing the keywords and class/ sub-classifications. W ith the results from these searches, we started coding the patent documents and assembli ng the Master Sheet. 2. GenomeQuest: Using the DNA sequences of Gag, Pol, Nef and Env, provided to us by Kerri Clark at PIPRA, we performed a sear ch using GenomeQuest database. Using this search result, we found patents which included the three key words \"HIV, DNA 3 4 Vaccines, and Vaccine\" and a 65% to 80% homology with the respective sequences. After analyzing the search results, we arrang ed the most relevant patents in our Master Sheet. 3. Delphion: This was the main database us ed by us. The relevant patents found on USPTO database were then searched on Delphion, wh ere the searches were narrowed down, each team member created their own work files, extracted pdf's, extracted data on excel sheets, etc., which were then comp lied into the Master Sheet. After the Preliminary Search, we moved on to Search Round I. In this round each team member was given fixed US Class/Subclasses to s earch and the keywords to use with those class numbers as search strings. These were: 1. Lisa Class 435/320.1 + HIV any field + v accine in title or abstract Class 435/320.1 + HIV any field + v accine in title or abstract 2. Arshdeep Class 424/188.1 + vaccine in title Class 424/188.1 + vaccine in abstract Class 424/188.1 + vaccine in claims Class 424/188.1 + vaccine in all fields 3. Weonmee Class 424/208.1 + vaccine in title Class 424/208.1 + vaccine in abstract Class 424/208.1 + vaccine in claims Class 424/208.1 + vaccine in all fields 4. Michelle a. search the Derwent World Patent Index classes B04, D16, C06 on Delphion and mine for relevant U.S. patent numbers; b. search U.S. patents for the following assignees and add keywords as indicated for relevant patents on HIV vaccines: - Merck - Aventis - Virogenetics - Chiron - University of California c. search U.S. patents for class 536 and add keyw ords as indicated for relevant patents on HIV vaccines 3 5 Patent searching on these outlines gave us an outcome of nearly 2284 patent documents, out of which only 174 were found relevant. These doc uments were read by us and we coded and categorized each of these docum ents under three categories: 1. Construction 2. Optimization; and 3. Delivery Method Although the emphasis was on the title, the abstr act, the specifications and the claims, we searched the claims more thor oughly to look for SIV/HIV, prime boost and adjuvants in the claims. Each stack of patents was initially c oded by the student Team members. These were subsequently reviewed by the entire Team and Dr. Kowalski and categorized according to the final categories mentioned above. The documents were coded according to their relevancy and a Master Sheet was prepared simultaneously containi ng all the information on each of these patent documents. At the end of the Search Round I, the number relevant patent documents on the Master Spread Sheet had been reduced to a more manageable number. Search round II was carried out to round up the search in Sear ch round I in order to locate any relevant patent which might have been mi ssed in the first round. This search was mainly carried out in the Delphion data base using Derwent World Patent Index (DWPI) Patent Database and US & EP applications and patents, WI PO PCT publications by employing the keywords Vaccine, HIV, DNA polynucleotide to locate the top 21 assignees which are listed in Table 1. Further, the keywords HIV, vaccine were used to locate the top 3 classe s of patents which came out to be B04, S03 and D16. These classes were then used with the keywords HIV, vaccine, DNA, polynucleotide to search for patent docume nts. Other searches were carried out using keywords like ELISPOT, DNA Va ccine, HIV, human immune virus, Vaccine, Susan, Chiron, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, DNA Polynucleot ide, AIDS, etc. in classes 530 and 536, B04, D16, C06 and 424/188.1. The second round resulted in 463 patent documents out of which 209 were relevant. These 209 were then first coded by us individually and th en together with Dr. Kowalski. The final results were inserted in the Master Spread Sheet. Having completed an exhaustive search utili zing all the possible approaches, we then focused our attention to Genome Quest. Because the GenomeQuest searches were not premised on keywords but on native DNA sequences of Gag, Pol, Env and Nef genes the coding scheme was based on homology. The patent documents were search based on 65% to 80% and above homology of the DNA sequences of the four gene s. These searches were further narrowed down by using keywords along with the sequences, such as, HIV, DNA Vaccine and Vaccine, in various different search strings. The patent documents located in this search round again were first coded by each of the team members individu ally and then together as a team with Dr. Kowalski. In the end of this Search Round III, we were able to add 98 relevant patent documents to the Master Spread Sheet out of the 513 hits. Round IV, was carried out on IPVision, Inc. the access and password to which were granted by Joseph G. Hadzima, using keywords DNA and vaccine, and then further searches were carried out in Delphion with Researchers listed on Na tional Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website as inventors, HIV, v accine, while searching for French researchers, Italian researches, UC Davis Researchers, NIH researchers, Harvard researchers, US 3 6 researchers, Dutch researchers, etc. This r ound resulted in 163 patent s out of which 23 were relevant. These were coded and then put into the Master Spread Sheet. Finally all the searching and coding ended on April 24, 2008 with the compilation of a final Master Spread Sheet. 5.B.

Patent Search Results Spreadsheet Summary 5.C.1. Categorization Summary Construction, optimization and delivery mechanism are the major three landscape tiers selected to subcategorize the HIV DNA Vaccine patents/applications found in this project. Construction relates to work ing with DNA elements constituting DNA vaccines. Included under this tier are inventions directed to design of DNA backbones, selecti on elements, HIV genes, leader sequence, secretary signals and promoters. Under construction, wherever SIV genomes are empl oyed instead of and/or in addition to HIV's, it is indicated on a separate colu mn as Y (Yes) or N (No). Optimization relates to working with DNA vaccin es to optimize their efficacy as a vaccine. Included in this tier are inven tions related to codon optimizati on of genes utilized in the DNA vaccine. Adjuvants under optimization, relate to substances utilized to potentiate or increase the vaccine efficiency, and may take a form of a gene constituting part of the DNA structure of a DNA vaccine (molecular adjuvant, such as a cytokine ge ne incorporated into a plasmid) or a form of protein/peptide or other chemi cal forms which are usually combined later with a DNA vaccine. 5 4 Delivery mechanism relates to the administrati on of DNA vaccines to hosts or vaccination strategy such as prime boost. Included in this ti er are inventions specifi cally related to deliver DNA vaccines to hosts through various methods su ch as gene gun, electroporation and lipids. Wherever, DNA vaccines are part of prime boos t strategy (DNA vaccination followed by other methods of vaccination, or vice versa), the corresponding claims are indicated. 5.C.2.

Expansion of HBV-specific memory CTL pr imed by dual HIV/HBV genetic immunization SHIV primary infection rhesus Grand R Rivi\u00e8re Y . We have previously shown the induction of humor al and cytotoxic respon ses specific for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens, following genetic immunization of rhesus macaques with a plasmid encoding both the third va riable domain of the HIV-1 external envelope glycoprotein and the pse udo-viral particle of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as presenting molecule s. The DNA-immunized primates and two control animals were then challenged with a chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). They were all infected. Significant s of SHIV specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) were detected early in peripheral blood. But, in all DNA-immunized macaques, HBV envelope specific CTLp were detected during the primary infection, and they were correlated with the peak of SHIV viremia. Furthermore, HBV or SH IV specific cytotoxicity corresponded in part to CD8(+) T cells presenting a memory phenotype. Several mechanisms could account for this cellular response. But our results suggest that an expansion of memory cy totoxic CD8(+) cells, not restricted to SHIV specific effectors, coul d occur in peripheral blood during SHIV primary infection. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11257382?dopt=abstract 2.

Verrier B , suggests that a CD8-mediated cy totoxic T-cell response against the regulatory proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV ) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) may control infection after pathogeni c virus challenge. Here, we eval uated whether vaccination with Tat or Tat and Rev could signi ficantly reduce viral load in nonhuman primates. Rhesus macaques were primed with Semliki forest Vi rus (SFV) expressing HIV-1 tat (SFV-tat) and HIV-1 rev (SFV-rev) and boosted with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing tat and rev. A second group of monkey was primed with SFV-tat only and boosted with MVA-tat. A third group received a tat and rev DNA/MVA prim e-boost vaccine regimen. Monitoring of anti- Tat and anti-Rev antibody responses or antige n-specific IFN-gamma production, as measured by enzyme-linked immunospot assays revealed no clear differences between the three groups. These 123 results suggest that prim ing with either DNA or SFV seemed to be equivalent, but the additive or synergistic effect of a rev vaccine could not be clearly established. The animals were challenged by the rectal route 9 weeks after the last booster immunization, using 10 MID(50) of a SHIV- BX08 stock. Postchallenge follow-up of the monkey s included testing seroconversion to Gag and Env antigens, measuring virus infectivity in PBMC by cocultivation with noninfected human cells, and monitoring of plasma viral load. None of the animals was protected from infection as assessed by PCR, but peak viremia was reduced more than 200-fold compared to sham controls in one third (6/18) of vaccina ted macaques, whatever the vaccine regimen they received. Interestingly, among these six protected animal s four did not seroconvert. Altogether, these results clearly indicated that the addition of early HIV proteins like Tat and Rev in a multicomponent preventive vaccine including st ructural proteins like Env or Gag may be beneficial in preventive vaccinal strategies. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396607?dopt=abstract 3.

Specificity and effect on apoptosis of Tat antibodi es from vaccinated and have demonstrated that acti vely secreted Tat protein plays an important functional role in human immunodeficiency viru s-1 (HIV-1) infection an d that Tat antibodies might interfere with disease progression by blocki ng the protein extracellularly. In this context we have studied the recognition of several Tat mu tants as well as various synthetic Tat fragments by anti-Tat monoclonal antibodie s and by IgG antibodies from a large collection of slow and fast-progressor infected indivi duals. We have also simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected maca ques with these Tat peptides. Important differences were found between long-term non-pr ogressors and fast-pro gressors, and between human and monkey sera in terms of antibody sp ecificity. Rabbits and macaques were immunised with several Tat peptides and we found that certain antibody subsets fr om immunised animals recognised the cognate protein Tat and had the ca pacity to inhibit Tat- induced apoptosis of T cells. Such antibodies might be important for cont rolling Tat-induced death in cells uninfected by HIV-1. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12804847?dopt=abstract ITALY RESEARCHERS 4.

Long-term protection against SH IV89.6P replication in HIV- 1 Tat vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys. with a biologically ac tive Tat protein or tat DNA contai ned infection with the highly pathogenic SHIV89.6P virus, prev enting CD4 T-cell decline and di sease onset. Here we show that protection was prolonged, since neither CD4 T-cell decline nor active virus replication was observed in all vaccinated animal s that controlled virus replic ation up to week 104 after the challenge. In contrast, virus persisted and repl icated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph nodes of infected animals, two of which died. Tat-specific antibody, CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were high and stable only in the anim als controlling the inf ection. In contrast, Gag- specific antibody production and CD4 and CD8 T- cell responses were consistently and persistently positive only in the monkeys that di d not control primary virus replication. These results indicate that vaccina tion with Tat protein or DNA i nduced long-term memory Tat- specific immune responses and controlled primar y infection at its early stages allowing a long- term containment of virus replica tion and spread in blood and tissues. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15308348?dopt=abstract UC DAVIS RESEARCHERS 5.

Thus, the da ta support the concept that plasmid DNA encoding an attenuated virus coul d be used instead live virus for vaccination. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14498984?dopt=abstract 125 NIH RESEARCHERS 6.

Protection against mucosal simian recent AIDS vaccine strategies have protected rhesus macaques against a pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)(89.6P) challenge, similar approaches have provided only modest, transi ent reductions in viral burden after challenge with virulent, pathogenic SIV, which is more representative of HIV infection of people. We show here that priming with replicating adenovirus recombinants encoding SIV env/rev, ga g, and/or nef genes, boosting SIV gp120 or an SIV polypeptide mimicking the CD4 of the envelope, protects rhesus macaques from intrarectal infection with the highly pathogenic SIV(mac251). Using trend analysis, significant re ductions in acute-phase and set point viremia were correlated with anti-gp120 antibody and ce llular immune responses, respectively. Within immunization groups exhibiting significant pr otection, a subset (39%) of macaques have exhibited either no viremia, cleared viremia, or controlled viremia at th e threshold of detection, now more than 40 weeks postchallenge. This combination prime-boost strategy, utilizing replication competent adenovirus, is a promising alternative for HIV vaccine development. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14963117?dopt=abstract HARVARD RESEARCHERS 7.

Recombinant poxvirus boosting of DNA-primed rhesus monkeys augments peak but NL . a consensus has emerged that an HIV v accine should elicit a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, the characteristics of an effective vaccine-induced T lymphocyte response remain unclear. We explored this issue in th e simian human immunodefi ciency virus/rhesus monkey model in the course of assessing the rela tive immunogenicity of vaccine regimens that included a cytokine-augmented plasmid DNA prim e and a boost with DNA or recombinant pox vectors. Recombinant vaccinia virus, recomb inant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), and recombinant fowlpox were comparable in their immunogenicity. Moreover, whereas the 126 magnitude of the peak vaccine-elicited T lympho cyte responses in the recombinant pox virus- boosted monkeys was substantially greater than that seen in the monkeys immunized with plasmid DNA alone, the magnitudes of recombin ant pox boosted CTL responses decayed rapidly and were comparable to those of the DNA-al one-vaccinated monkeys by the time of viral challenge. Consistent with these comparable me mory T cell responses, the clinical protection seen in all groups of experimentally vaccinate d monkeys was similar. This study, therefore, indicates that the steady-state memory, rather than the peak effector vaccine-elicited T lymphocyte responses, may be the critical immune correlate of protectio n for a CTL-based HIV vaccine. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15258286?dopt=abstract 8.

We have elicited immune responses in rhesus monkeys utilizing DNA vaccines augm ented by the administration of IL-2/Ig, a fusion protein consisting of interleuki n-2 and the Fc portion of IgG2. These vaccine-elicited immune responses did not prevent infection followi ng a high-dose intravenous challenge with SHIV(89.6P) but did control viremia to near ly undetectable levels and prevented immunodeficiency and clinical disease. In cont rast, control monkeys developed high levels of viremia and exhibited a rapid loss of CD4(+) T ce lls, significant clinical disease progression, and death in half of the animals by day 140 follo wing challenge. Vaccine approaches that elicit immune responses capable of reducing plasma vira l loads, but not capable of inducing sterilizing immunity, may still provide substantial clinical benefits. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11595290?dopt=abstract 9.

Increasing evidence suggests th at the generation of cytotoxi c T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses specific for a diversity of viral epitopes will be needed for an effective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine. Here, we determin e the frequencies of CTL responses specific for 127 the simian immunodeficiency virus monkeys. The p11C-specific CTL response was high frequency and dominant and the p41A-specific CTL response was low frequency and subdominant in bo th SHIV-infected monkeys and in monkeys vaccinated with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara vectors expressing these viral antigens. Interestingly, we found that plasmid DNA vacci nation led to high-fre quency CTL responses specific for both of these epitopes. These data demonstrate that plasmi d DNA may be useful in eliciting a broad CTL response against multiple epitopes. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11160750?dopt=abstract 10.

In the pr esent studies, cytokine production by virus-specific CTL was assessed in the rh esus monkey model for AIDS to determine its contribution to the functional impairment of CTL. CTL from monkeys infected with nonpathogenic isolates of simian and simian- human immunodeficiency virus expressed high levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2 after in vitro exposure to a nonspecific mitogen or the optimal peptide representing a dominant vi rus-specific CTL epitope. However, similarly performed studies assessing these capabilities in CTL from monkeys inf ected with pathogenic immunodeficiency virus isolates demonstrated a significant dysfunction in the ability of the CTL to produce IL-2 and TNF-alpha. Importantly, CTL from vaccinated monkeys that effectively controlled the replic ation of a highly pathogenic simian-h uman immunodeficiency virus isolate following challenge demonstrated a preserved capacity to produce these cytokines. These experiments suggest that defects in cytokine production may contribute to CTL dysfunction in chronic HIV or SIV infection. Moreover, an AI DS vaccine that confers protection against clinical disease evolution in this experimental model also preserves th e functional capacity of these CTL to produce both IL-2 and TNF-alpha. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11751978?dopt=abstract EMORY RESEARCHERS 11.

Studies in macaques on cross-clade T cell res ponses elicited by a DNA/MVA AIDS vaccine, better conservation of CD8 than CD4 T cell responses. 128 , Robinson HL . One of the unknowns faced by an HIV/AIDS vaccine is the ability of a single clade vaccine to protect against the multiple gene tic subtypes and recombinant fo rms of HIV-1 present in the current pandemic. Here, we use a macaque mode l to investigate the ability of our clade B vaccine that consists of DNA priming and modi fied vaccinia Ankara (M VA) virus boosting to elicit T cell responses that rec ognize an A/G recombinant of HIV- 1. To test for cross-reactive T cells, intracellular cytokine stai ning was conducted using five pools of Gag and six pools of Env peptides representing B or A/G sequences. Studies using the pep tide pools revealed essentially complete conservation of the CD8 response but only approximately 50% conservation of the CD4 response. Thus, the ability of an HIV vaccine for one clade to protect against other clades may be more limited by the ability to provide CD 4 T cell help than the ability to elicit CD8 effector functions. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15725752?dopt=abstract 12.

Recently we demonstrated the control of a mu cosal challenge with a pathogenic chimera of simian and human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-89.6P) by priming with a Gag-Pol-Env- expressing DNA and boosting with a Gag-Pol-Env-expressing re combinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (DNA/MVA) vaccine. Here we evaluate the ability of the MVA component of this vaccine to serve as both a prime and a boost for an AIDS vaccine. The same immunization schedule, MVA dose, and challe nge conditions were used as in the prior DNA/MVA vaccine trial. Compared to the DNA/MVA vaccine, the MVA-only vaccine raised less than 1/10 the number of vaccine-specific T cells but 10-fo ld-higher titers of binding antibody for Env. Postchallenge, the animals vaccinated with MVA alone increased their CD8 cell numbers to levels that were similar to those seen in DNA/MVA-vaccinated animals. However, they underwent a slower emergence and contraction of antiviral CD8 T cells and were slower to generate neutralizing antibodies than the DNA/ MVA-vaccinated animals. Despite this, by 5 weeks postchallenge, the MVA-only-vaccinated an imals had achieved as good control of the viral infection as the DNA/MVA group, a situation that has held up to the present time in the trial (48 weeks postchallenge). Thus, MVA v accines, as well as DNA/MVA vaccines, merit further evaluation for their ability to control the current AIDS pandemic. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12097576?dopt=abstract 129 13.

Multiprotein HIV type 1 clade simian/human virus (SHIV) vaccine consisting of priming with a Gag-Pol-Env-expressing DNA and boosting wi th a Gag-Pol-Env-expressing recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (rMVA) has successfully controlled a virulent SHIV challenge in a macaque model. In this, and th e accompanying paper, we report on the construc tion and testing of a Gag-Pol-Env DNA/MVA vaccine for HIV-1/AIDS. The DNA vaccine, pGA2/JS2, expresses aggregates of Gag proteins and includ es safety mutations that render it integration, reverse transcription, and packaging defective. The rMVA vaccine, MVA/HIV 48, is integration and reverse transcription defec tive and has a truncated Env to enhance expression on the plasma membrane. In a study in rhesus macaques, priming with pGA2/JS2 and boosting with MVA/HIV 48 raised high frequencies of T cells for Gag a nd Env and lower frequencies of T cells for PR, RT, and Tat. Stimulations with five peptid e pools for Gag and seve n peptide pools for Env revealed epitopes for cellular immune respons es throughout Gag and Env. On average, CD4 T cells from the vaccinated animals recognized 7.1 peptide pools and CD8 T cells, 3.2 peptide pools. Both the height and the breadth of the elicited cellular response provide hope that this multiprotein DNA/MVA vaccine will successfully control clade B isolates of HIV-1, as well as contribute to the control of other clades and recombin ant forms of HIV-1/AIDS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15242543?dopt=abstract 14.

DNA/MVA vaccine for HIV type 1: effects of codon-optimiza tion and the expression of aggregates or virus-like particles on the immunoge nicity of the DNA prime Smith JM RR , , HL . Recently, a vaccine consisting of DNA priming followed by boosting with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) has provided long-term protecti on of rhesus macaques against a virulent challenge with a chimera of simian and huma n immunodeficiency viruses. Here, we report studies on the development of the DNA compone nt for a DNA/MVA HIV vaccine for humans. Specifically, we assess the ability of a codon-optimized Gag-e xpressing DNA and two noncodon-optimized Gag-Pol-Env-expressing DNAs to the MVA booster dose. The codon-optimized DNA expressed virus-like part icles (VLPs), whereas one of the noncodon- optimized DNAs expressed VLPs and the other e xpressed aggregates of HIV proteins. The MVA boost expressed Gag-Pol and Env and produced VLPs. Immunogenicity studies in macaques used one intramuscular prime with 600 microg of DNA and two intramuscular boosts with 1 x 10(8) pfu of MVA at weeks 8 and 30. Th e codon-optimized and noncodon-optimized DNAs 130 proved similar in their ability to prime anti-Gag T cell re sponses. The aggregate and VLP- expressing Gag-Pol-Env DNAs also showed no significant differences in their ability to prime anti-Env Ab responses. The second MVA booster dose did not increase the peak CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, but increased anti-Env Ab tite rs by 40- to 90-fold. MVA-only immunizations elicited 10-100 times lower frequenc ies of T cells and 2-4 lower ti ters of anti-Env Ab than the Gag-Pol-Env DNA/MVA immunizations. Based on the breadth of the T cell response and a trend toward higher titers of anti- Env Ab, we are moving forward w ith human trials of the noncodon- optimized VLP-expressing DNA. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650426?dopt=abstract SEATTLE RESEARCHERS 15.

Antibody responses elicited in macaques immunized with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) SF162-derived gp140 envelope immunogens : comparison with those elicited during homologous simian/human immunodeficiency virus SHIVSF162P4 and heterologous HIV-1 infection. Derby NR Kraft Z , Kan immunized with soluble human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Env gp140 proteins derived from the R5-tropic HIV-1 SF162 virus were analyzed and compared to the broadly reactive neutra lizing antibody responses elicited during chronic infecti on a macaque with a simian (SF162P4), and humans infected with g p140 immunogens were evaluated: SF162gp140, (lacking the crown of the V2 loop) , DeltaV3gp140 (lacking the crown of the V3 loop), and DeltaV2DeltaV3gp140 (l acking both the V2 and V3 loop crowns). SF162gp140 and DeltaV2gp140 have been previously evaluated by our group in a pilot study, but here, a more comprehensive analysis of their immunoge nic properties was performed. All four gp140 immunogens elicited stronger anti-gp120 th an anti-gp41 antibodies and potent homologous neutralizing antibodies (NAb s) that primarily targeted the fi rst hypervariable region (V1 loop) of gp120, although SF162gp140 also elicited anti-V3 NAb s. Heterologous NAbs were elicited by SF162gp140 and DeltaV2gp140 but were weak in pot ency and narrow in specificity. No heterologous NAbs were elicited by Delta V3gp140 or DeltaV2DeltaV3gp140. In contrast, the SHIV(SF162P4)-infected macaque and HIV-infect humans generated similar titers gp120 and anti-gp41 antibodies and NAbs of significan t breadth against primary HIV-1 isolates, which did not target the V1 loop. The differe nce in V1 loop immunogenicity between soluble gp140 and virion-associated gp160 E nv proteins derived from SF 162 may be the basis for the observed difference in the breadth of neutralization in sera fr om the immunized and infected animals studied here. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16912322?dopt=abstract 131 16.

Viral evolution in macaques coinfected with CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic SHIVs in of anti neutralizing antibodies and the CXCR4-tropic heterologous mo ck-immunized and immunized animals became dually infected. Prior immunization preferenti ally reduced the vira l replication of the homologous virus during primary infection but th e relative replication of the two coinfecting viruses during chronic infection was unaffected by prior immunization, despit e the fact that five of six immunized animals maintained a significan tly lower overall viral replication that the control animals. Neutralizing antibodies part icipated in controlling the replication of SHIV(SF162P4), but not that of SHIV(SF33A). Dual infection resulted in the emergence and predominance within the circulating CCR5 virus pool , of a variant with a distinct neutralization phenotype. The signature of this variant was th e presence of three amino acid changes in gp120, two of which were located in the receptor a nd coreceptor binding site s. Also, a significant fraction of the viruses circul ating in the blood, as early as two weeks post-infection, was recombinants and prior immunization did not prev ent their emergence. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic interaction of CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic HI V isolates that are potentially relevant in better unders tanding HIV-mediated pathogenesis. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16920175?dopt=abstract NETHERLAND RESEARCHERS 17. generated by nucleic acid-, MF59-, and ISCOM-formulated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 kinetics imm in 16 mature outbred rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) within a 10-month period by th ree different human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine strategies were compar ed. Immune responses to monomeric recombinant gp120SF2 (rgp120) when the protein was expresse d in vivo by DNA immunization or when it was delivered as a subunit protein vaccine form ulated either with the MF59 adjuvant or by incorporation into immune-stimulating complexe s (ISCOMs) were compared. Virus-neutralizing antibodies (NA) against si milar titers in the two rgp120SF2 protein-132 immunized groups, but the responses showed differ ent kinetics, while NA were delayed and their levels were low in the DNA-immunized anim als. Antigen-specific gamma interferon (IFN- gamma) T-helper (type 1-like) responses were detected in the DNA-immunized group, but only after the fourth immunization, and the r gp120/MF59 group generated both IFN-gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4) (type 2-li ke) responses that appeared after the third immunization. In contrast, rgp120/ISCOM-immunized animals rapi dly developed marked IL-2, IFN-gamma (type 1-like), and IL-4 responses that peaked after the s econd immunization. To determine which type of immune responses correlated with protecti on from infection, all animals were challenged intravenously with 50 50% infectiv e doses of a rhesus cell-propagat ed, in stock of a chimeric simian immunodeficiency virus-HIVS F13 construct. Protection was observed in the two groups receiving the rgp120 subunit vaccines. Ha lf of the animals in the ISCOM group were completely protected from infection. In other subunit vaccinees there was evidence by multiple assays that virus detected at 2 weeks postchallenge was effectiv ely cleared. Early induction of potent type 1- as well as type 2-like T-helper responses indu ced the most-effective immunity. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10074183?dopt=abstract 18.

In two previous studies, we have demons trated the successful protection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-vaccina ted rhesus macaques from challenge with SHIV(SF13) with envelop immunogens derived fro m the closely related HIV-1(SF2) strain. Here we report on two follow-up studies in which we aimed to broaden immuni ty in order to elicit protection from a more diverse heterologous challenge with SHIV(SF33). In the first study, animals were boosted once with HIV-1(SF33) V2 a nd V3 peptides that were cross-linked to influenza immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) . In the second study, monkeys were boosted twice at 12-week intervals, using a heterologous recombinan t gp120 derived from HIV-1(SF33) that was either incorporated into ISCOMs or mi xed with the MF59 adjuvant . In both studies, the animals were challenged with 50 monkey infectious doses of SHIV(SF33) 4 weeks after the final boost. All controls became read ily infected with the heterolo gous challenge virus SHIV(SF33). Neither boosting with heterologous SF33 peptides or gp120 afforded protection from infection to SF2-vaccinated animals that had previously resi sted SHIV(SF13) challenge. These results demonstrate the importance of developing vaccine st rategies that are capab le of generating broad immune responses early in the immunization prot ocol. Furthermore, these findings may illustrate the potential pitfalls of early antigenic sin. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10593489?dopt=abstract 19.

The pres ent work was undertaken to determine whether immunization with multiple antigens influen ced individual Th responses and increased protection relative to a single antigen. Rhesus macaques were primed with DNA and boosted (immune-stimulating complex-form ulated protein) with a co mbination of regulatory and structural antigens (Tat-Env-Gag) or with Tat alone. Immunization with combined antigens reduced the magnitude of the responses to Ta t compared to the singl e-antigen immunization. Interestingly, the Th immune responses to the individual antigens were noticeably different. To determine whether the qualitative differences in vaccine-induced Th responses correlated with vaccine efficacy, animals were challenged intrav enously with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (strain SHIV(89.6p)) 2 months following th e final immunization. Animals that developed combined Th1- and Th2-like responses to Gag and Th2 dominant Env-specific responses were protected from disease progr ession. Interestingly, one animal th at was completely protected from infection had the strongest IFN-gamma and interle ukin-2 (IL-2) responses pr ior to challenge, in addition to very strong IL-4 responses to Gag an d Env. In contrast, animals with only a marked vaccine-induced Tat-specific Th2 response (no IF N-gamma) were not protected from infection or disease. These data support the rationale that effective HIV vacci ne-induced immunity requires a combination of potent Th1- and Th2-like responses best directed to multiple antigens. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15016855?dopt=abstract 134 APPENDIX B: Description of Patent Databases Used in this Report70 Database Name General Information USPTO Patents issued from 1790 through 19 75 are searchable only by patent number, issue date, and curre nt U.S. classifications.

Classifications are typically expressed as \"482/1\". The first number, 482, represents the class of invention. The number following the slash is the subc lass of invention wi thin the class. o A Subclass definition is a complete description of the subclass. o The Subclass Definition can incorporate an explanation of the class, a glossary, search notes, references to subclasses w ithin the class, and references to other classes and subclasses. There are about 450 Classes of invention and about 150,000 subclasses of invention in the USPC. Classes and subclasses have titles which pr ovide a short description of the class or subclass. Classes and subclasses also have definitions which provide a more detailed explanation. Many Classes and subclasses have explicitly defined relationships to one another. Subclasses contain patents. In a sense, classes also cont ain patents but for classificati on purposes patents are always classified at the subclass level. That one or more classificati ons (i.e., class/subclass desi gnations) are assigned to each granted patent and each published application. A patent classification also represents a sear chable collection of patents grouped together according to similarly claimed subject matter. A classification is used both as a tool for finding patents (patentability searches), and for assisting in the assignment of patent applica tions to examiners for examination purposes. Classification Codes app licable for this report Class 424: Drug, Bio-Affecting and Body Treating Compositions o Class 424/188.1: Immunodeficiency Virus (e.g. HIV, etc) o Class 424/208.1: Immunodeficiency Virus (e.g. HIV, etc) Class 435: Chemistry- Molecu lar Biology and Microbiology o Class 435/320.1: Vector, Per Se (e.g., Pl asmid, Hybrid Plasmid, Cosmid, Viral Vector, Bacteriophage Vector, Bacteriophage Vector, etc.) Class 536: Organic Compounds- Part of the Class 532-570 Series Class 530: Chemistry: Natural Resins or Deri vatives; Peptides or Reaction APPENDIX D: Derwent Classifications72 Description of Derwent Patent Classifications - Categorizes patent documents using a simple classification system for all technologies; consistently applied to all patents by Thom son Scientific subject experts, enabling effective and precise searching in a particular area of technology - International Patent Classifi cation (IPC) is an internati onally recognized classification system, which is controlled by the World In tellectual Property Orga nization (WIPO) and assigned to patent docume nts by Patent Offices. - Where possible we indicated next to the Class the equivalent IPC in an abbreviated form (e.g. A47, F23-5). o However, this should only be taken as a guide, since there are areas where the DWPI o Classes are assigned intellectually by our subject experts, and no strict correspondence is claimed. Classification Codes app licable for this report - Class B04: Natural products and polymers. Including testi ng of body fluids (other than blood typing or cell counting), pharmaceu ticals or veterinary compounds of unknown structure, testing of microorganisms for pathogenicity, testing of chemicals for mutagenicity or human toxicity and ferm entative production of DNA or RNA.

The non-infectious particles are obtained by introducing a number of inactivating mutations into a native viral genome. These mutations are designed so as to minimize the probability of genetic reversion to an infectious virus, while retaining the basic protein content and immunogenic properties of a wild-type virion. The altered viral genome expresses proteins that can assemble into non- infectious particles which contain immunogenic components of the virus, but which are unable to infect cells. The preferred mutations are introduced in at least one amino acid position of the nucleocapsid (NC) protein in combination with at least one other mutation in an amino acid position of the reverse transcriptase (RT) protein or the In protein. In one embodiment, the mutations to the native HIV genome may also be made in at least one amino acid position of the NC protein, at least one position in the RT protein, and at least one position in the integrase ( In) protein. In another embodiment, the mutations to the native HIV genome may be introduced in clusters, where two or more mutations are made in the NC protein, the RT protein, the In protein, or any combinations thereof.

VACCINE [71] Applicant: INFECTIOUS DISEASES FOUNDATION [75] attenuated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) whose replication is not constitutive but is instead conditionally regulated (such that rounds of reverse transcription with accompanying potential for error are strictly limited) might yield a paradigm that minimizes evolution to virulence and facilitate vaccine development. We have broached the concept of conditional control of HIV-1 through gain-of-function. Here, we describe the design of constitutively inactive HIV-1 genomes (HIV-DoxT and HIV-DoxSp) which can be conditionally resuscitated to an active state by tetracycline or related analogues. The HIV-DoxT construct comprises an inactivating mutation engineered into TAR, thereby rendering the virus non- responsive to Tat, a 302-bp DNA fragment (TetopT) which contains the tet-operator ligated into a position upstream of the HIV TATAA box, in both the 5' and 3' LTRs, and a reverse tetracycline-controlled activator (RTTA) coding sequence in place of the nef coding region. The HIV-DoxSp construct contains three additional Sp1 sites in the TetopT promoter upstream of the TATAA box thereby generating the promoter TetopSp. Genotypically, HIVDoxT is tat(+)tar(-)nef(-)Sp1(-) and HIVDoxSp is tat(+)tar(-)nef(-)Sp1(+). Since both genomes are genetically tar(-), they would ordinarily be expected to be wholly defective in producing viral proteins and/or particles. However, following transfection into an appropriate cell target, both proviruses, in a doxycycline-dependent fashion, capably released Gag and RT from cells. In the absence of doxycycline, no replication competent virus could be recovered.

In addition, enhancing antibodies may negatively influence disease progression. Due to the early appearence in infection and its particulate nature, the virus core protein p55-GAG seems to be a promising vaccine candidate. p55-core expression was assayed by recombinant vaccinia and baculo viruses. Shedding of 90-110 nm core particles into culture medium was observed in both expression systems and proven by ultrathin-section electron microscopy and sedimentation analysis. Addition of the protease coding sequence resulted in an efficient processing of the p55-precursor molecule-in the Baculo-system only. Significant protease mediated processing of the GAG precursor in the Vaccinia-system was only achievable by addition of the entire POL coding sequence. In contrast to other retroviruses (MMLV), HIV-1 protease mediated processing is not dependent on the myristylation of p55-GAG. As protease mediated processing does not complete the maturation process of the p55-precursor particles, but, in contrast, inhibits particle formation, further investigations focused on the application of premature p55-GAG-particles. To extend their immunological spectrum, a consensus sequence of the HIV-major neutralizing epitope V3 of gp120, designed in our lab, was inserted into different regions of the p55 carrier molecule. The expression of the p55/V3 chimeric proteins in E. coli and the Vaccinia expression system was proven by Western blot analysis using (i) monoclonal antibodies directed to p55 and the inserted V3 SIV HIV-3 retrovirus strains comprising in their nucleic acid sequence a contiguous R region and an U3 region sequence showing a homology of more than 70% with the nucleic acid sequence as represented in SEQ ID NO 3, and provided that said HIV-3 retrovirus strains have at least one nucleotide difference in their sequence compared to the HIV-3 (ANT 70) retrovirus strain deposited under ECACC N\u00b0 V88060301.
