EXECUTIVE SUMMARY7 Executive Summary 1. The Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, vide letter no. - D-15020/46/2016- RD dated 15th June, 2016 constituted a committee to review the functioning of Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and peripheral institutes functioning under it. The Committee was chaired by Dr. V.M. Katoch, Ex Secretary, DHR and DG, ICMR, NASI -ICMR Ch air on Public Health Research and the other members were Prof. Y.K. Gupta, Head of Pharmacology Pune, Dr. Atmanand , Dean , Consulting and Advancement Management Development Institute (MDI), Gurgaon, Dr. D.C. Katoch , Adviser (Ay.), Ministry New Delhi and Prof. Vd. K.S. Dhiman , Director General, CCRAS, New Delhi (Member Secretary). Terms of Reference of the Committee were: a) To review the overall research work and major achievements/ outcomes of CCRAS and its units in qualitative and quantitative terms; b) To visit at least one best- claimed unit each of Clinical Research, Preclinical Studies, Drug Research, Literary Research and Tribal Health Research for assessment of functionality, infrastructural facilities and manpower requirements; c) To provide specific inputs, vision, direction and broad roadmap for development of future research program of CCRAS in prioritized areas of health & medicine; d) To identify and recommend potential aspects/priorities of Ayurvedic research management and development of advance r esearch interventions on the leads available with CCRAS for outcomes in national interest; e) To recommend institutions, networks and broad research topics for collaborative and interdisciplinary research; f) To identify, indicate and recommend priority areas f or capacity building of the Council's institutes and training of scientists at various levels and g) To indicate prevailing gaps and make suggestions for any specific reforms/remedial measures in the Council's structure and delegation of powers to the peripheral units that may facilitate smooth functioning and conduct of research activities. The Committee was also authorized to seek inputs from other experts. 2. The Committee held 11 meetings to deliberate with the stakeholders by visiting CCRAS institutions, h ad interaction with Chairperson and Members of Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) , and Chairpersons and Members of 4 Scientific Advisory Groups (SAGs) at CCRAS headquarters . 3. The Committee Hyderabad, CSMRADDI Chenn Kolkata. Review meetings, In -charges of nearby located CCRAS institutions were also called for interaction and presentation. 8 4. The Committee had exhaustive interaction with In-charges, scientists, technical and administrative staff of 25 out of 30 CCRAS institutions during these visits and meetings at Headquarters. 5. All heads (Director/In -charge) of the institutions were provided a specific proforma to provide the details of activities & achievements of their respective institutions. These documents were perused by the Chairpersons & Members and deliberated upon in the Review meetings. The clarifications were also sought by the Committee wherever required. All the institutions complied & their documents are on record. 6. The Committee perused in detail the Review Committee report of Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS) under the chairmanship of Dr. Nitya Anand which was submitted in the year 2007. The Committee evaluate d/examined to what extent the recommendations of this Committee have been adopted by the Council for implementation in terms of development of infrastructure, human resource, research goals and outcomes. The Committee also assessed what have been the major achievements of the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) institutions and the Council as a whole during last 10 years (i.e. after submission of Dr. Nitya Anand Committee report) The Committee felt that CCRAS has seriously attempted t o implement the recommendations of Dr. Nitya Anand Committee. However, due to highly deficient manpower, lack of requisite infrastructure and the changing mandates of the institutes, CCRAS could not implement its recommendations completely. The Committee a lso examined the vision, direction and also the roadmap for development of future research program me of CCRAS in prioritized areas of health and medicine considering the 11 th and 12th Five Year Plans and other directives issued by the Ministry of AYUSH fro m time to time. After thorough review, the Committee identified prevailing gaps and suggested for reforms/remedial measures in the Council's structure and delegation of powers to the peripheral units that may facilitate smooth functioning and conduct of re search activities. Though the research output is satisfactory with the background of prevailing infrastructure, manpower , etc. t he CCRAS needs to attract competent research scientists with outstanding research profile. Considering this , major structural changes in recruitment and promotion policy are highly essential. Further, the institutes are to be strengthened with infrastructure and manpower (permanent recruitment or contractual) to meet the need of NABH/NABL. Vision and Mission: The Committee noted that CCRAS has developed a Vision and Mission document in 2016. Further, this has been revised and updated in January, 2017. Accordingly, the CCRAS is committed to a short term, midterm and long term agenda till the year 2030. The C ommittee finds this document comprehensive and focused. 9 Overview of CCRAS The Committee noted the following: i. In 2007 -2008, there were 38 institutes/centres/units under Central Council for Research in Ayurveda & Siddha. In the year 2009, four institutes were me rged with other CCRAS institutions due to administrative reasons thus total number of institutions were reduced to 34. ii. Later in the year 2011, the Siddha Council was separated from CCRAS and it was renamed as Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences. In this process, four institutions were shifted to Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS). Thus, as on date, the total number of CCRAS institutions is 30 excluding Headquarters. iii. The CCRAS is currently headed by a Director General who admi nistratively controls 30 institutions across the country and also the Headquarters. Out of them, only 05 institutions are headed by Director, whereas 14 are headed by Assistant Director In - charge and remaining 11 by Research Officer In -charge. iv. The Committe e noted that there had been frequent change in nomenclature and mandate of CCRAS institutions, which probably has affected the efficiency of CCRAS system. v. The CCRAS has a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and 4 Scientific Advisory Groups viz. (i) Clinical research, (ii) Drug development, (ii i) Literature research, and (iv) Basic sciences and fundamental research at headquarters. In many of the CCRAS institutions, Scientific Advisory Committees have not been formed and in majority they are not functioning. vi. The current pattern of centralization is causing huge burden to CCRAS headquarters for monitoring of both administrative/financial and technical aspects. The timely monitoring which is required for quality research output is being hampered due to lack of cl ose monitoring by CCRAS Headquarters attributed to inadequate manpower which is over burdened with different other activities. vii. Out of the 30 CCRAS institutions, 20 are housed in their own buildings whereas 10 are housed in rented buildings/ space. Of these 10, land has been procured for 4 and construction has been started in 3 institutes. This may take about 3 years for completion and occupation. One institution viz. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Nutritional Disorders at Mandi (HP) is also having a small space of approximately 1000 sq.ft . owned by Gandhi Bhavan Trust, Mandi which is charging zero rent. At Mumbai for Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer (CARIC), 2.78 acres of land at Bhandup (East) is in advanced stage of procurement from Ministry of Urban Development, Central Public Works D epartment, Govt. of India. The I nstitute is proposed to be developed as 'National Centre of Excellence in Ayurveda and Integrative Oncology' for academic and research purpose with total proposed staff strength of 492. viii. The Committee observed that in 2007- 08 the total allocation (Plan and Non -plan) was Rs. 56.9 cr. T his gradually increased to Rs. 134 c r. in 2014- 15. In 2015- 16, this 10 increased to Rs. 173 c r. The figure of funds utilized as provided by CCRAS indicates that the Council has been utilizing funds satisfactorily. ix. For CCRAS having 30 institutions with a total sanctioned staff strength of 1983 (428 sanctioned scientists strength, 29 non- technical Group A and B post s and 1526 sanctio ned posts for Group C), running scientific programmes and Intra Mural Research, this budget allocation appears to be grossly inadequate for growth, development and optimal scientific functioning. Recommendations: i. There i s an urgent need of structural c hanges in the CCRAS set -up for delivering Quality Research Output . The Committee recommends that 20 major institutes which are proposed t o be named as National/Central I nstitutes should be headed by Director; rest all should be headed at least by Assistant Director. He/she may be given adequate financial po wer and autonomy to conduct research on the focused mandate following norms of ICMR. However, policy issues and monitoring of these institutions should be under the control of Headquarters. ii. Rest of small units may be linked to a major nearby identified Central Research Institutes as per feasibility. Public health related research/ research oriented outreach activities may be taken by these institutions/units. iii. Each major Inst itute should have a functional Scientific Advisory Committee. Each Committee should have nominated members from CCRAS Headquarters These nominated members will act as a bridge between DG and Director s of Institutes. iv. The Institutes developed with a specifi c mandate should flourish with focused vision and mission for at least 20 years, so that the manpower and infrastructure developed can be optimally utilized with full expertise. v. A quantum jump of at least three times of the current budget allocation is recommended to meet the salary component of all filled positions, equipping/upgrading the labs, construction of already in principle agreed buildings with modern instrumentation and proportionally expanded scientific programs. Human Resource i. The Committee noted that in the sanctioned strength in Group A and Group B of all the institutions including Headquarters as on date is 457 (Group A 383 + Group B 74). Of this, only 196 positions were filled in as in Dec 2016. The CCRAS was working with only 42.8% strength which certainly affected the outcome. ii. The Committee appreciated the recent initiatives of the authority in filling 108 more vacant positions of Group A during 2016- 2017 which resulted in total 304 filled -in positions (66.5%) of Group A and Group B. iii. The situation is precarious with respect to Group C employee s in position. Only 38% (577/1526) were filled up till Dec 2016. Such deficiency in laboratory working strength may be serious handicap for optimum scientific output. This situation is compounded by wrongly classifying some of the para -medical positions with ministerial staff. 11 iv. The Committee observed that the action has already under way for revival of the lapsed post for Group B & C. v. The Committee noted that there are inadequate career p rogression opportunities and in-situ promotions under the existing system are pending for nearly four years which seriously affects the motivation of the scientists . vi. For Technical Group C posts, no career progression opportunities exist. vii. The Committee felt that critical mass of scientific, technical and administrative human resource is must for effective functioning of a unit/or an institution. In absence of this, the productivity of a potential high caliber scientist is greatly compromised with. viii. Most of the C CRAS institutions have nominal a dministrative posts with negligible chances of promotion. The Committee also n oted that even the mandatorily required financial and audit staffs do not exist. Moreover, because of inadequate staffing, even trivial financial and administrative decision s get unnecessarily delayed. ix. The Committee observed that there is no provision for recruitment of specialists for the assigned mandate of CCRAS institutions . x. The Committee noted that the CCRAS periodically conducts cap acity building workshops for human resource development in contemporary areas viz. research methodology, Good Clinical P ractices (GCP), Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), bio - statistics, drug development, drug st andardization, instrumentation and g ood cultivation practices. It was also noted that the CCRAS also impart s structured training and short -time course on Panchakarma. Recommendations: i. The C ommittee opined that for optimum output , all vacant positions should be filled on priority basis . The Committee recommends that immediate steps should be taken for correcting the classification, revival of post s and filling -up of vacant post s. A committee headed by DG, CCRAS may be empowered to take corrective actions. ii. The centers with less than 05 scientific and te chnical persons are not sustainable for meaningful scientific outcome. Unless they are meant for short -time and specific purpose, like collection of data, such units need immediate strengthening and empowerment. iii. The Committee recommends necessary changes i n the R ecruitment Rules of Direct or General and Scientific staff . For this purpose , the pattern of recruitment and promotion policy for scientists as followed in ICMR (with a feeder cadre of Scientist - B) with similar R ecruitment Rules and promotional avenues should be adopted. iv. Considering the mandate assigned to the institutes, the Committee felt that a t least additional 300 scientists from Ayurveda and 200 basic medical scientists are required to deliver the research output. Contractual part -time consultants from modern sciences and or adjunct scientists from collaborating national institutes / universities may be appointed under suitable arrangements whenever and wherever justifiably required. v. For the technical cadre, recruitment and promotion pol icy including pay matrix/structure of ICMR may be followed. 12 vi. The positions for administrative and financial staff may be created as per the Government norms. Even pooling of the senior positions among different Councils under Ministry of AYUSH may be consid ered for providing promotional avenues at higher level. vii. The Committee recommends that capacity building programs such as CME s should be strengthened for their scientists, technical and m inisterial staff. Further, CCRAS scientists should also participate in the CME's conducted by other organiza tions/Institutes. These programmes should focus on research planning , management and scientific writing. There is need to develop master trainers among CCRAS scientists and modules for interdisciplinary research. There is a need to identify a nodal centre for trainings in Ayurveda research. In - house expertise for Council's scientists should be enhanced. The frequency of organizing workshops, training s and seminars should be increased for propagation of Ayurveda. The Committee recommends that the CCRAS should maintain a comprehensive database of all the people undergone different workshops/trainings/courses , etc., frequently ascertain the needs and schedule events accordingly. The CCRAS should maintain and update el ectronic database of experts available throughout the country. viii. Emeritus Scientist Scheme may be evolved so that senior scholars from Ayurveda can be located at national institutes/ universities and scientists from modern science disciplines can be hosted a t Ayurveda institutes / universities. Present S tatus of Research Activities: i. The Committee noted that d uring the last 10 years (2007- December 2016) , the CCRAS continued its activities in the areas of Clinical Research, Medicin al Plant Research (Medico -ethno botanical Survey, Pharmacognosy and Cultivation), Drug Standardization, Pharmacological Research, Literary Research & Documentation, Tribal Health Care Programme, and health care services through out-patient department s (OPD s) and i n-patient departmen ts (IPDs), special clinics for geriatric health care. ii. Moreover, the CCRAS initiated other outreach activities viz. Swasthya Rakshan Programme, Ayurveda Mobile Health Care Programme under Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP) and integration of Ayurveda in Nat ional Programme for P revention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio- vascular Disease and Stroke (NPCDCS) and extension of Tribal Health Care Research Programme (THCRP) . Further, the CCRAS initiated the process of setting up of 20 Ayurvedic Health Centres in three North East States (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim) under North East Plan. iii. It is satisfying that institutions involved in clinical research have duly constituted Institutional Ethics Committees (IECs) and the institutions involved in a nimal 13 experimentation have duly constituted Institutional Animal Ethics Committees (IAECs) . iv. The Committee noted that CCRAS has also taken initiative to explore the feasibility of integration of Ayurveda with the conventional medical system through pilot projects on osteoarthritis (knee) in collaboration with Safdarju ng Hospital and on reproductive and c hild health care in collaboration with ICMR at PHC level in two districts of Himachal Pradesh. v. It was also noted that the CCRAS formulated a r esearch policy in 2015 to streamline research through intramural and collaborative mode s. The research projects undertaken during the last ten years are as under: Under clinical research, 65 intramural projects on 37 diseases / conditions and 6 collaborative projects were completed. Under the medicinal plant research, 657 m edico -ethno- botanical surveys were conducted in selected areas of 5 states. Besides this, 10 intramural research projects were completed . Analysis o f 480 single drugs and 300 compound formulations w as carried out and 2 i ntramural projects were completed under drug standardization. A total of 51 projects related to safety -toxicity/ pharmacological activity of Ayurvedic formulations were completed. Ten literary r esearch projects were completed. The C CRAS published 142 Books/Monographs/Select Research Papers/Proceedings. vi. AYUSH Research Portal : A web -based portal for research publications in AYUSH systems was launched in 2011which is successfully continued and the information is being updated periodically. vii. AYUSH Ph.D. fellowship programme : The Committee appreciated the efforts of the CCRAS in introducing AYUSH Ph.D. fellowship programme for creating high quality human resource for research. viii. Ayurgenomics : The Committee noted that the CCRAS has taken up projects on validation of assessment format for Prakriti which later on can be correlated with genetic approach. ix. The Committee appreciated that the CCRAS provided health care services through OPD / IPD to a pproximately 4,839,017 patients who received health benefits and generated valuable data on the usefulness of Ayurveda in wide spectrum of diseases for which people access Ayurvedic services. This provides a very useful interface with the people and inform ation necessary for developing guidelines as well as identifying priorities for research. x. It was observed that 1152 r esearch papers were published by the CCRAS scientists , out of which 513 (44.5%) research papers appeared in indexed journal s, 117 (10.1%) in AYUSH Research Portal and 522 (45.3%) in other publications including non- 14 indexed journals. The CCRAS has maintained a good level of publications which is reasonably significant with the meager number of available scientists. xi. It was also noted that the CCRAS signed 62 Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) with reputed institutes, organizations at national and international level s for collaboration in the field of academic , drug development and research, out of which 20 MoUs are operational at present. The status /functionality and outcome of all MoUs may be reviewed. xii. In the area of drug development, the CCRAS filed 18 pa tents, out of which 17 a re pending and technology has been transferred for 10 products. It is noteworthy that the Council has obtained more than Rs. 2 crores premia / royalty from patents and commercialization during the last two years. xiii. The Committee noted that the CCRAS has undertaken val idation of Ayurvedic terminology for international / WHO recognition, validation of diagnostic procedures under development of integrated research protocols, integrated clinical decision support system, etc. xiv. Under Gold en Triangle Partnership (GTP) programm e, SOPs for preparation, chemical characterization were prepared and safety/toxicity studies of eight Rasayogas (Herbo -mineral formulations) were carried o ut in collaboration with CSIR. In addition, several clinical trial protocols have been developed in p artnership with the ICMR. xv. The CCRAS also contributed to Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committee (APC) for development of standards of single drugs and compound Ayurvedic formulations. Besides , the CCRAS also contributed to TKDL in the matter of collection of published material on Ayurveda, compilation of formulations and generation of Traditional Knowledge Resource Classification (TKRC). xvi. The Committee also noted that large volume of data has been generated by the CCRAS scientists which is yet to be analyzed and p ublished in indexed and peer review Journals. xvii. The Committee is of the opinion that considering the staff available and other constraints, the CCRAS scientists and the system have been reasonably productive in most of the aspects which were highlighted by D r. Nitya Anand Committee and recommendations made by SAB / different SAGs as well as the task assigned to them by Government from time to time. However, the work related to modern biology could not be implemented to any visible extent and appears to be in the nascent stage only, mainly due to lack of trained human resource and networking. xviii. Institutions, networks and broad research projects for collaboration and interdisciplinary research : The Committee observed that the CCRAS has initiated few collaborative research project s of multidisciplinary nature. For instance, a new institute of c ancer research and treatment in collaboration with Tata Memorial Hospital Mumbai is an ambitious project. 15 Recommendations: i. The research should be focused on developing special validation methods for Ayurveda research based on the principles of Ayurveda taking into consideration the holistic approach and not thinking about drug development alone. ii. The Committee , while addressing para d and e of Terms of Reference, opined that the CCRAS should identify and focus on at least five areas where Ayurveda can be made part of public health of our country. Emphasis on Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) including Cancers, Stroke, Dementia / Alzheimer's, Cardio -vascular diseases, metabolic con ( PCOS ), mental health, Musculo- skeletal disorders, Reproductive Health and S kin Disorders may be laid down and executed as lon g-term strategy. iii. Chronic kidney failure, autoimmune diseases, hormonal disorde rs and vector borne diseases etc. are other potentially productive areas for research in Ayurveda. Cohort studies on multi drug resistant tubercul osis (MDRTB) and other mutually identified health conditions may be unde rtaken. In addition to chronic non- communicable diseases (NCDs) and other life style disorders, the CCRAS should also focus on viral diseases such as Chikungunya, Dengue etc. iv. For developing robus t and productive research programmes on the above, it is absolutely essential to have networks amon g the CCRAS institutions, with other Ayurvedic institutions, with institutions/Center o f Excellence in allopathy and other systems, University/ Departments as well as Central (AIIMS, ICMR, CSIR etc) and state institutions. v. The Committee recommends to evolve a formal structure to encourage interdisciplinary research through a network of national institutes and top universities and those of the CCRAS institutions. This will help in research capacity building and HRD of the CCRAS . vi. The Committee further r ecommends to create conducive environment to undertake interdisciplinary research on basic concepts and medicines of Ayurveda. For instance, efforts like Ayurvedic Biology, Ayurgenomics have already been undertaken through DST and CSIR, CCRAS needs to be a n active partner in these efforts. vii. The Committee recommends to bring more synergy among the CCRAS institutions and with the institutes of ICMR / DBT / DST / ICAR , etc. and strengthen other national / international network of institutions for the growth of Ayurveda. To address these aspects, the Committee recommends as under: Interdisciplinary Research Network : Specific institutions of the CCRAS should be identified to establish research collaborations with appropriate national institutes and ICMR / DST / DBT/ top universities in specific areas to develop modernize equipment of Panchakarma, Ksharsutra, Pulse examination, Prakriti examination, etc; Study of mechanism of action of drugs / reverse pharmacology / cell line study, tissue culture etc and pharmacology . 16 Strategic collaboration through regional networks may be developed so that CCRAS institutions are link ed with national institutes/universities present in respective regions. One such institute may be identified as lead institute while others may be part of collaborative network. In furtherance to the PhD fellowship programme of the CCRAS, postdoctoral research fellowship scheme in Ayurveda should be initiated by the CCRAS. The movement of Postdoctoral Fellows (PDFs) from Ayurveda to Modern Sciences and vice versa may be encouraged. viii. For networking and developing linkages, there are some suggestions which may be taken as illustrative examples only. The agreements/understanding may be at the level of heads of the organization, institutions for developing such networks and implementing collaborative programmes. For exampl e, for NCDs, mental health and chronic ki dney diseases (CKD) , good strength exists in the central medical institutions (AIIMS, NIMHANS etc.) and many state medical colleges, non -governmental institutions like CMC Vellore, Manipal, etc. which will be specific for different NCDs. For vector borne diseases, ICMR has very robust chain of institutions across the country. For other lifestyles disorders, same principle should be followed. For developing diagnostics and therapeutics for viral disease, networking with ICMR institutions as well as chain of virology diagnostic research labs in state medical colleges and n ational institutes like AIIMS, PGI, JIPMER , etc. would be most productive as clinical and laboratory strength will be available across the country. In case of nutrition and metabolic diseases, the institutions like NIN, Hyder abad (ICMR) and Departments of Endocrinology, Medicine, Obstetrics and G ynaec ology, Paediatrics and C ommunity medicines at national institutions and state medical colleges will be very useful. The CCRAS should collaborate with institutes working in the related areas such as National Institute of Tradit ional Medicine (ICMR), Belagavi . ix. The Committee recommends that the CCRAS should also conduct research in the area of integrative health care. x. The drug- drug interaction of Ayu rveda drugs with allopathic drugs in prevalent diseases like Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension should also be prioritized. xi. Stand alone Ayurveda and Ayurveda intervention as add- on therapy may be studied for generating adequate scientific evidence to mainstr eam Ayurveda in India's health care system. xii. Studies on availability of raw material and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP ), etc. need to be prioritized. xiii. Robust and periodic m onitoring of the research projects should be effectively done to improve the quality. xiv. The CCRAS may facilitate research to other research organization / academic institutes other than conducting research on its own, and specialized funding system for collaborative research in Ayurveda may be evolved. 17 xv. The outcomes of com pleted r esearch projects and public health programme may be analyzed, interpreted and published based on the guidelines / trends and evidence - based treatment regimen may be evolved for public utility. The unpublished data of the completed projects may be immedia tely published by the CCRAS. Mechanisms may be proposed for faster analysis and publication in future. xvi. The o bservational studies based on the experience / data of OPD s should be published. For this purpose, suitable mechanism may be evolved for proper documentation and analysis of hospital data. xvii. Meta analysis of the studies conducted so far should be done and accorded priority. xviii. Special focus should be given for researc h in Sowa -Rigpa system of medicine in the field of literary research, medicinal plants and clinical research especially in the context of health problems related to altitude. xix. Since the ethical issues are dynamic and several regulat ory changes are happening , the C ommittee recommends that it is important that workshops should be organized for chairp ersons and members of all IECs. It is important that all investigators involved in animal research should also be sensitized through workshops on the humane use of animals. xx. Ayurveda chairs may be established in academic institutes / Universities to promote interdisciplinary research and to establish liaison with other institutions. xxi. Scientists from modern medicine / basic medical science should be involved as chair(s) in the CCRAS institutions as per the requirement of their mandate for a specific period. xxii. Since a number of new scientists have joined the CCRAS recently , some of them along with existing s cientists should be trained in m olecu lar techniques so that this work may be initiated in near future. Further, the collaboration with other organizations like ICMR / CSIR / DST / DBT etc. should be established through network project mode. Overall remarks : Ayurveda has a rich history and solid foundation but there is a huge gap in understanding Ayurveda according to contemporary times. Therefore it is essential to generate a lot of data to showcase the evidence based Ayurveda in order to provide cafeteria choice to the public and to make an impact in a bigger way. Considering the strength of Ayurveda on health promotion and prevention of diseases, the CCRAS should focus on the concept of wellness particularly in areas where conventional medicine has limitation and to minimize the risks of modern medicine. Further, impetus should be given for development and validation of fundamental principles of Ayurveda through development of suitable modules. Ayurveda is aimed at maintenance of heath primarily, therefore it is impo rtant to introduce Ayurveda in school health program for children. The Committee felt that the CCRAS has potential leads with a great scope for their further development for important diseases viz. Arthritis, Diabetes, Reproductive 18 Health, Malaria and Skin Disorders. Further, the huge information already documented through public health programmes such as THCRP, Swasthya Rakshan Programme, NPCDCS etc, need to be critically analyzed and published which may serve as basic evidence on effectiveness of Ayurveda System and also framing the policy. The CCRAS should continue and expand its work on classical and several coded / proprietary Ayurveda medicines and also for retrieval of several ancient manuscripts. The Committee feels that the R ecruitment Rules of Director General and Scientific staff need to be changed. The post of Director General should be at the same rank as in ICMR / CSIR and under no circumstances less than the rank of Additional Secretary with a Grade pay of 12000/ - + NPA as admissible. Further , the CCRAS should have a recruitment and merit promotion scheme as in ICMR. The Committee recommends that frequent changes in nomenclature and mandate of the CCRAS units should be avoided. The CCRAS should develop linkages with similar research institution s / highly acclaimed u niversities / departments considering their strength and Council's need in specific areas. The Committee recommends that the CCRAS should develop a well defined and targeted action plan to achieve the goals set in the vision document 2030 incorporating the suggestions made by this committee to strengthen the CCRAS system. The Committee strongly recommends major reforms in Human resource development and management by making provisions as followed in ICMR or any such Council with Research mandate. 3. OVERVIEW OF CCRAS 19 OVERVIEW OF CCRAS In 2007 -2008, there were 38 institutes / units under Central Council for Research in Ayurveda & Siddha. In the year 2009, 3 institutes / units viz. RSSCA, Jamnagar; DSRP, Jamnagar ; and Regional Research Institute (Ay.), Junagadh were merged with RARISD Ahmedabad and one centre viz. Regional Research Centre, Hastinapur was merged with CARICD Delhi due to adminis trative reasons. Total institutes merged were 04, thus total number of institutes was reduced to 34. Later on in the year 2011, Siddha Council was separated from CCRAS and the Council was renamed as Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences. In this process, 4 institutions/units namely Cent ral Research Institute (Siddha); Chennai Regional Research Institute (Siddha) Pondicherry ; Central Research Unit (Siddha), Palayamkottai and S iddha Medicinal Plants Unit (SMPU) , Palyamkottai were shifted to Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS). Thus, as on date, the total number of the CCRAS institutions is 30 in addition to laboratory at Headquarters. i. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), was registered as societ y under Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 on 29th July 2011 (this was earlier component of the \" Central Council f or Research in Ayurveda and Siddha \" registered on 30th March, 1978). This is an autonomous organization under Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India and is the apex body for formulation, co -ordination, development and promotion of research on scientific lines in Ayurveda and Sowa - Rigpa systems of medicine. ii. CCRAS is currently headed by a Director General who administratively controls 30 institutes across the country and also the Headquarters . The organogram of CCRAS is given in Fig.1 Fig.1: Organogram of CCRAS 20 iii. The 30 institutions are headed by Director (05 institutes) / A.D. In- charge (14 institutes) / Research officer In-charge (11 institutes). iv. The activities are carried out through its 30 Institutes/Centers located across India (Fig. 2 ) and also through collaborative research with various Universities, Hospitals and Institutes. (Annexure 3 a & 3b) Fig. 2: Location of CCRAS institutions in India 21 v. CCRAS has a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and 4 Scientific Advisory Groups viz. (i) Clinical research, (ii) Drug development, (iii) Literature research and (iv) Basic sciences & fundamental research at headquarters. It was informed that though a circular was issued to all institutions in 2010 to constitute Scientific Advisory Committee it was observed that in many of institutes these committees have not been formed and in majority they are not functioning. vi. The major research area/Programme include s; Medi cinal Plant Research (Medico - ethno botanical Survey, Pharmacognosy and Tissue Culture), Drug Standardization, Pharmacological Research, Clinical Research, Literary Research & Documentation and Tribal Health . vii. Several research oriented outreach activities S RP, SCSP, NPCDCS are also being carried out. viii. The Council conducts capacity building workshops on human resource development on contemporary areas viz. Research methodology, Good Clinical Practices (GCP), Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), bio- statistics, drug development, drug standardization, instrumentation, Good Cultivation Practices. ix. Council also imparts structured training and short time course on Panchakarma. 3.1 Infrastructure In 2007- 08, out of 38 institutes/ centres/units , 16 were housed in their own building and the rest were in rented accommodation. During last ten years, the number of CCRAS institutes has been reduced to 30 including one for S owa-Rigpa and CCRS has been separated in 2011. At present out of 30 institutes, 20 institutes have own building including those under construction and 10 institutes have rented/rent free/donated buildings. At Mumbai and Delhi, required land has been obtained for construction of building and at Mumbai it has been proposed to develop the institute for integrative research & health care on cancer. Recently, CCRAS has also opened a centre at GADVASU, Ludhiana on veterinary Ayurveda. The governing body of CCRAS has also approved opening of a new institute for research on metal/mineral/marine products at Goa. The status of infrastructure as provided by CCRAS is given in Table 1 Table 1: Building status of CCRAS institutes Own building Rented buildings Donated /Rent free or as per MOU of state government 20 04 07 1.

CARIC Mumbai 22 Recently, Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer (CARIC), CCRAS has been proposed as National Centre of Excellence in Ayurveda and Integrative Oncology at Bhandup (East), Mumbai, Maharashtra by upgrading the existing facility and creating new infrastructure to conduct Teach ing and Research in Integrative Ayurveda oncology and to provide Cancer care through Integrative oncology through Additional Central Assistance. The centre would be state- of- the-art and on par with international standards in quality bench- marks. The Minis try of Urban Development, Central Public Works Department and Govt. of India have allocated 2.78 acres of land for this purpose. The total financial provision required is estimated at Rs.407.50 Crores towards Capital Works in the 1st Phase with total proposed staff strength of 492. Current status of Infrastructure of Drug Standardization Facilities: CCRAS is in continuous process of up- gradation of its Drug Standardization laboratories. Drug Standardization work is being carried out at Central Ayurveda Rese arch Institute for Drug Development (CARIDD), Kolkata, Captain Srinivasa Murthy Regional Ayurveda Drug Development Institute, (CSMRADDI), Chennai, Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development (RARIDD), Gwalior and Central Ayurveda Research ins titute Skeletal Disorders, (CARIN&MSD), Cheruthuruhty. Captain Srinivasa Murthy Regional Ayurveda Drug Development Institute, Chennai is equipped with HPTLC, AAS, LCMS etc and is a NABL accredited laboratory since 2006, it also holds Drugs Testing Laboratory (DTL) License from Drugs Controller, Tamil Nadu State. Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development (CARIDD), Kolkata is equipped with facilities HPTLC and HPLC for Drug Standardization Research besides facilities for isolation of marker compounds. Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development (RARIDD), Gwalior and Central Ayurveda Research institute for Neuromuscular& Musculo- Skeletal Disord ers, (CARIN&MSD), Cheruthuruhty are equipped with facilities for Drug standardization related work. GMP certification was obtained for Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development (CARIDD), Kolkata (2010- 11); Central Ayurveda Research Skeletal Disorders, (CARIN&MSD), Cheruthuruhty (2009 -10); Central for Respiratory Disorder ( CARIRD ), Patiala (2008- 09). 3.2 Human Resource During 2007 -08, there was a freeze order for the recruitment in CCRAS for which the available manpower substantially decreased. After withdrawal of freeze order , attempts have been made to fill up the vacant post and during last one year , 108 number of group A, 43 number of Group C post have been filled up. The Recruit ment Rules of various posts have also been revised in consultation with Ministry of AYUSH and an order for redeployment has been issued allocating specific manpower to different institutes.

The situation has somehow improved recently. After the recruitment of 43 Group C staff during last one year, 577 posts have been filled out of total 1526sanctioned posts (38%). 3.3 Review of Funds allocation to CCRAS The Committee noted that during pe riod of 2007- 08 to 2016- 17, the CCRAS was allocated Rs. 1213,13.89 (Lakhs ) and same was released. Year wise budgetary allocation as provided by the CCRAS is given in Table 4 and Fig.3 Table 4: Budget allocation during last 10 years (2007- 2016) Year Total Allocation (in Lakhs) Year Total Allocation (in Lakhs) 2007 -08 5,692.92 2012 -13 11,565.81 2008 -09 -14 2009 -10 13,850.00 -15 -11 -16 12 17 13,625.00 to 31.12.2016 Grand Total 1213,13.89 Fig. 3 Year -wise budget allocation (in lakhs) 26 The Committee observed that in 2007- 08 the total allocation (Plan and Non plan) was 56.9 cr. This gradually increased to 134 Cr. in 2014- 15. In 2015 -16 this increased to 173 Cr. The figures of funds utilized as provided by CCRAS indicate that the Council has been utilizing funds satisfactorily. The council has utilized the allocated budget and also the funds which it generated through various other sources. For CCRAS with 30 institutions and 457sanctioned Group A & B posts and 1526 sanctioned positions for group C, running scientific programme and Intra Mural Research, this budget allocation appears to be grossly inadequate for growth, development and optimal scientific functioning. Expenditure on modernization of laboratory infrastructure To keep pace with the scientific advancements and contemporary research technology, it is must that the laboratories are equip ped with state -of- the- art equi pment and facilities. This requires adequa te and optimum funding. The approximate funds spent for major scientific equipment/ tools in the last 10 years as provided by CCRAS are given in Table 5. Table 5: Expenditure on Major equipments during last 10 years S. No. Year Approximate Expenditure (in R s.) 1. 2007 -2008 23,51286/ - 2. 2008 -2009 68,84401/ - 3. 2009 -2010 3,99,78194/ - 4. 2010 -2011 2,40,17016/ - 5. 2011 -2012 1,48,67347/ - 6. 2012 -2013 74,62971/ - 7. 2013 -2014 17,85520/ - 8. 2014 -2015 54,83153/ - 9. 2015 -2016 22,05160/ - 10. Up to December 2016 Grand Total 12,48,81,347/ - Observation: The major part of allocated budget i.e. Rs. 634 crores (52.26%) was spent on salary component, Rs. 211Cr. (17.39%) was spent on capital works (infrastructure maintenance/ new construction component), Rs.12.48Cr. (1.02%) on crores (22%) leaving only 89Cr. (7.33%) for research. The Committee noted that on an average 1% of the total expenditure of CCRAS has been towards the purchase of major equipments which is a very low figure. 4. STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DR. NITYA ANAND REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT27 In pursuance of Ministry's Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2006 and 08.08.2006 (F.No.27020/2004- Ay.Desk), a Review Committee consisting of the following experts was constituted for assessment of quality and quantum of research work done by CCRAS in the last three years.

(Details o f recommendations at Annex ure 5) Recommendation s of Dr. Nitya A nand Committee I. R&D Programme 1. Prioritization of the R&D Programmes: The first R&D priority should be standardization of classical A&S drugs so that people get drugs of standard quality, proven safety and efficacy evidenced by acceptable modern methodology. The first priority in standardization should go to drugs of the following categories: a. Drugs used for Primary Health Care b. Drugs commonly used in everyday life such as for g. i. Disorders, cough & cold, pains c. Common Nutraceuticals d. Drugs of selected disease areas of great national concern in which A&SMs have special strengths and modern drugs are inadequate or are not available The disease areas suggested were Metabol ic syndrome; Diabetes, Obe sity, Hypertension and Lifestyle disorders, Skin disorders, Musculo- skeletal disorders and inflammatory disorders, Respiratory disorders and inflammatory disorders, GI disor ders and Ageing & related degenerative problems & Rasayana. Observation of the C ommittee The Committee noted that the following aspects have been implemented: As far as the standardization of drugs used for Primary Health Care (PHC) is concerned the Committee was informed that CCRAS has facilitated in preparing the Essential Drugs List (EDL) by the Ministry of AYUSH by giving technical inputs. This list has been prioritized for standardization purpose. CCRAS has contributed scientifically and logistically for development of standards by the Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia Committee (APC). CCRAS informed that so far 39 out of 100 drugs in EDL have been standardized under APC being Secretariat. ( Annexure 6) The standardization parameters of these 39 drugs have already been incorporated viz. 9 in API Part II Vol. I; 2008, 20 in API Part II Vol. II; 2008, 9 in Part II Vol. III; 2010 and remaining 1 formulation is approved by APC & under publication. The council has already worked on most of the areas identified by them as well as other disease of National/International importance like Diabetes, Obesity, 29 Hypertension, Skin disorders, Respiratory disorders, Musculoskeletal disor ders, Ageing and Rasayana effect, etc. The Council has also drafted a research policy for intra mural and collaborative (both national/International) research incorporating prioritized area and modalities of execution. This policy has been approved vide 20th meeting of Governing Body of CCRAS held on 13th August 2015. CCRAS has taken up approximately 140 numbers of classical medicines for validation out of which study on 77 medicines in 24 disease conditions have been completed. (Annexure 7 ) The C ommittee appreciates and recommends that this standardization work may be expedited as it is important for improving the Health Care System through Ayurveda and confidence building in the public. 2. Methods of manufacture: The selected classical drugs should be manufactured by the traditional concepts and methodology, though employing modern scientific technologies, and the detailed Method of Preparations (MOPs) thus developed should be well documented. The products so manufactured should undergo standardization and quality control for pharmacopoeial standards. CCRAS Institute at Patiala, which has been identified for the work of manufacture and development, should be equipped with GMP conforming pilot plant facilities with all the laboratory analytical and spectroscopic capabilities for developing the necessary quality control standards both for the raw materials and the finished products. Observation of the Committee Recommendation to upgrade CCRAS Institute at Patiala could not be implemented due to lack of its own building . CCRAS informed the Committee that much correspondence was done with State Govt. to hand over the building to the Council. Neither the building was transferred to CCRAS nor was required modification done. The Committee feels that these issues should have been sorted out by active negotiation through the Government system. The C ommittee was informed by CCRAS that it has initiated the up gradation/establishment of pharmacy along with the QC laboratory at RARI, Jhansi . For this, the approval of Standing Finance Committee (SFC) has been taken and t he civil work is likely to be completed this year . The Committee recommends that this is of great importance and urgency & the facility should be made functional as early as possible. 3. Standardization and Quality Control: One of the Central Research Institute should have a separate botanical department specializing in this area and work in close collaboration with Botanical Survey of India and some of the CSIR labs working on cultivation of medicinal plants. The standardization of raw materials is no more a mere 30 pharmacognostic identification but is based on characterization of the major chemical constituents. The standardization of the A& SMs cannot be based on the characterization of a single active chemical constituent, but on total analytical profiling with the major chemical constituents, as these drugs would be polycomponent. This will require isolation and availability of each of the major chemical constituent as a reference substance and marker compound, and without this it would not be possible to bring the product to a level of wider acceptance, nationally and internationally. These quality control standards developed should be full y documented and should become the pharmacopoeial standards for these drugs. Standardization and quality control should gradually be extended to other areas where A&S drugs are used, especially in the following, viz: Nutraceuticals, also named \"dietary supplements\" or \"home remedies\", Drugs for Veterinary use, All the A&SM commercially manufactured and marketed by organizations supported by or under AYUSH such as Indian Medicine and Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited (IMPCL), Mohan, Distt. Almora. Observat ion of the Committee The Committee noted that the recommendation to develop a separate botanical Department in Central Research Institutes (CRIs) could not be implemented. However, the CCRAS institution at Kolkata has been strengthened and is already fulfilling that need to some extent. The Committee emphasizes that this recommenda tion may be implemented in time -bound manner. All the classical drugs and coded formulations used for clinical trials are subjected to standardization/Quality Control both for raw ingredients and finished products. CCRAS also has taken up such work for other single drugs and compound formulations. From the year 2007- 08 to 2015- 16, 480 numbers of single drugs and 300 numbers of compound formulations have been standardized/analyzed. Besides this d uring 2007- 2016, Pharmacopoeial work was also carried out at CCRAS institutions. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and Pharmacopoeial Standards of 46 compound formulations were developed. Thin layer chromatographic atlas of 179 Pharmacopoei al Drugs of API, Part -I, Volume -I & III was also developed. CSMRADDI, Chennai had developed 68 monographs for Quality Standards of Indian Medicinal Plants (ICMR). Development of Marker Compound from 06 Classical Ayurvedic Formulations & 10 medicinal plants was carried out by CCRAS and these were published by World Health Organization (WHO). 31 4. Sequence of Studies for Establishing the Clinical Efficacy of Classical A&S Drugs The following sequence of R&D studies should be followed and adhered to for undertaking the clinical efficacy studies. Identifying and selecting the method of manufacture, which should be as close to the traditional method described as possible? Developing suitable QC standards of raw material and manufactured products with in -proces s controls, with reproducibility of at least 3 batches, and its validation at 3 centers. Checking the safety and toxicity of the drug thus developed. If a change in the method of manufacture is necessary this may be carried out but the product must conform to the QC standards developed. If due to some reason the new batch has different quality standards but is to be used clinically it must undergo fresh clinical trial. Clinical evaluation of the drug, with each batch checked for its QC standard, strictly fo llowing the protocol developed by the committee formed for this purpose. The Clinical Trial Protocol must be developed following the WHO Guidelines for Clinical Trials. A special Expert Committee should be entrusted this job. The clinical Trial should be supervised and monitored by a Joint Expert Group consisting of both Ayurve dic & Modern Physicians. Observation of the Committee The committee noted that the following aspects have been implemented The protocols of drug development have been made applicable according to the requirement of new drug development. Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) of manufacturing, Quality control standards for raw ingredients and finished products, Safety/toxicity, clinical study have been taken up. Toxicity studies of herbo- mineral formulations in GLP laboratories have also been initiated. CCRAS has developed standard clinical protocols which have been used with suitable modifications as per internationally adopted scales/parameters. CCRAS has developed clinical research protocols in collaboration with ICMR for 4 disease conditions/areas viz. Dys lipidemia, Osteoporosis, Benign Prostate Hypertrophy (BPH) and Hypertension 5. Study of the mode of action at biochemical/molecular level of classical A&S drugs With the rapid scientific advances in biological sciences and structural biology, unprecedented opportunities are now available to study the mode of action of A&S drugs at the molecular and even at Systems level, which can add great value to these drugs. For example it has been shown in recent studies that gugulsterones, the active constituents of gugulipid, the classical Ayurvedic hypolipidemic drug, acts through FXR, the bile acid nuclear receptors, which is a 32 novel mode of action for lipid lowering drugs. Such studies open up new vistas for further development of existing drugs, and for new drug disc overy research. In due course of time, all the important A&S drugs should undergo such reverse pharmacology studies to understand their mode of action. Further, the focus in drug research is shifting to non- infectious diseases, and the growing realizati on of the multi -factorial causation of most of them, is focusing attention on drugs acting on multiple targets, and on multi -component drugs, which A&SM drugs are. Study of their mode of action may even provide new therapeutic uses of these drugs. The study of the molecular mode of action of classical but well standardized A&SM drugs should thus be an essential part of the A&SM Drug Research Institutes and Ayurvedic Science Research Institute as suggested above, which will help to bring A&SM into the main stream of medical sciences. Observation of the Committee The Committee was informed that except biological activity of Ayurvedic dosage forms including extracts no other work at molecular/bio- chemical level have been taken up till now. The validation of approximately 77 classical Ayurvedic formulations has been completed. It is recommended that the lead from the same may be taken u p for future bio- chemical/molecular studies. Since a number of new scientists have joined CCRAS recently some of them along with existing scientists should be trained in Molecular Techniques so that this work may be initiated in near future. Further, the c ollaboration with other organization like ICMR/CSIR/DST/DBT etc. should be established through network project mode. 6. Broad Biological Screening of A&S drugs and the plant extracts prepared therein Screening of chemical libraries and established therapeutic agents against phenotypic and molecular targets has emerged as an important approach to new drug discovery research. It would be useful to subject the classical A&S drugs, which can be easily handled, and their constituent plant ingredients to screening programs to get new leads. A bank for these drugs and the plant extracts should be prepared and kept in CCRAS laboratories. To begin with, these products should be got screened from outside Centers established for screening. Concurrently steps should, howe ver, be undertaken to set up this Screening facility at one of the National Institutes recommended to be set up. This might will also uncover some new uses for old drugs. Observation of the Committee The Committee noted that the following aspects have been implemented CCRAS informed that it has conducted biological screening of 33 Ayurvedic drugs (19 plant extracts/oil and 14 compound formulations). These screening for different activities were conducted in collaboration with different institutions as well as in house institutions. (Annexure 8) 33 Though Dr.Nitya Anand (NA) Committee recommended for setting up a screening facility at one of the National institute, the present Committee feels that this may not be feasible to have all screening method at one institute and it is better to utilize established laboratories in respective areas of expertise. The Committee emphasizes that the translation and implementation of the findings may be expedited for developing or improving Ayurveda products. II. Restructuring of CCRAS Institutes and Centers Specific recommendations for 8 institutes for renaming and mandate of 12 institutes were made and the prototype of National Research Institute of Ayurveda Drug Development has been recommended. The Committee also recommended to create national research institutes, central research insti tutes and one national bio- geo repository Observation of the Committee The Committee noted the action taken on this recommendation After submission of report of Dr. Nitya Anand Committee, several meetings were conducted between Department of AYUSH and CCRAS. Then CCRAS issued notifications for renaming, mandate and staff pattern of 5 institutes. Accordingly, CCRAS has changed the name and mandate of these 5 institutes. Subsequently, name and mandate of other institutes were also changed with the approval of 19 th Governing Body meeting. The implementation of recommendations pertaining to manpower, infrastructure and equipment instruments etc. could not be materialized in true pers pective due to various reasons as that would have required concurrence of Finance Ministry and/or Cabinet approval especially to create manpower. The Committee is making a separate recommendation to have a system for nomenclature and functioning of CCRAS institutions keeping in views the needs and the realities of the present times. III. Product registration and regulatory control of marketed A & S drugs Regulatory controls of A&SMs are not stringent currently. This has resulted into flooding of market with substandard, poor quality products with very often tall and unsubstantiated claims. This practice needs to be curbed if A&SMs are to be protected from going into disrepute. In the current scenario, GMP certification is provided only for manufacturing premises and manufacturing license is provided for several products on one page only. There is no system of product registration as on today. A review of regulatory scenario in other countries reveals that in the countries where product registration of Traditional Medicine is in existence, not only the quality of medicine has improved, but the acceptance of traditional medicines has also grown. The need of the hour, therefore, is to introduce the system of product registration through a dossier containing all the details of quality control measures in terms of raw material 34 specifications, in process controls and finished product specifications. In addition to it, the dossier should also contain SOPs for manufacturing process on every product be it classica l or proprietary. This will help taking A&SM forward in faster strides with better quality control and minimum batch- to-batch variation. Every product should also be given a unique product registration number to be displayed prominently on the labels. This would help in easy tracking of the product back to the producers quickly in case certain adverse events are reported . Observation of the Committee a) For marketing of products, CCRAS has agreement with NRDC since 1981 which has been revised in 2015 and license for commercialization of certain products have been granted to various firms through NRDC. b) Dossiers of the products developed by CCRAS are being prepared comprising of complete information viz. raw material specification, SOP, standardization, safety toxicity data and clinical studies before commercialization. c) For regulatory control, DCC Section of Ministry of AYUSH is being taking steps. d) 8 Monographs to European Medicines Agency (EMA). e) CCRAS provides data about traditional use of medicinal plants for preparation and publication of monographs by EMEA from time to time. f) The Co mmittee noted that regulatory work is not in the purview of CCRAS and it should confine its role to provide to knowledge and expertise to help the government in taking up decision whenever required. IV. Service conditions and Human Resource Development (service condition and salary structure to be at par with ICMR, Research Fellowship Programme, each laboratory to be headed by Director etc.) It is strongly recommended that the same service conditions and salary structure as exist in ICMR institutions should be adopted for CCRAS and its research institutions. And the same Selection process for Scientific & Technical Staff should be adopted & followed; no ad- hoc appointment should be made. The contingent gr ant for Post -graduation & PhD, both for Ayurveda and related sciences. Fully developed research fellowship program for RA, SRF and JRF of different disciplines. Each laboratory should be headed by a Director in the same scale as that of CSIR Institute. 35 Observation of the Committee a) Only Ph.D. fellowship programme has been taken up recently. After inviting applications, examination has been conducted and result has been declared only for Ayurveda discipline. The matter of other disciplines is under process. b) No change has been made in service conditions salary structure and hierarchy, like CSIR/ICMR as recommended by the Committee. c) At present only in- situ promotion scheme for non- medical scientists has been extended to both medical and non- medical scientist o f CCRAS which provides time bound promotion every 5 years to Group 'A' scientific staff. d) The committee is making a separate recommendation for human resource development and service conditions etc. keeping in views the needs and the realities of the presen t times. V. Accountability and autonomy of CCRAS and its constituent institutes (similar to CSIR, ICMR) It is very important that, the CCRAS head quarter should enjoy the autonomy, similar to CSIR & ICMR. There should also be equal emphasis on accountability and the head of CCRAS should continuously monitor the functioning and productivity of each lab apart from yearly review by the RAC. The financial autonomy given to CCRAS must also be extended to its different constituent institutes. The present designation of CCRAS Head should be re -designated as 'Director General' as in ICMR and CSIR to differentiate it from the Director of different national research institutes recommended to be established under this report. Observation of the Committee The committee no ted that the following aspects have been implemented The nomenclature of Director, CCRAS has been changed as Director General. The financial power of DG is now 1 Cr. (as against 10 Lac of the erstwhile Director). The committee is making a separate recommendation on this subject . VI. Increasing the education outreach of A & S system of medicine (optional paper on Ayurveda & Siddha in MBBS, three months orientation program for pharmaceutical/ biological sciences and course on GLP/GCP) Education and research need to go hand in hand. In order to attract the modern medicine, pharmaceutical sciences and modern biology students conversant with the special scientific basis special sources may be designed. The following three teaching program mes, to begin with, may be introduced: o One optional paper in Ayurveda and Siddha Medical Sciences for the MBBS students. 36 o A three months' orientation programme on A&S drugs for the Pharmaceutical Sciences/Biological Sciences. o Courses on GLP/GCP, Evidence based Medicine, Medical Biostatistics and Modern Biology for A&SM graduate students. This would create the required interest and understanding in the science of Ayurveda and Siddha Systems of Medicine, and help to create an interface between Ayurveda and Si ddha Medical sciences with modern biology and medical science. All the steps should be taken to project A&S as a lucrative career option after 10 + 2 to attract those students who are bright and are really interested in studying these sciences. Observation of the Committee These points have not been feasible to be taken up by CCRAS considering its staff strength and infrastructures as well as some of these issues are not under the purview of CCRAS. The committee noted the point of view of CCRAS. However, re calling the need for integrated medical systems which was part of aspirations before independence, failed attempt after independence and the current thinking in USA and other western countries this concept needs to be revived. The Ministry of AYUSH should work with Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to develop such teaching/ training programme for the development of integrated medicine approach in the interest of patients. VII. Financial assistance for research project (EMR should have same area as meant for Council) Currently several projects are being funded under Extra Mural Research (EMR) scheme through the Project Evaluation Committee (PEC) of CCRAS. It is recommended that only those projects should be approved for financial assistance, which falls under any one of the areas identified above as focused therapeutic areas for CCRAS. At the same time, the projects which may add value to basic Ayurvedic concepts should always be encouraged, preferably under interdisciplinary research mode. Observation of the C ommittee The committee was informed that EMR scheme is continued to be controlled by the Ministry of AYUSH. It was noted that the priority areas mentioned in CCRAS research policy have similarity with prioritize areas published in EMR scheme of Ministry of AYUSH. The committee feels that the priority list should be revisited annually to maintain contemporariness. 37 The committee recommends that the pattern followed at DHR and ICMR/CSIR/DST/DBT may be followed because technical expertise is available at the Council. VIII. Training needs: CCRAS scientists need to be trained on regular basis in their respective fields, in order to keep abreast of the latest knowledge on the subject. These should be a continuous training and education programme and should a part of CCRAS scientists as listed. Some of the areas of training are listed below - Research Methodology Good clinical practices Good laboratory practices National and International Regulatory status Exposure to sophisticated equipments for s tandardization In vitro techniques for toxicity and efficacy evaluation using biotechnological inputs Intellectual property rights Good Management Practices Observation of the Committee The committee noted that the following aspects have been implemented CCRAS itself has been conducting various seminars/workshops on research methodology, scientific writing etc. and also send staff as feasible to such training in India and abroad. They include programme of CSIR, DST, ASCI Hyderabad, LBSNAA Mussoorie etc. The Committee recommends that the council should maintain a comprehensive database of all the people undergone different workshops/trainings/courses etc. frequently ascertain the needs and schedule events accordingly. CCRAS should maintain and update electronic database of experts available throughout the country. IX. Constitution of Research Advisory Committee (RAC) for each Institute & Science Adviser for each Centre Each institute must have a Research Advisory Committee (RAC), which will meet at least once a year for 2 days to guide and monitor the R&D activity of the institute. Each discipline of work must be adequately represented in the RAC. The chairman of the RAC will be a member of the SAC of CCRAS. Observation of the Committee The committ ee noted that the following aspects have been implemented In many of CCRAS institutes, Scientific Advisory Committees have not been formed and in majority they are not functioning. The committee recommends that regular meetings of SACs are important to giv e such research guidance. 38 X. Review Committees: The Research Advisory Committee will review the work every year and will also reduce the need for external review, which can be carried out every five years. Observation of the Committee The committee noted that the following aspects have been implemented At Headquarter level, Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) for Drug Development, Clinical Research, Literature Research and Basic Sciences & Fundamental Research and Scientific Advisory Board (SAB ) have also been constituted to monitor whole research work of the Council including those of peripheral institutes. The present Committee is reviewing the activities of the council for last 10 years XI. Vision for CCRAS CCRAS is sitting on a \"Gold Mine\", a rich knowledge resource of ancient systems of medicine, which have survived many onslaughts for over 3000 years and are still widely practiced, which speaks for their strong scientific foundations and inherent strength of their materia -medicas, healthcare practices and traditions. However, much more can be gotten from this rich heritage than what have been achieved so far, with modem science and technology inputs, which is the thrust of this report. The recent advances i n pharmaceutical and biological sciences offer many unprecedented opportunities to achieve these objectives. It is up to CCRAS management to create the scientific strengths and environment in its institutions that would help in utilizing the opportunities offered by modem science and technology, both to bring A&SMs into the mainstream of healthcare as well as help developing an interface with modem medicine and integrate the opportunities for better healthcare. Observation of the Committee The committee no ted that the following aspects have been implemented CCRAS has framed a vision 2030, which has been approved by Ministry of AYUSH, to develop scientific evidence in Ayurvedic principles, drug therapies by way of integrating ancient wisdom with modern techn ology . (Annexure 9 ) CCRAS has initiated steps to bring products for commercialization or to put in to National Health programs. Collaborative studies have been taken up with ICMR, Tata Memorial Centre, AIIMS, IIT etc. in important areas like Cancer, Dengue, healthy ageing and automation of Ksharastura etc. 39 Overall Remarks CCRAS has made serious attempts to implement the recommendations of Dr. Nitya Anand Committee however, it could not be fully implemented due t o lack of requisite manpower, infrastructure and financial support. If recommendations of Dr. Nitya Anand Committee would have been implemented in true perspective, CCRAS would have been able to deliver more. However, CCRAS has tried its best to assign som e work/project as reflected in the report; to fill the gap or work in commercialization of products with IPR value, validation of classical medicines, safety/toxicity and efficacy study of herbal/herbo -mineral formulations; revival of important texts from ancient manuscripts, survey of medicinal plants and other aspects. In recent past, some formulations (AYUSH 82 & AYUSH SG) have been gone for commercialization and in near future a series of drug are going to be commercialized or can be introduced in mains tream of National Health programs. Besides specific recommendations made in the preceding paragraphs, several new recommendations are being made in chapter 7 of this report. 5.

The major activities are listed below: 6.1 Out-Patient Department (OPD) services : Approximately 4839017 patients attended OPD during last 10 years (2007- December, 2016). Some of these patients were hospitalized. The data shows that majority of pa tients (1373673) suffered from Musculo -skeletal system followed by skin disorder (20575), Respiratory Disorder s (211005), Lifestyle related Disorder s (125433), Ano- rectal Disorder s (95442) and Gastrointestinal Disorder s (81885). Fig. 4: No. of patients Years 42 6.2 Outreach activities Tribal Health Care Research Programme: This programme has been implemented under Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) and services have been extended to 14 states through 15 CCRAS Institutes to provide health care facilities at door step of tribal people. In this programme, CCRAS has covered a population of 4,67,917 and 851 folk claims/LHTs have been documented. Swasthya Rakshan Programme: This programme has been initiated during the month of November, 2015. A total 255 villages/colonies covered through 4130 tours in 19 states and medical aid provided to 122906 patients. During these tours, awareness about hygiene was also provided to the people Ayurveda Mobile Health Care Programme under Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP) : This programme has been initiated during the month of November, 2015. A total 336 villages/co lonies covered through 3464 tours in 19 states and medical aid provided to 122134 patients. During these tours, awareness about hygiene was also provided to the people NPCDCS Programme: Through this programme i.e. National Programme for prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio- vascular disease and Stroke (NPCDCS) ,Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with DGHS, Ministry for Health and Family Welfare, GoI has been taken up for prevention and control of non communicable diseases i n 3 identified districts of 3 states viz. Gaya (Bihar), Bhilwada (Rajasthan) and Surendranagar (Gujarat). So far, 52,709 patients have been screened for selected Non Communicable Diseases, out of which 23,318 patients have been enrolled for selected NCDs under this programme. Ayurvedic Health Centres under NE Plan: CCRAS has sanctioned 20 OPDs in 20 districts of North- East states during 2015- 16, viz. 10 OPD in Assam state, 6 Arunachal in In Pradesh, 6 Ayurvedic Health Centres viz.

AYUSH Ph.D. Fellowship/SRF Scheme The concept was proposed by CCRAS to introduce AYUSH Ph.D. fellowship programme for creating a high quality human resource for research and the scheme was approved by the Ministry of AYUSH vide Letter F.No.D -15020/13/2016- RD, along with the of IFD vide FTS No. 3074582, dated 22.09.2016. Fellowship /SRF scheme has been circulated to all Post Graduate Colleges/Institutes of Ayurveda, Siddha & Unani and all peripheral Research centres / Units of CCRAS for wider publicity . After inviting a pplications from interested and eligible candidates for AYUSH- National Eligibility Test (AYUSH -NET) , the exam was conducted at 5 centres namely Delhi, Mumbai , Kolkata, Chennai and Guwahati and the result has been declared recently. 11. Other important Research outcomes: Healthcare seeking trends in Ayurveda : The OPD data (app.62 lac patients) available in annual report of 24 CCRAS institutes for the period 1991 -2012 was analyzed to present the healthcare seeking behaviour. The analysis showed that majority of p atients (16.17%) suffered from diseases of digestive system followed by musculo- skeletal system (15.88%) and nervous system (11.55%). The data was suggestive of patients inclination towards Ayurveda treatment for chronic and lifestyle related diseases. A R eport \" Healthcare seeking trends in Ayurveda A CCRAS Perspective\" was published in 2015 CCRAS published \"Evidence based Ayurvedic Practice\" in 2015 on 18 disease conditions based on the several research studies conducte d at CCRAS institutions for the last three decades. The document is an effort to translate research into practice. 45 Some articles published in journals reported the toxicity, presence of heavy metal contents of certain classical/proprietary preparations which created misconceptions regarding the safety of Ayurvedic Rasa Kalpas and Bhasmas. Recognizing the therapeutic importance and safety concerns of such formulations, CCRAS compiled experimental studies conducted by CCRAS and other institutions on safety profile of 15 metal/herbomineral formu lations and published a document \" Evidence based Safety of Ayurvedic Herbo -Mineral Formulations\" in 2015. The Council -WHO India country office conducted an operational study to explore the feasibility of integrating Ayurveda with modern system of medicine in a tertiary care hospital (Safdarjung Hospital New Delhi) for the management of Osteoarthritis (Knee) in 2007. The Ayurvedic treatment provided to 201 patients was found effective in the management of Osteoarthritis Knee w ith respect to reducing the symptoms, improving the quality of life and reducing the intake of rescue medication (analgesics). The project established a cross referral system and revealed a shift in service seeking behaviour of the patients. A Technical report of the study was published by CCRAS in 2007. Feasibility of integration of Ayurveda in RCH programme : The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) carried out the study in a pilot mode for introducing Ayurveda health care system in t he conventional system for Antenatal, postnatal and neonatal care with technical support from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Government of India. It was implemented in some selected areas viz. Ladbhadhol & Chauntra blocks of Mandi District of Himachal Pradesh. Total 2465 participants were enrolled in the study. Significant improvement in various outcome indicators such as improvement in Hb%, minimal complications such as vomiting, Edema etc. dur ing pregnancy, achievement of full term pregnancy and nil still birth and neonatal death were observed in the study. Whereas in Himachal Pradesh, Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) was 31 per 1000 live births and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) were 40 according to Sample Registry survey (SRS -2010). Further, there was no mortality of women in the registered cases. No adverse drug reaction (ADR) or adverse event (AE) was reported during the study period. The responsiveness of study participants and the outcome of cor e indicators reveal the acceptability of study participants for Ayurveda during pregnancy. A paper has been published \"Effectiveness of Ayurvedic interventions for Ante -natal Care (Garbhini Paricharya) at Primary Health Care level - A multi- centre operatio nal Study\" in Journal of Research in Ayurveda and Siddha published by Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, New Delhi (2015) . The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) has conducted scientific studies in collaboration with reputed institutes to establish safety profiles of most commonly used Ayurvedic Govt. of India brought out the document \"Evidence Based Safety of Ayurvedic Medicines\" (2016) focusing on safety of Ayurvedic metal and mineral based formulations to present the scientific aspects, relevance and rationale of unique interventions in the public domain. For further studies, the document is available at www.ccras.nic.in . Under G olden Triangle Partnership (GTP) programme, SOPs for preparation, chemical characterization and safety/toxicity studies in collaboration with CSIR. Research protocols have also been developed in partnership with ICMR. The articles/monographs are under publication. CCRAS also contributed to TKDL in the matt er of collection of published material on Ayurveda, compilation of formulations and generation of Traditional Knowledge Resource Classification (TKRC). Observations : The Committee perused in detail of achievements discussed above and listed by the CCRAS (Annexure 10 a -h and Annexure 11 ) and i s of the opinion that with limited budget and HR, the output of Council is very good as measured by research publication per scientist, patient care activity, commercialization of the technologies, support to AYUSH sys tem in standardization of Ayurveda drugs, launching of fellowship scheme, AYUSH Research Portal, publishing documents for relevant for clinical care, attempting for integration of Ayurveda in RCH and other programmes, research studies for the safety profil e of commonly used Ayurveda medicines and development of SOPs for clinical research. The Committee observed that a long lag period has existed for analysis and publication of the report/papers which appears due to small number of scientific staff involved in variety of activities and not so strong system for data capturing and analysis. 6. CCRAS - STRENGHTS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES & THREATS (SWOT) ANALYSIS 47 SWOT Analysis: The Committee has carried out SWOT analysis in consultation with CCRAS and the observations are as follows: I. STRENGTHS CCRAS has a network of 30 Institutes which are located in majority of the states including North East & Andaman Nicobar. So, t he study on diseases & Health care delivery can be done in different geographical & environmental conditions. CCRAS has scientists from different disciplines like Ayurveda, Pharmacology, Pharmacognosy, Botany, Pharmacy, Chemistry etc. whose expertise can b e utilized in a diversified aspects of research like Medicinal plants, phytochemical analysis, Quality Control & standardization, Clinical research, Literary research etc. 24 out of 30 institutes of CCRAS have OPD/hospital facilities where several patien ts undertake consultation, avail the facilities of laboratory tests & also avail the benefits of Ayurveda. CCRAS has also been involved in several outreach activities like NPCDCS, SRP, SCSP, THCRP under which important demographic health profile are collec ted & documented. CCRAS has conducted survey of Medicinal plants in several forest divisions across the country and has established herbarium and digitalized thousands of herbarium sheets. CCRAS has facilitated APC for development of Standards of several A yurveda Single drug & Compound formulations which have been laid down in API Part I and Part II accordingly. CCRAS has conducted several studies on classical medicines which will increase the confidence among Ayurveda Practitioners to prescribe such medici ne and evidence thus generated has been published for 18 disease conditions. CCRAS has developed several coded/ proprietary Ayurveda medicines for the diseases wherein conventional medicine has certain limitation. Some medicines like AYUSH 82 for Type II Diabetes Mellitus & AYUSH SG for Rheumatoid Arthritis have been more commercialized. Council has also undertaken development of Ayurveda medicines in the disease conditions/areas like Reproductive & Child health ,improving quality of life in cancer patients , mental retardation , healthy ageing etc which may help to disseminate the strength of Ayurveda. CCRAS has also contributed for retrieval of several important Ayurveda texts with Hindi/English translation from ancient manuscripts which are hitherto publi shed; some of which are referred text under D&C Act. CCRAS has done some work on veterinary Ayurveda and published books viz. Review of medicinal plants in Veterinary practices and Exploration of Veterinary practices in Ayurveda and also considering the present usage of herbal drugs in Veterinary practice. CCRAS may contribute a lot for treatment of common animal diseases especially for cow. CCRAS may also conduct research on panchagavya products especially Cow Urine. 48 II. Weakness es Lack of required N umber of manpower : CCRAS has taken up steps for recruitment of scientific and admin staff since last two years. But there is huge gap between availability of expertise /scientific staff according to new name and mandate of several insti tutes like in CARICD, New Delhi there is no cardiologist as per the mandate of preventive cardiology and RARIED, Jaipur, as per the mandate there is no Endocrinologist. Further, Diversion of manpower in implementation of extension activities like SRP, NPCD CS, SCSP, THCRP Arogya Mela etc. Lack of Specialized Consultancy/Manpower: To handle specialized equipments and instruments, the trained manpower for handling these are also essentially required. There is lack of interdisciplinary persons . For example, there needs to be a modern cardiologist in CARICD Delhi to handle any untoward situation even if the research is taken up in preventive cardiology . Insufficient Supporting Staff: It has also been observed that several paramedical and other staff like ward boy, Aaya, Panchakarma Attendant etc. have been categorized as MTS and most of them have lapsed .Except peon attendant attached with admin section all other staff associated with technical activities and designated as MTS separately demarcated. Lack of adequate financial and functional autonomy to facilitate the execution of research in a proper way & d elegation of Power of Director General, CCRAS: At present, the power of sanctioning a project / equipment at an instance with DG, CCRAS is Rs.1 Crore and if the budgetary requirement exceeds one crore, it goes to Ministry of AYUSH for necessary approval which delays the project . Frequent change in Nomenclature/ Mandate: Due to fr equent changes i n nomenclature and mandate of CCRAS institutes , they coul d not focus on specific area of research and this amounted to destabilized human resource. Failure to attract highly skilled technical human resource due to poor promotional avenues and pay scales . Lack of appropriate infrastructure. : Though, the mandate has been changed, the institutes are not equipped to meet the requirements like Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases (CARICD), New Delhi is a National level Institute of CCRAS supposed to have specialized prevention / treatment facilities for cardiovascular diseases. But the existing infrastructure comprises of a very basic pathology and bio- chemistry lab with few Panchakarma instruments and Ksharasutra facility. The basic facilities like ECG, X -ray machine and Ultrasonography ar e not available. There is no specialized infrastructure for dealing with cardiovascular diseases. Lack of GMP facilities for preparation of research drugs in CCRAS . 49 CCRAS has a huge research data which is yet to be translated in the form of publication. F urther, mechanism should be evolved for proper data management in future. If urgent steps are not taken to increase human resource and train them adequately progress in clinical research as well as laboratory activities will be adversely affected. Lack o f publications and writing skills and attitude. Lack of linkages among researchers. III. Opportunit ies Ayurveda is being used by a larger population and has a long history of use. The world at large acknowledged the potential of Traditional medicine and in developed Countries, institutes are being developed for this purpose. Considering this, the CCRAS can con tribute by conducting research on Ayurveda and tap the potential of Ayurve da particularly in areas where conventional medicine has limitation and to minimize the risks of modern medicine. Collaboratio n should be done with similar research/academic organization in specific area like ICMR/ DST /DBT /IITs etc. to Ksharsutra ,Pulse examination, Prakriti examination etc; Study of mechanism of action of drugs/ reverse pharmacology/cell line study, tissue culture etc are pharmacology. Ayurvedic principles of Daily regimen, Pathya -Apathy a for disease conditions etc can be propagated which will be helpful to prevent life style diseases which have increased in recent years. Observational studies can be done at OPD/IPD of CCRAS institutes generating evidence of particulars diseases with specific medicine(s). In this direction, research should be more focused on chronic diseases, degenerative & lifestyle related dise ases in which CCRAS can make a good impact. CCRAS can invent drugs to be used as independent therapy or add on therapy in the disease for which conventional system has limitation. Since present Government is pat ronizing AYUSH system more, CCRAS can make important contributions in health care & can work to meet domestic needs for use of Ayurveda. Since in recent times, Ayurveda has been popularized globally, Council can help the industries with scientific/technical inputs to meet demand internationally both for exports of pr oducts & to cater health care needs. Ayurveda has been used in traditional dosage forms which may be a bit dif ficult to be accepted without adequate research, the Council can develop acceptable dosage forms with help of modern technology for its wider utility. 50 Owing to its long history of use, c ommunity participation , affordability and acceptability , Ayurveda has gained high social and culture support. Hence, the Council may also contribute at Primary health care level in developing modules, treatment protocols, Standard treatment guidelines etc. Ayurveda is aimed at maintenance of heath primarily, therefore it is important to introduce Ayurveda in s chool health program for children. As Ayurveda has elaborate description of food items and also emphasizes on Pathya - Apathya for the management of diseases, Research on Ayurveda based Nutraceuticals and food supplements, cosmetics etc may also be undertaken . There have also been several epidemic challenges like Swine Flu, Chikungunya, H1N1 etc which are not described in Ayurveda as such but public expect s remedial measures from Ayurveda. Threat s Ayurveda has a rich history and solid foundation but there is a huge gap in understanding Ayurveda according to contemporary times. Therefore it is essential to generate a lot of data to showcase the evidence based Ayurveda in order to provide cafeteria ch oice to the public and to make an impact in a bigger way. The environment, human/animal genetics/ epigenetic have changed. This is a challenge to be tackled by Ayurveda community. There has been rapid degradation of bio diversity for which several plant species as well as metals/minerals have been scarce. Raw drugs are not available in quantities Other AYUSH Research councils & modern Research/Academic organizations are also working in the field of Ayurveda and there will be great competition to come up with successful therapies/products. 7. RECOMMENDATION S 51 Recommendations With the available infrastructure, human resources (technical as well as ministerial) and financial resources, the research output of the CCRAS is appreciable qualitatively and quantitatively as per the objectives of this autonomous organization . However, the Committee recommends the following to improve the quality of research for global acceptance with better translational values: I. Required Structural Changes for Delivering Quality Research Output 1. Recruitment of Director General and delegation of power: The recruitment rules of Director General (DG) may be framed following the pattern of the ICMR. The RRs of the said post may include competent Ayurveda e xpert having suitable qualifications, outstanding experience and proven track record with administrative and managerial skills. The eligibility criteria may be devoid of restriction of having experience in a particular pay scale for a certain period , etc. The post of DG should be of the same rank as in ICMR/CSIR and under no circumstances less than the rank o f Additional Secretary with a Grade P ay of 12000/ - + NPA as admissible . The existing financial power of DG for sanction of research projects and equipment /inst rument may be enhanced up to Rs. 5 c rores. There should be at least 2 posts between upgraded pos t of DG and the Directors for proper coordination. 2. Recruitment of s cientific staff : The Committee recommends necessary changes in the Recruitment Rules of scientific staff. For this purpose , the pattern of recruitment and promotion policy for scientists as followed in ICMR (with a feeder cadre of Scientist - B) with similar Recruitment Rules and promotional avenues should be adopted. 3. Directors and In -charges: The major i nstitutes like Central Research Institutes and Regional Research Institutes may be headed by Director level official equivalent to Scientist- G level officer. The post may be appointed through Direct Recruitment wherein the preference may be given to s cientist having research experience in the CCRAS. He may be given adequate financial p ower and autonomy to conduct research on the focused mandate following norms of the ICMR. 4. Decentralization: The current pattern of centralization is causing huge burden to the CCRAS headquarters for monitoring of administrative, financial and technical asp ects. The timely monitoring which is required for quality research output is being hampered due to lack of close monitoring by the CCRAS headquarters attributed to less manpower and over burdened with different other activities. For better quality research output, it is proposed that t echnical and administrative powers may be decentralised by upgrading the CRIs/RRIs of CCRAS adopting the following: The major i nstitutes of the Council may be elevated up to the level of Central / National Research Institutes headed by Director level officers with necessary infrastructure and manpower. Twenty institutes need to be upgraded and other 52 institutes should be put under the control of the nearest Central/National Research Institutes. The post of D irector should be filled by direct recruitment process at national level. The institutes should be given functional and administrative autonomy. However, policy issues and monitoring of these institutes should be under the control of the h eadquarters . The rest of small units may be linked to a major nearby identified Central Research Institute as per feasibility. Public health related research/ research oriented outreach activities may be taken by these institutions/units. Each major i nstitute will focus on a focused mandate guided by a separate Scien tific Advisory Committee. Each c ommittee should have nominated members from the CCRAS headquarters. These nominated members will act as a bridge between DG and Director s of Institutes. Infrastructure and manpower should be provided to the institutes as per their mandate . These committees should be constituted immediately for developing and implementing the research agenda. Allocat ion of quarterly budget to the i nstitutes should be made to meet the requirement of salary, allowances, contingencies, etc. through major CRIs/RRIs in appropriate manner . Delegation of a dministrative and financial powers to meet the above requirements will be assigned and executed through the majo r CRIs/National Institutes. The CCRAS headquarters will monitor the functioning of major CRIs/National Institutes and inputs regarding functioning of other institutes will be appraised through these institutes. 5. The positions for administrative and financia l staff may be created as per the government norms. Even pooling of the senior positions among different Councils under Ministry of AYUSH may be considered for providing promotional avenues at higher level. 6. For the technical cadre , recruitment and promotio n policy of ICMR may be followed. 7. The retirement age of scientist should be increas ed to 62 years at par with ICMR. 8. The CCRAS may undertake inter -council collaboration among AYUSH systems. II. General Suggestions The core objectives of CCRAS need to be contemporary, clear and thus may be re - framed keeping in view its broad mandate as well as contemporary needs. There should be a permanent cell in each institute of the CCRAS for deciding the areas of research. The CCRAS institutes should work as nodal centers for collaboration with reputed academic and research institutions through networking for better research outcomes. There should be functional integration among various systems of medicines viz. Ayurveda, Mode rn Medicine and others. 53 Evidence -based referrals should be promoted among various systems of medicines to cater the healthcare needs of the society. There is a need for collaborati on with nearby Modern Medicine hospitals for coordinated research on disea ses for which patients are available in those hospitals. Good practitioners, academicians, researchers from Ay urvedic colleges, national institutes and other organizations should be identified to utilize their expertise for collaborative interdisciplinary research. Impact assessment study/ outcomes should be done by all the Institutes. It will help in the gaps analysis and future planning. The Research Management Information System (RMIS) may be used for preparing standardized clinical protocols and the same may be uploaded in the RMIS from time to time. Furthe r, it is recommended to upload clinical research protocols prepared by the CCRAS in the RMIS site. National clinical data management system including Ayurveda pharmaco - epidemiology may be developed. Efforts should be made to get more CCRAS instit utes to be recognized by other universities to conduct Ph.D. studies. Development of proper geriatric care facilities need priority and efforts may be made for developing guidelines for research on domestic care, Yoga, counseling, nutritional care (diet modification), and psychological support to elderly. Study on disease prevalence and effect of the treatment at OPD or outcome of the treatment may be done using the simple questionnaires , and findings should be published in the indexed journal. All the institutes should make their own website and link them with the CCRAS website. Considering the fact that AYUSH systems of medicine and modern medicine are concomitantly used, safety monitoring of integrative me dicine practices is essential to observe the drug -drug interactions. Owing to this, Pharmaco- vigilance programme may be included as one of the feature of routine activities of institutions engaged in clinical research. The CCRAS i nstitutes should continue to study various diseases prevalent in the region / country, pool data for developing guidelines ( set targets of de veloping guidelines for each year), act as nodal centers for diseases assigned to them and should be appropriately given suitable nomenclature. The CCRAS institute (s) will work on the core mandate assigned to them as \"Nodal Institutes\" and should be responsible for monitoring and coordinating such specific areas of research across the country. However, various CCRAS institutions may also work in other research area as one of the participating centre. Further, some institutes may be suitably positioned as na tional institutes which would focus on areas of national importance. As other institutes would also be focusing on such areas, the word regional may be removed and such institutes other than National may be named as CCRAS - Research Institute/ Centers/Units by defined criteria of its strength and role. 54 All CCRAS institutions should submit the action plan within three months according to CCRAS Vision 2030. III. Research -specific Suggestions Vision 2030 should synergize with National Health Policy and goals defined by Niti Ayog from time to time. Holistic approach of Ayurveda a) The holistic approach of Ayurveda should be promoted instead of focusing on isolation of active principles while formulating R&D. b) The holistic approach of Ayurveda includes medicines, dietetics and lifestyle, which should be considered for research. The factors such as seasonal variations and geographical locations responsible for therapeutic efficacy may be considered. c) The research should be focused on developing special validation methods for Ayurveda research based on the principles of Ayurveda taking into consideration the holistic approach and not thinking about drug development alone. Emphasis on non- communicable d iseases (NCDs) may be laid down and executed as long-term strategy. Chronic kidney failure, autoimmune diseases, hormonal disorders and vector borne diseases, etc. are other productive areas for research in Ayurveda. While evaluating complementary tools and strategies, cohort studies on multi drug re sistant tuberculosis (MDRTB ), etc. may be undertaken. Standardization and stability studies of Ayurvedic drugs should be focused to prove their efficacy . The drug- drug interaction of Ayurveda drugs with allopathic drugs in prevalent diseases like Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension s hould also be prioritized. Dietetic and lifestyle m odifications and concept of incompatible diet should be emphasized as research areas for clinical trials. Protocols developed by ICMR -CCRAS collaboration may be taken forward for wider utility. Drug selection should be as per the principles and concepts of Ayurveda. The CCRAS should identify and focus on at least five areas where Ayurveda can be made part of public health of our country. Focus should be on whole system approach of Ayurveda. Stand alone Ayurveda and Ayurveda intervention as add- on therapy may be studied for generating adequate scientific evidence to mainstream Ayurveda in India's health care system. Priority may be accorded to generate evidences on i ntegrative health care. Robust and periodic m onitoring of the research projects should be done to improve the quality . Studies on availability of raw material and GACP , etc. need to be prioritized. There should be appropriate selection of speci es of plant(s) use d for research. 55 The Council may explore the possibility to study Ayurveda / health g limpses from other non- medical literature. The CCRAS may facilitate research to o ther research organization/academic institutes other than conducting research on its own, and specialized funding system for collaborative research in Ayurveda may be evolved. The outcomes of completed research projects and public health programme may be analyzed, interpreted and published based on the guidelines/trends and evidence based treatment regimen may be evolved for public utility. The CCRAS should develop research networking and monitoring system for effective implementation of research work. In addition to various chronic non- communicable diseases (NCDs) and other lifestyle disorders, mother and child health, mental health etc the CCRAS should also focus on viral diseases such as Chikungunya, Dengue, etc. The unpublished data of the completed pr ojects may be immediately published by the Council. Mechanisms may be proposed for faster analysis and publication in future. Meta analysis of the studies conducted so far should be done and accorded priority. Consultancy regarding NABH may be sought for accreditation process. Special focus should be given for research in Sowa -Rigpa system of medicine in the field of literary research, conservation of medicinal plants and clinical research. The committee recommends that since the ethical issues are dynam ic and several regulatory changes are happening, it is important that workshops should be organized for chairpersons and members of all IECs and IAECs as well as organization/institutions committee dealing with Intellectual Proprietary Rights (IPR). Protoc ols developed by the ICMR may be studied and adapted accordingly with addition of Ayurvedic parameters; eventually integrated research protocols must be developed. IV. Publication- specific Suggestions The system for p roper and robust documentation, analysis and publication of researches in CCRAS system should be strengthened. An appropriate positioning of outcome of research should be done by the CCRAS through appropriate media/advertisement to improve the visibility of the outcome of research across all stakeholders. The q uality of journals published by the CCRAS should be improved and should be accorded priority. The authentic and quality literature of Ayurveda should be disseminated globally for propagation and promotion of system in right direction. The observational studies based on the experience/ data of OPD should be published. For this purpose, suitable mec hanism may be evolved for proper documentation and analysis of hospital data. The old title 'Bulletin of the Indian Institute of History of Medicine (which was indexed in Pubmed) should be retrieved instead of Journal of Indian Medical Heritage (JIMH) as t here are several issues involved in indexing and citations due to change in 56 the Journa l's title. Whatever strategy is decided and found workable, negotiations should target continued indexing. V. Other Suggestions (Infra structure, Human Resource and Financial Empowerment etc.) Infrastructure and manpower may be reassessed as per the mandate for strengthening the CCRAS Institutes and also learning from ICMR/CSIR pattern. The Committee recommends t hat for optimum output, all vacant positions should be filled on priority. The Committee recommends that immediate steps should be taken for correcting the classification, revival of the post s and filling -up of vacant posts. A committee headed by DG, CCRAS may be empowered to take corrective actions. Considering the m andate assigned to the institutes, the Committee feels the requirement of three -fold increase in the existing manpower . At least 300 scientists from Ayurveda and 200 basic medical scientists are required to deliver research output. Further, it is observed that there is no provision for recruitment of special ists; therefore contractual part -time consultants may be appointed wherever required. Equipment, infrastructure should be developed to strengthen research on fundamental principles of Ayurveda. Funding for research needs to be enhanced by Ministry of AYUSH. The Committee recom mends that in -situ promotions and adequate career progression opportunities (suggested on ICMR pattern) should be provided for improving the motivation of the scientists. Finance management software should be adopted by the C ouncil which will be governed centrally. A quantum jump of at least 3 times of the current budget allocation is recommended to meet the salary component of all filled positions, equipping/upgrading the lab s, construction of already in principle agreed buildings with modern instrumentation and proportionally increased scientific programmes. VI. Capacity Building Periodically, capacity building programme such as CME should be conducted by the CCRAS as a routin e programme for their scientists and m inisterial staff. Further, the CCRAS scientists should also participate in the CME's conducted by other organizations/ institutes. These programmes should focus on research planning, management and scientific writing. There is a need to develop master trainers among CCRAS scientists and modules for interdisciplinary research. There is a need to ident ify a nodal centre for training in Ayurveda research. In -house expertise for the Council's scientists should be enhanced. The frequency of organizing workshops, trainings and seminars should be increased for propagation of Ayurveda. The Committee recommends that the CCRAS should maintain a comprehensive database of all the people particip ated in workshops/ undergone different trainings/ courses, etc., frequently ascertain the needs and schedule events accordingly. The 57 CCRAS should maintain and update electronic database of experts available throughout the country . Postdoctoral research fel lowship scheme in Ayurveda should be initiated by the CCRAS. The movement of fellows from Ayurveda to Modern Sciences and vice versa for a defined period may be encouraged. VII. Outreach A ctivities : The outreach activities viz Integration of Ayurveda in National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio- vascular diseases and stroke (NPCDCS) , Tribal Health Clinical Research Programme (THCRP ), Schedule Caste Sub- Plan (S CSP) should be continued, and outcome of Ayurveda intervention and data on correlation of diseases with dietetic and environmental factors should be published. For Tribal Health Care Research Program , collaboration may be made with National Institute for Research in Tribal Health, Jabalpur to develop a strategy to t ake up collaborative works as well as to identify and fill the gaps. The folk claims collected with regard to the mandate of the CCRAS institute should be further scrutinized and taken up for observational clinical studies. Owing to the importance of outreach health programmes such as THCRP , Integration of NPCDCS, Swasthya Rakshan Programme (SRP), Ayurveda Mobile Health Programme (SCSP), clinical and outreach programmes are very important . These may be extended and about 300 addit ional manpower, either permanent or contractual , may be engaged to meet the requirements and ensure their effective functioning. VIII. Institutional Network and Broad Research Topic for Collaborative and Interdisciplinary R esearch The CCRAS should develop l inkages with other reputed research organizations of excellence / departments viz. ICMR, CSIR, DBT, DST and other academic institutes in vicinit y as per the requirement to deliver quality research output. Ayurveda chair(s) may be established in academic i nstitutes / universities at national level to promote interdisciplinary research and to liaison with other institutes. Scientists from modern medicine should also be taken as chairs in the CCRAS institutions depending upon their contribution and needs for a specific period. The CCRAS scientists should be encouraged to develop multidisciplinary projects with non- CCRAS institutes acquiring complementary capability and strength which should be submitted to ot her agencies like ICMR/DBT/DST/DRDO, etc. for funding. The up- gradation of different laboratories must be taken up in a time -bound manner. Since a number of new scientists have joined CCRAS recently , some of them along with existing scientists should be trained in molecular techniques so that this wor k may be initiated in near future. Further, the collaboration with other organizations like ICMR/CSIR/DST/DBT , etc. should be established through network project mode. 58 INSTITUTE- WISE RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations for NIIMH , Hyderabad Electronically searchable books may be prepared instead of printed books. Presently , available e- books on Caraka samhita, Sushruta samhita , etc., should be appended with English translation for wider dissemination and utility. Fire-proof mechanism should be adopted for protection of books and exhibits. Display of portraits of Caraka, Sushruta, Vagbhata and other luminaries of AYUSH systems should be done according to historical age. The work on Ayurveda encyclopedia should be continued. The Collection and Digitization of Medical Manuscripts and Rare Books (CDMM Project) in a phase -wise manner by cov ering all the states of India should be taken up. All the books/ works listed under First Schedule of Dru gs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 should be collected and retrieved. A centralized repository of manuscripts/ books (including translations and published editions) of First Schedule both in print and digital format should be maintained at the CCRAS h eadquarters/ NIIMH , Hyderabad. E-books appended with English translation should be made available for Schedule I books, so that the information scattered in several works can be found at one place which facilitate easy content search. Copies of the S chedule I books available at TKDL should be obtained by NIIMH. This work should be taken up in collaboration with PCIM&H and digitization of books should also be undertaken. Institute's expert committee comprising software professionals should be constituted to provide guidance and review of software development programmes before launching on the website. 'AYUSH Knowledge Portal' should be designed in which clinical protocols, treatment protocols, guidelines, case reports, clinical case records, informa tion of Schedule I books, materials database, research updates and all relevant information about AYUSH systems of medicine may be uploaded. The software models followed by National Institute of Health (NIH), USA which maintains powerful search engines like PUBMED may be studied/ emulated for development of AYUSH Knowledge Portal. Recommendations for RARISD, Vijayawada The Institute must publish observational studies and ensure that there should be proper documentation of clinical therapies. Observational studies on skin and allergic disorders in addition to clinical trials should be given priority. Research studies on Raktamokshana (therapeutic blood- letting) should be carried out at the Institute. The Institute should convene an annual meeting on s kin dis orders at Vijayawada every year to explore the strengths of Ayurveda in s kin healthcare and to address the gaps. 59 Recommendation s for RARIM&CH, Nagpur: The folk claims collected with regard to maternal and child health may be further scrutinized and taken up for observational clinical studies. Protocols on mother and child health should be developed to carry out clinical research with RARIMCH as a Nodal Institute in association with other institutes. The following studies/plans should be initiated and impl emented wit h an objective to be included in National Health Programme in the next 4 -5 years : i. Antenatal care in collaboration with the CCRAS - Institute(s) dealing with diet, dietetics and nutrition viz., Bangalore, Mandi ii. Adolescent anae mia with Punarnavdimandura and Dhtrloha. iii.

He also presented the key issues for interactions. Dr. D.C. Katoch , Advisor (Ayurveda), Ministry of AYUSH, delivered his preliminary remarks. It was followed by introduc tion of all the members. Dr. V.M. Katoch , Chairman -Review Committee of CCRAS addressed the house and informed the purpose of the interactive meet. He expressed that the former review of CCRAS done by Nityanand Committee may or may not have been implemented due to certain constraints of infrastructure and manpower. So this committee has taken steps to appreciate the ground level situation of working of CCRAS and invited the suggestions of members of SAB as they are the main advisor s for all scient ific works of CCRAS. He highlighted that the documentation and publication of all experiences and research es in the field of Ayurveda should be done in a prioritized manner. With these comments, he welcomed al l the members of SAB and invited their views. Dr. H.M. Chandola, Chairman Scientific Advisory Board(SAB) welcomed the effort s of CCRAS for review of the work done so far. He emphasized that the research should be conducted in such a way that the principle s of Ayurveda are neither compromised nor negle cted. Further, the studies to globalize the Ayurveda should be prioritized and holistic approach of Ayurveda should be preserved instead of focusing on isolation of active principles . He also appreciated the effort of CCRA S to standardize the Prakriti assessment questionnaire which is the ba se of all further research in Ayurveda . He also added that interdisciplinary research in Ayurveda with the collaboration of other systems is the need of the hour. He expressed his hope for Ayurveda to become the medicine of millennium. Dr. V.M. Katoch, Chairman Review Committee opined that while scientific validation, the sanctity of Ayurveda should be maintained. Dr. S.K. Maulik, Professor, Department of Pharmacology, AIIMS New Delhi & Member SAB, expressed that the CCRAS has put a lot of effort to validate the drug/therapy which is the need of the hour. He put emphasis on s tandardization and stability studies of Ayurvedic drugs which are essentially required to prove the efficacy of the drugs . Animal studie s should 77 not be much emphasized unless Safety/toxicity studies are required due to lack of sufficient evidence. Utmost care should be taken on the designing of the study protocol in association with v ery good bio- statisticians; else the false positive resul t outcomes may be there. The research in Ayurveda should be carried out in modern medicine setups. All the traditional system s of Ayurveda should be revalidated with appropriate designing and well documented. The documentation of complementary effects should also be well documented. He suggested revivingof the Pharmaco -vigilance centre which was functioning at I.P.G.T. & RA, Jamnagar . Dr. V.M. Katoch, Chairman Review Committee expressed tha t Ayurveda has a legacy of 5000 years and its strength should be projected where modern medicine has limitations. Data from CCRAS centres on diseases being currently effectively being treated with Ayurvedic system/ drugs will provide some inputs to move fo rward. Prof. V.K. Kapoor , Member - SAB, expressed his views that the Biomedical scientists are reluctant to accept Ayurvedic medicines due to lack of documentation of their efficacy and safety . He stressed that t he research should be carried out by taking the drug as a whole ast he molecule based approach may not be appropriate for Ayurvedic drugs .He listed some important research areas viz. Leismaniasis, Filariasis , Skin diseases, Arthritis , Liver diseases etc. where Ayurveda has great strength in comparison to other systems . He further added that it is high time to see functional integration among various systems of medicines viz. Ayurveda, Modern Medicine and Bio- Medicine etc. He further suggested that it is advisable to carry safety studies o n Ayurveda drugs before clinical research and the drug -drug interaction should also be studied scientifically. Dr. V.M. Katoch, Chairman Review Committee welcomed the suggestions of conducting drug- drug interaction studies including medicines being used in other systems like Allopathy with Ayurvedic drugs which people may take for chronic diseases like diabetes and or may be required for health problems like cancer for a perfect holistic approach and better acceptance. Dr. D .C.Katoch, Advisor (Ayurveda), Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India opined that the term 'Integrative Health care' is more appropriate instead of ' Integrative Medicine' .The research should be focused on developing special validation methods for Ayurveda research based on the principles of Ayurveda as the contemporary guidelines of research may not be perfectly suitable for Ayurveda research. Protocol s developed on the GTP Scheme and protocol s developed during the period of Dr. Satyavati may also be revisited. Dr. V.M. Katoch, Chairman Review Committee expressed that the fractionation of Ayurveda drugs may possess harmful effects but the drug as a whole from the plant component may be safer. Dr. Bhusan Patawardhan in his view stated that Swasthavritta and Basic principles are the integral components of Ayurveda and accordingly the Dietetic & life style modifications should be emphasized as research areas for clinical trials. 78 Dr. K.K. Sijoria, Former Principal, A&U Tibbia College, New Delhi suggested that the identification of a potent variety of the species with better efficacy needs to be selected for preparing a formulation for the clinical trial. Dr. Va santha Muthuswamy, Former Sr. Deputy Director General, ICMR expressed that Ayurveda has a great field to work in the areas where modern medicine has limitations. Thus the gray area s should be identified and the strength of Ayurveda should be focused. The study should be carried out as per the principle s of Ayurveda . She further added that modern medicine and Ayurveda have their own methods of evaluation. We can adopt either i.e. modern tools or Ayurveda tools for establishing Ayurveda research and treatment. She further informed that certain protocols were developed by ICMR -CCRAS collaboration, which can be taken forward. Ayurveda needs to work for global acceptance in coming era. Dr. V.M. Katoch, Chairman Review Committee appreciated the suggestions given by Dr.V.Muthuswamy . He further suggest ed that referrals should be promoted among various systems of medicines in favor of society for a better results and promotion of all systems. Dr. V.K. Joshi, Professor & Head, Deptt. of Dravyaguna , Faculty of Ayurveda, IMS, BHU, Varanasi emphasized mainly on the appropriate understanding/ interpretation of the terminology/concepts of Ayurveda and its application in modern contexts. He also highlighted the need of development of human resources in t he field of Ayurveda for conducting research as per the principle s& concept s of Ayurveda in appropriate manner. He suggested that dietetic research is an important area as according to Ayurveda diet is as good as drug. He also laid emphasis on the proper documentation of all the researches and experiences. Drug selection should be as per the principle s and concep ts of Ayurveda. Appropriate selection of drugs may be the major focus in the field of research. Vd. Devendra Triguna, renowned Ayurvedic Physician expressed his views that the research should be focused on fun damental principles of Ayurveda . Moreover, for uplifting the research in peripheral institutes, efforts should be made to collaborate with local physicians / practitioners and take their views. Regarding the human resource development, he emphasized that the officers should be trained ti me to time for brushing and updating their knowledge. He highlighted that most of the time CCRAS officers are busy with the outreach activities like Arogya Melas, Exhibitions etc. working as impediment to the research .

Dr. Lama Chosphel Z otpa highlighted the need of c onservation of m edicinal plant species for development of Sowa -Rigpa system of medicine . Prof. H.B. Singh, mainly emphasized on the r egulations and trading of raw material as the standards of a drug is based on the quality of raw material . Dr. V.M. Katoch , Chairman of Review Committee in his remarks expressed that all the CCRAS peripheral Inst itutions should collaborate with Allopathic and other institutions for research in Ayurveda . CCRAS should develop the guidelines for all kin ds of research in Ayurveda to facilitate research collaboration with other organisations/Researchers. He laid great emphasis on the quality publications of research finding s. Experiences of stalwarts of Ayurveda may be documented for dissemination of knowledge. He also stated that the mandate of the Institute should be decided as per feasibility. Further, he focused on the drug interaction study and expressed that it is seriously required as people may be taking Ayurvedic drugs along with the Allopathi c drugs in all cases of chronic and non- communicable diseases. He also stated that the d rug with new indication should be evolved. Dr Katoch also emphasized on adequate funding, robustness of mechanisms and also financial autonomy. The following recommendations emerged out of the discussion : CCRAS institut es should work as nodal centres for collaboration with reputed academic and research institutions through networking for better research outcomes. Infrastructure and manpower may be reassessed as per the mandate for strengthening the CCRAS Institutes and also learning from ICMR/CSIR pattern. There is a need of documentation and publication of researches in the field of Ayurveda in a systematic manner . Holistic approach of Ayurveda should be prese rved instead of focusing on isolation of active principles while formulating R&D . The research should be focused on developing special validation methods for Ayurveda research based on the principles of Ayurveda taking into consideration the holistic approach and not think about drug development alone . Emphasis on Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) may be l aid down should be done as long term strategy . Funding for research need to be enhanced by Ministry of AYUSH. Pay scales of Researchers and promotion avenues should be at par with other research organizations and accordingly it may be enhanced. Standardization and stability studies of A yurvedic drugs should be focused to prove the efficacy of the drugs. 80 There should be functional integration among various systems of medicines viz. Ayurveda, M odern Medicine and others . The drug -drug interaction of Ayurveda drugs should also be prioritized . Dietetic & life style modifications , concept of incompatible diet shoul d be emphasized as research areas for clinical trials. Protocols developed by ICMR -CCRAS collaboration may be taken forward for wider utility . Evidence based referrals should be promoted among various systems of medicines to care the healthcare needs of the society. Drug selection should be as per the principles and concepts of Ayurveda. Efforts should be made to collaborate with local physicians / practitioners and take their views. Vigorous training on research methodology and concepts of Ayurveda to scientists of CCRAS is the need of the hour for improving the quality of research and publications. Chronic kidney failure , Auto immune diseases , Hormonal disorders and Vector borne diseases etc. are other productive areas for research in Ayurveda. Cohort studies on MDRTB etc. may be undertaken. Need of conservation of medicinal plant species for development of Sowa -Rigpa system of medicine. The financial power of DG, CCRAS should be enhanced.

Office, New Delhi under the Chairmanship of Dr. V.M. Katoch , Former Secretary Department of Health Research and Former D.G., ICMR. The list of officials is appended at Annexure -I At the outset, Dr. N. Srikanth , Deputy Director General, CCRAS expressed hi s welcome note and presented the background of the interactive meet highlighting the Terms of References (ToRs) of Review Committee. He also presented the key issues for interactions. He informed about various Scientific Advisory Groups of the Council viz. Clinical Research, Drug Development, Literary Research and Fundamental Research to the Review Committee. Dr. V.M. Katoch , Chairman - Review Committee of CCRAS addressed the house and expressed that Ayurveda is gaining popularity, it always had good acceptance among the masses and it is important to generate tangible evidence supporting this ancient knowledge system. Further he expressed that the recommendations of earlier review of CCRAS do ne by Nityanand Committee may or may not have been implemente d due to certain constraints of infrastructure and manpower. So this committee has taken steps to appreciate the ground level situation of CCRAS and invited the suggestions of members of SA G of CCRAS for recommending the future roadmap, scope, feasibility of integration and extent of collaboration. With these initial comments he welcomed all the members of SA G and invited their views. Dr. Atmanand, Member -Review Committee of CCRAS suggested to re -work on vision document of CCRAS. He emphasized that targets should be fixed taking into account in the managerial prospective. He further stressed upon the implementation of research findings, SWOT Analysis of CCRAS institutes to minimize the weaknesses and maximize the strength of the Council and the system. Dr. Bhusan Patawardhan , Member - Review Committee of CCRAS stated that presently the focus on drug research but it is a need of hour to concentrate on preventive measures documented in Ayurveda. He stressed upon the proper & robust documentation and sugges ted to work on at least five areas where Ayurveda may become a part of public health system . Prof. Y.K. Gupta, Member - Review Committee of CCRAS emphasized on optimal use of human resources, he stated that human resources in Ayurveda is much less as compared to modern medicine. Further he suggested that the Council should make all possible efforts for motivation of currently available human resources. He also stated that experience by long practice of Ayurveda has to be converted into evidence based document. There is a tremendous scope of using Ayurvedic drugs as adjuvant therapy to Cancer, Tuberculosis, Diabetes and Auto immune disorders etc. He emphasized on collaboration with modern system especially for development of protocols. 85 Dr. K.D. Sharma, Chairman of Litera ture Research emphasized that research should be focused on fundamentals of Ayurveda and epidemic diseases. He also suggested that there should be proper monitoring of the collaborative projects for better outcomes. Further he stressed to update the training programmes . Dr. Nandini Kumar, Chairman of Clinical Research emphasized that the expertise of Ayurveda should be improved so that it is globally accepted. She stated that availability of appropriate raw material- plants grown in proper conditions is an important issue which needs to be addressed on priority basis. She suggested utilizing the protocols developed under GTP scheme. She also emphasized on the necessity for the capacity building of researchers. Dr. K .K. Srivastava, Chairman of Drug Development expressed that upgradation is needed at CCRAS . He stressed upon improving the quality of journals published by CCRAS . Dr. V.K. Joshi, Member - Drug Development emphasized on appropriate selection of species of plant while carrying out drug standardization and opinion from an expert of Dravyaguna may be taken . Dr. B. Ramarao, Member - Litera ture Research suggested that besides study of Ayurvedic literature, Council may explor e the possibility to study Ayurveda / Health Glimpses from other non- medical literature. Dr. Kamalesh Sharma, Member - Litera ture Research stated that the Council has limited human and other resources, therefore efforts may be made to identify good practitioners, academicians, researchers from Ayurvedic Colleges and other organizations and utilize their expertise. Dr. Mahesh Vyas, Member - Litera ture Research suggested that manuscripts availa ble in various libraries should be explored by CCRAS and efforts may be made to publish available commentaries. He also opined to develop equipment, infrastructure to substantiate the research on fundamental principles of Ayurveda. Dr. Geetha Krishnan, Member - SAG, Basic Sciences & Fundamental Research opined that there is a need to develop protocols in areas where Ayurveda research is required like viral diseases. He further added that CCRAS may facilitate research to other research organiza tions/academic institutes since research needs a very specialized infrastructure. Thus Council can lead research as a promoter. Prof. Tanuja Nesari , Member - SAG, Basic Sciences & Fundamental Research suggested that there is a need to develop a separate cell for integrative Ayurveda Biology. We need to rethink about the parameters required to validate Ayurveda. A special mechanism is to be developed for auditing, enforcement and monitoring mechanism for research. She further added that CCRAS has a good inte llectual expertise which can be utilized in a better way. Dr. Tanmay Goswami, Member SAG, Drug Development express that research in Ayurveda needs a global touch. The authentic and quality literature of Ayurveda should be disseminated globally for propagat ion and promotion of system in right direction. He also suggested some area where research data needs to be generated i.e. astronomy and bio -astronomy. Some other areas for Ayurvedic research suggested by him are - Sports medicine , Dental care, and Cosmetics & Ayurveda diagnostics. 86 Dr. V.M. Katoch appreciated the remarks of Dr. Tanmay Goswami. He articulated that w hile allopathy has strength in Emergency medicine and S urgery, it has limitations in treating cancer, chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis etc. thus Ayurveda has a good scope. Prof. P.K. Prajapati , Member, SAG, Basic & Fundamental Research and Clinical Research opined that evidence based is the need of the hour and the data should be generated accordingly. He further added that the facilities and infrastructure for research should be improved and the financial powers delegated to DG, CCRAS should be enhanced in view of the same. Dr. Pawan Godatwar , Member, S AG, Basic & Fundamental Research emphasized that the research should focus on the needs of the clinician also. It is imperative to study drug -drug interaction in present scenario. He suggested certain modalities for human resource development i.e. CME's & seminars on scientific writing, research methodology etc. he further added a nodal center should be identified for trainings in Ayurveda research. Dr. V.M. Katoch appreciated the comments and added that data is required for evidence based medicine and maki ng recommendations for the use of Ayurveda specially in the light of movement towards integrative medicine . He further opined that documentation and quality of research papers including their citation are important. Meta analysis of work done has to be giv en top priority. Dr. S.K. Mishra , Member, SAG, Basic & Fundamental Research expressed his opinion that there is big shortage of officers and staff in the various institutes of Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences. Every institute must be headed by a Director with two Deputy Directors and other Technical and non- technical officers and staff for proper output and time bound result s. He suggested that Scientific Advisory Committee and Scientific Advisory Groups should be called at least twice a year for review of progress and guidance. Further, there is need for collaboration with nearby Modern Medicine Hospitals for coordinated research on diseases for which patients are available in those hospitals and t hose programmes should be given priority, the result s of which may be more beneficial for Ayurvedic profession. The research outcomes which are not much satisfactory should be analyzed and further strengthened so that outcome may be beneficial and wastage of money can be avoided. Every institute should have a local Scientific Advisory Committee so that timely advice and benefits of their experience are available. Networking with nearby Ayurvedic as well as other relevant institutions should be collaborative institutions for research for mutual benefit. Dr. B. Ravi Shankar , Member, SAG, Drug Development opined that strengthening of human resource and infrastructure are very important issues. There should be a permanent cell in each institute of CCRAS for deciding the areas of research. It has been observed that Individual components have different efficacies while their combined m ixture has different efficacies. Thus such facts have to be analyzed through research. He fu rther added that bio informatics facility should be developed by CCRAS. Dr. Anand Choudhary , Member, SAG, Drug Development suggested that the doses of Ayurveda medicines need to be revised in the current scenario of diminished individual strength of the pa tients. He further opined that we can develop some new dosage forms which 87 are palatable and more acceptable to the patients. He further added that the research aptitude should be inculcated at graduation level so that the student can develop it in better w ay by the end of his/her educ ation . Funding system for research in Ayurveda needs to strengthened. The workshops and training seminars can be enhanced for propagation of Ayurveda . He also suggested that the officers of CCRAS should work in a unidirectional focus i.e. research and their diversion in other activities such as mela etc. should be avoided. Dr. V.M. Katoch, welcomed his suggestions. Dr. Paresh C. Tripathi, Member, SAG, Clinical Research informed that holistic approach of Ayurveda includes medicines, dietetics and lifestyle. He further added that inter disciplinary and multi dimensional research is important for Ayurveda. Further he added that collaborations are required for research since Ayurveda OPDs of a particular institution might have limited number of patients of specific disease conditions. He opined that cultivation of fresh herbs and their processing under GMP is important to get quality results in research . Post marketing studies may also be useful . Prof. O.P. Gupta, Member, SA G, Clinical Research, stated that Ayurvedic parameters should be incorporated in designing research protocols. Further he emphasized to consider the factors such as seasonal variation s and geographical location responsible for therapeutic efficacy. Dr. Ram Manohar , Member, SAG, Clinical Research laid emphasis on creating web based system and to develop mechanism so that research funding may be provided to the organizations working in the field of Ayurveda. Further he suggested revamp ing of AYUSH research portal. He also opined that the Ayurvedic practices in country should be documented properly. Dr. Atul Juneja, Member, SAG, Clinical Research stated that the council has limited human resource and it is essential to design trainers programme for capacity building. Following recommendation s emerged out of the discussion : Scientific Advisory Committee and Scientific Advisory Groups should be calle d at least twice a year for review of progress and guidance. Every CCRAS institute mu st be headed by a Director and other Technical and non- technical officers and staff as per CSIR/ICMR pattern for proper output and time bound results . Optimal utilization of human resources should be done for better output. SWOT Analysis of CCRAS institutes should be carried out to minimize the weaknesses and maximize the strength of the Council and the system. There is need for collaboration with nearby Modern Medicine Hos pitals for coordinated research on diseases for which patients are available in those hospitals and t hose programmes should be given priority, the results of which may be more beneficial for promotion and growth of Ayurvedic profession. Budget for research should be enhanced by Mini stry of AYUSH for quality research outcomes . 88 It may be necessary to r e-work on vision document of CCRAS focusing on collaboration, implementation and publication of research. Meta analysis of the studies conducted so far should be done and accorded priority. Proper & robust documentation should be given priority. CCRAS should identify and focus on at least five areas where Ayurveda can be made part of public health of our country. Focus should be on whole system approach of Ayurveda. Quality of journals published by CCRAS should be improved and should be accorded priority . Nearby Ayurvedic/ other relevant institutions should be networked as collaborative institutions for research for mutual benefit. Collaboration with modern system especially for development of protocols. Stand alone Ayurveda and Ayurveda intervention as add -on therapy may be studied for generating adequate scientific evidence to mainstream Ayurveda in India's health care system. Priority may be accorded to generate evidences on Integrative health care. Robust and Periodic Monitoring of the research projects to improve the quality of research . Studies on availability of raw material and GACP etc. needs to be prioritized . There sh ould be appropriate selection of species of plant used for research. Council may explore the possibility to study Ayurveda / Health Glimpses from other non- medical literature. Identify good practitioners, academicians, researchers from Ayurvedic Colleges and other organizations and utilize their expertise f or collaborative interdisciplinary research . Develop equipment, infrastructure to substantiate the research on fundamental principles of Ayurveda. CCRAS may facilitate research to other resea rch organization/ academic institutes other than conducting research on its own and specialized funding system for collaborative research in Ayurveda may be evolved. There is a need to rethink about the parameters required to validate Ayurveda . A special mechanism is to be developed for auditing, enforcement and monitoring mechanism for research. The authentic and quality literature of Ayurveda should be disseminated globally for propagation and promotion of system in right direction.

NITYA ANAND) ON THE RESEARCH WORK AND FUNCTIONING OF CCRAS (2004 -2007) Executive Summary 1. Perspective of R&D on Ayurveda and Siddha Systems of Medicine (A&SM Large sections of Indian people use A&SM drugs. It is essenti al to ensure that drugs of A & SM are of standard quality, proven safety and efficacy evidenced by acceptable modern methodology, and enforced by Regulatory Authority. ): A&SM are important components of the total health care system in India. Like modern system of medicine these systems also needs strong base of research and development to keep them contemporary. There is growing interest in the A&SM drugs in the developed world also: (a) for conditi ons for which modern drugs are inadequate or not available and Ayurveda has special strength such as for lifestyle diseases; (b) non -communicable diseases which are the focus of attention in the West at present are multi -factorial in origin and are more likely to respond to multi -component drugs, which A&SM drugs are, and are, therefore, attracting much attention; (c) the \"holistic\" view of Ayurveda, both for preventive/promotive health and for therapeutics, taking an integrated view of different body funct ions is close to Systems Biology perspectives an d is attracting much attention. For all this an in -depth application of modern scientific and technological advances to the knowledge and practices of A&SM is needed to make a more effective use of this rich resource and bring A&SM into the mainstream of medical science and health care. 2. Prospect : CCRAS, with its constituent research institutions, offers a useful platform to build on to exploit the opportunities offered by the rich resource of Ayurveda & Siddha Systems of Medicines for healthcare. However, to get the optimal benefits from A&SM very well equipped and staffed R&D laboratories are required, which should not only be as good but for certain studies be even better equipped than the common modern drug research laboratories. The herbal and herbo -mineral drugs of traditional systems are \"compounded\" mixtures and more difficult to analyze and standardize than commonly used synthetic drugs of modern system of medicine. This requires special equipments and 140 facilities, which must be provided in the CCRAS laboratories. Only then these laboratories will be able to meet the above objectives. The common mindset that for studies on traditional systems drugs rudimentary R&D facilities would do must be changed; rese arch on A&SM needs well equipped R&D laboratories as modern drug research does. The CCRAS must have first rate laboratories, with GCP grade clinical trial capabilities to fulfill the expectations from them. But very few of the CCRAS laboratories come anywh ere close to this. This situation must be changed. 3. The thrust of this report is to emphasize the creation of such \"state of the art\" facilities so that CCRAS can meet its objectives and fulfil its mission of providing drugs of the right quality. The structure and functioning of R&D Institutions of CCRAS : Presen t Status of R&D at CCRAS Institutions CCRAS and its Institutions as they are structured and functioning today leave much to be desired Research output: In the R&D work, though standardization, safety studies and clinical evaluation of som e classical Ayurvedic and Siddha Medicines (A&SM) have been carried out but the overall R&D output was observed to be rather inadequate, and not commensurate with the number of research institutions. There could be varied reasons for this, but the major reasons the committee felt were lack of competent and well -trained staff and poor infrastructure. For example, both standardization for quality and establishing safety and clinical efficacy of classical A&S drugs are set objectives. But the sequence necessar y in the drug standardization studies had so far not been followed in most of the studied due to insufficient infrastructure and manpower, which made most of the work infructuous and unproductive. Such studies require first standardizing the methods of manufacture and establishing quality standards, followed by animal toxicity and then clinical testing of the . In their present status and set up, these laboratories are not likely to be able to contribute much to achieve their avowed objectives. Most of the laboratories are grossly under -staffed, poorly equipped and most with inadequate infrastructure. The service conditions of the staff are also very unsatisfactory and unlikely to attract or retain good talent. Most of the staff members have not had a promotion for over a decade and some had even retired in the grade in which they joined due to non- availability of promotional channel. The staff must be nurtured well to get the best out of them. The service conditions for the staff and the infrastructure for R&D must be vastly improved to achieve the above objectives. 141 standardized drugs, which has by and large not been followed. There has to be proper prioritization of the involved steps in each study. Similarly the clinical trials carried out have been conducted with inadequate numbers and not properly statistically analyzed, and, therefore, the results are not dependable. The sequence of studies suggested in the report for standardization of classical drugs should be strictly followed to make the work meaningful and productive. The committee was satisfied to note that for the last few years standardization of A&SM drugs and developing suitable protocols for clinical evaluation are getting the importance they deserve and it is planned to carry out the future clinical trials with suitably standardized drugs, adhering strictly to the protocols developed. The Committee would emphasize that this must be rigorously followed and monitored. For this clinical trial monitors s hould be a must. 4. (A) Developing Quality Control Standard of Classical A&S Medicines: This ought to be the prime objective of CCRAS laboratories. Although these standardization studies should extend from cultivation/collection of botanical raw materials to the final formulated A&S drugs as they are used, but as first priority CCRAS should undertake the standardization for quality control of classical A&S drugs used: (a) which are more commonly consumed by people, and (b) those used for conditions for which modern system drugs are not available or inadequate and in which Ayurveda and Siddha Systems have some special strengths. Such areas have been identified and listed in the body of the report. Supplementar y to this list should be the A&S drugs manufactured and marketed by factories or production units supported by AYUSH. A committee at CCRAS Hq. may be formed to identify/select around 100 such classical A&S drugs and allot study on these as first priority t o the CCRAS laboratories. These studies should include developing methods for their manufacture, developing QC standards, carrying out safety (toxicity) studies, followed by clinical efficacy studies and finally commercialization or introduction through State Health Departments for health care. The same committee could select a second list of around 100 important nutraceuticals and common 'Home remedies', which are largely used, for which no clinical trials would be needed, but QC standards need to be developed, and establish their safety. Work on these could also be allotted to different CCRAS laboratories meant for this work. If QC standard and clinical efficacy validation of 5 drugs of each group by each laboratory in a Prioritization of R&D studies at CCRAS Institutes 142 multicentric mode, could be carri ed out every year, it will be a significant contribution of CCRAS towards promoting A&S drugs for healthcare. (B) Study of the mode of action of classical A&S drugs: With the rapid scientific advances in biological sciences and structural biology, unpreced ented opportunities are now available to study the mode of action of A&S drugs at the molecular and even at Systems level, which can add great value to these drugs. For example it has been shown in recent studies that guggulsterones, the active constituent s of gugulipid, the classical Ayurvedic hypolipidemic drug, act through FXR, the bile acid nuclear receptor, which is a novel mode of action for lipid lowering drugs. Such studies open up new vistas for further development of existing drugs, and for new dr ug discovery research. In due course of time, all the important A&S drugs should undergo such reverse pharmacology studies to understand their mode of action. Further, the focus in drug research is shifting to non- infectious diseases, and the growing realization of the multi- factorial causation of most of them, is focusing attention on drugs acting on multiple targets, and on multi -component drugs, which A&SM drugs are. Study of their mode of action may even provide new therapeutic uses of these drugs . The study of the molecular mode of action of classical but well standardized A&SM drugs should thus be an essential part of the A&SM Drug Research Institutes and Ayurvedic Science Research Institute as suggested above, which will help to bring A&SM into the main stream of medical sciences. (C) Broad Biological Screening of A&S drugs and the plant extracts prepared therein: Screening of chemical libraries and established therapeutic agents against phenotypic and molecular targets has emerged as an importan t approach to new drug discovery research. It would be useful to subject the classical A&S drugs, which can be easily handled, and their constituent plant ingredients to screening programs to get new leads. A bank for these drugs and the plant extracts sho uld be prepared and kept in CCRAS laboratories. To begin with, these products should be got screened from outside Centers established for screening. Concurrently steps should, however, be undertaken to set up this Screening facility at one of the National Institutes recommended to be set up. This might will also uncover some new uses for old drugs. (D). Molecular Study of the Holistic concept / basis of Ayurveda/Siddha Medical Sciences: The main strength of Ayurveda lies in its integrated holistic view, both of the health practices 143 are aim ed at providing good health and long life, and their therapies take an integrated view of the whole body and not confining treatment to any one tissue or organ. The time is just ripe to demonstrate experimentally and in practical terms the importance of th is integrated view of Ayurveda and its closeness to the Systems Biology perspective of modern biology, with systematic studies at molecular level to provide an experimental basis to its \"holistic\" concept. These studies will provide a molecular and genetic basis for the Tridosha, Prakriti & related concepts of Ayurveda and in turn these terms may need some redefining understanding and adaptation. This will demonstrate the ancient -modern concordance and enrich Ayurveda and bring it into the mainstream of modern biological developments. The major thrust of the R&D of the National Research Institute of Ayurvedic Science (discussed later) should be on the scientific study of the science and practices of A&S Medical Systems. (E). Interface Between Modern System a nd A&SM Systems: An effective interface should be developed between the two, so that patients get the best of the pharmaco -economic benefits that are possible. For example, for life -threatening infectious diseases, the well established modern drugs must be used, while for common, chronic, life style and metabolic diseases like obesity, atheroscklerosis, hypertension, A&S medicines could be preferred. The modern medicine and A&S Medicine communities should be encouraged to work closely together for the healt hcare of the people. 5. Restructuring of CCRAS to Enhance Productivity: It was observed that many of the CCRAS Institutes are grossly under staffed, poorly equipped and, hence have low productivity. It is suggested that at this stage, 10 to 12 of its better staffed and equipped research institutes be chosen and developed into National level Research Institutes, in specialized areas , staffed adequately and fully equipped with a focused R&D mandate (as described in the body of the report). Each Institute must b e well equipped and have high caliber scientific staff for R&D in thespecialized areas of work including from outside the Ayurveda stream wherever needed. Each institute must have a Research Advisory Committee (RAC), which will meet as often as needed but at least once a year for 2 days to guide and monitor the R&D activity of the institute. Each discipline of work must be adequately represented in the RAC membership. The chairman of the RAC will be a member of the Scientific Advisor y Committee (SAC) of CCR AS. 144 The rest of the institutes can function as Extension Centers of the National Institutes mentioned above or function as independent healthcare centers or may be merged with the proposed National Institutes. A brief description of two such Institutions is given below to act as a model structure for the other Institutes. It is strongly recommended that these two Institutes with the required staff, infrastructure and capabilities should be created with the highest priority so that visible results start f lowing soon. (A). National Institute for Ayurveda & Siddha Drugs: These Institutes would be primarily involved in the pharmaceutical studies including development of standardized classical A&S drugs and will carry out the botanical identification and phyto chemical investigations of the desired plants, preparing the herbal products from these plants up to the pilot scale, developing quality control standards, studying their biological activities, carrying out the regulatory toxicity studies, clinical trials and documentation of all the data and preparing dossiers. The clinical study at these Institute will primarily be confined to A&S drugs being developed at the Institute for the identified therapeutic areas and will not work like general OPD & IPD as far as possible. The Institute would have the following disciplines/subjects: Pharmacognosy / Taxonomy Phytochemistry Analytical development Formulation development Microbiology Pharmacology Toxicology/Safety Pharmacology Clinical Research & Experimental Medicine Ayurvedic Information Management/Documentation Any other department needed for Institute's activities There should be five such research institutes, each one specializing for drugs of a defined disease area mentioned in the body of the report. One of these institutes should be setup without any delay. (B). National Research Institute for Ayurvedic Science: This Institute would be a basic scientific studies Institute to design and carry out experimental molecular biology and genetic studies on diffe rent doctrines and principles of Ayurveda to provide better scientific insights 145 to the integrated view of Ayurveda on the working of the human system. This Institute should have the following disciplines/subjects: Molecular & Systems Biology Genomics & Pr oteomics Study of Holistic medicine Herbo -Mineral Drugs and Nanotechnology Dietetics, Yoga and Panchakarma Division of Bioinformatics Library and Information Centre/Documentation Any other Department as needed As the National Research Institute of Ayurvedic Science will be the first institute of its kind in the country, a special attention would need to be given for the selection of its senior scientific staff and Director, who should be scientists of proven merit in the areas of molecular biology, genetics and proteomics with an understanding and commitment to study of Ayurveda. Its Research Advisory Committee should also be a mix of scientists of Ayurvedic stream and molecular biologists, and headed by an eminent Scientist, who has deep insight int o Ayurvedic Science. This institute should have great deal of inter - institutional collaboration with other institutes working on genomics, proteomics and integrative biology of CSIR, DBT or ICMR. For detailed planning and establishment of these institutes, a National Advisory Board should be constituted, which is duly empowered to take appropriate decisions so that these institutes become functional without any delay. 6. Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia (AP): Assigning the AP work to CCRAS is a welcome move. CCRAS mus t now bring out more and more monographs to cover all the important raw materials used and the more commonly used classical formulations therefrom. The CCRAS should collaborate with the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission in this work to incorporate appropria te quality control standards needed for better acceptance of A&S medicines at the National and International levels, within the mandate of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Committee. 7. Registration and Regulatory Controls of Standardized A&S Drugs for Marketing: 146 Just developing QC methods for classical Ayurvedic & Siddha drugs is not enough. It is equally important that the drugs marketed through commercial channels conform to these standards. For this a system of registration with specified methods of manufacture and QC standard would need to be put in place. A separate organization may be created to regulate the marketing of those standardized A&S drugs. CCRAS could take up this issue with the authorities concerned, and impress upon them that without this all the work done by CCRAS on standardization and QC will not have much impact. 8. Widening the Education Outreach of A&S Systems of Medicine: Education and research need to go hand in hand. In order to create greater awareness among the modern pharmaceutical sc iences and modern biology students/scientists, special courses/workshops should be designed on the science and practices of A&S systems. The following three teaching programmes, to begin with, may be introduced: 1. One optional paper in Ayurveda and Siddha Medical Sciences for the MBBS students. 2. A three months' orientation programme on A&S drugs for the Pharmaceutical Sciences/Biological Sciences. 3. Courses on GLP/GCP, Evidence based Medicine, Medical Biostatistics and Modern Biology for A&SM graduate students. This would create the required interest and understanding in the science of Ayurveda and Siddha Systems of Medicine, and help to create an interface between Ayurveda and Siddha Medical sciences with modern biology and medical science. The necessa ry steps also need to be taken to project A&S as a lucrative career option after 10 +2 to attract those students who are bright and are really interested in studying these Sciences. 9. Service conditions: This is the most serious issue with CCRAS. The ex isting salary structure and the promotional avenues are far below that of other central government research organizations and therefore, will not attract good talent to work in CCRAS laboratories. Why should the CCRAS research staff be at an inferior level to other central government research organizations such as CSIR, ICMR, if these institutes are expected to be scientifically as productive? Due to poor service conditions and poor promotional avenues, it is observed that many scientists have already left and some more are likely to leave CCRAS. This should be viewed seriously for immediate remedial measures. It is strongly recommended that the 147 same service conditions and salary structure as exist in ICMR/CSIR institutions, should be adopted for CCRAS and its research institutions . The same rigorous selection process for Scientific & Technical Staff should be adopted & followed. No ad- hoc appointment should be made as it is non- productive in the long term. CCRAS must also have a fully developed Research F ellowship Program as an essential component of the human resource development. This will provide both a great deal of human resource for the scientific work to be carried out and also act as a training ground for the future scientists needed for scientific development. ICMR/CSIR has a well-structured research fellowship program. CCRAS could follow the procedures followed by these organizations. To sum up 1. A large section of Indian people use A&S drugs and will continue to do so. It is important to ensure that they get drugs of proven efficacy and right quality. More stringent regulatory controls on marketing by introducing a product registration system are strongly recommended. : 2. A&SM have several useful drugs for certain conditions for which modern therapy is inadequate or where modern drugs are not available. CCRAS institutions should take special interest in the development of these drugs for which there is an interest in western world 3. The A&SM systems have much to contribute to medical science as well. Th e holistic view of Ayurveda adds to the fast emerging integrating Systems biology perspective of modern biology and an interface between the two could greatly enrich the modern medical sciences. 4. For all this, an in -depth application of modern science and t echnological advances to the existing knowledge and practices of A&SM is needed to bring A&SM system into the mainstream of medical science and health care. 5. The CCRAS through its constituent laboratories and institutes has a unique and marvelous opportuni ty to do so and can achieve this. 6. It is strongly recommended that CCRAS should have the complete administrative and scientific autonomy as CSIR/DRDO/ICMR organizations have, so as to achieve the objectives. 7. CCRAS should focus its activities on the areas identified in this report. For this CCRAS laboratories will have to be restructured, upgraded and better staffed. 148 8. Service conditions of scientists working at CCRAS need to be improved and should be brought on par with ICMR/CSIR and the best of research facilities must be provided to the scientists and laboratories at CCRAS. The steps that need to be taken to achieve these objectives are highlighted in this Review Report. Recommendations 1. Prioritization of the R&D Programmes: The first R& D priority should be standardization of classical A&S drugs so that people get drugs of standard quality, proven safety and efficacy evidenced by acceptable modern methodology. The first priority in standardization should go to drugs of the following categ ories: a. Drugs used for Primary Health Care b. Drugs commonly used in every day life such as for g. i. Disorders, cough & cold, pains c. Common Nutraceuticals d. Drugs of selected disease areas of great national concern in which A&SMs have special strengths and mode rn drugs are inadequate or are not available. The following disease areas are suggested: Metabolic syndrome; Diabetes, Obesity, Hypertension and Lifestyle disorders Skin disorders Musculo- skeletal disorders and inflammatory disorders Respiratory disorders and inflammatory disorders. GI disorders Ageing & related degenerative problems & Rasayana The Council had already identified 30 research areas for drug development; out of these, it has already standardized 8 formulations (Annexure - III). The a reas, which are not falling under the above category, may be dropped. The CCRAS should form a Committee at the Headquarter to identify about 100 classical A&SMs for these conditions and allot these drugs in a phased manner to the institutes designated for this work, and monitor the progress of work. These studies should include developing methods for their manufacture, developing QC standards, carrying out safety 149 (toxicity) studies, followed by clinical efficacy studies and finally commercialization or introduction through State Health Departments for health care. The same committee could select a second list of around 100 important nutraceuticals and common 'Home remedies', which are largely used, for which no clinical trials would be needed, but QC standards need to be developed, and establish their safety. Work on these could also be allotted to different CCRAS laboratories meant for this work. If QC standard and clinical efficacy validation of 5 drugs of each group by each laboratory in a multicentric m ode, could be carried out every year, it will be a significant contribution of CCRAS towards promoting A&S drugs for healthcare. Efforts should be made to finish this work in 5 years time under rigorous monitoring after the establishment of the suggested i nstitutes. 2. Methods of manufacture: The selected classical drugs should be manufactured by the traditional concepts and methodology, though employing modern scientific technologies, and the detailed Method of Preparations (MOPs) thus developed should be wel l documented. The products so manufactured should undergo standardization and quality control for pharmacopoeial standards. CCRAS Institute at Patiala, which has been identified for the work of manufacture and development, should be equipped with GMP confo rming pilot plant facilities with all the laboratory analytical and spectroscopic capabilities for developing the necessary quality control standards both for the raw materials and the finished products. There may be justification or need to modify the met hod of manufacture in some cases, but this should be followed by safety and clinical evaluation of the product, and the efficacy established with the traditionally produced product. The quality criteria should then be developed/checked of the product made by the new method. So it is most important that the product should first be manufactured by the traditional process, quality testing methods developed and its safety and clinical efficacy established. Any change in the method of manufacture should be consi dered only after this is done so that a check can be kept on the quality efficacy of the products. 3. Standardization and Quality Control: This would apply both to the raw materials (whole plants or the parts, minerals or metals), which are used as such or processed, and the extracts and poly -component formulations manufactured there from to be used as drugs. This standardization would also apply to the whole range of practices dealing with the cultivation, season and method of collection of 150 plants to post -harvest technology and storage conditions of raw materials. It is interesting that in Ayurveda great emphasis is given to the conditions of cultivation and harvesting of plants. Vrikshayurveda, a branch of Ayurveda deals with identification/selection of soi l, manure and season for cultivation of plants. There is need to revive interest in this aspect of Ayurveda to identify the right cultivars yielding plants of the correct quality. One of the Central Research Institute should have a separate botanical depar tment specializing in this area and work in close collaboration with Botanical Survey of India and some of the CSIR labs working on cultivation of medicinal plants. The standardization of raw materials is no more a mere pharmacognostic identification but i s based on characterization of the major chemical constituents. The standardization of the A&SMs cannot be based on the characterization of a single active chemical constituent, but on total analytical profiling with the major chemical constituents, as the se drugs would be polycomponent. This will require isolation and availability of each of the major chemical constituent as a reference substance and marker compound, and without this it would not be possible to bring the product to a level of wider acceptance, nationally and internationally. These quality control standards developed should be fully documented and should become the pharmacopoeial standards for these drugs. Standardization and quality control should gradually be extended to other areas where A&S drugs are used, especially in the following, viz: Nutraceuticals, also named \"dietary supplements\" or \"home remedies\" Drugs for Veterinary use All the A&SM commercially manufactured and marketed by organizations supported by or under AYUSH such as Indian Medicine and Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited (IMPCL), Mohan, Distt. Almora. 4. Sequence of Studies for Establishing the Clinical Efficacy of Classical A&S Drugs The following sequence of R&D studies should be followed and adhered to for undertaking the clinical efficacy studies. Identifying and selecting the method of manufacture, which should be as close to the traditional method described as possible. Developing suitable QC standards of raw material and manufactured products with in-process controls, with reproducibility of at least 3 batches, and its validation at 3 centers. Checking the safety and toxicity of the drug thus developed. 151 If a change in the method of manufacture is necessary this may be carried out but the product must conform to the QC standards developed. If due to some reason the new batch has different quality standards but is to be used clinically it must undergo fresh clinical trial. Clinical evaluation of the drug, with each batch checked for its QC standard, strictly following the protocol developed by the committee formed for this purpose. The Clinical Trial Protocol must be developed following the WHO Guideline for Clinical Trials. A special Expert Committee should be entrusted this job. The clinical Trial should be supervised and monitored by a Joint Expert Group consisting of both Ayurvedic & Modern Physicians. 5. Study of the mode of action at biochemical/molecular level of classical A&S drugs With the rapid scientific advances in biological sciences and structural biology, unprecedented opportunities are now available to study the mode of action of A&S drugs at the molecular and even at Systems level, which can add great value to these drugs. For example it has been shown in recent studies that gugulsterones, the active constit uents of gugulipid, the classical Ayurvedic hypolipidemic drug, acts through FXR, the bile acid nuclear receptors, which is a novel mode of action for lipid lowering drugs. Such studies open up new vistas for further development of existing drugs, and for new drug discovery research. In due course of time, all the important A&S drugs should undergo such reverse pharmacology studies to understand their mode of action. Further, the focus in drug research is shifting to non- infectious diseases, and the grow ing realization of the multi- factorial causation of most of them, is focusing attention on drugs acting on multiple targets, and on multi -component drugs, which A&SM drugs are. Study of their mode of action may even provide new therapeutic uses of these drugs. The study of the molecular mode of action of classical but well standardized A&SM drugs should thus be an essential part of the A&SM Drug Research Institutes and Ayurvedic Science Research Institute as suggested above, which will help to bring A&SM i nto the main stream of medical sciences. 6. Broad Biological Screening of A&S drugs and the plant extracts prepared therein Screening of chemical libraries and established therapeutic agents against phenotypic and molecular targets has emerged as an important approach to new drug discovery research. It would be useful to subject the classical A&S drugs, which can be easily handled, and their 152 constituent plant ingredients to screening programs to get new leads. A bank for these drugs and the plant extracts should be prepared and kept in CCRAS laboratories. To begin with, these products should be got screened from outside Centers established for screening. Concurrently steps should, however, be undertaken to set up this Screening facility at one of the National Institutes recommended to be set up. This might will also uncover some new uses for old drugs. II. Restructuring of CCRAS Institutes and Centres: It was observed that many of the CCRAS Institutes are grossly under staffed, poorly equipped and, hence with low productivity. It is suggested that at this stage, 10 to 12 of its better staffed and equipped research institutes be chosen and developed into National Institutes in specialized areas, staffed adequately and equipped well with a focused R&D mandate (as described later). Each institute must have high caliber scientific staff for R&D in the specialized areas of work includi ng from outside the Ayurveda stream wherever needed. Each institute must have a Research Advisory Committee (RAC), with experts from the relevant scientific streams. This RAC should meet at least once a year for 2 days to guide and monitor the R&D activity of the institute. Each discipline of work must be adequately represented in the RAC membership. The chairman of the RAC will be a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of CCRAS. 1. National Research Institutes of Ayurveda Drug Development: It is suggested that there should be five such Research Institutes, each specializing in specific disease condition covering the important areas of Ayurveda. These Institutes - five of them - would be involved in botanical identification and phytochemical investigations of the desired plants, preparing the herbal products from these upto a pilot plant, developing quality control standards, studying their biological activity, carrying out the regulatory toxicity studies and clinical trials and documentation of all the data. It would have the following disciplines/subjects: Pharmacognosy/Taxonomy Phytochemistry Analytical development Formulation development Microbiology Pharmacology Toxicology/Safety Pharmacology 153 Clinical Research & Experimental Medicine Documentation Library & Information Sciences. Each Institute will have specialization in one or more identified therapeutic areas as mentioned above. 2. National Research Institute of Ayurveda & Siddha Herbo -Mineral Drugs: There is not enough understanding and appreciation of the therapeutic use of herbo - mineral drugs commonly used in the Siddha System. With the developments in Nanotechnology it is opportune time to study in depth the physicochemical characteristic vs. the mode of action at molecular level o f herbo -mineral drugs. This institute thus in addition to the research work carried out on commonly used Ayurvedic drugs will specialize on the use of mineral drugs. This institute will have the following departments: Pharmacognosy / Taxonomy Metallurgy Phytochemistry / Analytical development Nanotechnology Microbiology Pharmacology Toxicology/Safety Pharmacology Clinical Research Documentation Library & Information Sciences 3. National Research Institute of Ayurvedic Sciences: This would be a basic scientific studies institute to design and carry out experimental molecular biology and genetic studies on different doctrines and principles of Ayurveda to provide better scientific insight into the integrated view of Ayurveda on the working of human system. It should have the following Departments: Molecular & Systems Biology Genomics & Proteomics Study of Holistic medicine Herbo -Mineral Drugs and Nanotechnology Dietetics, Yoga and Panchakarma Division of Bioinformatics Library and Information Centre/Documentation Any other Department as needed 4. National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage 154 The study of literature of any discipline constitutes an important resource but its relevance for oriental disciplines like Ayurveda/Indian Medicine, especially the revival of the sacred of Ayurveda has an immense value for planning research programmes in right prospective. The basic source materials of Ayurveda lies inscribed on manuscripts in Bhurja Patra (Birch bark) and Tada Patra (Palm leaf) and scattered in Government repositories and private collections within the country and foreign archives and mus eums. The Council's literature research programmes of CCRAS broadly cover medico -historical studies, transcription and publication of rare works /classical treatises and unpublished manuscripts on Ayurveda and Siddha besides their documentations in the for m of inventory of medical manuscripts. Currently, the Indian Institute of History of Medicine Hyderabad is engaged in revival and retrieval of AYUSH literature/rare books and manuscripts besides maintaining a museum having objects of historical important . Considering this, this institute needs to be upgraded and should have the following departments and infrastructure. Library & Information Sciences Photography & Documentation, Collection, Preservation & Maintenance of Manuscripts Publication Translatio n, Transcription & Transliteration Auditorium & Conference Hall Museum 5. National Research Institute of Panchakarma With the emerging interest in the use of Ayurveda worldwide, safety and efficacy of medicines and procedure -based therapies such as Panchakar ma have become important. Panchakarma (bio -cleansing therapy) is unique to Ayurveda. It is basically a bio- cleansing regimen, which prepares the body system for better bioavailability and assimilation of the drugs , besides achieving homeostasis of body hum ours. This therapy is believed to impart radical elimination of disease- causing factors and helps maintain the equilibrium by body tissues. These unique procedures is widely practiced by Ayurvedic physicians in India and some other countries too both for prophylactic & therapeutic purposes, improving the quality of life of subjects suffering from chronic & refractory illnesses. The procedures of Panchkarma and their effects on body need to be subjected to scientific investigations. This 155 institute will focus on this aspect of Panchakarma and shall have the following disciplines/subjects. Clinical Medicine Pharmacy and Dietetics Physiotherapy Neurosciences Physiology Pathology Biochemistry & Pharmacology Biophysics Analytical Chemistry Library and Documentation Any other 6. Central Research Institute for Tribal Health Care Tribal health care has not received enough focus and attention so far, though of much strategic importance. Unless attention is paid to preserve and utilize these traditions for the benefit of the masses these would become extinct. Therefore, more focus needs to be accorded on the issue to protect this knowledge. The council has extended health care facilities covering about 500 villages and 155 tribal pockets consisting of a total population of more than 7.5 lakhs so far. Incidental medical aid has been extended to more than 3.0 lakhs patients including patients from neighboring villages/tribal pockets. Besides this in view of protecting the traditional knowledge the council has made the following efforts. Medico -botanical survey of about 400 forest areas all over India has been completed and more than one lakh twenty thousand plant specimens representing a large number of families, genera and species have been collected. About thre e thousand museum drug samples of plant, mineral and animal origins have been collected besides information on plant based 5,000 folk medicines. 12 monographs covering the ethno medico practices in different states of the country and a monograph entitled 'An Appraisal of Tribal - Folk Medicine' covering more than 2500 folk claims have been published. In view of the above, one of the existing CCRAS constituent Institute may be developed for preservation, promotion and research on Tribal Health Practices. Th e institute should have the following departments: Ethnobotany Survey, Surveillance and population Study 156 Photography & Documentation Museum & Herbarium Mobile Clinical Research Unit Pharmacognosy & Taxonomy Pharmacy Any other relevant to Tribal Health C are 7. Central Research Institute for Sowa Rigpa The Amchi system of Medicine is an integral part of Ayurveda and has further developed during Buddhism's period. Besides Ayurvedic philosophy and concepts this system has added, more information on diagnosis and therapeutics. This system is prevalent in confined regions of India viz. Himalayan region and other countries. To preserve the cultural heritage and proper utilization of benefits of this system, more attention needs to be given to this system. The exist ing center under AYUSH (CCRAS) at Leh may be upgraded with all facilities. 8. National Ayurveda & Siddha Bio- and Geo - Repository India is one of the 12 mega -biodiversity countries harboring two unique biodiversity hot spot out of 18 hot spots in the world. It is rich in all the three levels of biodiversity i.e. species, genetic and habitat diversity. Under such unique and varied agro- climatic bio - edap hic variety of medicinal plants grow. Out of 17,000 flowering plants, 8000 species (MoEnF, AICRPE -report) are used medicinally in local health traditions and codified system of medicine. The intra -specific variability of the flowering plants found in the country make it one of the highest in the world. In Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani systems of medicine about 2,000 plants are used in various formulations. There are estimated to be around 25,000 effective plant based formulations used in folk medicine by the rural communities of the country, besides around 30,000 designed formulations available in indigenous medical texts. These natural plant resources are still as potent and effective as they were thousand years ago. Many of the Ayurveda & Siddha Formulations use the raw material of mineral, metal, animal products besides the plant materials. Recent efforts of standardization will be futile if the different standards of authentic raw material and chemical marker compounds are not made available to the stake folders. There is a strong need of having a institute to keep the repository of all the materials for display in one site and make it available to the stake folders on demand on other side. 157 CCRAS should identify one of the existing institutes to be developed to give these objectives. It is proposed that, the institute should have minimum following facilities: Departm ent of Pharmacognosy & Taxonomy Department of Analytical Chemistry Library for reference on Herbs, Metals , Minerals and Chemical Markers Museum, H erbarium and other repositories Specialized storage system Specialized catalogue Any other Annexure -I gives the list of existing institutes which are recommended to be upgraded and to be rechristened with new focused mandate. The parameters followed for identification of these existing institutes are: - Own building Sanctioned scientific staff Track record in terms of output Availability of the disciplines of other institutes for collaboration in the vicinity Strategic identification in terms of geographical location are special needs The other institutes / centers of CCRAS could be given the choice to remain as Extension/ satellite Centers of the National Institutes mentioned above depending upon their requirement and regional needs and professional capabilities. Some of the centers being run in rented buildings and with bare minimum existing scientific staff may be merged with any one of these proposed National Institutes depending upon their current mandate. The staff could be given the choice to get transferred to any of the existing research institutes/ centers of CCRAS. Appropriate funding and requisite human resources need to be ensured through proper budgetary allocation for the purpose. Each of these Centers should have an Adviser, who would monitor and guide the scientific work. It is proposed that reorganization of the constituent Institutes may be executed in phased manner as suggested above. However , strongly recommend that the National Research Institute for Ayurvedic Sciences which will carry out basic scientific research on the concept and philosophy of Ayurveda and at least one of the 5 National Research Institute for A&S drug development should be created without much delay so that the results start flowing in the near future. 158 III. Product Registration and Regulatory Controls of Marketed Ayurveda & Siddha Drugs: Regulatory controls of A&SMs are not stringent currently. This has resulted into flooding of market with substandard, poor quality products with very often tall and unsubstantiated claims. This practice needs to be curbed if A&SMs are to be protected from going into disrepute. In the current scenario, GMP certification is provided only for manufacturing premises and manufacturing license is provided for several products on one page only. There is no system of product registration as on today. A review of regulatory scenario in other countries reveals that in the countries where product registration of Traditional Medicine is in existence, not only the quality of medicine has improved, but the acceptance of traditional medicines has also grown. The need of the hour, therefore, is to introduce the system of product registration through a dossier containing all the details of quality control measures in terms of raw material specifications, in process controls and finished product specifications. In addition to it, the dossier should also contain SOPs for manufacturing process on every product be it classical or proprietary. This will help taking A&SM forward in faster strides with better quality control and minimum batch -to-batch variation. Every product should also be given a unique product registration number to be displayed prominently on the labels. This would help in easy tracking of the product back to the producers quickly in case certain adverse events are reported. IV. Service Conditions and Human Res ource Development: This is the weakest component in the CCRAS. The existing salary structure and the promotional avenues are far below that of other central government research organizations and will not attract good talent to work in CCRAS laboratories. W hy should the CCRAS research staff be at an inferior level to other central government research organizations such as CSIR, ICMR, if these institutes are expected to be scientifically as productive? Due to very poor service conditions and non- availability of promotional avenues, it is observed that many scientists have already left and some more are likely to leave CCRAS. This should be viewed seriously for remedial measures. It is strongly recommended that the same service conditions and salary structure as exist in ICMR institutions should be adopted for CCRAS and its research institutions . And the same Selection process for Scientific & Technical Staff should be adopted & followed; no ad- hoc appointment should be made. 159 The contingent grant for Post graduation & PhD, which is currently adopted for Ayurveda & Siddha disciplines, is only for 35 scholars. This should also be extended to other related sciences, increasing the number to at least one hundred. CCRAS must also have a fully developed research fell owship program as an essential component of the human resource development. This will provide both a great deal of human resource for the scientific work to be carried out and also act as a training ground for the future scientists needed for scientific de velopment. ICMR/CSIR have a well -structured research fellowship program. CCRAS could follow the procedures followed by these organizations. It is also necessary to have research fellowship programme for RA, SRF and JRF of different disciplines as a part of the human resource development. These research scholars preferably should be PhD research scholars and not mere SRF/JRF. There should not be any restriction on the number of SRF/JRF and the appointment of SRF/JRF should be project based that include Ayurveda/Siddha and all other related sciences such as Biotechnology, Bioengineering, pharmaceuticals, phyto -chemistry, pharmaceutical analysis etc. and as per the need. Each laboratory should be headed by a Director in the same scale as that of CSIR Institute. V. Accountability and Autonomy of CCRAS and Its Constituent Institutes: It is very important that, the CCRAS head quarter should enjoy the autonomy, similar to CSIR & ICMR. There should also be equal emphasis on accountability and the head of CCRAS should continuously monitor the functioning and productivity of each lab apart from yearly review by the RAC. The financial autonomy given to CCRAS must also be extended to its different constituent institutes. The present designation of CCRAS Head should be re -designated as 'Director General' as in ICMR and CSIR to differentiate it from the Director of different national research institutes recommended to be established under this report. VI. Increasing the Education outreach of A&S Systems of Medicine: Education and research need to go hand in hand. In order to attract the modern medicine, pharmaceutical sciences and modern biology students conversant with the special 160 scientific basis special sources may be designed. The following three teaching programmes, to begin with, may be introduced: 1. One optional paper in Ayurveda and Siddha Medical Sciences for the MBBS students. 2. A three months' orie ntation programme on A&S drugs for the Pharmaceutical Sciences/Biological Sciences. 3. Courses on GLP/GCP, Evidence based Medicine, Medical Biostatistics and Modern Biology for A&SM graduate students. This would create the required interest and understanding in the science of Ayurveda and Siddha Systems of Medicine, and help to create an interface between Ayurveda and Siddha Medical sciences with modern biology and medical science. All the steps should be taken to project A&S as a lucrative career option after 10 + 2 to attract those students who are bright and are really interested in studying these sciences. VII. Financial assistance for research projects: Currently several projects are being funded under Extra Mural Research (EMR) scheme through the Projec t Evaluation Committee (PEC) of CCRAS. It is recommended that only those projects should be approved for financial assistance, which falls under any one of the areas identified above as focused therapeutic areas for CCRAS. At the same time, the projects wh ich may add value to basic Ayurvedic concepts should always be encouraged, preferably under interdisciplinary research mode. VIII. Training needs: CCRAS scientists need to be trained on regular basis in their respective fields, in order to keep abreast of the latest knowledge on the subject. These should be a continuous training and education programme and should a part of CCRAS scientists as listed. Some of the areas of training are listed below - Research Methodology Good clinical practices Good laborat ory practices National and International Regulatory status Exposure to sophisticated equipments for standardization 161 In vitro techniques for toxicity and efficacy evaluation using biotechnological inputs Intellectual property rights Good Management Practices IX. Constitution of Research Advisory Committee (RAC) for each Institute & Sci ence Adviser for each Centre Each institute must have a Research Advisory Committee (RAC), which will meet at least once a year for 2 days to guide and monitor the R&D activity of the institute. Each discipline of work must be adequately represented in the RAC. The chairman of the RAC will be a member of the SAC of CCRAS. X. Review Committees: The Research Advisory Committee will review the work every year and will also reduce the need for external review, which can be carried out every five years. XI. Vision for CCRAS CCRAS is sitting on a \"Gold Mine\", a rich knowledge resource of ancient systems of medicine, which have survived many onslaughts for over 3000 years and are stil l widely practiced, which speaks for their strong scientific foundations and inherent strength of their materia -medicas, healthcare practices and traditions. However, much more can be gotten from this rich heritage than what have been achieved so far, with modem science and technology inputs, which is the thrust of this report. The recent advances in pharmaceutical and biological sciences offer many unprecedented opportunities to achieve these objectives. It is up to CCRAS management to create the scientific strengths and environment in its institutions that would help in utilizing the opportunities offered by mod em science and technology both to bring A& SMs into the mainstream of healthcare as well as help developing an interface with modem medicine and integrate the opportunities for better healthcare. 162 Annexure 6 Standardization of Ayurvedic formulations appeared in Essential Drugs List (2008) undertak en by APC S.
