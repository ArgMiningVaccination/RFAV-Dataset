For now, our forecasts do not anticipate a significant impact in the first half of 2021,\" the IEA said in its monthly report. \"The poor outlook for demand and rising production in some countries ... suggest that the current fundamentals are too weak to offer firm support to prices.\" (Reporting By Noah Browning; Editing by Jane Merriman) "}
