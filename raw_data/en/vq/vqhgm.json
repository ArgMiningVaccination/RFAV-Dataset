They are believed to have therapeutic properties that can promote health and balance in the body. For instance, essential oils such as lavender and peppermint are commonly used in TCM massage therapy to relax muscles, relieve pain, and improve circulation.

Consumers in China actively seek out essential oils for their potential therapeutic benefits and overall wellness benefits. They integrate essential oils into their daily routines through practices such as aromatherapy, inhalation, and topical applications. For instance, individuals may use essential oils like eucalyptus or tea tree oil for respiratory support or citrus oils for mood enhancement. The cultural connection and belief in the effectiveness of TCM have contributed to the growth of the essential oils market in China. The demand for high-quality essential oils continues to rise as more consumers embrace TCM and its holistic approach to health. This trend has created opportunities for manufacturers and suppliers in the essential oils industry to cater to the specific needs and preferences of the Chinese market.
