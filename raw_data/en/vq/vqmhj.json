Scleroderma patients are at increased risk of influenza complications and pneumonia; thus, vaccinations are recommended. This systematic review evaluated the influenza and pneumococcus vaccination coverage for SSc patients. We included all studies from Pubmed reporting on influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rate in Scleroderma patients up to May 2021. The 14 studies thus selected identified a suboptimal vaccination rate in autoimmune and SSc patients, ranging from 28 to 59% for the flu vaccine, and from 11 to 58% for the pneumo vaccine in absence of specific vaccination campaigns, variously considering also other variables such as age, gender, vaccination settings, and possible vaccination campaigns. We also considered the reasons for low coverage and the approaches that might increase the vaccination rates. A lack of knowledge about the importance of vaccination in these patients and their doctors underlined the need to increase the awareness for vaccination in this patients' category. Current guidelines recommend vaccination in elderly people and people affected by particular conditions that widely overlap with SSc, yet autoimmune diseases are not always clearly mentioned. Improving this suboptimal vaccination rate with clear guidelines is crucial for SSc patients and for clinicians to immunize these categories based principally on the pathology, prior to the age. Recommendations by the immunologist and the direct link to the vaccine providers can highly improve the vaccine coverage.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-11-15", "cleaned_text": "Flu and Pneumococcal Vaccine Coverage in Scleroderma Patients Still Need to Be Prompted: A Systematic Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111330](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111330) [Infectious Diseases: The Sclerosis [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01330)]. [2](#B2-vaccines-09-01330)]. Systemic sclerosis (SSc), or scleroderma, is a rare autoimmune disease with a prevalence ranging worldwide from 10 to 40 cases per 100,000 individuals [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01330)] characterized by excessive collagen production and deposition, often presenting symptoms overlapping with other rheumatological conditions. SSc pathogenesis is not yet completely unraveled [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-01330)]. However, most SSc-related deaths are determined by interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) caused mainly by a constant state of lung inflammation and cellular damage followed by fibroblast activation and subsequent fibrosis [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-01330), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-01330)]. Patients affected by this disorder have a high risk of developing life-threatening infections [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-01330)]. Respiratory tract infections need to be investigated in case of sudden dyspnea aggravation: they are one of the most common causes [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-01330)]. Influenza infection for SSc patients, especially for those who have advanced age, comorbidities and receive immunosuppressive drugs therapies, can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia or organ failure [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-01330)]. Influenza incidence was demonstrated to be almost three times higher in patients with autoimmune diseases compared to the healthy population [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-01330)]. Pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) is a bacterium that especially affects immunocompromised and elderly people, more frequently during the winter months, causing severe conditions such as pneumonia. [11](#B11-vaccines-09-01330)] and to plan early therapy intervention [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-01330)]. The higher prevalence of infections and the higher risk of mortality, hospitalization, and complications for SSc patients, make the antiflu and antipneumococcal infection vaccination particularly crucial [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-01330), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01330)]. 1.2. Flu and Pneumococcal Vaccines 1.3. Efficacy and Safety of Anti-Influenza and Antipneumococcal Vaccine [15](#B15-vaccines-09-01330), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01330)]. Different studies provided evidence of no negative outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease immunized with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-01330)]. [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01330)]. [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01330), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-01330), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01330)]. severe [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01330), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01330), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-01330)] and no disease flares were reported [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-01330)]. Local and mild side effects in AID, including SSc, are comparable to those in the healthy subject [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01330), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-01330), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-01330)]. Side effects in some cases were reported to even be less frequent in SSc than in healthy control, although not significantly [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01330)]. For instance, Sampaio-Barros et al. reported local side effects in 7.6% of SSc vs. 10.9% of controls and minor systemic reactions rates in 25% vs. 31.5% in SSc and controls, respectively [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01330)]. 2. Materials and Methods Search Strategy and Statistical Analysis [25](#B25-vaccines-09-01330)]. We thus selected all the studies that reported on the vaccination coverage in term of percentage or rate of patients vaccinated with respect to all the patients under study, and confidence intervals when available. We evaluated the possible distinction between gender, age, clinical data, awareness, and other vaccination settings, when reported, although the primary outcome remained the flu and/or pneumococcal vaccination coverage rate. We also reviewed the literature for safety and efficacy of flu and pneumococcal vaccination in autoimmune patients and in scleroderma patients in particular, and report on the strategies applied to improve vaccination coverage revealed by the literature search. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-01330)] and Murdaca et al., 2020 [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330)] to analyze the coverage rate in relation to three successive vaccination years and in relation to patients' ages. Comparisons for these data were done by Fisher's exact test and vaccine rates are given with 95% confidence interval (95% CI, [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01330-t001)). 3. Results 3.1. Vaccine Coverage Rate [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-01330-f001)). Three more studies were included because retrieved from the references cited in studies already selected [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-01330), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-01330), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01330)], in addition to one still unpublished study concerning vaccination data on scleroderma patients at the San Martino Hospital, Genova, Italy [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-01330)], for a total of 14 studies. We distinguished these papers as (i) concerning autoimmune diseases (AIDs) possibly including systemic sclerosis, among which systemic sclerosis is not specified but might be included; (ii) AIDs explicitly including systemic sclerosis, and iii) studies specifically focusing on systemic [31](#B31-vaccines-09-01330), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-01330)], referral by a physician, indication for vaccination, educational levels [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01330), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-01330)] and knowledge attitude towards vaccination [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01330), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-01330), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01330), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-01330), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-01330)], vaccination settings such as rural vs. urban [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01330)] and concomitant vaccination campaigns aimed to improve the vaccination rate [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01330), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-01330), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-01330)], however these outcomes were variably reported. [27](#B27-vaccines-09-01330)] was the first to investigate the flu vaccination in 137 patients treated for systemic inflammatory diseases ( [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01330-t001)). Only 28% (95% CI: 20-36) of were vaccinated, among which 46% of patients >65 years and 21% of those aged <65 years, while 30% were affected by vasculitis or systemic sclerosis. The authors advocated as reasons for such a low vaccination rate the lack of doctor recommendation (58%), fear of side effects (35%) and uncertainty about the vaccine efficacy (5%). Sowden et al., 2007 [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-01330)] reported on both the anti-influenza and antipneumococcal vaccination rate, focusing on patients treated with immunosuppressives like disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, sulphasalazine, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, and gold). The authors stressed that immunization in those patients was under the optimal threshold, with only 53% of patients immunized against influenza and 28% against pneumococcus for patients under minor immunosuppressant treatment, and 54% vs. 38% for patients under major immunosuppressant. A few years later Mouthon et al., 2010 [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-01330)], assessed an overall influenza vaccination rate of 39% (69 patients out of 177) in a cohort of SSc patients. Interestingly, among the 108 patients who were not vaccinated, 78 (72%) presented at least one indication for vaccination. The mean age at the time of evaluation was 63.9, among patients vaccinated and 55.4 among not vaccinated (p < 0.0001). [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01330), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-01330), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01330)]. In particular, Loubet et vaccination rate of 59% pneumo. Patients >65 years old were more likely to be vaccinated for flu (74% vs. 55%; p < 103) and patients vaccinated against influenza were more likely to be vaccinated against pneumococcus (63% vs. 37%; p < 103). [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01330)]. Serre et al., 2017 [ [33](#B33-vaccines-09-01330)] tried to improve awareness on vaccination importance. In fact, their nurse program, through which nurses checked patients' vaccination eligibility and performed vaccination, proved to be effective in raising the pneumococcal vaccination rates in patients with AID. [34](#B34-vaccines-09-01330), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-01330), [36](#B36-vaccines-09-01330)]. Still in 2019 the immunization rate was low, with 29% of 208 patients belonging to three main groups (joint, bowel and skin inflammatory diseases) vaccinated for influenza overall [ [34](#B34-vaccines-09-01330)]. In the same year Sheikh et al., 2019 [ [35](#B35-vaccines-09-01330)] detected a pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rate in SSc patients of approximately 20% and 45%, respectively, identifying a lack of knowledge about vaccine guidelines among adult patients and their providers as a cause for such a low rate. Qendro et al., [ [36](#B36-vaccines-09-01330)] found a vaccination coverage of 42% and 37.8% for flu and pneumo, respectively, among systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases patients, which might include scleroderma. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-01330)], carried out an extensive follow-up, investigating the immunization coverage in three consecutive vaccination seasons in a cohort of patients with SSc. The authors reported seasonal influenza and S. pneumoniae vaccination coverage also investigating demographic and clinical factors related to vaccine acceptance. [Table 2](#vaccines-09-01330-t002)and [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-01330-f002)b). The flu vaccination rate instead, was significantly higher among people above 65 years than in patients below (p = 0.004) in 2017-2018, and this separation between patients over or under 65 years of age was maintained and still significantly different through the following vaccination seasons up to 2019-2020 (p = 0.0011) ( [Table 2](#vaccines-09-01330-t002)and was 75% in 2017-2018 and reached 91% of patients in 2019-2020, in the under 65 years cohort the rate increased from 41% to 61%, showing an increased but still suboptimal rate for the younger SSc patients. [37](#B37-vaccines-09-01330)] reported a 76-83% coverage for the 2020 season, in concomitance with the COVID-19 pandemic period. 3.2. Improving Vaccine Coverage in Autoimmune Patients and in and favorable attitude toward vaccination was a positive predictor for vaccination, but not the level of education [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01330), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-01330), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01330), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-01330), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-01330)]. Gender was generally multimodal education activity for clinician to improve the immunization rate [ [35](#B35-vaccines-09-01330)], significantly increasing awareness on the matter [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-01330), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-01330)] developed programs to improve pneumococcal vaccination coverage in pediatric and adult patients with autoimmune inflammatory disorders. Similarly, Murdaca et al., [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-01330), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330)] carried out a campaign for both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-01330)]. Among the strategies applied to improve the immunization rate there were establishing good records about the vaccination status and urging the clinicians to recommend vaccination [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-01330)]. Since several clinicians had reported fear and uncertainty to recommend vaccination to immunocompromised patients for lack of information [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-01330)], several studies attempted strategies to enhance the knowledge of clinicians on the single patient's case. [40](#B40-vaccines-09-01330)] provided specialists with tools for vaccination decision, but the rate did not improve substantially, possibly due to uncomfortableness by the clinicians in using these tools, as hypothesized by the authors. Other vaccination campaigns supported clinicians with a reminder to propose vaccinations to the patient on the day specialist visit [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-01330)]. In particular, directly including the patient in the vaccine reservation list or providing immediate vaccination during the specialty visit proved to be successful [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-01330)]. Sivaraman et al., 2020 [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330)] proposed to order vaccine doses to have them available for the day of the visit so that the nursing staff could be ready to vaccinate the specific patient. Also directly addressing the patient to the vaccine provider might be the reason for the vaccination rates improvement detected in some studies [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330), [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330)], rather than leaving the burden of the vaccination to the specialty clinician, which might not be confident with the management of specific vaccines [ [39](#B39-vaccines-09-01330)]. [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330)] applied a specific vaccination campaign to their cohort of patients affected by scleroderma. In detail, this cohort of SSc patients, if not yet vaccinated, received information and recommendation on flu and pneumococcal vaccination during their routine specialty medical check at the clinical immunology hospital unit and, if they accepted to adhere to the vaccination prophylaxis, they were directly addressed to the vaccine dedicated department. Here, the patients were registered, and a vaccine appointment was scheduled. This workflow allowed to precisely evaluate patients who were not already vaccinated, monitor if patients would undergo vaccination, and create a strong collaboration between immunologist who knows about the importance of immunization for these categories of immunocompromised patients and vaccine providers who managed the vaccination iter. [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330)] and Sivaraman [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330)], support the importance of vaccine recommendations by the clinical immunologist that follow the SSc patient and the direct link to the vaccine providers to make the vaccination iter easier and more direct. A shift from primary care to specialty care with the direct cooperation by the vaccine provider is a successful strategy for vaccine management and to keep high levels of vaccination rate for the seasonal flu vaccine and the antipneumococcal prophylaxis. 4. Discussion [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01330), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-01330), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01330), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-01330), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-01330), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-01330)]. At the same time, it is well known that these patients have higher risk of infections and consequent mortality, hospitalization, and complications, especially if with advanced age, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive drugs therapies. [42](#B42-vaccines-09-01330)]. Sadly, although vaccination remains the most effective measure to prevent severe disease caused by influenza, in some countries vaccination coverage in people with chronic disease is reported to be around 40% [ [34](#B34-vaccines-09-01330), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-01330), [36](#B36-vaccines-09-01330)]. [43](#B43-vaccines-09-01330)]. The antipneumonia vaccine is recommended for persons 65 years old and older and also for under 65 years individuals who smoke or with particular conditions, including long-term health conditions, like heart disease or asthma, a weakened immune system (i.e., congenital or acquired immunodeficiency), and iatrogenic immunosuppression [ [44](#B44-vaccines-09-01330)]. Yet, the CDC, through two retrospective surveys in the general adult population for the 2019/2020 season, reported a flu vaccination coverage of 48.4%, higher for 65 years persons, among who an immunization rate of 69.8% was assessed [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-01330)]. Following this lack of substantial improvement in vaccination for adults under 65 years, the Healthy People 2030 initiative, released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to improve health and well-being, set at 70 % the target for flu vaccination of persons 6 months even for healthy people [ [46](#B46-vaccines-09-01330)]. Vaccine prophylaxis must be active and suggested [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-01330)]. Several studies reported that the main reasons for no vaccination among autoimmune patients were no doctor recommendation and fear of side effects [ [36](#B36-vaccines-09-01330), [41](#B41-vaccines-09-01330)], and that the lack of adequate information and full and unambiguous indication is the most relevant possible cause of low vaccine coverage and the most referred cause of vaccine refusal [ [48](#B48-vaccines-09-01330)]. As a matter of fact, several studies that investigated the possible factors affecting the vaccination rate reported the doctors' recommendations and the vaccine awareness as the major vaccine uptake is significantly influenced by the physician recommendations and this significant increase in vaccination rate across three vaccination seasons from 2017 to 2020 support the importance of a clear recommendation by the specialist clinicians. Moreover, in Italy in particular, flu and pneumococcal vaccines are available without cost to patients aged over 65 years, patients presenting chronic comorbidity and patients under immunosuppressive therapy, although there is no clear and direct recommendation to vaccine SSc patients [ [49](#B49-vaccines-09-01330)]. Both Murdaca [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330)] and Sivaraman [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330)] support that a shift from primary care to specialty care and the direct cooperation with the vaccine provider is a successful strategy for vaccine management and to keep high levels of vaccination rate for the seasonal flu vaccine and the antipneumococcal prophylaxis. Also, the direct cooperation between the medical care and the vaccine provider seems to improve the vaccination rate, although the accessibility to vaccination (rural vs. urban location) did not affect the vaccination uptake [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01330)]. [37](#B37-vaccines-09-01330)] reported a spontaneous increment of about 9.8% in vaccine rate in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) during the COVID-19 period but not in the previous year. This increased vaccination rate can be in part due to the concurrent increase in recommendation by the rheumatologists, emphasizing the need for continuous campaigns aiming at improving patients' and physicians' awareness about the benefits of vaccination. Results from our review support those recommendations from clinicians that directly have in care the patients are pivotal to maintain a high vaccination coverage; thus, medical recommendations made in person are likely to remain the most powerful weapon to increase vaccination also against SARS-Co-2 in the general population. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-01330), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330)] distinguishing the vaccination rate between patients below 65 years of age and patients 65 years or older. We thus found that the vaccination rate, following specific strategies of vaccine promotion, improved to almost an optimal rate for older patients (91% for flu vaccination and 87% for pneumococcus influenza), while the rate was still low in patients below 65 years (61 and 67% respectively), in accordance with what reported by the Healthy People 2030. [50](#B50-vaccines-09-01330)]. The Italian Ministry of Health recommends flu and pneumococcal vaccine for over 65 years people and patients at greater risk. Among these patients several categories are specified, such as respiratory system, renal, and liver chronic diseases, cardiovascular system, hematological, metabolic, and neoplastic diseases, immunodeficiencies, and chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases. Pathologies requiring long-term immunosuppressive treatment are also mentioned, but not autoimmune disease [ [51](#B51-vaccines-09-01330)]. The American Guidelines suggest influenza vaccination for all persons, but antipneumonia vaccine is recommended for persons over 65 years old and individuals with particular conditions, and iatrogenic immunosuppression [ [52](#B52-vaccines-09-01330)]. Both elderly age and immunosuppressive treatment are two conditions often overlapping with SSc, yet the autoimmune diseases are not clearly mentioned. [48](#B48-vaccines-09-01330)]. Clear guidelines, healthcare personnel education, health literacy and vaccine promotion, continuous follow-up, equity in distribution, and easy access to vaccines are conditions needed to increase vaccine acceptance and coverage rates. 5. Conclusions [53](#B53-vaccines-09-01330), [54](#B54-vaccines-09-01330)]. The most effective way to promote vaccination, however, seems to be directly addressing immunocompromised patients by the immunologist specialist that routinely take care of them and directly transfer their vaccination iter to the specific vaccination center or provider [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01330), [38](#B38-vaccines-09-01330)].
