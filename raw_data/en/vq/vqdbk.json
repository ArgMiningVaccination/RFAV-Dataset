It doesn't off-gas and has almost no odor, so it's safe for use in enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces. It exceeds all VOC and environmental regulations, and it provides 500 PSI shear strength - more than enough grip for most applications. Almighty Adhesive is moisture-cured and fast-setting indoors or outdoors on paneling, drywall, galvanized metal, vinyl, decorative brick and stone, wood and metal frame construction, tub surrounds, concrete, masonry, windows, doors, skylights, wood flooring, and trim. It's non-flammable and non-slumping, and can even be applied in damp conditions. It can be used in vertical, horizontal, and overhead applications, as well as in low temperatures. An exceptionally strong bonding adhesive that works well on most (not all) substrates. It is similar to Liquid Nails but cures faster and has no odor. Once it bonds, it requires a sledge hammer to remove it. It dries very fast, and you can use it when temps get very low. We've glued 2x4s to a wall, and each one supported our biggest guys hanging from a 2x4 after only one hour.
