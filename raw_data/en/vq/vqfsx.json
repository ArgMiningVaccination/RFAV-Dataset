Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies and Healthy Living at Dana-Farber is dedicated to the belief that cancer patients can enhance their quality of life through integrative therapies such as acupuncture and massage, and healthy living programs such as exercise and nutrition counseling. Our clinical services, education, and group programs led by physicians, therapists, nurses, and other health care professionals empower patients to be active participants in their treatment plans. This integrative approach can help patients feel better by reducing the pain, stress, and anxiety caused by cancer and its treatment. Named for cancer patient and activist Leonard P. Zakim, the Center offers individual treatments including acupuncture, massage, and Reiki; group programs such as movement, meditation, and creative arts; and exercise and nutritional consultations. All Dana-Farber patients are eligible to take advantage of the Zakim Center's one-on-one offerings and free group classes. We offer lectures and educational seminars on topics related to integrative therapies and cancer treatment, which patients, their families, and their caregivers are invited to attend. We also conduct research on the value of integrative therapies and healthy living for cancer patients and survivors. The Zakim Center offers Integrative Medicine Consults designed to educate Dana-Farber patients about integrative therapies such as acupuncture, massage, yoga, and meditation. Patients meet one on one with a medical provider who will review how integrative therapies can help manage treatment-related side effects and improve overall wellbeing and quality of life. Integrative Medicine Consults also provide an opportunity for patients using supplements to review these with a trained provider who can help assess potential risks and interactions with traditional cancer therapies. To schedule an in-person Integrative Medicine Consultation, please call 617-632-3322 or email zakim_center@dfci.harvard.edu. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire prior to arriving for your appointment. The Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies and Healthy Living at Dana-Farber is dedicated to treating the mind, body, and spirit of cancer patients to enhance their quality of life through integrative therapies such as acupuncture and massage, and healthy living programs such as exercise and nutrition counseling.
