In October 2010 I had a wonderful opportunity\u2014as a visiting scholar in an annual exchange program between the Center for In- quiry (CFI) and the China Research Institute for Science Popularization (CRISP)\u2014to take a look at Chinese healing techniques. I toured the Mu- seum of Traditional Medicine at Bei- jing University of Chinese Medi cine (guided by two doctoral students), vis- ited two clinics that used traditional methods (at one I even underwent acupuncture and a related technique) and the pharmacy connected to one of them, and made other related explo- rations. Here is some of what I found. The Origins One of the oldest forms of medical practice, Chinese medicine had ancient antecedents that are lost to history. Ar- chaeological evidence of magical prac- tices\u2014including divination to deter- mine the will of one's ancestors, who were considered a major cause of illness (along with environmental factors, such as snow and, especially, wind)\u2014dates from as early as the Shang Dynasty (1766-1122 BCE). Still, the system that would develop into traditional Chinese medicine stems from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-219 CE) (Ancient Healing 1997, 278, 282-83). China's Huangdi Neijing(or \"Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon\"), stems from circa 200 BCE, when it was probably compiled by several different people rather than themythical Huang Di (who supposedly lived from 2698 to 2598 BCE\u2014a con- venient one hundred years). It influenced future generations of medical theorists and is still cited in support of today's Chinese medicine (Ancient Healing 1997, 282). (It also laid the foundation for most Asian medicine\u2014that of Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and other Asian countries\u2014although India de veloped its own medical system, Ayur veda [Monte 1993, 20].) Traditional Chinese medicine is based on a pair of central concepts. The first, the Doctrine of Two Principles, holds that there are two opposing forces\u2014yinand yang\u2014that combine in various ways to create all phenomena. Yin and yang's attraction creates an en- ergy called qi(pronounced \"chee\"), which is held to be the life force per- meating the entire universe. In the body, where it supposedly flows through certain channels called merid- ians, an imbalance of qi causes illness.The second key concept in Chinese medicine is that of the Five Elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, each associated with a particular planet, one of the five Chinese seasons, and a pair of the body's organs, among other as- sociated qualities. Traditional Chinese medicine is a complex system that com- bines these two main concepts with other diagnostics. Various treatments\u2014 the use of herbs, acupuncture, and other means\u2014are intended to balance qi and thus restore health (Monte 1993, 19- 29; Porter 1997, 94-113; Ancient Heal- ing1997, 296-98). entire floor of the Museum of Tra- ditional Chinese Medicine is de voted to eastern materia medica(Latin for \"medical matter\"), the herbs and other natural substances used for making tra- ditional medicines.

Powdered deer antler, for in stance, is prescribed for women's menstrual problems. Among several ancient pharmacopoeia to survive in some version, the principle one is a sixteenth-century herbalism text by a physician named Li Shih-chen. It de scribes nearly 2,000 herbs and pro- vides some 10,000 herbal remedies (Shealy 1996, 32). Among the museum's extensive col- lection of herbs (the bulk of the materia medica) is a display of both eastern gin- seng (Panax ginseng) and Amer ican ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) (Figure 1). I found this of particular interest be- cause as a boy growing up in eastern Kentucky I knew rural \"'sang\" hunters who dug, dried, and sold the root to meet the East's insatiable demand for an herbal remedy used to treat any lack of vitality, including impotence. In China, I sampled ginseng tea in tea houses and \"tonic soup\" in restaurants (including \"pigeon with ginseng,\" said to be efficacious for \"regulating one's energy, strengthening one's body,\" ac - cording to the menu description). Ginseng's root is often forked, giv- ing it a vague semblance of a person's body. It is probably because of this shape (the English word ginsengis de - rived from a Chinese term meaning \"man root\") that medicinal properties were first attributed to the plant. The genus name Panaxis Greek for \"all- heal,\" the same origin as 1996, Encyclopedia Britannica 1960, s.v. \"ginseng\"). Whereas western herbalists typically prescribe a single herb at a time, Chi- nese and other Asian therapists may concoct a mixture of medicinal sub- stances\u2014vegetable, animal, mineral\u2014 tailored to a particular person and con- dition. Each ingredient is based on its qi or energy value (said to be hot, warm, cold, cool, or neutral) (Shealy 1996, 72). While herbs have a definite place in modern science-based medicine\u2014some mainstream medical compounds are de- rived from plant sources\u2014the efficacy and safety of each plant must be deter- mined through double-blind clinicaltrials before it can be deemed suitable for medical use. Although many people believe \"natural\" medicines are inher- ently safe, the fact is that there are im- portant safety issues of drug interaction, contamination, dosage, and other con- cerns, including the fact that use of an ineffective medicine means that ex- pected health benefits are not realized. There is also the risk of long-term ad- verse effects with some herbs (Porter 1997, 92-93). Acupuncture Even more important than herbalism is acupuncture, \"the preeminent form of therapy in Chinese medicine\" (Monte 1993, 23). Among the oldest therapies still in use, it consists of inserting nee- dles at any of over 350 \"acupoints,\"which are supposedly located along in - visible meridians through which qi flows. The purpose is to drain any ex- cess of qi, remove blockages, and stim- ulate the flow of qi, thus correcting im- balances and thereby treating illnesses (Porter 1997, 19; Shealy 1996, 31). Acupuncture, however, has begun to be subjected to the rigors of science with generally negative results. The existence of neither qi nor the meridians through which it is supposedly carried has been proven, notwithstanding the claims made from faulty studies. As to the effi- cacy of the treatment, evidence is mounting that previous positive studies are flawed and that acupuncture lacks intrinsic clinical value. Researchers have demonstrated that \"sham\" acupuncture (i.e., phony treat-Figures 2-3. The author undergoes \"cupping\" treatment (shown here), together with acupuncture, at a Beijing clinic.

(See Steven Novella's \"What Is Acupuncture?\" SI, July/August 2011). In fact, acupuncture ap pears to be no more successful in relieving pain than can be attributed to the placebo effect, and there is no credible evidence that acu puncture is effective in treating any other medical condition (Slack 2010). Some additional Chinese medical treatments are related to acupuncture. There is acupressure, a needle-less form that \"involves the surface stimulation of acupoints digitally, manually, or with tools held in the hand\" (Raso 1996, 4); moxibustion, the burning of moxa (dried leaves of Artemesia vulgaris) to apply heat to acupuncture points (Shealy 1996, 31); and cupping, where by a vacuum is created in a cup (by burning combustible mate- rial inside it) that is quickly placed on the patient's body, often at an acupoint (see Figures 2 and 3). Acupuncture, herbalism, and otheraspects of traditional Chinese medicine are viewed with nationalistic pride, not unlike the art of Chinese brush calligra- phy, and criticism of it is often met with some defensiveness. Nevertheless, the practice appears to be slowly declining in China\u2014just as, ironically, it has been gaining favor among New Agers in the West. Meanwhile, as an advanced doc- toral student at the Beijing Uni versity of Chinese Medi cine admitted to me, Chi- nese traditional medicine and Wes tern medicine are not well integrated but function in a rather parallel manner; the practice is to use both. In other words, one might be given a Western diagnosis that included labwork followed by pre- scription of an antibiotic andalsosepa- rately be given acupuncture treatment, based on looking at the patient's tongue and taking his or her pulse, coupled with an herbal concoction. One hopes that in both hemispheres, science-based medi- cine\u2014not \"Western\" medicine\u2014will prevail.nAcknowledgments I am grateful to the Chinese Research In sti - tute for Science Popularization (CRISP) in Beijing, especially Zhang Yunjing and Hu Junping; the Center for Inquiry (CFI), espe- cially CEO Ron Lindsay and CSI Executive Director Barry Karr.
