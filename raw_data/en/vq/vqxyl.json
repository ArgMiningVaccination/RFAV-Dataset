The scholarship is awarded annually to a medical student who exhibits leadership qualities and the desire to care for the medically underserved. Keren Valerus, MPH, MMP The scholarship was awarded Feb. 15, which is celebrated as Sarah Loguen Fraser Day at Upstate, in honor of Sarah Loguen Fraser, MD, class of 1876. A Syracuse native whose family was instrumental in the underground railroad, Loguen Fraser graduated from the medical school now known as Upstate. She was one of the nation's first African American women physicians and the first woman doctor in the Dominican Republic. Valerus said she often thinks of the class photograph of Loguen Fraser taken when she was a medical student. \"I often wonder if she ever thought she would accomplish so much in her lifetime, served so many communities in the US and abroad, and broken so many barriers for Black women to enter medicine, including for me as a minoritized, first-generation medical student.\" \"Because she persevered, I am here, and I am forever grateful that she persisted,\" Valerus said of Loguen Fraser. Asked if she had any insights to share with those interested in following Loguen Fraser's footsteps, Valerus said it was important to find good, consistent mentors, and suggested students gain healthcare experience beyond shadowing. Her work before medical school let her see healthcare from the perspective of patients and their families, and it keeps her motivated, even on tough days. Valerus earned her bachelor's degree at SUNY Stony Brook, going on to earn an MPH at SUNY Downstate School of Public Health, and a Master of Medical Physiology at Case Western Reserve University. She has experience coordinating person-centered healthcare and supportive services for community members and has worked to implement community-based interventions addressing nutrition-related chronic diseases. The daughter of Haitian immigrants, she aspires to provide culturally-appropriate, high-quality healthcare in medically-underserved communities locally and abroad. \"My final piece of advice is to find ways to mentor someone else along the way, regardless of where you are in your journey,\" Valerus said. \"You may have a valuable connection, an idea, a resource, or even an encouraging word that can help solve difficult problems, shift perspectives, and help your colleagues make meaningful connections.\" Black mental health was the theme of the 18th Annual Sarah Loguen Fraser Day. Tolani Ajagbe, MBBS, clinical assistant professor of addiction psychiatry, discussed the broad array of mental health crises affecting black, Indigenous and people of color, issues that have been highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "sitename": "blogs.upstate.edu", "date": "2022-02-28", "cleaned_text": "at Upstate Medical University Norton College of Medicine, has been awarded the Sarah Loguen Fraser scholarship.
