TN Nevada Tribal Consultation Requirements Section 1902(a)(73) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires a State in which one or more Indian Health Programs or Urban Indian Organizations furnish health care services to establish a process for the State Medicaid agency to seek advice on a regular, ongoing bases from designees of Indian health programs, whether operated by the Indian Health Service (IHS), Tribes or Tribal organizations under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), or Urban Indian Organizations under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). Section 2107(e)(I) of the Act was also amended to apply these requirements to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Consultation is required concerning Medicaid and CHIP matters having a direct impact on Indian health programs and Urban Indian organizations. Nevada Consultation Process The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Tribes, Indian Health Service, Tribal a nd Urban Indian Organizations (I/T/U) residing within of the State of Nevada created a Tribal Consultation Process. The Tribal Consultation Process was signed and became effective March 2010. Below is a summary of the process for the Tribal Consultation Process: Purpose - The purpose of the agreement is to establish an open and meaningful consultation process between the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services and the Indian Tribes in the State of Nevada to facilitate better communication and collaboration between the entities. Agreement - The guiding principle of the agreement is to ensure that open and meaningful communication occurs in a timely manner for consultation between the parties regarding high- level policy changes that significantly impact Indian Tribes in the State of Nevada. Policy changes that significantly impact Indian Tribes refer to actions that have substantial Tribal implications with direct effects on one or more Indian Tribes, on relationship between the State of Nevada and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of roles on and responsibilities between the State of Nevada and Indian Tribes. A copy of the tribe-state consultation process can be requested from the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP). 1. Please describe the process the State uses to seek advice on a regular ongoing basis from federally- re cognized tribes, Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations on matters related to Medicaid and CHIP programs and for consultation on State Plan Amendments, waiver proposals, waiver extensions, waiver amendments, waiver renewals and proposals for demonstration projects prior to submission to CMS. Please include information about the frequency, inclusiveness and process for seeking such advice. Notification Process In addition to the tribe-state consultation process set forth between DHHS, Tribes, and I/T/Us; TN No.: 10-013 Approval Date: January 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No.: New 9 (Continued Page 1) State: Nevada DHCFP will consult with all federally recognized Tribes and I/T/Us within the State of Nevada on all Medicaid state plan amendments, waiver requests, waiver renewals, demonstration project proposals and/or on all matters that relate to Medicaid and CHIP programs. a. The notifi cation will describe the purpose of the state plan amendment, waiver request, waiver renewal, demonstration project proposal and/or on matter relating to Medicaid and CHIP programs and will include the anticipated impact on Tribal members, Tribes and/or I/T/Us. The description of the impact will not be Tribal member, Tribe and/or I/T/U specific if the impact is similar on all Tribal members, Tribes and/or I/T/Us. b. The notification will also describe a method for Tribes and/or I/T/Us to provide official written comments and questions within a time-frame that allows adequate time for State analysis, consideration of any issues that are raised and the time for discussion between the State and entities responding to the notification. c. Tribes and I/T/Us will be provided a reasonable amount of time to respond to the notification. Whereof, thirty (30) days is considered reasonable. d. In all cases where Tribes and/or I/T/Us request in-person consultation meetings, DHCFP will make these meetings available. e. The tribe-state consultation process allows for an expedited process for notification of policy changes due to budget cuts prior to changes being implemented. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires Medicaid state plan amendments, waiver requests and waiver renewals, which fall within this category to have a notification process prior to these documents being submitted to CMS. Due to this, the State is instituting an expedited process which allows for notification to the tribes of at least one-week n otice prior to the changes being implemented as agreed upon in the tribe-state consultation process or two weeks prior to the submission of the state plan amendments, waiver requests and/or waiver renewals, whichever date precedes. 2. Please describe the consultation process that occurred specifically for the development and submission of this State Plan Amendment, when it occurred and who was involved. State of Nevada, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Tribal Consultation Process: On August 13, 2009, Michael J. Willden (Director, DHHS), Charles Duarte (Administrator, DHCFP) and John Liveratti (Chief of Compliance, DHCFP) met with representatives from the Indian Health Board of Nevada (IHBN) to begin tribal-state collaboration process discussions. To help facilitate this discussion, IHBN presented a draft of the State of Arizona's tribal -state consultation policy. Based on the outcome of this discussion and Arizona's draft policy, Mary Liveratti (Deputy Director, DHHS) created a draft tribal -state consultation policy. The draft policy was completed on September 15, 2009. Subsequently, the Deputy Director presented the draft policy to the IHBN and DHHS division administrators. On October 7, 2009, a follow-up meeting was convened to discuss the draft policy. Those in attendance were Mary Liveratti, Diane Comeaux (Administrator, Division of Child and Family Services), Romaine Gilliland (Administrator, Division of Welfare TN No. 10-013 Approval Date: April 5, 2011 Effective Date: January 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. NEW TN No. 10-013 Approval Date: April 5, 2011 Effective Date: January 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. NEW 9 (Continued Page 2) State: Nevada and Supportive Services), Carol Sala (Administrator, Division of Aging and Disability Services), Dr. Luana Ritch (Health Division) and Larry Curley (Indian Health Board Nevada).

Those in attendance were Mary Liveratti, Diane Comeaux, Romaine Gilliland, Carol Sala, Dr. Luana Ritch, Larry Curley, Sherry Rupert (Executive Director, Nevada Indian Commission)1, and Darryl Crawford (Executive Director, Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada). Based on agreements established during this meeting, in December 2009, DHHS mailed an explanatory letter (viz., requesting their input) and the draft tribal-state consultation policy to all Federally Recognized Tribes, Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada, Indian Health Services and Tribal and Urban organizations residing within the State of Nevada. Based on feedback from the chairpersons, DHHS developed a final policy. In January 2010, DHHS mailed policy agreement letters, along with the final policy, to all the tribal chairpersons. Tribes were asked to sign and return the letters to DHHS. As of March 31, 2010, DHHS received 11 responses. On March 31, 2010, the Director sent out a memorandum to all of the division administrators, along with the policy, requesting they sign and return the policy agreement letters to DHHS.

If so, please describe the algorithm used for passive enrollment and how the algorithm and the state's provision of information meets all of the requirements of 42 CFR 438.54(c)(4),(5),(6),(7), and (8). Voluntary populations are assigned an MCO using the same alg orithm and notification process described in question 2 below for mandatory enrollment. ii. Please indicate how long the enrollee will have to disenroll from the plan and return to the fee -for-service delivery system: Nevada's voluntary managed care populati ons can request disenrollment from their plan to return to fee -for-service at any time during their managed care enrollment. Disenrollment approval is subject to voluntary population disenrollment requirements as outlined in policy. 2. For mandatory enrollment: (see 42 CFR 438.54(d)) a. Please describe how the state fulfills its obligations to provide information as specified in 42 CFR 438.10(c)(4), 42 CFR 438.10(e) and 42 CFR 438.54(d)(3). At the time of application, the applicant is provided with each MCO plan's telephone number and website. The MCOs have complete lists of active providers on their websites. The applicants also have access to a comparison chart of the MCOs which highlights each plan's added benefits . A first -time ben eficiary, that is one who has never been enrolled in an MCO and who is not joining an established case, will be asked to complete their selection of an MCO at the time of Medicaid application. Their enrollment will go into effect immediately upon approval of their Medicaid eligibility. Absent a choice by the applicant, the State will complete a default enrollment process, and they will be assigned to an MCO based upon an algorithm developed by the State to distribute enrollees among the MCOs. The benefici ary has a 90 -day period in which they are entitled to change MCOs. Beneficiaries may also change their MCO once every 12 months during open enrollment. For a beneficiary, new to Medicaid or returning, who is joining an open case where another family membe r is currently enrolled in an MCO; they will automatically be assigned to the same MCO as the rest of the family and will not have a 90 day right to change period. Their enrollment will go into effect immediately upon approval of their Medicaid eligibility . State: Nevada TN No. 22-0001 Supersedes TN : 2022 8-0933 Citation Condition or Requirement ______________________________________________________________________________________________ These new case members, as well as the rest of the family, remain locked -in until the next open enrollment period. A returning Medicaid beneficiary who had a lapse in managed care enrollment for two months or less due to a loss in Medicaid eligibility will automatically be assigned to their former MCO. For those returning in the first month, their enrollment will go into effect the beginning of that month with no lapse in enrollment. For those returning in the second month, their enrollment will go into effect immediately upon approval of their Medicaid eligibility. They will not have a 90 day right to change period and will be considered locked -in until the next open enrollment period. A returning Medicaid beneficiary, who had a lapse in managed care enrollment for two months or less for reasons other than a loss in Medicaid eligibility OR for more than two months no matter the reason, will have enrollment rules applied as follows. Their enrollment will go into effect immediately upon approval of their Medicaid eligibility. If the beneficiary is returning to an open case where another family member is currently enrolled in an MCO, they will automatically be assigned to the same MCO as the rest of the family and they will not have a 90 day right to change period and will be considered locked -in until the next open enrollment period. If there are no other family members on the case currently enrolled in an MCO, and the beneficiary made a new MCO choice on their application, they will be enrolled into their MCO of choice and may disenroll without cause within the first 90 days of enrollment. If the beneficiary did not make a new choice on their application, they will be assigned to their former MCO and may disenroll without cause within the first 90 d ays of enrollment. Regardless of which enrollment or default assignment process is used, the head of household will be notified of all choices that need to be made, the timeframe for making these choices, and the consequence of not making a choice. For th e MCOs, the total maximum lock -in period is 12 months inclusive of the initial 90 days up front to disenroll without cause. The beneficiaries will be notified of their option to change MCOs at least 60 days prior to the end of the lock -in period. Beneficia ries will be allowed to change MCOs during the annual open enrollment period. b. If applicable, please check here to indicate that the state provides an enrollment choice period , as described in 42 CFR 438.54(d)(2)(i), No. 22-0001 Approval : 2022 8-0933 Condition or Requirement ______________________________________________________________________________________________ which individuals who are subj ect to mandatory enrollment may make an active choice to select a managed care plan, or will otherwise be enrolled in a plan selected by the State's default enrollment process. i. Please indicate the length of the enrollment choice period: The beneficiary h as a 90 -day period in which they are entitled to change MCOs. Beneficiaries may also change their MCO once every 12 months during open enrollment c. If applicable, please check here to indicate that the state uses a default enrollment process, as described in 42 CFR 438.54(d)(5), for individuals who are subject to mandatory enrollment. i. If so, please describe the algorithm used for default enrollment and how it meets all of the requirements of 42 CFR 438.54(d)(4), (5), (7), and (8). To reduce large disparities and adverse risk between MCOs, the State uses a default assignment algorithm for auto -assignment of first -time beneficiaries. The algorithm will give weighted preference to any new MCO, as well as MCOs with significantly lower enrollments. Thi s is based on a formula developed by the State. The State may also adjust the auto-assignment algorithm in consideration of the MCO's clinical performance measure results or other measurements. The algorithm is as follows: *Auto Assignment Algorithm Number of Plans in Geographic Service Area Percentage of Beneficiaries Assigned to Largest Plan Percentage of Beneficiaries Assigned to 2nd Largest Plan Percentage of Beneficiaries Assigned to 3rd Largest Plan Percentage of Beneficiaries Assigned to 4th Largest Plan 2 plans 34% 66% 3 plans 17% 33% Approval : 2022 8-0933 Citation Condition or Requirement ______________________________________________________________________________________________ * The function of the algorithm is to ultimately achieve no more than a 10% differential in enrollment between all MCO contractors. Once the differential is achieved, use of this algorithm will be discontinued and head of households will be auto assigned o n rotating basis. d. If applicable, please check here to indicate that the state uses a passive enrollment process, as described in 42 CFR 438.54(d)(2), for individuals who are subject to mandatory enrollment. i. If so, please describe the algorithm used for passive enrollment and how it meets all of the requirements of 42 CFR 438.54(d)(4), (6), (7), and (8). 1932(a)(4) 3.

There are qualifications (that are reasonably related to developing service plans) for persons responsible for the dev elopment of the individualized, person -centered service plan. (Specify qualifications): State: Nevada \u00a71915(i) State Plan HCBS State Plan Attachment 3.1 -I.2 Page 18 TN#: 23-0007 Approval Date: June 16, 2023 Effective Date: March 29, 2023 Supersedes: TN#: 21-0002 The development of the person -centered service plan will focus on a strengths and needs -driven approach that provides intensive care management in a team setting usin g a Child and Family Team approach. The CFT team includes the Care Coordinator, child or youth, caregiver(s), support persons identified by the family (paid and unpaid), and service providers, including the youth's treating clinician as available. The process is designed to promote youth and parent involvement as active members of the CFT. The goals of CFT meetings are to manage care and services to avoid fragmentation, ensure access to appropriate and person -centered care, and provide a team approach t o address needs. Youth and parent/guardian involvement is essential in the assessment of safety; strengths; medical, social, behavioral, educational , and cultural needs; skill building; family/caregiver supports and services; and goals. The Care Coordinator will utilize assessments to create the individualized POC for children and families. The plan will include needs, outcomes, and strategies that are: Specific. The CFT, including the family should know exactly what must be completed or changed and why. Measurable. Everyone should know when the needs have been met. Outcomes will be measurable to the extent that they are behaviorally based and written in clear and understandable language. Achievable. The CFT and family should be able meet the identified needs in a designated time period given the resources that are accessible and available to support change. The person -centered POC will include detailed service plans for applicable 1915(i) services. The CFT shall develop the initial POC, which will be documented by the Care Coordinator. The Care Coordinator will also be responsible for documenting updates to the POC, including recommendations and decisions made by the CFT, in accordance with timeframes as listed in DCFS policy. The Car e Coordinator is responsible to submit the developed POC to the QIO -like vendor for approval. 6. Supporting the Participant in Development of Person -Centered Service Plan . Supports and information are made available to the participant (and/or the additional parties specified, as appropriate) to direct and be actively engaged in the person -centered service plan development process. (Specify: (a) the supports and information made ava ilable, and (b) the participant' s authority to determine who is included in the process): DCFS offers tiered care coordination services to best meet the needs of youth with serious emotional disturbance (SED). Youth with the highest level of need receive High Fidelity Wr aparound. While we anticipate that nearly all youth who are eligible for 1915(i) State plan benefit will also qualify for High Fidelity Wraparound due to intensive behavioral healthcare needs, we have included in this application the possibility that yout h may be routed to FOCUS or SAFE and may have a Care Manager or Case Worker leading their Child and Family Team (CFT) and the development of their POC. Youth with intermediate level of need (not in Washoe or Clark counties) are offered FOCUS Care Coordina tion, an evidence -informed intermediate level care coordination program created by the National Wraparound Implementation Center which also provides training and technical assistance to Nevada in State: Nevada \u00a71915(i) State Plan HCBS State Plan Attachment 3.1 -I.2 Page 19 TN#: 23-0007 Approval Date: June 16, 2023 Effective Date: March 29, 2023 Supersedes: TN#: 21-0002 our implementation of High -Fidelity Wraparound . FOCUS Care C oordination is a new, evidence - informed intermediate level care coordination program created by the National Wraparound Implementation Center which also provides training and technical assistance to Nevada in our implementation of High -Fidelity Wraparound. FOCUS care coordination is built around the following elements of service: Families are laughing, i.e. positive relationships are necessary for healing; Outcomes; Coordination; Unconditional positive regard; and Short -term process (FOCUS). Youth receiving FOCUS will have a Care Manager directing the development of the POC. Youth in Washoe and Clark Counties are offered care coordination utilizing , the Safety Assessment Family Evaluation (SAFE) model. This is a strengths -based, family -centered, and trauma -informed model to inform child welfare agency decision -making. Child safety is the primary focus of the SAFE model, and focus is given to childre n who may be unsafe based on the presence of uncontrolled danger threats. SAFE uses standardized tools and decision -making criteria to assess family behaviors, conditions, and circumstances, including individual child vulnerabilities and caregiver protect ive capacities, to make well - founded child safety decisions. The practice model's approach to safety assessment and management recognizes that issues concerned with child safety change as the child protective services intervention proceeds. Y outh receivin g SAFE will have a Case Worker directing the development of the POC. The child's/youth's family is informed verbally and in writing about overall services available in the State Plan HCBS benefit at the time they make the choice to receive 1915(i) service s. One of the key philosophies in the Wraparound process is family -driven care. This means that parent(s) or legal guardian, youth and family members are the primary decision makers in the care of their family. The Care Coordinator is responsible for worki ng with the participant, family, and team to develop the Plan of Care through the process outlined below. Within 72 hours of notification of enrollment, the Care Coordinator contacts the participant and family to schedule a face -to-face meeting. At the fi rst meeting between the Care Coordinator, participant, and family after enrollment, the Care Coordinator will: (a) Administer the appropriate assessments, as designated by DCFS; (b) Work with the participant and family to develop an initial crisis plan tha t includes response to immediate service needs; (c) Execute signing of releases of information and all necessary consents (d) Provide an overview of the wraparound process; and (e) Facilitate the family sharing their story. The Care Coordinator will, with the participant and family: identify needs that they will work on in the planning process; determine who will attend team meetings; contact potential team members, provide them with an overview of the care management process, and discuss expectations for the first team meeting; conduct an initial assessment of strengths of the participant, their family members and potential team members; and establish with the family their vision statement. The team, which includes the participant and his or her family an d informal and formal supports will determine the family vision which will guide the planning process; identify strengths of the entire team; be notified of the needs that the team will be working on; determine outcome statements for meeting identified nee ds; determine the specific services and supports required to achieve the goals State: Nevada \u00a71915(i) State Plan HCBS State Plan Attachment 3.1 -I.2 Page 20 TN#: 23-0007 Approval Date: June 16, 2023 Effective Date: March 29, 2023 Supersedes: TN#: 21-0002 identified in the POC; create a mission statement that the team generates and commits to following; identify the responsible person(s) for each of the strategies in the POC; review and update the crisis plan; and meet at least every 30 days to coordinate the implementation of the POC and update the POC as necessary. The plan must also address the methods used to ensure the active participation of the client and/or the legally responsible person and others to develop such goals and to identify the steps or actions each CFT member will take to respond to the assessed service needs of the participant. This will be demonstrated by the CFT members signing and dating the plan and any updates made to the plan during plan updates and reviews language. The Care Coordinator in collaboration with the team shall reevaluate the POC at least every 90 days with re-administration of DCFS -approved assessments as appropriate. 7. Informed Choice of Providers. (Describe how partic ipants are assisted in obtaining information about and selecting from among qualified providers of the 1915(i) services in the person -centered service plan): 8. Process for Making Person -Centered Service Plan Subject to the Approval of the Medicaid Agency . (Describe the process by which the person -centered service plan is made subject to the approval of the Medicaid agency): DHCFP, through an Interlocal agreement with DCFS, delegates the responsibility for service plan approval to an independent contracted entity (QIO -like vendor). As part of its routine operations, DHCFP's contracted entity, must review each service plan subm itted to ensure the plan addresses all pertinent issues identified through the assessment. The DHCFP contractor enters the determination of his/her review in the Provider Portal database. The Provider Portal database interfaces with the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) for processing and tracking of eligible individuals, 1915(i) services and claims reimbursements. The DHCFP contractor informs DHCFP and DCFS of any issues related to the review and approval or denial of service plans. DHCFP retain s the authority and oversight of the 1915(i) program delegated to DCFS. In addition, the DHCFP and DCFS reviews and approves the policies, processes and standards for developing and approving the care plan. All participants or legal guardians read and sign a \"Statement of Understanding\" form. The Statement of Understanding read s, \"The 1915(i) HCBS are optional Nevada Medicaid services. Assessment of my diagnoses and needs will direct the services to be provided, as determined by the Child and Family Team led by the Care Coordinator. I have the opportunity to participate as an ac tive member of the Child and Family Team. The Child and Family team will support me in selecting providers for medically necessary HCBS services. My family and I had a voice and choice in the selection of services, providers , and interventions, when possi ble, in the SAFE, FOCUS, or Wraparound process of building my family's Plan of Care. I choose to receive HCBS. I understand that I have to be eligible for Medicaid to remain in this program. I have been offered a choice among applicable services and availa ble providers.\" By signing this form participants acknowledge they have chosen from a list of available providers. Provider enrollment into the program will not be limited; an ongoing enrollment of providers will promote choice and accessibility.

Such guidelines include, but are not limited to, identifying probable cause, development of interventions to improve pe rformances, trend analysis on performance measures, etc. On an as needed basis, the QA Unit conducts educational trainings with the Operating Agencies regarding how to perform case file and provider reviews. Provider reviews are entered into the provider database to be tracked and deficiencies flagged. Depending on the deficiency, referrals are sent to an appropriate state agency for review and corrective action plan as appropriate. Case Management records are in a case management database which generates reports needed for QA case file reviews. Provider records are managed through the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS ) and reviewed by the SMA Fiscal Agent and Provider Enrollment Unit. Electronic submission of claims is also done thro ugh InterChange, which has built -in edits to ensure claims are processed correctly and appropriately. Serious Occurrence Reports (SORs) are tracked through a Child Welfare (CPS) which is monitored and reviewed by the Operating Agencies Care Coordinator S upervisors . 2.

If an HMO lacks sufficient contracts, the state will not begin enrollment in the HMO. The effective date of the Medicaid contract with an HMO is dependent upon the HMO meeting all contract requiremen ts. 4. The State will conduct reviews at least annually. Provider contracts will be reviewed again and, if the HMO is deficient, the State will suspend enrollment and request a plan of corrective action. Between readiness reviews and annual reviews, the State will review any information regarding access problems and conduct reviews and apply contract suspension of enrollment rules when necessary. C.

The State defines \"estate\" as follows: \"ESTATE\" - means all real a nd personal property and other assets included in the estate of a deceased recipient of Medicaid and any other assets in or to which he/she had an interest or legal title at the time of their death, to the extent of that interest or title. The term includ es assets passing by reason of joint tenancy, tenants -in-common , life estate, survivorship, living trust, annuity, homestead or other arrangement. 2. The State uses the following notification procedures): a. Advance Notice Procedure 1) All Medicai d applicants are notified of the Medicaid Estate Recovery program at their initial application process and annual redetermination, via the Signature and Affirmation (2920 -EM (9/01) which they read and sign. Along with the application or redetermination, th e applicant is provided with \"Medicaid Estate Recovery Notification of Program Operation\" (form 6160) which is signed and dated by the eligibility worker to confirm that a copy was provided to the applicant. The applicant keeps a copy of this form and a co py is filed in the permanent section of the client's case file. b. Recovery Notification Procedures Immediately following case identification, all known heirs, survivors and designated representatives are notified of: 1) the State's interest in the deceden t's estate and of the right to recovery, 2) the amount of Medicaid assistance paid, to date, on behalf of the decedent, 3) the priority of estate creditors as defined by Nevada State Law, and 4) the method through which an undue hardship waiver may be pursued. 3. The State defines undue hardship as severe financial duress or a significant compromise to an individual's health care or shelter needs. 4. Application for Undue Hardship Waiver - Any heir or survivor may seek an undue hardship waiver by submitting a written r equest for a waiver by completing an \"Application (Request) for a Hardship Waiver Regarding Recovery of Correctly Paid Medicaid Benefits\" form, within thirty (30) days of notification of the Division's intent to recover. Documentary evidence that supports the applicant's claim should be attached. The written decision of the Administrator will be provided to the applicant 90-days from receipt of the request. TN No. 02-09 Approval Date: April 14, 2003 Effective Date: Supersedes TN No. 95-11 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.17 -A Page 2 5. The State will waive enforcement of any estate recovery claim when the requesting party is abl e to show, through convincing evidence, the state's pursuit of estate recovery subjects them to undue hardship. A claim for emotional hardship is not considered sufficient to warrant waiver approval. No waiver will be granted if the Division finds the undu e hardship was created by estate planning methods by which the waiver applicant or deceased client divested, transferred or otherwise encumbered assets, in whole or part, to avoid estate recovery. In determining whether undue hardship exists, the following criteria will be used: a. The asset to be recovered is the sole income -producing asset of the applicant; or, b. The recovery of the assets would result in the applicant becoming eligible for governmental public assistance based on need and/or medical assistan ce programs; or, c. A doctor's written verification of a medical condition that compromises the applicant's ability to repay the Medicaid claim. 6. If an undue hardship waiver is requested and the State determines that none of the a bove conditions apply, full payment of the claim may be ordered, recovery may be temporarily waived, compromised, or modified. The following factors shall be considered individually or in combination when making a decision to temporarily waive, modify, or compromise estate recovery: a. The gross annual income, property and other assets of the applicant and their immediate family; b. The type and level of care provided by the applicant (caregiver) to the decedent and the extent to which the care delayed or pr evented the institutionalization of the decedent; 1) The State uses the following process for determining if the applicants will be considered as caregivers when through clear evidence they substantiate: a) Maintained residency in the Medicaid recipien t's home for at least two years immediately preceding the recipient's death or admission into a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded or other medical institutions; and b) Provided care for the Medicaid recipient which meets o r exceeds published state standard established for Intermediate Care Level (ICL 1), which includes as necessary, assisting the individual with ambulatory needs, feeding, grooming, personal hygiene, oral hygiene, nail care, bathing toilet activities, skin c are and medical needs. c. The applicant continuously resided with the decedent for two years or more immediately prior to the decedent's death and continues to reside in the decedent's residence and the prior occupancy permitted the decedent to reside at home rather than in an institution; d. The estimated value of the real or personal property at issue. If the cost of recovering the asset(s) of the deceased Medicaid recipient is more than the value of the asset(s), it would not be cost effective to rec over, and/or; e. The financial impact of recovery against immediate family members of the applicant.

Applicants who seek a recovery delay (i.e., temporary waiver) will be given the opportunity to provide written details or complete an \"Application for a Hardship Waiver Regarding Recovery of Correctly Paid Medicaid Benefits\" form, within 30 -days of notification of the Division's intent to recover. 7. The following collection methods may be utilized when recovery is temporarily waived, co mpromised, or modified: a. Reduction of recovery amount; b. Reasonable payment schedule based on the asset to be recovered; and/or c. Where not prohibited by law, imposition of a lien against the assets of the deceased Medicaid recipient. 1) Before imposition o f a lien, the Division shall notify all persons having an interest in the estate of the deceased Medicaid recipient and petition the appropriate district court for the imposition of a lien per NRS 422.29355. 2) If a lien is placed on an individual's home, ad justment or recovery will only be made when: a) there is no surviving spouse; b) there is no child under the age of 21; or c) there is no blind or disabled (as defined in Section 1614 of the Social Security Act) child of the Medicaid recipient. 3) The lien will bec ome due and payable upon the sale, refinance, transfer or change in title to the real property; and /or escrow funding, but only when there is no surviving spouse, children under 21, blind or disabled children of the Medicaid recipient . Recovery is limited to the Medicaid recipient's interest in the property at the time of claim payment not to exceed the Medicaid claim or the percentage of interest of the Medicaid recipient in the asset. 4) Upon payment of the claim, or need of the statutory exemptions, the division will prepare a release of lien or subordinate the lien. This release will be provided to the appropriate entity; such as, an escrow company or the county recorder's office. 8. The following time frames are used by the State in considering the wa iving of estate recoveries: a. Any beneficiary, heir or family member claiming entitlement to receive the assets of the deceased Medicaid recipient may apply for a hardship waiver by submitting a written request for a waiver within 30 -days of being notified of intent to recover to the Medicaid Estate Recovery unit. b. The Division may request additional information or documentation from the waiver applicant. If some or all of the additional information or documentation is not provided within 30 days of the request, the hardship waiver request will be considered solely on the basis of the information and documentation provided.

Within 90 -days of receipt of the undue hardship waiver requ est, the Division Administrator OR his appointed representative, will issue a written decision granting or d enying the applicant's request for an undue hardship waiver. 9. The State defines cost -effective as follows (include methodology/thresholds used to de termine cost effectiveness): a. Cost-effective recovery is accomplished when the amount recovered exceeds the administrative (direct or indirect) expense associated with obtaining the recovery such as , but not limited to, legal fees and expenses. b. Many of th e estate recovery activities have been automated thereby minimizing corresp ondence costs. Indivi dual case analysis and management is not required until a ninety (90) day delinquency has occurred. c. Therefore, case costs would begin to accrue after this t ime. Costs such as, but not limited to, staff costs, document filing fees, legal costs, postage, copying, travel and indirect administrative costs would be considered. 10. The Division may elect not to recover a Medicaid Estate Recovery claim when the Sta te determines that it is not cost-effective to do so. a. Cost-effectiveness will be decided on a case -by-case basis. b. If the Medicaid claim is $100 or less or the value of the asset to be recovered is $100 or less, recovery may not be pursued. 11. Hearing and Appeal Procedures a. If the undue hardship waiver is denied, the decision may be appealed within 30 days through the appropriate district court (Administrative Procedure Act 233B.130). 12. Action to Enforce Recovery: a. Actions to enforce recovery of Medi caid Estate Recovery claims are accomplished through legal means using, if necessary, the appropriate court of juris diction. Use of the court protects the due process right of all and guarantees safe protection of the law. b.

B. State Assurances . The State makes the following additional assurances: 1. For hospitals -- a. 447.253(c) - In determining payment when there has been a sale or transfer of the assets of a hospital, the State's methods and stand ards provide that payment rates can reasonably be expected not to increase in the aggregate solely as a result of changes of ownership, more than payments would increase under Medicare under 42 CFR 413,130, 414.134, 413.153 and 413.157 insofar as these sec tions affect payment for depreciation, interest on capital indebtedness, return on equity (if applicable), acquisition costs for which payments were previously made to prior owners, and the recapture of depreciation. 2. 447.253(e) - The State provides for an appeals or exception procedure that allows individual providers an opportunity to submit additional evidence and receive prompt administrative review, with respect to such issues as the State determines appropriate, of payment rates. 3. 447.253(f) - The Sta te requires the filing of uniform cost reports by each participating provider. 4. 447.253(g) - The State provides for periodic audits of the financial and statistical records of participating providers. 5. 447.253(h) The State has complied with the public noti ce requirements of 42 CFR 447.205.

HOSPITALS UNDER PROSPECTIVE RATES Types of rates: Inpatient hospital services, which have been authorized for payment at the acute level by a quality improvement organization ( QIO-like vendor) , as specified in the contract between the QIO-like vendor and Nevada Medicaid, are reimbursed by all-inclusive, prospective per diem rates by type of admission. The all -inclusive prospective rates cover routine and ancillary services furnished by the hospital, including direct patient care for professional services furnished to inpatients by hospital -staffed physicians and practitioners. All-inclusive per diem rates are developed for Maternity, Newborn, Neonatal, Rehabilitative/ Specialty Hospital, Level I Trauma, M edical/ Surgical, and Psychiatric/ Substance Abuse Treatment admissions, as described in Sections II, III, and IV. All-inclusive rates for selected Organ Transplants are described in Section III. Administrative day rate development is covered in Section V. Critical Access Hospitals under Medicare retrospective cost reimbursements are described in Section VII. II. PROSPECTIVE RATE DEVELOPMENT (Prior to September 1, 2003) The primary goals of the inpatient hospital rate method ology are: Rates should be based on actual, reasonable and allowable hospital costs and the rate development me thod should comply with federal requirements. The prospective rates are inclusive of all ancillary services required by patients. A. Basic data sources for tier rate development . 1. The most recently filed Hospital Health Care Complex Cost Report (HCFA 2552 ) was the basis for identifying allowable cost. Routine cost limits were not applied. 2. Paid claims and billing information were taken from the Nevada database for Medicaid claim payment history report for services provided during the period covered by the HCFA 2552.

Adjustments made to determine allowable cost. The following adjustments were made to each individual hospital's cost report: 1. An audit adjustment was applied to the total Medicaid cost for each hospital. The adjustment was determined by using an average for each hospital of the audit adjustment percentages for the three most recent years available. Adjustments for two years were used if three were not available. 2. Since the hospitals' cost report periods vary, all cost data was indexed to the same period, using the Medicare inflation factor for non-prospective payment system (non- PPS) hospitals.

In order to convert to a MMIS system on September 1, 2003, hospital reimbursement tier rates will be converted to per diem rates. The Maternity and Newborn service categories will be retained. The service category Medical/Surgical will be converted to Level I Trauma and Medical/Surgical categories. These per diem rates will be effective for claims paid on or after September 1, 2003, with admission dates before September 8, 2008. The Level I Trauma will be retained at the September 1, 2003 amount.

Maternity Rate Conversion An all-inclusive per diem rate is paid for obstetrical hospital admissions. The rate also covers related admissions such as false labor, undelivered OB, and miscarriages. Historical Medicaid data for the Calendar Year (CY) ended December 31, 2002, has been extracted showing Medicaid Maternity admissions and Maternity patient days by tier. Projected Maternity payments for each tier are calculated as CY2002 Maternity admissions per tier times the current tier rate. Total projected Maternity payments are the sum of all projected tier payments. The conversion per diem rate for Maternity has been determined by the following formula: Total Projected Maternity Payments ----------------------------------------------------------- = Maternity Per CY2002 Historical Maternity Patient Days Diem Rate For services performed on or after January 1, 2006, the maternity per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.1001 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed on or after July 1, 2007, the maternity per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.0757 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after September 8, 2008, the maternity per diem rate will be calculated as follows: 1. Charges submitted for claims paid in SFY 2007 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. 2. The number of days admitted (the length of stay) for claims paid in SFY 2007 was used to calcul ate each claim's billed charges per day. 3. The per diem rate will be 34% of the median of billed charges per day for Nevada in-patient hospitals for obstetric services. This rate will be used as a prospective rate until rebased as directed by the Departmen t of Health and Human Services. There will be no cost settlement. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after July 9, 2015, the maternity per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.05 times the September 8, 2008 per diem rate.

Newborn Rate Calculation An all-inclusive per diem rate will be developed for newborns admitted through routine delivery at a hospital. Historical Medicaid data for the Calendar Year (CY) ended December 31, 2002, has been extracted showing Medicaid Newborn admissions and Newborn patient days by tier. Projected Newborn payments for each tier are calculated as CY2002 Newborn admissions per tier times the current tier rate. Total projected Newborn payments are the sum of all projected tier payments. The conversion per diem rate for Newborn has been determined by the following formula: Total Projected Newborn Payments ----------------------------------------------------------- = Newborn Per CY2002 Historical Newborn Patient Days Diem Rate For services performed on or after January 1, 2006, the newborn per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.1001 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed on or after July 1, 2007, the newborn per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.0757 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after September 8, 2008, the newborn per diem rate will be calculated as follows: 1. Charges submitted for claims paid in SFY 2007 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. 2. The number of days admitted (the length of stay) for claims paid in SFY 2007 was used to calculate each claim's billed charges per day. 3. The per diem rate will be 34% of the median of billed charges per day for Nevada in-patient hospital routine services related to the care of a newborn. This rate will be used as a prospective rate until rebased as directed by the Department of Health and Human Services. There will be no cost settlement. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after July 9, 2015, the newborn per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.05 times the September 8, 2008 per diem rate.

Neonatal Intensive Care Rate Calculation For admissions prior to September 8, 2008: A separate rate is used for patients admitted to Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units. The current rate was developed from historical costs pursuant to Section II, Prospective Rate Development. The calculated cost per day of each neonatal unit was arrayed from highest to lowest. The prospective per diem rate was then calculated at the 55th percentile and indexed. For admissions on or after September 8, 2008: 1. Charges submitted for claims paid in SFY 2007 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. 2. The number of days admitted (the length of stay) for claims paid in SFY 2007 was used to calculate each claim's billed charges per day. 3. The per diem rate will be 34% of the median of billed charges per day for Nevada in-patient hospital services for Neonatal Intensive Care. This rate will be used as a prospective rate until rebased as directed by the Department of Health and Human Services. There will be no cost settlement. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after January 1, 2020, the per diem rate for Neonatal Intensive Care services will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.25 times the September 8, 2008 per diem rates. 1.

Rehabilitative and Specialty Hospital Rate Calculation A few Nevada hospitals are licensed to provide acute care in single diagnostic category. Rehabilitative and specialty hospital patients generally have hospital stays of ninety or more days. The length of stay does not significantly influence the cost per day. To the extent these hospitals participate in Medicaid, they are reimbursed as follows: 1. Inpatient hospital services which have been certified for payment at the acute level by a QIO-like vendor are reimbursed an all-inclusive per diem rate at the lowest rate acceptable to both parties. In establishing the lowest rate acceptable to both parties, Nevada Medicaid reviews cost information filed by the provider, amounts paid by other insurers and national literature on comparable costs for similar services. The rate cannot exceed the reasonable and customary charges of the facility for similar services.

Medical/Surgical Rate Development The current tier rate will be paid for Medical/Surgical payments made on or prior to August 31, 2003. Beginning September 1, 2003, an all-inclusive per diem rate will be paid for general hospital admission, not meeting the criteria of patients described in Parts B. - D. and F. of this Section or Section IV. Historical Medicaid data for the Calendar Year (CY) ended December 31, 2002, has been extracted showing Medicaid Medical/Surgical admissions and Medical/Surgical patient days by tier. Projected Medical/Surgical payments for each tier are calculated as CY2002 Medical/Surgical admissions per tier times the current tier rate. Total projected Medical/Surgical payments are the sum of all projected tier payments. The conversion per diem rate for the Medical/Surgical category has been determined by the following formula: Total Projected Medical/Surgical Payments ----------------------------------------------------------- = Medical/Surgical Per CY2002 Historical Medical/Surgical Patient Days Diem Rate For services performed on or after January 1, 2006, the medical/surgical per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.1001 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed on or after July 1, 2007, the medical/surgical per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.0757 times the conversion per diem rate. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after September 8, 2008, the medical/surgery per diem rate will be calculated as follows: 1. Charges submitted for claims paid in SFY 2007 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. 2. The number of days admitted (the length of stay) for claims paid in SFY 2007 was used to calculate each claim's billed charges per day. 3. The per diem rate will be 22% of the median of billed charges per day for Nevada in- patient hospital services for medical/surgery procedures. This rate will be used as a prospective rate until rebased as directed by the Department of Health and Human Services. There will be no cost settlement. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after July 9, 2015, the medical/surgical per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.05 times the September 8, 2008 per diem rate.

PSYCHIATRIC/SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT RATE DEVELOPMENT Psychiatric/substance abuse treatment admissions can vary from short stays to several weeks. The length of stay does not significantly impact the cost per day. Therefore, a per diem rate is a more appropriate method to pay acute care hospitals providing this type of service. 1. Psychiatric/substance abuse treatment costs for each hospital are divided by the number of psychiatric/substance abuse treatment days to determine a cost per day. The Medicaid related costs of freestanding psychiatric hospitals are determined using the steps in Section II, Parts A and B, then dividing their Medicaid costs by their total Medicaid days to determine the cost per day. The calculated cost per day of each general acute care hospital and freestanding psychiatric hospital is arrayed from highest to lowest. The prospective per diem rate is then calculated at the 55th percentile and indexed in accordance with Section II, Part E of this plan. a. These rates do not apply to facilities accredited as Residential Treatment Centers by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Organizations (JCAHO). For services performed on or after July 1, 2014, the psychiatric/substance abuse per diem rate will be determined as follows: 2. General acute hospitals providing inpatient psychiatric services will be reimbursed with a per diem. a. Billed charges for inpatient psychiatric claims paid in SFY ending June 30 , 2013 were used from the Nevada Medicaid claims data. b. The aggregate average billed charges per day was calculated for all Nevada Medicaid enrolled general acute hospitals using this data. c. The per diem rate will be 37% of the aggregate average billed charges per day for Nevada Medicaid enrolled inpatient general acute hospital psychiatric services. 3. Freestanding psychiatric hospitals are reimbursed at the lowest rate acceptable to Nevada Medicaid and the provider. In establishing the lowest rate acceptable to both parties, Nevada Medicaid will review cost information filed by the provider, rates received from other state Medicaid programs and other information it deems pertinent to calculate an average cost per day. Considering this information, Nevada Medicaid will then assign an individual rate to each provider. This rate will remain in effect until the DHCFP authorizes a change. The rate cannot exceed the reasonable and customary charges of the facility.

In no case may payment exceed audited allowable costs. b. Interim rates will be based upon the most recent audited cost reports for the current state fiscal year. The interim rate for the initial year of operation will be based upon cost and utilization projections. c. Each facility is paid an interim rate subject to a cost settlement.

ADMINISTRATIVE DAY RATE DEVELOPMENT For those patients who remain in an acute care hospital awaiting admittance to a long-term care facility, an administrative day rate is used. Services so reimbursed are call \"administrative days.\" The administrative rate is based on statewide weighted average payment rate established in 2003 for skilled and intermediate levels of care. The administrative rate is lower than the hospital rate as described in Part II of the State Plan. For services performed for claims with an admission date on or after July 9, 2015, the intermediate level administrative day per diem rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.05 times the rate. VI. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTERS Nevada Medicaid will only pay for stays in facilities accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation Health Organizations (JCAHO) as Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs). All stays must be pre-approved by the QIO-like vendor. These services will be reimbursed at the lowest rate acceptable to both parties. In establishing the lowest rate acceptable to both parties, Nevada Medicaid reviews cost information filed by the RTC, amounts paid by other insurers, and national literature on costs for RTCs. Each facility will have a negotiated rate established for each general level of service. If a placement is being proposed which is different from the general level of care offered by the facility, a rate will be negotiated after considering the average cost per day of the facility and the additional will be reviewed based upon cost information received on or prior July 1 of the year of review. The rate cannot exceed the reasonable and customary charges of the facility for similar services.

HOSPITALS UNDER MEDICAID RETROSPECTIVE COST REIMBURSEMENT (CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS) A few Nevada hospitals have been designated by Medicare as Critical Access Hospitals. To the extent these hospitals participate in Medicaid, they are reimbursed under Medicare's retrospective cost reimbursement, as follows: A. Inpatient hospital services which have been certified for payment at the acute level by the QIO-like vendor, as specified in the contract between the QIO -like vendor and Nevada Medicaid, upon final settlement are reimbursed allowable costs under hospital -specific retrospective Medicare principles of reimbursement in accordance with 42 CFR 413 and further described in CMS Publications 15 -I and 15 -II. 1. Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) will use the CMS -2552 -10 cost report form and apply Medicare cost principles and cost apportionment methodology. 2. Critical Access Hospitals will file this cost report with the state annually within five months of their respective fiscal yea r end. 3. In general, underpayments will be paid to the provider in a lump sum upon discovery and overpayments will either be recouped promptly or a negative balance set up for the provider. However, other solutions acceptable to both parties may be substitu ted. 4. The federal share of any overpayment is refunded to the federal government in accordance with 42 CFR 433 Subpart F. B. On an interim basis, each hospital is paid for certified acute care at the Provider specific interim Medicaid inpatient per diem rate as follows: 1. Effective July 1, 2009, the base interim rate for Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) will be the FY2007 Total Medicare inpatient per diem rate. This interim rate is defined as total Medicare in -patient cost divided by total Medicare in -patient d ays, and applies to the revenue codes billed by general acute hospitals that fall under the Medical/Surgery level of service category for inpatient services. 2. The CAH Medical/Surg ical/Intensive Care Unit (ICU) interim rate for each CAH will be updated within 90 days of receipt of the most recently audited cost report from the contracted vendor. The interim rate is not to increase more than 50% or decrease more than 25% from the facilities' prior year interim rate.STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: Nevada Attachment 4.19 -A Page 15 a TN No.: 22-0021 Approval The updated CAH Medical/Surg ical/ICU interim rate will be calculated by dividing the total Title XIX program inpatient costs by the total program inpatient days as reported in the latest available audited Medicare/Medicaid cost report. 4. If Title XIX data repor ted in the latest available audited Medicare/Medicaid cost report is not sufficient to calculate the adjusted CAH Medical/Surg ical/ICU interim rate, the CAH Medical/Surg ical/ICU interim rate will default to the Medical/Surg ical/ICU rate paid to general acu te care hospitals for the same service. This applies only to Critical Access Hospitals that have an existing CAH Medical/Surg ical/ICU interim rate for the prior year. 5. Maternity newborn, Psychiatric/Substance Abuse and administrative days will be reimburse d at the rate paid to general acute care hospitals for the same in -patient services. a. Critical Access Hospitals with Obstetric/Maternity units may also request a provider -specific interim rate for Maternity services. Interim rates for Maternity services wi ll be calculated by multiplying the hospital -specific Medical/Surgical/ICU rate by 77.8%. b. Obstetric/Maternity days for Critical Access Hospitals who do not request a provider -specific interim rate will be reimbursed at the rate paid to general acute care hospitals for the same inpatient services. 6. Critical Access Hospitals that do not have a CAH Medical/Surg ical/ICU interim rate for the prior year based on the methodology in Paragraph VII.B.3, will be assigned either the prior years' Total Medicare inpatie nt per diem rate if available or the rate paid to general acute care hospitals for the same Medical/Surg ical/ICU level of services until such time as the CAH Medical/Surg ical/ICU interim rate can be updated according to the methodology detailed in Paragrap hs VII.B.2 and VII.B.3. Facilities accredited as Residential Treatment Centers by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Organization (JCAHO) are not considered specialty or general acute hospitals. Residential Treatment Centers are paid in accordance with Paragraph VI above.

HOSPITALS SERVING LOW -INCOME PATIENTS DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITALS (DSH) A. Eligibility - A Nevada hospital will qualify for DSH payment if it meets the conditions of either Paragraph 1 or 2. 1. Subject to the provisions of Subparagraph c, a Nevada hospital will be deemed to qualify for DSH payment if it meets either of the condi tions under subparagraphs a or b. The data used to determine eligibility is from the prior State Fiscal Year ending June 30th. For example, eligibility for SFY 14 DSH is done in the third quarter of SFY 13, using data from SFY 12. a. A hospital's Medicaid inpatient utilization rate (MIUR) is at least one standard deviation above the mean MIUR for hospitals receiving Medicaid payment in the State. i. MIUR is the total number of inpatient days of Medicaid eligible patients, including patients who receive their Medicaid benefits through a health maintenance organization, divided by the total number of inpatient days of all patients during a fiscal year. b. The hospital's low-income utilization rate (LIUR) is at least 25%. LIUR is the sum (expressed as a percentage) of the fractions, calculated as follows: i. Total Medicaid patient revenues paid to the hospital, plus the amount of the cash subsidies for patient service received dire ctly from State and local governments in the cost reporting period, divided by the total amount of revenues of the hospital for patient services (including the amount of such cash subsidies) in the same cost reporting period; and, ii. The total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospital services attributable to charity care (care provided to individuals who have no source of payment, third -party or personal resources) in a cost reporting period, less the portion of any cash subsidies received directly from the state or local government for inpatient hospital services, divided by the total amount of hospital charges for inpatient services in the hospital in the same period. The total inpatient hospital charges attributed to charity care shall n ot include contractual allowances and discounts (other than for indigent patients not eligible for Medicaid assistance under an approved Medicaid State plan), that is, reductions in charges given to other third -party payors, such as HMOs, Medicare or Blue Cross Blue Shield. c. A hospital must: i. have a MIUR of not less than 1%; STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 22 TN No. : 23-0003 Approval Date: June 22, 2023 Effective Date: January 20, 2023 Supersedes TN No. : 13-011 ii. have at least two obstetricians with staff privileges at the hospital who have agreed to provide obstetric services to individuals entitled to such services under State Medicaid plan. In the case of a hospital located in a rural area (that is, an area outs ide of a Metropolitan Statistical Area, as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget) the term \"obstetrician\" includes any physician with staff privileges at the hospital to perform non -emergency obstetric procedures. This does not apply to a hospital in which: (a) the inpatients are predominantly individuals under 18 years of age; or (b) non-emergency obstetric services were not offered as of December 22, 1987. iii. not be an institution for mental disease or other mental health facility subject to the limitation on DSH expenditures under Section 4721 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 2. Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 1c above, a hospital will qualify for DSH payments if it is: a. a public hospital (i.e., hospital owned or operated by a Nevada hospital district, county or other unit of local government); or b. in Nevada counties, which do not have a public hospital, the private hospital which provided the greatest number of Medicaid i npatient days in the previous year; or c. a private hospital - located in a Nevada county which has a public hospital, if the public hospital has a MIUR greater than the average for all the hospitals receiving Medicaid payment in the State. B. Distribution Pools: For the DSH state plan rate years beginning July 1, 2022, and July 1, 2023, h ospitals qualified under Paragraph \"A\" above will be grouped into distribution pools on the following basis: 1. Distribution pools are established as follows: a. All public hospitals qualifying under Paragraph A above and in counties whose population is 700,000 or more, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 32.46 % of the total Amount for Distribution as specified in B.2 for the State Fiscal Year . b. All private hospitals qualifying under paragraph A above and in counties whose population is 700,000 or more, the total annual disproportionate STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 23 TN No. : 23-0003 Approval Date: June 22, 2023 Effective Date: January 20, 2023 Supersedes TN No. : 13-011 share payments will be 9.49% of the total Amount for Distribution as specified in B.2 for the State Fiscal Ye ar. c. All private hospitals qualifying under Paragraph A above and in counties whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 32.90 % of the total Amount for Distribution as specified in B. 2 for the State Fiscal Year. d. All public hospitals qualifying under Paragraph A above and in counties whose population is less than 100,000, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 5.90% of the total Amount for Distribution as specified in B.2 for the State Fiscal Year . e. All private hospitals qualifying under Paragraph A above and in counties whose population is less than 100,000, the total annual disproportionate share payments will be 19.25 % of the total Amount for Distribution as specified in B.2 for the State Fiscal Year. f. Note: There is no public hospital in counties whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000. 2. Amount for Distribution: For the DSH state plan rate year of July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, the total computable payment will be $18,317,765.95. The total amount distributed to an individual hospital may not, under any circumstance, exceed the total uncompensated care costs (DSH limit) for that facility. 3. Total annual uncomp ensated care costs equal the cost of providing services to Medicaid inpatients, Medicaid outpatients and uninsured patients, less the sum of: Regular Medicaid FFS rate payments (excluding DSH payments); Medicaid managed care organization payments; Supplem ental/enhanced Medicaid payments; Uninsured revenues; and Federal Section 1011 payments for uncompensated services to eligible aliens with no source of coverage. 4. An \"uninsured patient\" is defined as an individual without health insurance or other source of third -party coverage (except coverage from State or local programs STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -A Page 24 based on indigency). A system must be maintained by the hospitals to report revenues on Medicaid and uninsured patient accounts to determine uncompensated care cost consistent with Section 1923 (g) of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations at 42 CFR 447 Subpart E. Costs for Medicaid and uninsured patients will be based upon the methodology used in the HCFA 2552 report. Revenue will be deducted from cost. The total costs on the report will be subject to an independent audit. The HCFA 2552 report must be submitted within six months of the hospital's fiscal year end. C. Calculation of Hospital DSH Payments 1. Using supplemental payment data for the DSH program year and the same period outlined on Subparagraph A.1 for all other data, the Division will calculate the DSH payments for each hospital as follows: a. Fifty percent of the pool amount will be distributed based on the percent to total of the uncompensated care percentage of the hospitals within the pool. i. Uncompensated Care Percentage is the uncompensated care cost of the hospital divided by the net patient revenues of the hospital, as reported on the Medicare Cost Report, which is required to be filed with the State. (a) Net patient revenues are total patient revenues less contracted allowances and discounts. This comes from Medicare cost report, Worksheet G-3 Line 3, less any net patient revenue from non- hospital inpatient and non-hospital outpatient services. b. The remaining 50% of the pool amount will be distributed based on the percent to total of the uncompensated care cost of the hospitals within the pool. 2. The DSH payments will be made monthly to the eligible hospitals. Payments will be based on the State Fiscal Year. DSH payment will in no instance exceed a hospital's DSH limit. If any hospital's calc ulated DSH payment exceeds its DSH limit, the excess will be redistributed to the remaining hospitals within the pool using the same formula above. D. Adjusting DSH payments based on DSH Independent Certified Audit results 1. The Division will audit each hospital for each year in which the hospital received a disproportionate share payment pursuant to NRS, NAC and in accordance with the provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 et seq. 2. After conducting an audit, if a hospital's eligibility changes or its initial DSH payment exceeded its audited DSH limit, the Division will recalculate the TN No.: 17-012 No.: 13-011 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 25 following for all hospitals in the affected pool: a. Audited uncompensated care costs b. Audited uncompensated care percentages c. Final DSH payment amounts using the same methodology as defined in Paragraph C. Final DSH payment amounts are calculated using the audited amounts in Subparagraphs D 2a and b. d. The amount of monies available for redistribution within each pool based on a c omparison of each hospital's final DSH payment amount and the initial DSH payment received by each hospital in the pool. 3. For all hospitals in the affected pool(s), the Division will reconcile each hospital's initial DSH payment to its final DSH payment as calculated in Paragraph D 2. Any hospital whose initial DSH payment is greater than the final DSH payment will return the difference to the Division, and any hospital whose initial DSH payment is less than the final DSH payment will be paid the difference. The final DSH payment amount for an individual hospital, as calculated in Paragraph D 2 and in accordance with the methodology in Paragraph C, will in no instance exceed that hospital's audited DSH limit. 4. If each hospital within a pool of hospitals has received the maximum amount of disproportionate share payments allowable by federal and state statutes and regulations, the Division will use the money returned to pay additional disproportionate share payments as follows in the method described in Paragraph C above: a. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of Pool A, to hospitals in Pool B; b. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of Pool B, to hospitals in Pool C; c. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of Pool C, to hospitals in Pool D; d. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of Pool D, to hospitals in Pool E; or e. If the money was returned by a hospital that is a member of Pool E, to hospitals in Pool A.

HOSPITALS OUT OF STATE Elective out-of- state admissions require prior authorization by Nevada Medicaid's Peer Review Organization, which must verify medical services required by Medicaid-eligible or pending- eligible clients are not available in Nevada. The out-of-state payment rate for inpatient care is based on one of the following criteria, whether emergency or elective in nature. A. For California hospitals, the following rates will be paid: 1. If the hospital has no signed contract with the State of California to provide Medi- Cal services, the California interim reimbursement Medi-Cal rate. 2. If the hospital has a signed contract with the State of California to provide Medi- Cal services, the Medi-Cal contract rate is paid. If the contract rate is not made available to Nevada Medicaid, the California interim Medi-Cal rate is paid. B. For Utah hospitals the payment rate is 45 % of billed charges. C. For all other states' hospitals, the payment rate will be either the Nevada Medicaid prospective rate or the Medicaid rate for the state in which the hospital is located, but not more than billed charges. To receive the Medicaid rate for the state in which the hospital is located, the hospital must attach documentation to the UB-92 Billing Claim, produced and generated by that state's Medicaid program, verifying the state's payment rate to that hospital. D. All other states' freestanding psychiatric/substance abuse hospitals are reimbursed 70% of billed charges. E. For Medicare crossover claims, the payment will be the lower of the Medicare deductible amount or the difference between the Medicare payment and the Nevada Medicaid prospective payment for that service. F. For services that cannot be provided by a provider that accepts payments under (A) through (E), the State will maintain a list of other qualified out-of-state providers and will negotiate competitive rates that will not exceed the provider's customary charge.

RATE ADJUSTMENTS Payment is made for services provided in inpatient hospital facilities in accordance with Section 1902(a)(13) of the Social Security Act as amended by Section 4711 of the Balanced Act of 1997. Prospective payment rates are based using the most current hospital costs reports (HCFA 2552) and cost reimbursement series (CRS) reports following the steps described in Section II - V above. Rates in effect on June 30, 1999 will be continued without adjustment except as may be directed by the Department of Human Resources. XII. MONITORING FUTURE RATES Nevada Medicaid monitors cost and utilization experience of all hospitals by evaluation of the cost reports filed each year. Payments are examined closely. Should modification of any elements or procedures such as creation or deletion of a rate or group appear necessary, this State Plan Attachment will be amended. XIII.

DIRECT GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PAYMENTS This section of the state plan contains the provisions for making additional Medicaid payments to recognize the additional direct costs incurred by hospitals with approved graduate medical education programs. Fee-for-Service (FFS) Direct Graduate Medical Education (GME) Payments A. Qualifying Hospitals: Non-state government owned hospitals that participate in the Medicaid program are eligible for additional reimbursement related to the provision of Direct GME activities. To qualify for these additional Medicaid payments, the hospital must report costs associated with residents, interns or fellows who participate in an approved medical residency program on their CMS Form 2552, Hospital Cost Report. If there is not a non-state government owned hospital located in a county, certain private hospitals may qualify for additional reimbursement related to the provision of Direct GME activities. To qualify for these additional Medicaid payments, the hospital must report costs associated with residents, interns or fellows who participate in an approved medical residency program on their CMS Form 2552, Hospital Cost Report. The private hospitals that qualify under this section are Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital located in Elko County and Renown Regional Medical Center in Washoe County. No payment under this section is dependent on any agreement or arrangement for providers or related entities to donate money or services to a governmental entity. B. FFS Direct GME Definitions: (i) Base Year Per Resident Amount - for hospitals receiving Medicaid GME supplemental payments prior to July 1, 2017, the base-year per resident amount is the Medicaid allowable inpatient direct GME cost as reported on CMS Form 2552 -96, Hospital Cost Report; Worksheet B, Part I, Line 22, Column 22 and Line 23, Column 23, divided by the un-weighted FTE residents from Worksheet S-3; Part I; Line 12 and Line 14, Column 7 of the Hospital Cost Report ending in June 30, 2008. For hospitals that begin receiving Medicaid GME supplemental payments on or after July 1, 2017, the base-year per resident amount is the Medicaid allowable inpatient direct GME cost as reported on CMS Form 2552-10, Hospital Cost Report; Worksheet B, Part I, Line 21, Column 21, and Line 22, Column 22, divided by the un-weighted FTE residents from Worksheet S-3; Part I; Line 27 of Column 9 of the Hospital Cost Report ending in June 30, 2015.

(ii) Current Number of FTE Residents - means the number of FTE interns, residents or fellows who participate in an approved medical residency program, including programs in osteopathy, dentistry and podiatry, as required in order to become certified by the appropriate specialty board reported on CMS Form 2552-10, Hospital Cost Report; Worksheet S-3: Part I; Line 27, Column 9. (iii) FFS Medicaid Patient Load - is the ratio of FFS Medicaid inpatient days to total hospital inpatient days. The FFS Medicaid patient load ratio is determined by the following: Medicaid inpatient days as reported on CMS Form 2552 -10, Hospital Cost Report; Worksheet S-3, Part I; Lines 16,17 7; divided by the hospital's total inpatient days, as reported on worksheet S -3; Part I; Lines 14, 16, 17 and 18; Column 8. (iv) The cost report data used to determine a hospita l's GME payment amount is subject to state review to ensure compliance with federal principles, including those at 42 CFR 412, 42 CFR 413, and Provider Reimbursement Manual Part I and Part II. C. Methodology for Determining FFS Direct GME Payments: The hospitals that qualify for FFS Medicaid GME payments will have their hospital specific payment amount determined as follows: (i) The base-year per resident amount is multiplied by the latest available market basket adjustment factor for each federal fiscal year used for Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems (IPPS) as published in the Federal Register. The market basket change reflects the Medicare payment increases before application of any Medicare adjustments. (ii) The results in (i) are multiplied by the current number of FTE residents; the current number of FTE residents and the FFS Medicaid patient load will be updated annually using data from the most recent Medicare Hospital Cost Report (CMS Form 2552-10) submitted to Medicare by each qualifying hospital; (iii) The results in (ii) are multiplied by the FFS Medicaid patient load which results in the total direct FFS GME payment for the hospitals; (iv) The annual FFS direct GME supplemental payment for each hospital will be included in the FFS UPL calculation for the annual time period.

FEDERAL UPPER PAYMENT LIMIT In order to preserve access to inpatient hospital services for needy individuals in the state of Nevada, the state's Medicaid hospital reimbursement system shall provide for supplemental payments to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals and private hospitals. Supplemental payments shall be made to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals effective for services provided on after January 1, 2002. Supplemental payments shall be made to private hospitals effective for services provided on or after January 2, 2010. These supplemental payments shall be determined on an annual basis and paid to qualifying hospitals on a quarterly basis. The supplemental payments to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals shall not exceed, when aggregated with other payments made to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals, 100% of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for such services under Medicare payment principles for non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals, except that payments for the period prior to May 14, 2002, such payments shall not exceed 150% of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for such services under Medicare payment principles for non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals. The supplemental payments to private hospitals shall not exceed, when aggregated with other payments made to private hospitals, 100% of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for such services under Medicare payment principles for private hospitals. The upper payment limit will be determined on an annual basis. In general, this approach identifies the upper limit through the application of Medicare's prospective payment system, which is a diagnosis related group (DRG) payment system. The upper limit computes, for each hospital, the Medicare DRG payment amount for each Medicaid discharge by determining a Medicare equivalent case mix index based on Medicaid discharges. This upper limit also uses a payment per discharge calculation of the amount of Medicare pass-through and add-on reimbursement including but not limited to outlier, direct graduate medical education, organ acquisition, routine and ancillary pass-through, IME, DSH, and capital payments. The Medicare pass-through and add-on reimbursement are identified from the Medicare cost report and adjusted for Medicaid where applicable. The hospital's Medicare payment per discharge, which includes the DRG and the pass-through/add on amounts, are applied to the number of Medicaid discharges. The latest available information is used for Medicare DRG, Medicare pass-through and add-on payments, Medicare discharges, and Medicaid discharges. Inflation factors are accordingly applied to determine an individual hospital's Medicare payment for the UPL period. The sum of each hospital's estimated Medicare payment for Medicaid discharges is the aggregate upper payment limit for the hospital class. TN No.: 10-002B Approval Date: November 7, 2, 2010 Supersedes TN No.: 05-002 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 32a SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR NON-STATE GOVERNMENTALLY OWNED OR OPERATED HOSPITALS The state will determine annually the payments to be made to non-state, governmentally owned or operated hospitals under this section of the plan using the following methodology: 1. Identify all non-state government owned (NSGO) or operated acute care hospitals. 2. For each facility identified in Step #1, compute total Medicaid Fee-for-Service inpatient hospital payments using latest available data projected to the current period. 3. For each facility, calculate the difference between payments identified in Step #2, and the hospital's Medicare UPL. This difference is the total maximum disbursement available under this section of the state plan. These calculations will be set on a prospective basis and will not be retroactively adjusted to previous fiscal years. A. Calculation of Supplemental Payment for NSGO Hospitals The state shall determine the maximum annual supplemental amount payable to hospitals prospectively for period that will begin each July 1. The state shall determine the amount of supplemental payments to each facility using the following criteria: a. Total supplemental payments under this section of the state plan will not exceed the difference between Medicaid payments and the Medicare UPL calculated in Step #3 above. b. Facilities participating in the supplemental payment program will be identified. c. Total supplemental payments will be apportioned to public hospitals participating in the supplemental payment program using each hospital's participation percentage. This percentage is calculated by dividing each supplemental payment hospital's Medicaid days by the total Medicaid days for all supplemental payment hospitals. d. Medicaid days for each supplemental payment hospital shall be identified using the most recent Medicare cost report data available at the time the calculation are prepared. e. Once these participation percentages are determined they will be final and not subject to recalculation, except when errors are found in the calculations. The state will not recalculate the percentages following receipt of more accurate data, such as a more current or audited Medicare cost report. B. Adjustment to Supplemental Payment for NSGO Hospitals to Preserve DSH 1. The total annual supplemental payment for each hospital will be the lesser of: a) The total supplemental payment as calculated above in Paragraph A; or TN No.17-012 Approval Date: Supersedes TN No. 10-002B STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: Nevada Attachment 4.19 -A Page 32a.i TN No. : 23-0003 Approval Date: June 22, 2023 Effective Date: January 20, 2023 Supersedes TN No. : 17-012 b) If the uncompensated care limit of DSH Distribution Pool D per the Medicaid State Plan Attachment 4.19 -A, Page 23 for the same time period beginning July 1 as above is less tha n the maximum amount of DSH payment available to the Distribution Pool, the supplemental payment as calculated in this section above for the individual hospitals in the DSH Distribution Pool will be reduced by the amount necessary to allow the Distribution Pool to receive the maximum DSH payment allowable. In no event will the adjustment for each individual hospital reduce the supplemental payment as calculated in Section A to less than $0. 2. For the purpose of the reduction discussed in Paragraph B.1.b above , the Supplemental Payment for NSGO Hospitals for all hospitals in each DSH Pool will be reduced by the lesser of: a) The amount of the smallest calculated annual Supplemental Payment for NSGO Hospitals in Paragraph A , if there are sufficient DSH funds in th e pool to distribute this DSH payment amount equally to all hospitals in the pool, or b) The remaining amount of DSH funds available in the pool which will be distributed by dividing a hospital's maximum allowed DSH payment by the total maximum allowed DSH pa yments for the hospitals in the distribution calculation. No hospital will receive a DSH payment greater than the hospital's uncompensated care limit. If a hospital in the pool is projected to have negative uncompensated care costs, as determined in Section VIII of this Attachment 4.19 -A, prior to the adjustment calculation described in Paragraph B.2, the hospital will be excluded from the adjustment ca lculation; the Supplemental Payment for NSGO Hospitals for such hospital will be that as calculated in Paragraph A. If a hospital in the pool has its annual Supplemental Payment for NSGO Hospitals reduced to $0, this hospital will be removed from further r epetitions of Paragraph B.2. The process in Paragraph B.2 .a - b will be repeated until all DSH funds allocated to the DSH Distribution Pool have been distributed or the annual Supplemental Payment for NSGO Hospitals for all hospitals in the DSH Pool have been reduced to $0. C. Payment of the Supplemental Payment for NSGO Hospitals On a quarterly basis, hospitals will receive a supplemental payment equal to 25% of the annually determined supplemental amount. A quarterly payment will be made in each calendar quarter during the state's fiscal year.

These supplemental payments shall be determined on an annual basis and paid to qualifying private and public inpatient hospitals on a quarterly basis. The payments will be based on inpatient hospital Medicaid Fee -for-Service utilization. No payment under this se ction is dependent on any agreement or arrangement for providers or related entities to donate money or services to a governmental entity. A. Amount for Distribution 1. For the period July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 the total computable payment will be $ 78,105, 149.82 . 2. The aggregated amount of supplemental payments to inpatient hospitals shall not exceed the Upper Payment Limit (UPL) for each one of the respective periods. The supplemental payment for the period of July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 will be accounted for in the UPL room available for July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023. B. Eligibility 1. Nevada Acute Care Inpatient Hospitals (PT 11), that are not designated as Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) (PT 75), Psychiatric Inpatient Hospitals (PT 13), Rehabilitation, Specialty or Long -Term Acute Care (LTAC) (PT 56), will be deemed to qualify. 2. Nevada Acute Care Inpatient Hospitals (PT 11) certified as Trauma I, Trauma II and Trauma III levels will additionally qualify for the distribution of the Trauma case portion of the allotment. STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 32c C. Methodology 1. Data Source a. Days count, by date of service, obtained from the Nevada Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) for the Med/Surg/ICU, Maternity, NICU and Psych/Detox revenue codes. b. Data used is from the calendar year two years prior. i. For example, the calculation for payment in State Fiscal Year 2014 would be computed in calendar year 2013 using data from calendar year 2011. c. Case Mix Index (CMI) is calculated using the same claims data described above, in (a) and (b) by Contractor University of Nevada Las Vegas, Center for Health Information Analysis (CHIA). d. Trauma cases are determined using the same claims data described above, in (a) and (b) by counting the number of patient discharges which have a trauma revenue code. 2. Calculation - The calculation will be computed annually, based on the total allocation amount specified above in A.1 with quarterly payments to be made during calendar year quarters as described in D.1 using the following methodology: a. Identify all eligible hospitals as described above in (A). b. Determine which hospitals are trauma certified (Levels 1, 2 and 3). c. Determine the total allocation. d. Determine the total count of trauma cases for any trauma certified hospital. e. Calculate 3% of the total allocation to determine the trauma portion of the allocation. f. Level I and Level II trauma cases will be given a weight of 100% of the amount to be paid for each trauma case; Level III trauma cases will be given a weight of 50%. g. Divide the number of Level I plus Level II plus half the number of Level III trauma cases into the product of 2 (e) above to determine the amount to be paid for each 100% weighted trauma case. TN No.: 13-032 Approval Date: August 2014 Effective Date: January 1, 2014 Supersedes TN No.: NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State Nevada Attachment 4.19-A Page 32d a. To calculate the 50% weighted trauma case amount, divide the 100% weighted trauma case by 2. b. Multiply the number of trauma cases of hospitals certified as trauma Level I and Level II by the 100% weighted amount determined in (g), to calculate the payment for each hospital in this category. c. Multiply the number of trauma cases of hospitals certified as trauma Level III by the amount determined in (h), to calculate the payment for each hospital in this category. d. Subtract the trauma portion of the allocation from the total allocation to determine the amount remaining for distribution to eligible hospitals as identified in Step 2 (a). e. Multiply the number of each hospital's Medicaid Fee -for-Service days, by their Medicaid CMI to determine the number of adjusted days per hospital. f. Divide the remaining allocation (the amount in Step (c) reduced by the amount in Step (e)) by the total adjusted days to determine the per day rate. g. Multiply the per day rate times the individual hospital adjusted days to determine each hospital payment. h. Add hospital day rate payment amount to the trauma payment, if any, to determine the total payment to each hospital. B. Payment 1. Payment issued to hospitals participating in the supplemental payment will be deducted and tracked to ensure that total Medicaid payments do not exceed the aggregate amount of (UPL) calculated for the corresponding period. (see A.2 above). 2. One fourth of the total annual allocation (not to exceed the aggregate amount of UPL for the corresponding period) will be paid out quarterly to each eligible hospital, in supplemental payments, in the last month of the quarter for which the payment is calculated (Effective July 1, 2015: e.g. the supplemental payment for SFY 2016 Quarter 1 will be issued in September 2015). 3. Each hospital will be issued the supplemental payment by EFT as a financial transaction through the MMIS.

SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR PRIVATE HOSPITALS In order to preserve access to inpatient hospital services for needy individuals in the state of Nevada, effective for services provided on or after January 2, 2010, the state's Medicaid hospital reimbursement system shall provide for supplemental payments to private hospitals affiliated with a state or unit of local government in Nevada through a Low Income and Needy Care Collaboration Agreement (Affiliated Private Hospitals). A Low Income and Needy Care Collaboration Agreement is defined as an agreement between a hospital and a state or unit of local government to collaborate for purposes of providing healthcare services to low income and needy patients. These supplemental payments shall be determined on an annual basis and paid to qualifying hospitals on a quarterly basis. The supplemental payments are payments for Medicaid F ee-for-Service inpatient hospital service. The supplemental payments shall not exceed, when aggregated with other payments made to private hospitals, 100% of a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for such services under Medicare payment principles for private hospitals. The state will determine the payments to be made under this section of the plan using the following methodology: 1. Identify all Nevada private hospitals. Non-state government owned or operated acute care hospitals and state owned hospitals do not qualify under this methodology. 2. For those facilities identified in Step #1, compute the Medicare UPL according to the methodology set out on Page 32 above. 3. The amount computed in Step #2, less the Medicaid F ee-for-Service inpatient hospital payments to those facilities identified in Step #1, is the total maximum disbursement available under this section of the state plan in each fiscal year. If the payments under this section of the plan exceed this total maximum disbursement, the state will calculate the percentage by which the Medicare UPL is exceeded and reduce payments to all hospitals under this section of the state plan by the same percentage. The Medicaid director shall then determine the amount of supplemental payments to each facility using the following criteria. 1. Total supplemental payments under this section of the state plan will not exceed the difference between Medicaid payments and the Medicare UPL calculated in Step #3 above. 2. Facilities participating in the supplemental payment program will be identified. All Affiliated Private Hospitals are eligible to participate in the supplemental payment program.

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (PA) Prior Authorizations (PAs) will be screened for PPC codes and reviewed by the fiscal agent's medical review staff, which will make determinations for denials of payment for continued stay requests and/or level of care increases if the request appears to be related to a PPC. Payment denial does not consider medical necessity. Providers can appeal a PPC denial utilizing the existing appeals process. RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW Prior Authorization A provider who caused a PPC may be discovered in the process of reviewing a PA request from a second provider from whom the patient seeks treatment. If it is determined in the PA screening that a provider other than the provider requesting the PA may be responsible for causing a PPC, a retrospective review of claims of the provider possibly causing the PPC will be done. Payments associated with treating the PPC will be recovered, from the original provider, if those increases in payments can be reasonably isolated to the PPC event. Claims Review Under NRS 449.485 and R151-8 the Nevada Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) and University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA ) collects and maintains billing record fields for Nevada hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. This data set captures the Present on Admission (POA) indicator for the UB-04 claims for principal and each secondary (other) diagnosis field. Claims data with dates of service on or after July 1, 2012 will be reviewed and those fitting the criteria for PPCs will be identified. Providers will be supplied information identifying claims with the potential PPCs and will be given 30 days to review and respond to any discrepancies. Provider-confirmed PPCs will be subject to payment adjustment. Payment Adjustment For per diem payments, the number of covered days shall be reduced by the number of days associated with any PPC not present on admission. Nevada will use nationally accepted standards to determine the number of days attributable to the diagnosis absent the PPC and the incremental number of days attributable to the PPC. Reimbursement may also be reduced for level of care changes attributable to a PPC.

STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State of Nevada Attachment 4.19 -B Page 1 (Continued) c. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC) Nevada Medicaid uses a Prospective Payment System (PPS) for FQHCs/RHCs as required by S.S.A. \u00a71902 for FQHCs/RHCs was implemented and took effect on January 1, 2001. Prospective Payment System (PPS) Reimbursement for Existing Facilities On January 1, 2001, the State began paying FQHCs/RHCs (including \"FQHC look alike clinics\") based on a PPS rate methodology, per CMS requirements. The ba seline for a PPS was set at 100% of the average of an FQHC/RHC per visit rate based on the reported reasonable and allowable costs of providing Medicaid -covered services during the FQHC/RHC fiscal years 1999 and 2000, adjusted to take into account any reported increase (or decrease) in the scope of servic es furnished during FY 2001 by the FQHC/RHC (calculating the payment amount on a per visit basis). Medicaid -covered services that are considered to be FQHC/RHC services are those services that were identified and approved to be provided by the facility as it applies to HRSA in order to be deemed as an FQHC/RHC faci lity. Beginning in Federal fiscal year 2002, and for each fiscal year thereafter, each FQHC/RHC is entitled to the payment amount (on a per visit basis) to which the center or clinic was entitled under the Act in the previous year, increased each October 1st (FFY) by the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) for primary care services as defined in Section 1842 (i)(3) of the Social Security Act, which is int ended to account for the basic cost increases associated with provid ing such services. After February 6, 2016, the DHCFP will allow reimbursement for up to three encounters/visits per person per day provided that the FQHC has separate PPS rates for each r eimbursable service type; medical, mental behavioral health and dent al. FQHCs that only provide two of the specified service types will be allowed reimbursement for up to two encounters/visits per patient per day. For FQHCs that only have one PPS rate will be allowed reimbursement for only one encounter/visit per patient p er day. For FQHCs that do not have separate Service Specific Prospective Payment Systems (SSPPS) rates already established, they may opt to change to an Alternative Payment Methodology (AP M) wherein their costs/visits will be reviewed after a full year of providing and receiving reimbursement for up to three (or two) visits/encounters per patient per day, resulting in separate Service Specific Alternative Payment Methodology (SSAPM) rates b eing established. FQHCs may choose to retain their current SSPPS ra tes and not bill up to three encounters/visits per patient per day, which will not result in a change to an SSAPM and a current review of their costs and visits. PPS rates will not be subject to rebasing after their initial computation unless authorized b y Congress. Only the actual costs related to any reported change in scope of services will be calculated (based on a full year of providing those services) and an adjustment or add -on to the baseline PPS rate will be made. Any other changes to the PPS rate (s) will be considered an APM and will be outline d below in this State plan. TN No.: 16-003 Approval Date: December 13, 6, 2016 Supersedes TN No.: 13-017 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State of Nevada Attachment 4.19 -B Page 1 (Continued p. 1) Prospective Payment System (PPS) -Service Specific Reimbursement f or New Facilities Newly qualified FQHCs/RHCs after Federal fiscal year 2012 will have initial payments (interim Service Specific PPS (SSPPS) rates) established either by reference to payments to one or more other clinics in the same or adjacent areas with similar caseloads and/or similar s cope of services or based on an average of rates for other FQHC/RHC clinics throughout the State. Once their average per visit reasonable costs of providing Medicaid -covered services based on their first full year of ope ration can be determined, the initi al interim SSPPS payments of the FQHC/RHC will be cost settled and any over or under payments will be reconciled and the SSPPS rate will then be established based on the actual cost to provide those services for their fir st full year. The per visit SSPPS rate(s) will then be adjusted annually every October 1st beginning at the next federal fiscal year by the percentage change in the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) for primary care services as defined in Section 1842 (i)(3) o f the Social Security Act, for that calendar year as published in the Federal Register. The MEI adjustment is the mechanism used to account for the basic cost increases associated with providing such services. All required documentation of actual costs for the first full year of providing services must be furnished to the DHCFP no later than six months after completion of the first full year of services. If the required documentation is not received within six months after the completion of a full year of s ervices, the annual MEI adjustments will be suspended until such time as the documentation is received and an actual SSPPS rate is determined. PPS/SSPPS rates will not be subject to rebasing after their initial computation unless authorized by Congress. O nly the actual costs related to any reported change in scope of services will be calculated (based on a full year of providing those services) and an adjustment or add -on to the baseline PPS/SSPPS rate will be made. Any other changes to the PPS/SSPPS rate( s) will be considered an Alternativ e Payment Methodology (APM) and will be outlined below in this State Plan. Alternative Payment Methodology (APM) Reimbursement For any fiscal year after FY 2002, a State may use an APM methodology other than the Medicai d PPS, but only if the following st atutory requirements are met. First, the APM must be agreed to by the State and by each individual FQHC/RHC to which the State wishes to apply the methodology. Second, the methodology must result in a payment to the cente r or clinic that is a least equal t o the amount to which the center or clinic is entitled under the Medicaid PPS. Third, the methodology must be described in the approved State plan. Service Specific APM (SSAPM) rates are based on the specific service typ e being provi ded. SSAPM rates are s et at 100% of the average of an FQHC/RHC per visit rate based on the reported reasonable and allowable costs of providing Medicaid -covered services during the time period under review (calculating the payment amount on a per visit basis per service type). For FQHCs that have separate service specific APM rates established, the DHCFP will allow reimbursement for up to three (or two) SSAPM encounters/visits per patient per day for the different service types: one medical, on e behavioral health and one dental. Effective October 1st (FFY) of each year after an SSAPM rate has been established, for services TN No.: 16-003 Approval Date: December 13, 2016 Effective Date: February 6, 2016 Supersedes TN No. 13-017 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State of Nevada Attachment 4.19 -B Page 1 (Continued p. 2) furnishe d on or after that date, the DHCFP wi ll adjust the SSAPM rate by the percentage increase in the MEI applicable to primary care services as published in the Federal Register for that calendar year, which will account for basic cost increases associated with providing such services. APM to Ref lect Other Payment Adjustments FQHC/RHC's may request an APM to reflect other payment adjustments in the event of extraordinary circumstances, not otherwise reimbursed by other sources, including but not limited to acts of God; acts of nature; acts of ter rorism and acts of war. However, if an FQHC/RHC's existing PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM rate is sufficient to cover its overall costs, including those associated with the extraordinary circumstances, other payment adjustment is not warranted. The FQHC/RHC must show tha t its PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM rate is not sufficient to cover the costs associated with the extraordinary circumstance. The adjusted rate will only apply to the extent, and only for the period of time, that the additional costs for the event are reimbursable under federal Medicaid law and regulations governing claims for federal financial participation (FMAP). The DHCFP will work with the provider to gather the appropriate data at the time the incident occurs and a written reque st for a rate adjustment is made by t he Provider. Change in Scope of Services PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM rates may be adjusted to take into account any requested, documented and approved increase (or decrease) in the scope of services furnished by the FQHC/RHC in a ny given fiscal year. The FQHC/RHC mu st submit a written request detailing the change in scope of services to the Division within 60 days of the effective date of those changes in order for the rate adjustment to be retroactive to the date of the Change in Scope of Services. If a written requ est is not received within 60 days of those changes, the effective date for a rate adjustment will be the date the written request for a Change in Scope of Services was received by the DHCFP. Documentation and notificat ion to support an increase or decreas e in the scope of services is the responsibility of the provider and must specify all the changes up for review. An FQHC/RHC requesting a rate adjustment for changes in scope of services must submit data/documentation/ schedules that substantiate the changes in scope and the related adjustment of reasonable costs following Medicare principals of reimbursement. An interim rate will be determined using the first three months of actual cost data available from the provider . After a full year of providing the services related to the change in scope, an analysis will be performed on the actual costs for a full year of service and an adjustment will be made to the PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM. Adjustments to the PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM rate for qu alified/approve d changes in scope will be based on Medicare Cost Reimbursement methodology, allocating costs related to patient care based upon a providers audited and approved costs for the change in scope services. The PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM rate adjustment wil l then be deter mined by dividing the approved allocated costs by the number of approved total visits for the given time period. TN No.: 16-003 Approval Date: December 13, 6, 2016 Supersedes TN No.: 13-017 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State of Nevada Attachment 4.19 -B Page 1 (Continued p. 3) A Change in S cope of Services has been defined as a change in the type, intensity, duration and/or amount of any service that meets the definition of FQH C/RHC services as defined in Section 1905 (a)(2)(B) and (C) of the Social Security Act; and the service is included as a covered Medicaid service under the Medicaid state plan. General increases or decreases in costs associated with programs that were already a part of an established PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM rate do NOT constitute a Change in Scope. A Change in Scope must meet a ll of the following requirements: The change in the scope of services is a change in the type, intensity, duration, or amount of services, or any combination thereof as defined in Section 1905 (a)(2)(B) and (C) of the Social Security Act. The cost is all owable under Medicare reasonable co st principals set forth in 45 CFR Part 75 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for HHS Awards and /or 42CFR Part 413 Principles of Reasonable Cost Reimbursement. The net change in t he FQHC/RHC's per visit PPS/SSPPS/A PM rate must equal or exceed 4% for the affected FQHC/RHC site(s). For FQHC/RHC's that filed consolidated cost reports for multiple sites to establish the initial Prospective Payment reimbursement rate (PPS), the 4% thres hold will be applied to the average per visit rate (medical, dental and mental health) of all sites that provide the specific service for the purposes of calculating the cost associated with a scope of service change. \"Net change\" means the per visit rate change attributable to the cumulati ve effect of all increases and decreases for a particular fiscal year for the specific service type. A Change in Scope of Services includes any of the following: A change in the types of services offered, i.e., the addi tion of dental services, may qualif y as a Change in Scope which may warrant an adjustment to the PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM rate or the establishment of a new PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM rate. A change in intensity/duration or character of services offered by an FQHC/RHC attrib utable to changes in the types of p atients served may qualify, such as services to patients with HIV/AIDS or other chronic diseases and other special populations requiring more intensive and frequent care. A change in the magnitude, intensity or character of currently offered services, dem onstrated and documented by an increase or decrease in the patient volume of certain high risk populations that require more intensive and frequent care, which may reasonably be expected to span at least one year may qual ify. A change in the type, intensity, duration or amount of service caused by changes in technology and medical practice used may qualify.

Rate appeal procedures are defined in the Medicaid Service Manual (MSM) Chapter 700. Definition of a \"Visit\"/ \"Encounter\" A \"visit\" or an \"e ncounter\" for the purposes of reimbursing FQHC/RHC services is defined as face - to-face contact with one or more qualified health professionals and multiple contacts with the same health professional that take place on the same day with the same patient for the same service type. Qualified Health Professional To be eligible for PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM reimbursement, services must be delive red exclusively by one or more of the following licensed Qualified Health Professionals or a provider working under his or her direct supervision: Physician, Osteopath, Podiatrist, Physician's Assistant, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse, Certified Nurse Midwife, Clinical Psychologist, Clinical Social Worker, Dentist or Dental Hygienist and other Medicaid Qualified Providers.

The DHCFP , its fiscal agent or a designated and contracted financial entity may conduct periodic on-site or desk audits of all co st data, including financial and statistical records of the FQHCs/RHCs. TN No.: 16-003 Approval Date: December 6, 2016 Supersedes TN No.: 13-017 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State of Nevada Attachment 4.19 -B Page 1 (Continued p. 5) FQHCs/RHCs must submit information (statistics, costs and financial data or other data) as deemed necessary by the DHCFP or its fiscal agent. Failure to submit requested documentation may result in denial of a rate adjustment request. The DHCFP will conduct one audit annually (at a minimum) to the claims submitted by the FQHC/RHC for supplemental payments. Supplemental Payments for FQHCs/RHCs Enrolled with a Managed Care Entity (MCE) FQHCs/RHCs that prov ide services under a contract with a Medicaid Managed Care Entity (MCE) will receive quarterly or monthly (as agreed upon between the provider and the state) supplemental payments for furnishing such services, that are a calculation of the difference betwe en the payments the FQHC/RHC receives from the MCE(s) for all qualified Medicaid FQHC/RHC visits and the payments the FQHC/RHC would have received under the PPS/SSPPS or SSAPM methodology. At the end of each payment peri od, the total amount of MCE payment s received by the FQHC/RHC will be reviewed against the amount that the actual number of visits provided under the FQHC's/RHC's contract with MCE(s) would have yielded under the PPS/SSPPS/SSAPM methodology. If the amount exceeds the total amount of MCE pay ments, the FQHC/RHC will be paid the difference, if the amount is less, the FQHC/RHC will refund the difference to the DHCFP. The FQHC/RHCs must provide sufficient documentation (as requested) to the DHCFP to facilitate s upplemental payment calculations. I f the required documentation is not provided to support the supplemental payment, future supplemental payments may be suspended. Documentation Required to Calculate/Support Supplemental Payments The FQHC/RHC will submit an electronic request for suppleme ntal payment which will contain at least the following information for each line item of every qualified encounter during the reporting time period (Quarterly or Monthly): Medicaid Billing Provider ID#, Recipient MC E ID Number, Recipient Medicaid ID Number , Date of Service, Procedure Code(s), MCE Name, Total Billed Amount, MCE Paid Amount, Other Paid Amount, Total Amount Paid and Recipient Date of Birth. The FQHC/RHC will submit claim data for supplemental payment n o later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period agreed upon with the DHCFP (Quarterly or Monthly).

To determine the Medicaid -allowable direct and indirect costs of providing covered services to M edicaid - eligible clients, the following steps are performed: TN No.: 07-009 Approval Date: October 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No.: 08-017 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.19 -B Page 3d A. Facilities that are primarily providing medical Services: (a) Direct costs for covered services inclu de unallocated payroll costs and other unallocated costs that can be directly charged to covered medical services. Direct payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. Other dire ct co sts include costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as supervision, materials and supplies, professional and contracted services, capital outlay, and travel. These costs must be in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional re imbur sement policy and are accumulated on the annual cost report, resulting in total direct costs. (b) Total direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy and are further re duced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted dir ect costs for covered services. (c) Indirect costs are determined by applying the agency specific approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs. If the provider has no approved indi rect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These allocated indirect costs are reduced by any unallowable amount based on Medicaid non -institutional reimburse ment policy. The indirect costs details are accumulated on the annual cost report. (d) Net direct costs (Item b) and indirec t costs (Item c) are combined. (e) A CMS approved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providi ng th e Medical services described in the applicable Section 3.1 -A State Plan pages and is used to determine the percentage of time that medical service personnel spend on direct medical services, general and administrative time, and all other activities to account for 100% of the time to assure that there is no duplicate claiming. This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct medical services time study percentage is applied again st the net direct and indirect costs. (f) Medicaid's portion of total allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from Item (e) above to the ratio of the total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service pr ovide d. (g) Total Medicaid allowable costs (Item f) is reduced by any revenue, e.g. Medicaid co - payments, TPL, received for the same services to arrive at the total Medicaid net allocable and allowable costs. TN No.: 07-009 Approval Date: October 2008 Effective Date: November 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No.: NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.19 -B Page 3e B. Facilities that are used for multiple purposes and the provision of medical services are not the primary purpose: (a) Direct costs include unallocated payroll costs and medical equipment and supplies. Unallocated payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of d irect care staff. These costs are accumulated on the annual cost report. (b) The Direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in complianc e with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payment s for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs. (c) Indirect costs are determined by applying the agency specific approved indirect cost rate to its ne t direct costs (Item b.). If the entity has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect co sts can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These indirect costs are reduced by any unallowable am ount. For these facilities, allowable costs are only those cost that are \"directly attributable\" to t he professional component of providing the medical services and are in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy. For those costs inc urred that \"benefit\" multiple purposes but would be incurred at the same level if the medical service s did not occur are not allowed, e.g. room and board, allocated cost from other related organizations. The indirect cost details are accumulated on the ann ual cost report. (d) Net direct costs (Item (b)) and indirect costs (Item (c)) are combined. (e) A CMS appr oved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the Medical services described in the a pplicable S ection 3. 1-A State Plan pages and is used to determine the percentage of time that medical service personnel spend on direct medical services, general and administrative time, and all othe r activities to account for 100% of the time to assure that there is no dupli cate claiming. This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activ ities and direct services. The direct medical services time study percentage is applied against the net direct and indirect costs. (f) Medicaid's portion of t he total net allocable and allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from Item (e) above to the ratio of total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. (g) Total Medicaid allowable costs (Ite m f) is reduced by any revenue received for the same services, e.g. Medicaid co -payments and TPL, to arrive at the total Medicaid net (h) allocable and allowable costs.

Cost Reconciliation Process Governmental providers will be responsible for reconciling total allowable computable costs reported on the cost report to the provider's Medicaid interim payments for Medi caid services delivered during the reporting per iod as document in the MMIS, resulting in cost reconciliation. The cost reconciliation process must be completed within 24-months of the end of the reporting period covered by the annual Cost Report. 4. Cost Se ttlement Process If a governmental provider's i nterim payments exceed the actual, certified costs of the provider for services to Medicaid clients, the DHCFP will recoup the federal share of the overpayment using one of the following two methods: 1. Off-set all future claims payments from the provider un til the amount of the federal share of the overpayment is recovered; 2. The provider will return an amount equal to the overpayment. If the actual, certified costs exceed the interim Medicaid payments, the DHCFP will pay the federal share of the difference t o the provider in accordance with the final actual certification agreement. The DHCFP will issue a notice of settlement that denotes the amount due to or from the provider.

Definitions: 1. \"Emergency Medical Transportation\" is synonymous with \"Emergency Medical Response.\" It includes both the act of transporting an individual from any point of origin to the nearest med ical facility capable of meeting the emergency medical needs of the patient, as well as the advanced, limited -advanced and basic life support servi ces provided to an individual by emergency medical transportation providers before or during the act of trans portation. 2. \"Emergency Medical Response\" is a cost objective that includes expenditures for medical services performed at the point of injury or il lness, typically outside of a medical facility, to evaluate or treat a health condition. An emergency medical response is classified as \"medical\" by dispatch if the primary reason for the response is to provide medical services. 3. \"Direct costs\" means all costs that can be identified specifically with particular final cost objectives in order to meet all medical t ransportation mandates. 4. \"Shared Direct Costs\" are direct costs that can be allocated to two or more departmental functions or cost objectives on the basis of shared benefits. 5. \"Indirect costs\" means costs for a common or joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective that are allocated to each benefitting objectives using an agency approved indirect rate or an allocation methodology. In direct costs rate or allocation methodology must comply with 2 CFR, Part 200 and CMS non - institutional reimburseme nt policies. 6. \"Service Period\" means the period from July 1st through June 30th of each Nevada state fiscal year. B. Provider Eligibility for Medicaid Reimbursement Based on Cost Identification. To be eligible to receive reimbursement based on cost identifi cation for emergency medical transportation, a provider must meet all of the requirements described below: 1. The provider is owned or operated by an eligible government entity to include the state, a city, a county, a consolidated city and county, a fire protection district organized pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 474 or a federally recognized Indian tribe. 2. The provider is enrolled as a Nevada Medicaid provider for the period being claimed. 3. The provider delivers emergency medical transportatio n services to Nevada Medicaid beneficiaries. STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TN No.: 15-008 Approval Date: January Supersedes TN No.: 13-009 State NEVADA Attachment 4.19 - B Page 4.2 4. The provider has a Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) approved by the State Medicaid Agency on file with the State. C. Interi m Medicaid Payment 1. \"Base Payment\" is the interim reimbursement paid for each transport as a result of Medicaid claiming by the provider throughout the year. The base payment in the period October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2017 is determined by the Nev ada Medicaid Fee-for-Service ambulance fee schedule. For periods beginning October 1, 2017, the base payment is the average cost per transport as determined in the most recent available cost report. The average cost per transport is determined by dividing the total allowable costs of providing emergency medical transportation services by the total number of emergency medical transports. D. Methodology for Reimbursement of Emergency Medical Transportation Services Based on Cost Identification. 1. A provider's sp ecific allowable cost per -medical transport rate will be calculated based on the provider's audited financial data reported on the CMS -approved cost re port. The per -medical transport cost rate will be the sum of actual allowable direct and indirect costs o f providing medical transport services divided by the actual number of medical transportation services provided for the applicable service period. a. Direct costs for providing medical transport services include only the unallocated payroll costs for those e mergency response staff who dedicate 100% of their time to providing medical transport services; medical equipment and supplies, and other costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as first -line supervision, materials and supplies, p rofessional and contracted services, capital outlay, travel and training. These costs must be in compliance with Medicaid non- institutional reimbursement policies and are directly attributable to the provision of the medical transport services. b. Shared dir ect costs for emergency medical transportation services as defined by Section A.1, must be allocated for personnel, capital outlay and other costs; such as, medical supplies, professional and contracted services, training and travel. The personnel costs wi ll be allocated based on the percentage of total hours logged performing emergency medical transportation activities versus other activities. The capital and other direct costs will be allocated based on the percentage of total call volume. c. Indirect cost s are determined based on the provider's approved cost allocation plan.

The provider specific per -medical transport cost rate is calculated by dividing the tota l net medical transport allowable costs (Item 1.a, Item 1.b and Item 1.c) of the specific provider by the total number of medical transports provided by the provider for the applicable service period. 2. Medicaid's portion of the total allowable cost for providing emergency medical transportation services by each eligible provider is calculated by multiplying the total number of Medicaid FFS transports provided by the provider's specific per-medical transport cost rate (Paragraph D.1.d) for the applicable service period. E. Eligible Provider Reporting Requirements: Eligible provider shall: 1. Report and certify total computable allowable costs annually on a CMS - approved Nevada Medicaid Emergency Transportation Services Cost Report, which is to be submitted annually by December 1 to the State Medicaid Agency. The Cost Report includes a certification of expenditures statement that states the total costs reported are accurately reported and allowable. 2. Provide documentation to serve as evidence supporting the informati on on the cost report and the cost determination as specified by the State Medicaid Agency. 3. Keep, maintain and have readily retrievable, such records as specified by the State Medicaid Agency. 4. The provider will comply with the allowable cost requirements provided in 42 CFR, Part 413, 2 CFR, Part 200 and Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policies. F. State Medicaid Agency's Responsibilities: 1. The State will submit to CMS claims based on total computable certified expenditures for emergency transportat ion services provided that are allowable and in compliance with federal laws and regulations and Medicaid non-institutional reimbursement policies. 2. As part of its financial oversight responsibilities, t he State will review each provider's Cost Report for reasonableness and accuracy and reconcile the Cost Report to t h e provider claims data obtained from the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). The state will complete the cost report review and settlement process of the interim payments for the se rvice STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TN No.: 15-008 Approval Date: January 11 , October 1, 2015 Supersedes TN No.: 13-009 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State NEVADA Attachment 4.19-B Page 4.4 period within three years of the postmark date of the cost report. 3. I f the interim Medicaid payments exceed the actual certified costs of a provider, t he Stat e will recoup any overpayments and return the Federal share to the Federa l govern ment in accordance with 42 CFR 433.316. If the actual certified costs exceed t he int erim Medicaid payments, the DHCFP will pay the federal share of the diffe rence to the provider in accordance with the final actual certification agreement . III. Non-emergency transportati on: A. Other than Non-Emergency Secure Behavioral Health Transports, Non-emergen cy tran sportation is authorized through a contracted NET Broker, as specified in Attachment 3.1 - D. B. Effective for services provided on or af ter February 1, 2021, Non-Emergency Se cure B ehavioral Health Transports will be reimbu rsed for the following codes from Provider Typ e 32, Specialty 932 A mbulance, Air or Ground Fee Schedule as published at http://dhcfp.nv.gov/Resources/Rates/FeeSchedules/ on February 1, 2021: 1.

Reimbursement Methodology for Non-Emergency Paratransit services provided by th e Regi onal Transportation Commission (RTC) operated by local government entitie s: 1. The lower of: A) billed charges; or b) a cost based rate . The cos t based rate is calculated annually using each public provider's annual operating budget and service utilization forecast and an applicable 10% indirect cost rate. Each publ ic provider will submit an annual operating budget and service utilization forecas t at least 60 days before the start of the next fiscal year. The budget forecast must refl ect a proj ection for allowable, necessary and proper direct cost in providing services. The cost based rate is calculated as follow s: a. Direc t costs include the costs for fuel , tires and subcontracted costs that are dire ctly related in providing the non-emergency transportation services . These cost s must be in compliance with the Medicare reimbursement principle an d O MB A- 87. b. The to tal direct costs (from Item A) are reduced by any federal grant f unds rece ived for the same services to arrive at the net allowable direct cost s. c. I ndirect costs are determined by applying a ten percent indirect cost rate to th e net a llowable direct costs (from Item B) . Contin ued on Page 4 (Addendum) STATE UNDER TITLE XIX THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.19 -B Page 4 (Addendum) 1. Net allowable costs are the sum of the net allowable direct costs (Item 2) and indirect costs (Item 3). 2. The cost -based rate is the net allowable costs (from Item 4) divided by the total forecasted transpor tation service utilization. 15. a. Services of Religious non -medical Healthcare Institution nurses: NOT PROVIDED. b. Services in Religious non -medical Healthcare Institutions sanitoria: NOT PROVIDED. c. Hospice Services: Reimbursed at the established annual Medicaid rate regardless of billed charges.

Emergency hospital services out -of-state: lower of: a) billed charges, or b) local Medicaid maximums. The agency's rates were set as of July 1, 20 05 and are effective for services on or after that date. 17. Personal care services in recipients' home and setting outside the home: fixed hourly rate established by the State of Nevada legislative body. For pers onal care services performed on or after Jan uary 1, 2020, fixed hourly rate will be determined by multiplying a factor of 1.033 (equal to 3.3%) times the July 1, 2009 rate. The Agency's rates for personal care services will be updated on January 1, 2020 to reflect the rate increase, as specified a bove. All rates are published on the Agency's website at /. 18.

Administrative overhead, 10%, is the percentage of serv ice cost that should result fr om non -direct care activities. It includes insurance, administrative staff, operations and management activities and office supplies. Capital and related expenses is not included. It als o does not include staff training. IV. The following steps are used to determine the fixed quarter hour rate: 1. The State will use Nevada -specific hourly wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2. This hourly compensation is increased by the 27% ERE. 3. A productivity factor is applied to the hourly co mpensation calculated in Item 2 to equal the adjusted hourly rate. 4. Allowance for supervisory time is determined. 5. Administrative overhead (10%) is applied to the sum of adjusted hourly rate (Item 3) and the all owance for supervisory (Item 4). 6. Allowance for mileage cost is determined. 7. Allowance for capital costs is determined. 8. Fixed hourly rate is the sum of adjusted hourly rate (Item 3), allowance for supervisory time (Item 4), administrative overhead (Item 5), allowance for mileage (Item 6), and allowance f or capital costs (Item 7). 9. Quarter hour rate is the fixed hourly rate (Item 8) divided by 4. This rate has been compared to other private sector fee -for-service rates. Documentation of the assumptions used, rate development methodology, and fee schedule payment rates will be maintained by the DHCFP . The Agency's rates were set as of January 1, 2006 and are effective for services on or after January 1, 2006. All rates are published on the Agency's website at www.dhcf p.nv.gov B. Reimbursement Methodology for Targeted Case Management Services provided by a state or local government entity: Targeted Case Management services provided by a state or local government entity are reimbursed according to one of the following t wo payment methodologies. The second methodology must be used by providers who undergo all Medicaid cost identification, reporting, reconciliation and settlement procedures. I. The lower of: a) billed charges; or b) a cost based rate. The cost -based rate is an annual rate developed base d on historic costs. Cost based rates will be calculated annually and are determined by dividing estimated reimbursabl e costs of providing Medicaid -covered services by the projected total direct medical service utilization f or the upcoming fiscal period. STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TN No.: 08-006 Approval Date: March 17, 2009 Effective Date: November 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No.: NEW State : NEVADA Attachment 4.19 -B Page 4 (Continued p. 2) Each public provider will submit an annual operating budget and service utilization forecast at least 60 days be fore the start of the next fiscal year. The budget forecast must reflect a projection for allowable, necessary and proper expenses in provi ding Medicaid -covered services. Allowable costs are those direct and indirect costs deemed allowable by CMS which are incurred and are proper and necessary to efficiently deliver needed services. Direct costs include unallocated pay roll costs and other unallocated costs that can be directly charged to covered medical services. Direct payroll costs include total compensat ion (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. Other direct costs include costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as supervision, materials and supplies, professional and contracted services, capi tal outlay, and travel. These direct costs are accumulated on the annual cost report, resulting in total direct cos ts. The Agency's rates were set as of July 1, 2007 and are effective for services on or after July 1, 2009. All rates are published on the A gency's website at www.dhcfp.nv.gov II. The lower of: a) billed charges; o r b) an interim rate. The Interim rate is the rate for a specific service for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the completion of cost reconciliation and a cost settlement for that period. To determine the Medicaid -allowable direct and indir ect costs of providing Targeted Case Management services the following steps are performed: 1. Interim Rates Governmental providers are reimb ursed on an interim basis for direct medical services per unit of service at the lesser of the provider's billed charges or a provider -specific interim rate. A provider -specific interim rate is an annual rate for the specifi c services for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the completion of cost reconciliation and a cost settlement for that period. Interim rates are based on program experience and cost data reported during the prior fiscal year. 2. Annual Cost R eport Process Each governmental provider will complete an annual cost report in the format prescribed by Nevada Medicaid in the Medicaid Operations Manual for all medical services delivered during the previous state fiscal year c overing July 1 through Jun e 30. The cost report is due on or before December 1 of the year following the close of the reporting period. The primary purposes of the cost report are to: a. document the provider's total Medicaid -allowable cost for delivering the medical services, includ ing direct costs and indirect co sts. b. reconcile its interim payments to its total Medicaid -allowable costs. STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TN No.: 08-006 Approval Date: March 17, 20 09 Effective Date: November 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No.: NEW State : NEVADA Attachment 4.19 -B Page 4 (Continued p. 3) The annual Medicaid Cost Report includes a certification of expendit ures statement to be completed, certifying the provider's actual, incurred allocable and allowable costs/expenditures. All filed annual Cost Reports are subject to audit by the DCHFP or its designee. To determine the Medicaid -allowable direct and indirect costs of providing covered services to Medicaid -eligible clients, the following steps are performed: A. Settings that are primarily providing medical services: (a.) Direct costs for covered services include unallocated payroll costs and other unallocated cos ts that can be directly charged to covered medical services. Direct payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. Other direct costs include costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as supervision, materials and supplies, professional and contracted services, capital outlay and travel. These costs must be in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy and are accumulated on the annual cost re port, resulting in total direct costs. (b.) Total direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs for covered servic es. (c.) Indirect costs are determined by applying the agency specific approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs . If the provider has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These allocated indirect costs are reduced by any unallowable amount based on Medicaid non -intuitional reimbursement policy. The indirect costs details are accumul ated on the annual cost report. (d.) Net direct costs (b) and indirect costs (c) are combined. (e.) A CMS approved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the Targeted Case Management services described in the applicable Section 3.1 -A State plan pages and is used to determine the percentage of time that case management service personnel spend on direct Targeted STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: NEVADA Attachment 4.19-B TN No.: 08-006 Approval Date: November 1, 2008 Supersedes TN No.: NEW Page 4 (Continued p. 4) Case Management services, general and administrative time, and all other activi ties to account for 100 % of the time to assure that there is no duplicate claiming. This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct Targeted Case Management services time study percentage is applied against the net direct and indirect costs . (f.) Medicaid's portion of total allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from item (e) above to the ratio of the total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. (g.) Total Medicaid allowable costs (f) is reduced by any revenue, e.g. Medicaid co -payments, TPL, received for the same services to arrive at the tota l Medicaid net allocable and allowable costs. B. Facilities that are us ed for multiple purposes and the provision of medical services is not the primary purpose: (a) Direct costs include unallocated payroll costs and medical equipment and supplies. Unallocat ed payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. (b) The Direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement pol icy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs. (c) Indirect costs are determined by applying the agency specified approved ind irect cost rate to its net direct costs (Item b.). If the entity has no app roved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These indirect costs are redu ced by any allowable amount. For these facilities, allowable costs are only those costs that are \"directly attributable\" to the professional component of providing the medical services and are in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement pol icy. For those costs incurred that \"benefit\" multiple purposes but would be incurred at the same level if the medical services did not occur are not allowed, e.g., room and board, allocated cost from other related organizations. The indirect cost details a re accumulated on the annual cost report.

(g) Total Medicaid allowable costs (Item f) is reduced by any revenue received for the same services, e.g. Medicaid co -payments and TPL, to arrive at the total Medicaid net al locable and allowable costs. 3. Cost Reconciliation Process Governmental providers will be responsible for reconciling total computable costs reported on the cost report to the provider's Medicaid interim payments for Medicaid services delivered during th e reporting period as document in the MMIS, resulting in cost reconciliation. The cost reconciliation process must be completed within twenty -four months of the end of the reporting period covered by the annual Cost Report. 4. Cost Settlement Process If a gove rnmental provider's interim payments exceed the actual, certified costs of the provider for services to Medicaid clients, the DHCFP will recoup the federal share of the overpayment using one of the following two methods: 1. Off-set all future claims p ayments from the provider until the amount of the federal share of the overpayment is recovered; 2. The provider will return an amount equal to the overpayment.

Newly developed Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes determined to be for Ne vada Medicaid covered services: Codes for those services with a rate methodology which uses resource based relative value scale (RBRVS), as specified elsewhere in this Attachment, will be entered into the system using the Nevada specific unit value develop ed by Medicare. The 20 14 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule conversion factor will be used to calculate payment for these newly developed codes where the RBRVS is used. The maximum allowable will be established by multiplying the unit value and the 20 14 conve rsion factor and then paying the appropriate percentage, as specified elsewhere in this Attachment, based on the provider type, service type and CPT code range. If a code is billed that has no Nevada specific Medicare rate, the Division will determine if there is national Medicare pricing.

Surgical services provided in both hospital -based and freestanding Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC) a. Payments for services billed by hospital -based and freestanding Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC) will be calculated using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) groupin g as published in 42 CFR Parts 405, 410, 412 ,413, 416 and 419. A Nevada ASC Base Rate will be esta blished for each service by multiplying the associated 2016 ASC payment weight from the APC group (found in CMS -1633 -FC-Addenda file) by the 2016 ASC convers ion factor 44.177 (found in CMS -1633 -FC; CMS -1607 -F2), then multiplying the result by the 2016 N V Wage Index of 0.9299 (Found in CMS -1633 -FC Wage Index file). 1. Surgical Codes 10000 - 58999 and 60000 - 69999 will be reimbursed at 85% of the NV ASC Base Rate. b. Services that CMS identifies as excluded from payment in an ASC setting, but are deemed appropriate to be performed in that setting by NV Medicaid Policy , will be paid using the CMS Outpatient Prospe ctive Payment System (OPPS) relative weight from the associated APC group for that service in place of the ASC payment weight to establish the NV ASC Base Rate. c. In the case of multiple procedures, the following adjustments to the fee schedule are made: 1) First procedure 100% of fee schedule 2) Second procedure 50% of fee schedule 3) Third procedure 25% of fee schedule 4) Fourth procedure 10% of fee schedule 5) Fifth and thereafter procedures 5% of fee schedule d.

Cornea Procurement will be reimbursed at 100% of the procurement charges as listed in the 2013 The Lewin Group Study. Assurance: Except as otherwise noted in the plan, state developed fee schedule rates are the same for both public and private providers of the service.

When a hospital, clinic or county social service dep artment determines a person receiving emergency services is indigent and an illegal alien, the alien will be referred to the State Welfare Division District Office for application. If the applicant is unable or reluctant to go to the Welfare District Offic e, the hospital/clinic/social service department will assist the applicant in comple ting the application and gathering verification and will send the application and verification to the Welfare District Office with the billing(s). The District Office elig ibility worker will request from the provider a bill or other evidence services were rendered and will obtain an application (if not already completed) and necessary verifications/information. The eligibility worker will approve eligibility for the months in which services were rendered and the applicant meets income/resource and other cr iteria (e.g., disability or incapacity). (A Medicaid card will not be issued to the client.) Providers will be notified of client eligibility so applicable bills may be sub mitted to the Medicaid fiscal agent for payment determination and processing based o n whether the alleged qualifying services actually met the emergency criteria. The fiscal agent will notify providers of the reason for any payment denial. Medicaid will m ake payment only for the alien's care and services which are necessary for the treat ment after sudden onset of an emergency medical condition. As defined in Section 1903(v), an \"emergency medical condition means a medical condition (including emergency lab or and delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (includ ing severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in : (A) placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy, (B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

The published, all inclusive, rate is paid for up to five face-to-face encounters/visits per eligible Medicaid recipient per day. Encounters/visits are limited to healthcare professionals as approved under the Nevada Medicaid State Plan. Alternative Payment Methodology for Tribal Facilities Recognized as FQHCs Outpatient health programs or facilities operated by a Tribe or Tribal organization that choose to be recognized as FQHCs in accordance with Section 1905 (I)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act an d the Indian Self-Determination Act (Public Law 93 -638) will be paid using an alternative payment methodology (APM) for services as described on Attachment 3.1 -A, Page 1a, Paragraph 2c, that is the published, all - inclusive rate (AIR). The APM/AIR rate is p aid for up to five face -to-face encounters/visits per recipient per day. Nevada Medicaid will establish a Prospective Payment System (PPS) methodology for the Tribal facility so that the agency can determine on an annual basis that the published, all -inclusive rate is higher than the PPS rate. The PPS rate will be es tablished by reference to payments to one or more other FQHCs in the same or adjacent areas with similar caseloads. If such an FQHC is not available, the PPS rate will be established by referen ce to payments to one or more other FQHCs in the same or adjace nt areas with a similar scope of services. If there is no FQHC in the same or adjacent area with similar caseloads or similar scope of services, the PPS rate will be based on an average rate of other FQHCs throughout the state. The Tribal facility would no t be required to report its costs for the purposes of establishing a PPS rate. The APM is effective for services provided on and after April 1, 2019.

Medicaid Services must be billed under the Medicaid Billing Provider ID of a Designated Billing Provider. The S tate of Nevada DHCFP must concur with the public teaching entity's designation of eligible practitioners in order for the payment adjustment to be applied.

CCBHCs are provider entities certified by the Nevada Department of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) as mee ting the State's qualifications for a CCBHC. The State agency will reimburse CCBHC practitioners a facility -specific bundled daily rate applicable to providers affiliated with CCBHCs. These cost -based rates reflect the center's unique costs and they ensur e that CCBHCs receive at least their costs for providing services to Medicaid members. Payments will be limited to one payment per day, per recipient, regardless of the number of services received within a single day by center users accessing services from CCBHC practitioners. Encounters with more than one health practitioner and multiple encounters with the same health practitioner that take place on the same day and that share the same or like diagnoses constitute a single billable encounter. This also a pplies to encounters with multiple CCBHC providers in the same day. Only providers affiliated with the CCBHC who are designated as the principle behavioral health provider and holds the plan of care, will be issued a facility -specific bundled daily rate. The CCBHC bundled daily reimbursement methodology is effective for services provided on and after August 1, 2019. Interim bundled daily rate for year one (new facilities without an established rate) The State will allow the use of anticipated allowable costs to determine first year bundled daily rates. To determine the interim bundled daily rate for the first year of CCBHC operations, the State will: Utilize the CCBHC Cost Report as reviewed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to calc ulate the bundled per visit rate by dividing total allowable anticipated CCBHC services by total anticipated CCBHC visits. Allowable CCBHC cost include total direct cost of CCBHC services plus indirect cost applicable to CCBHC services. o Direct CCBHC cost include the actual salaries and benefits of Medicaid qualified providers, costs of services provided under agreement, and other direct CCBHC costs such as medical supplies or professional lability insurance specific to the CCBHC program. The CCBHC will also be required to identify the costs of providing \"non -CCBHC services,\" so that related indirect costs can be excluded fro m the rate. Examples of \"non -CCBHC\" services that a community behavioral health provider might provide include psychiatric residentia l treatment programs and habilitative services for developmentally disabled individuals.

Indirect costs are allocated based on a pro - rated share of CCBHC costs to non -CCBHC costs. Total CCBHC visits include all visits for CCBHC services, including both Medicaid and non- Medicaid visits. A CCBHC \"visit\" or an \"encounter\" for the purposes of reimbursing CCBHC services is defined as face -to-face contact with one or more qualified health professionals that take place on the same day with the same patient. Reconciliati on of bundled daily rate following year one After the first year of operation, the CCBHC will be required to submit a cost report inclusive of all actual costs to provide services for the first year of operations to calculate the bundled per visit rate by dividing total allowable CCBHC services by t otal CCBHC visits. Cost and visit data vary based on CCBHC size, location, economy, and scope of services offered and must adhere to 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 75 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Co st Principles, and Audit Requirements for th e US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Awards and 42 CFR 413 Principles of Reasonable Cost Reimbursement. The CCBHC must submit all required documentation of actual costs for the first full year of pr oviding services to Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) no later than 150 calendar days or 5 months after the first year of operations as a CCBHC. DHCFP will deem cost reports complete within 15 days of receipt. CCBHCs with missing documen tation will be issued a cost report request letter, identifying missing documentation necessary to complete the cost report. The CCBHC will have 30 days from the date of the cost report request letter to submit additional documentation. If a CCBHC does not submit the required documentation to comple te their cost report within 30 days, DHCFP reserves the right to suspend their Medicaid payments or require the CCBHC to pay back state Medicaid program payments received during the fiscal year period for which t hey were to provide a complete cost report. This process will remain in effect until the CCBHC has provided a complete cost report. The DHCFP will conduct an annual settlement based on the difference in the anticipated costs used to inform the interim yea r one rate and the actual year one costs as determined by the cost report. The settlement will apply to all claims from the first day of services until the day the new rate is determined, which could result in a payout or a recoupment. CCBHCs will continue to be reimbursed at the year one rate until the determination of payment or recoupment is determined and the final bundled daily rate is calculated. Reconciliation will be completed within 18 months of deeming the cost report complete. Bundled daily rate for year two Once the daily bundled rate has been calculated using actual costs on the CCBHC cost report submitted after the end of year one, the rate effective date will be aligned with the start date of year two.

Bundled daily rates will not be subject to rebasing after the year 2 rate is set. Qual ity Incentive Payments All CCBHC practitioners are eligible for a Quality Incentive Payment (QIP) based on achieving specific numerical thresholds with regard to state mandated performance measures. The performance period shall be a state fiscal year (7/1 -6/30). The eligibility of each CCBHC practitioner to receive a QIP is judged independently; and in order for a provider to receive a QIP, the CCBHC must achieve the thresholds on all of state mandated performance measures. A CCBHC will have met the particu lar performance measure by meeting or exceeding the posted improvement target goal for the measure. If the State chooses a measure for which there is no improvement target goal, the CCBHC can achieve the threshold for that measure by meeting or exceeding s tatewide mean for the m easure. Performance measures shall be calculated exclusively on the basis of data for Medicaid beneficiaries, excluding beneficiaries dually eligible for the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Each CCBHC will be required to submit elec tronic health record da ta to the State on a quarterly basis for calculation of the measures on an ongoing basis. CCBHCs that fail to submit all required data within six months following the end of the performance year will not be eligible for a QIP. Final results of the performa nce of each CCBHC on the required measures will be posted by June 30 of each year on DPBH website CCBHC pages and shared directly with each CCBHC. DPBH shall establish the minimum patient volume in each performance measure denominato r necessary for the performance measure to be valid. The amount of QIP to a CCBHC will be based on multiplying the total facility -specific bundled rate payments made to t he CCBHC in the performance period by a statewide percentage not to exceed 10% based o n pay for reporting requirements in the first year and 15% in each consecutive year based on pay for performance and pay for reporting requirements. In the first year a 10% QIP is issued for submitting the required datasets, if a full year is reported. F or a CCBHC practitioner who comes online partially through a fiscal year and a full year of data is not submitted, then a prorated amount will be paid for each month repo rted. For example, a CCBHC practitioner who came online effective January 1 would be eligible for 50% of the payment they would otherwise be eligible for the entire year. In the second and subsequent years a 5% QIP will be issued if the required datasets are submitted.

For example, by April 30, 2013, governmental providers must select a methodology for the rate year beginning July 1, 2013. Once a selected methodology is determined for a rate year, governmental providers will not be able to change the selected methodology until the following r ate year. Except as otherwise noted in the plan, state -developed fee schedule rates are the same for both governmental and private providers of ADHC services. The Agency's rates were set as of October 1, 2017 and are effective for services on or after tha t date. All rates are published on the Agency's website at http://dhcfp.nv.gov/Resources/Rates/FeeSchedules/ . The billable unit of service for ADHC is one unit per 15 minutes or the daily r ate. If services are authorized and provided for less than six hours per day, provider should bill one unit for each 15 minutes; If services are authorized and provided for six hours or more per day, provider should bill the per diem rate. State: Nevada \u00a71915(i) State plan HCBS 004 Page May 22, 2020 Supersedes: 11-0016 Rate Methodology: The rate is market based. This model is developed to reflect service definitions, provider requirements, operational service delivery and administrative considerations. The following elements are used to determine the rate: Wage information is taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The wage is based on similar occ upations reported by BLS and identified by Medicaid staff as comparable to ADHC services. Employee related expenses (ERE) percentage of 27% was based on input from the Task Force members and Medicaid Staff. It includes paid vacation, paid sick leave, holid ay pay, health insurance, life insurance, disability, workers compensation, and legally required payroll taxes. Productivity adjustment factor which accounts for the amount of non -billable time spent by staff. This includes the time staff needs to complete required documentation and record keeping, time associated with missed appointments and average travel time by the provider. Administrative overhead, 10%, is the percentage of service cost that should result from non-direct care activities. It includes in surance, administrative staff, operations and management activities and office supplies. Capital and related expenses is not included. It also does not include staff training. Allowances for capital costs - the costs are not included in the Administrative overhead. It includes the average hourly expense for building rental and maintenance, equipment leasing and utility expenses. The following steps are used to determine the rate: 1. The State will use Nevada -specific hourly wages from the Bureau of Labor Stat istics as of May 2004 inflated to June 2006. 2. This hourly compensation is increased by the 27% ERE. 3. A productivity factor is applied to the hourly compensation calculated in Item 2 to equal to the adjusted hourly rate. 4. Administrative overhead (10%) is applied to the adjusted hourly rate (Item 3). 5. Determine allowance for capital costs per hour. 6. Fixed hourly rate is the sum of adjusted hourly rate (Item 3), administrative overhead (Item 4) and capital costs (Item 5). 7. Fixed hourly rate is scaled to the pro per unit based on the procedure code. This rate has been compared to government entities who do not follow all cost reporting rules and other private sector fee -for-service rates. Documentation of the assumptions used, rate development methodology, and fe e schedule payment rates will be maintained by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP). A. Reimbursement Methodology for Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) services provided by a state or local government entity: State: Nevada \u00a71915(i) State plan HCBS 004 Page May 22, 2020 Supersedes: 11-0016 ADHC services provided by a state or local government entity are reimbursed according to the following payment methodology. This methodology is used by providers who undergo all Medicaid cost identification, reporting, reconciliation and settlement procedures. I. The lower of: a) billed charges; or b) an interim rate. The Interim rate is the rate fo r a specific service for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the completion of cost reconciliation and a cost settlement for that period. To determine the Medicaid -allowable direct and indirect costs of providing Adult Day Health Care Services the following steps are performed: 1. Interim Rates Governmental providers are reimbursed on an interim basis for direct medical services per unit of service at the lesser of the provider's billed charges or a provider -specific interim rate. A provider -specific interim rate is an annual rate for the specific services for a period that is provisional in nature, pending the completion of cost reconciliation and a cost settlement for that period. Interim rates are based on program experience and co st data reported during the prior fiscal year. 2. Annual Cost Report Process Each governmental provider will complete an annual cost report in the format prescribed by Nevada Medicaid for all medical services delivered during the previous state fiscal year covering July 1 through June 30. The cost report is due on or before December 1 of the year following the close of the reporting period. The primary purposes of the cost report are to: a) document the provider's total Medicaid -allowable cost for delivering the medical services, including direct costs and indirect costs. b) reconcile its interim payments to its total Medicaid -allowable costs. The annual Medicaid Cost Report includes a certification of expenditures statement to be completed, certifyi ng the provider's actual, incurred allocable and allowable costs/expenditures. All filed annual Cost Reports are subject to audit by the DHCFP or its designee. B. Settings that are primarily providing medical services: a) Direct costs for covered services include unallocated payroll costs and other unallocated costs that can be directly charged to covered medical services. Direct State: Nevada \u00a71915(i) State plan HCBS State plan Attachment 4.19 -B: TN: 20 -0004 Page 14 c Effective: March 1, 2020 Approved: May 22, 2020 Supersedes: 11-0016 payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. Other direct costs include costs directly related to the delivery of covered services, such as supervision, materials and supplies, profe ssional and contracted services, capital outlay and travel. These costs must be in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy and are accumulated on the annual cost report, resulting in total direct costs. b) Total direct costs fro m Item (a) are reduced by any amount that is not in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs for covered services. c) Indirect co sts are determined by applying the cognizant agency approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs. If the provider has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's appr oved cost allocation plan. These allocated indirect costs are reduced by any unallowable amount based on Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy. The indirect cost details are accumulated on the annual cost report. d) Net direct costs (b) and in direct costs (c) are combined. e) A CMS approved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the ADHC services described in the applicable section 3.1 -A State Plan pages and is used to determine the percent age of time that service personnel spend on direct ADHC. f) Services, general and administrative time, and all other activities to account for 100 Services, general and administrative time and all other activities to account for 100 per percent of the t ime to assure that there is no duplicate claiming. This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct Adult Day Health Care Services time study percentage is applied against the net d irect and indirect costs g) Medicaid's portion of total allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from item (e) above to the ratio of the total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. h) Total Medicaid allowable costs (f) is reduced by any revenue, e.g. Medicaid co - payments, TPL, received for the same services to arrive at the total Medicaid net allocable and allowable costs. C. Facilities that are used for multiple purposes and the provision of medical services is not the primary purpose: State: Nevada \u00a71915(i) State plan HCBS State plan -B: TN: 20 -0004 Page 14 d Effective: March 1, 2020 Approved: May 22, 2020 Supersedes: 11-0016 a) Direct costs include unallocated payroll costs and medical equipment and supplies. Unallocated payroll costs include total compensation (i.e., salaries and benefits and contract compensation) of direct care staff. b) The Direct costs from Item (a) are reduced by any amou nt that is not in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy and are further reduced by any federal payments for those costs, resulting in adjusted direct costs. c) Indirect costs are determined by applying the cognizant agency approved indirect cost rate to its net direct costs (Item b.). If the entity has no approved indirect cost rate, the allocated indirect costs can be derived from the allocation process through the provider's approved cost allocation plan. These indirect costs are r educed by any allowable amount. For these facilities, allowable costs are only those costs that are \"directly attributable\" to the professional component of providing the medical services and are in compliance with Medicaid non -institutional reimbursement policy. For those costs incurred that \"benefit\" multiple purposes but would be incurred at the same level if the medical services did not occur are not allowed, e.g., room and board, allocated cost from other related organizations. The indirect cost detail s are accumulated on the annual cost report. d) Net direct costs (Item (b)) and indirect costs (Item (c)) are combined. e) A CMS approved time study is required when providers of service do not spend 100% of their time providing the Adult Day Health Care Servi ces described in the applicable section 3.1 -A State Plan pages and is used to determine the percentage of time that service personnel spend on direct Adult Day Health Care Services, general and administrative time, and all other activities to account for 1 00 percent of the time to assure that there is no duplicate claiming. This CMS approved time study methodology will be used to separate administrative activities and direct services. The direct Adult Day Health Care Services time study percentage is applie d against the net direct and indirect costs. f) Medicaid's portion of the total net allocable and allowable costs is calculated by multiplying the result from Item (e) above to the ratio of total units of service provided to Medicaid eligible clients to the total units of service provided. g) Total Medicaid allowable costs (Item f) is reduced by any revenue received for the same services, e.g. Medicaid co -payments and TPL, to arrive at the total Medicaid net allocable and allowable costs.

Cost Reconciliation Process Governmental providers will be responsible for reconciling total computable costs reported on the cost report to the provider's Medicaid interim payments for Medicaid services delivered during the reporting period as documented in the MMIS, resulting in co st reconciliation. The cost reconciliation process must be completed within twenty -four months of the end of the reporting period covered by the annual Cost Report. 2. Cost Settlement Process If a governmental provider's interim payments exceed the actu al, certified costs of the provider for services to Medicaid clients, the DHCFP will recoup the federal share of the overpayment using one of the following two methods: 1. Off-set all future claims payments from the provider until the amount of the federa l share of the overpayment is recovered; 2. The provider will return an amount equal to the overpayment. If the actual, certified costs exceed the interim Medicaid payments, the DHCFP will pay the federal share of the difference to the provider in accordance with the final actual certification agreement. The DHCFP will issue a notice of settlement that deno tes the amount due to or from the provider. Services provided by an out -of-state provider require prior authorization by Nevada Medicaid, which must verify that the services required by Medicaid -eligible or pending - eligible clients are not available in Nevada. The out -of-state payment rate for services provided by an out -of-state provider is based on one of the following criteria: a. The out -of-state provider will be paid the lesser of the provider's billed charges or the fee -for-service rate that is paid to an in -state provider for the service. b. If the out -of-state provider refuses to accept this rate, then the out -of-state provider may be paid the lesser of the provider's billed charges or the same fee -for- service rate as it would be paid by its home stat e Medicaid program. c. For services that cannot be provided by a provider that accepts payment under (A) or (B), the State will maintain a list of other qualified out -of-state providers and will negotiate competitive rates that will not exceed the provider's customary charge.

Privately -owned or operated facilities. b. State government -owned or operated facilities c. Non-state government -owned or operated facilities 2. Free-Standing Privately -owned or operated facility UPL estimation a. A sample of at least one calendar quarter of Medicaid claims for these providers will be used as base data. b. Medicaid reimbursement is estimated for these claims using the methodology described in 4.19B, Page 5. c. Medicare reimbursement is estimated using the guidelines established in the Medicare Claims Processing Manual and Transmittal AB -03-116. d. The amounts calculated in b. and c. are compared. If b. is less than c. Medicaid reimbursement is in conformance with the provisions of 42 CFR 422.321. 3. Free-Standing state and non -state g overnment -owned or operated facilities - there are no facilities providing services under attachment 4.19B, Page 5 in Nevada. 4. Hospital -based privately -owned or operated facilities. a. The methodology utilizes Medicare cost principles to estimate UPL b. The meth odology includes all hospital outpatient services, including those provided under 4.19B, Page 1 and Page 5. c. The most recently filed Medicare cost report outpatient cost to charge ratio is used for each facility. d. A sample of at least one calendar quarter of Medicaid claims for the services described in 4.b. above will be used as base data. e. Medicaid reimbursement is estimated for these claims using the methodology described in attachment 4.19B. f. Medicare reimbursement is estimated by multiplying the total bill ed charges for each facility from d. above by the cost to charge ratio from b. above. The result is the Medicare UPL for these services. g. The amounts calculated in e. and f. are compared. If e. is less than f. Medicaid reimbursement is in conformance with t he provisions of 42 CFR 422.321 5. Hospital -based state government -owned or operated facilities - there are no facilities providing services under attachment 4.19B, Page 5 in Nevada. 6. Hospital -based non -state government owned or operated facilities estimatio ns are based on the same methodology described in 4. above.

A. Hospital -Based Facilities: (Hospital -based facility is defined as: a) a facility sharing a common buildin g or common tract of land with a hospital owned or operated by the state, or an instrumentality or unit of government within the state, located within a county of a population of 100,000 or less; or b) a facility (public or private) which prior to July 1, 1992, was paid for both inpatient hospital services under Attachment 4.19 -A of the Medicaid State Plan and long -term nursing facili ty services under this section. 1. Hospital -based nursing facility services are paid for under Medicare reasonable cost -based reimbursement principles, including the routine cost limitation (RCL), and the lesser of cost or charges (LCC). Effective October 1, 2001, hospital -based nursing facilities shall continue to be reimbursed under Medicare's cost-based reimbursement principle s, along with the other provisions of Paragraphs A.2 and A.3. Under this methodology, payment will follow any and all applicable Medicare upper payment limitation (UPL) requirements such that payments will not exceed the UPL. The rates the State of Nevada would pay per day of nursing facility care comply with the Medicare upper payment limit at 42 CFR 447.272, as amended. The routine cost limit (RCL) used in cost settlements will be $160.14 per day, effective October 1, 2001. This RCL will apply to cost reports ending on or after October 1, 2001, and will only apply to the portion of the cost report period on or after October 1, 2001. For those cost reports beginning prior to October 1, 2001 and ending on or after October 1, 2001, a weighted average RCL will be used. The RCL applicable to the portion of the cost report period prior to October 1, 2001 will be the per diem routine service cost paid to the facility during the most current cost report period ending prior to October 1, 2001. The RCL applic able to the portion of the cost report period on or after October 1, 2001, will be the RCL of $160.14, as adjusted for inflation. For example: If a hospital -based facility with a June 30 year end was paid $140 per day for routine service cost during its ye ar ending June 30, 2001, the $140 per day would be the RCL for this facility during the portion of the cost reporting year from July 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001. The RCL for the remainder of the year ending June 30, 2002 (October 1, 2001 through Jun e 30, 2002) would be the $160.14 RCL, as adjusted for inflation. The $160.14 RCL will be indexed (adjusted for inflation) from October 1, 2001 to the midpoint of the cost -reporting period to which it is applied. The Skilled and Intermediate Care Facilitie s without capital (non -seasonally adjusted) Table 9: Percent Change in Medical Prices as published by MEI will be used in indexing the RCL. If this index becomes unavailable, a comparable index will be used.

Free-standing Nursing Facilities (Free -standing nursing facility is defined as any other facility providing nursing facility services, except hospital -based nursing facilities.): 1. Reimbursement Methodology - January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002: a. In preparing the free -standing nursing f acilities for a resource utilization group (RUG) based Medicaid reimbursement system; a transitional rate setting process will be adopted effective January 1, 2002. The significant elements of this system include the following: b. Base operating rates will b e calculated for each facility effective January 1, 2002. The base operating rates will be calculated for each free -standing nursing facility using the weighted average operating rate for each facility effective October 1, 2001, (excluding SNL -3 days and r ates). The days used to prepare the weighted average operating rates will be paid nursing facility days from January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2001 (excluding SNL -3 days) as shown on a paid claims listing prepared in November 2001. Each facility's capital r ate effective October 1, 2001, will be added to their weighted average operating rate. If the statewide Medicaid day weighted average operating and capital rates, calculated as described above, exceed the budget target rate of $121.02, a budget adjustment factor will be employed to adjust the calculated rates to meet the budget target. c. For those facilities with unstable occupancy (i.e. facilities receiving their initial Medicaid certification on or after January 1, 2000), their base rate will be adjusted for changes in Medicaid acuity as follows: 1. A snapshot Medicaid average case mix index (CMI) will be calculated for each facility effective October 1, 2001. 2. Medicaid average CMIs will be prepared for these facilities as of January 1, 2002 and April 1, 2002, using the same weights as were used to prepare the October 1, 2001 snapshot. 3. The change in average Medicaid CMI, for each unstable occupancy nursing facility as measured from October 1, 2001 to January 1, 2002, and from October 1, 2001 to April 1, 2 002, will be used to proportionally increase or decrease 40% of that facility's operating rate effective January 1, 2002 and April 1, 2002. TN No.: 02-08 Approval Date : January 23, 2003 Effective Date: April 1, 2002 Supersedes TN No.: 01-10 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -D Page 4 2. Reimbursement Methodology July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003: a. Effective July 1, 2002, each nursing facility's base rate (the rate in effect for each facility on June 30, 2002) will be adjusted for the change in their average Medicaid CMI. The ratio to use in this calculation will be developed using as its numerator each facility's simple average of their Medicaid CMI as of January 1, 20 02 and April 1, 2002. The denominator will be the simple average of each facility's Medicaid CMI calculated as of October 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002. b. The rates in 2.a. will be further acuity -adjusted quarterly. In preparing these rate adjustments, the de nominator of the fraction described in Item 2.a. above will remain unchanged for each facility. The numerator of the fraction for October 1, 2002 adjustment will reflect the simple average of each facility's Medicaid CMI as of April 1, 2002 and July 1, 200 2. The July 2002 and October 2002 average Medicaid CMI will be used in the January 1, 2003 rate setting, while the October 2002 and January 2003 average Medicaid CMI will be used in the April 1, 2003 rate adjustments. c. The acuity -adjusted rates, as described above in Items 2.a. and b., will be further adjusted by an adjustment factor to not exceed the industry Medicaid weighted average per patient day rate effective January 1, 2002 as described in B. 1. b. above. d. Forty percent of each facility's weighted average operating rate will be subject to the acuity adjustments described in this section. e. Facilities that were initially certified between July 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999, will have their rates adjusted to reflect the adjustments to rates that were made to unstable occupancy facilities during the period of January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002. These rate adjustments will be effective July 1, 2002. The intent of this provision is to treat facilities initially certif ied during this period as if they had been identified as unstable occupancy facilities during the period from January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002.

Reimbursement Methodology - Effective July 1, 2003: Effective July 1, 2003, a nursing facility price -based reimbursement system will be implemented. Individual facility rates will be developed from prices established for three separate cost centers: operating, direct health care and capital. The allowable cost used in these rate setting activities will be nursi ng facility health care cost determined to be allowable in accordance with the Medicare/Medicaid provider reimbursement manual, commonly referred to as HIM 15. a. Operating Cost Center - The operating cost center will be comprised of all allowable cost excluding direct care cost, capital cost and direct ancillary service cost. The statewide price for this cost center will be set at 105% of the Medicaid day weighted median. TN No.: 03-09 Approval Date : July 6, 2004 Effective Date: July 18, 2003 Supersedes TN No.: 02-08 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -D Page 5 b b. Direct Health Care Cost Center - The direct health care cost center will be comprised of allowable RN, LPN, and Nursing Aide salaries and wages; a proportionate allocation of allowable employee benefits; and the direct allowable cost of acquiring RN, LPN and Nurse Aide staff from outside staffing companies. The statewide price will be established for this cost center at 110% of the Medicaid day weighted median case mix neutralized cost. In preparing the case mix neutralization, a minimum of two calendar quarters from each facility 's available quarterly facility wide case mix index information that most closely matches their base year cost report will be used to calculate the Medicaid day weighted average. On a quarterly basis, each facility's specific direct health care price is de termined by adjusting the statewide price using as the numerator, the facility's most current quarterly Medicaid case mix index and as the denominator, the Medicaid day weighted average of the facility wide case mix indexes used in setting the statewide price.

Capital Cost Center - This cost center will be comprised of allowable depreciation, capital related interest, rent / lease, and amortization expenses. A fair rental value (FRV) reimbursement system will be used to determine each facility's capital rate. The following i tems will be used in determining each facility's FRV rate: i. Value of New Beds (7/01/03) $73,000.00 ii. Bed Value Indexed Annually (using Marshall Swift, Class C nursing facility index) iii. Rate of Depreciation 1.5% Year iv. Maximum Age 40 Years v. Rental Rate 9.0% Annually vi. Minimum Occupancy Percent 92% These values will be used to determine a facility's FRV payment as demonstrated below: (Example facility has 100 beds and is 10 years old) Licensed Beds 100 Times Value/Bed $73,000 Gross Value $7,300,000 Depreciation Rate (1.5% x 10 15% Depreciated Value (85%) $6,205,000 Rental Rate 9% FRV Payment (Gross) $558,450 Divided by Greater of Actual or Minimum Days 33,580 Fair Rental Value Payment $16.63 TN No.: 03-09 Approval Date : July 6, Date: July 18, 2003 Supersedes TN No.: 02-08 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -D Page 5 d.1 1) Capital Renovations / Remodeling Projects - The fair rental value of each facility will be adjusted (increased) to reflect the cost of major renovation/replacement projects completed by each facility not to exceed a 24-month period . The renovation/replacement adjustment would be made at the start of the first-rate year following completion of the renovation/ replacement project. The cost of renovation/replacement projects must be documented within each facility's depreciation schedule, must be reported to the Medicaid program by May 1st prior to the July 1st rate year when they would first be eligible for incorporation into the FRV rate setting process, and must exceed $1,000.00 per licensed bed in order to be considered a major renovation/replacement. The cost of these renovation/replacement proj ects will be depreciated at a rate of 4% per year, but will also be indexed (inflated) annually using the bed value indexing methodology incorporated into this fair rental value system.

This age will be reduced for renovations and/or additions of beds that have occurred since the facility was built. If a fac ility added beds, these new beds will be averaged in with the original beds and a weighted average age for all beds will be used as the initial age. If a facility performed a major renovation project between the time the facility was built and the time whe n the initial age is determined, the cost of the renovation project will be used to determine the equivalent number of new beds that project represents. The equivalent number of new beds would then be used to determine the weighted average age of all beds for this facility. The equivalent number of new beds from a renovation project will be determined by dividing the cost of the renovation project by the cost of a new bed (using the new bed valuation methodology incorporated into the FRV system) at the time the renovation project was completed. Facility ages will be rounde d to the nearest whole number.

Cost Reporting Requirements: 1. Hospital -based and free -standing nursing facilities must complete and file an annual cost report with the Medicaid program. Cost and other statistical information within the cost report must be repor ted in compliance with allowable and non -allowable cost definitions contained in the Medicare/Medicaid provider reimbursement manual (commonly referred to as HIM 15). 2. Free-standing nursing facility cost reports are to be received by the Medicaid program by the last day of the third month following a facility's fiscal year end. If the facility is unable to complete their cost report within this time frame, a request for a 30-day extension can be requested from the Medicaid program ( DHCFP ) prior to the original cost report due date. Reasonable extension requests will be granted. 3. Hospital -based nursing facility cost reports are to be filed with the Medicaid program followi ng the cost report filing deadlines adopted by the Medicare program. If a facility requests an extension from the Medicare program, they must also request an extension from the Medicaid program ( DHCFP ). Extension requests approved by Medicare will automati cally be approved by the Medicaid program, once the DHCFP receives evidence of Medicare approval from the facility. 4. Facilities failing to file a Medicaid cost report in accordance with these provisions may have their payments suspended or be required to p ay back to the Medicaid program all payments received during the fiscal year period upon which they were to provide a cost report. Facilities may also be subject to late filing fees assessed in accordance with guidelines issued pursuant to the Medicaid Se rvices Manual.

New Facilities and Change of Ownership: 1. New facilities are those entities whose beds have not previously been certified to participate in the Medicaid program. New free -standing facilities will be reimbursed an interim rate computed from the following Nursing Facility rate components in effect on the date of the facility's Medicaid certification: a. The Fair Rental Value per diem will be determined based upon an initial capital survey the new provider completes and submits to the DHCFP , and upon the methodology described in Section B.3.c. of this attachment. b. The operating component for the rate will be the \"Operating Statewide Price \" as described in Section B.3.a. of this attachment. c. The direct health care component will be the \"Statewide Direct Health Care Price \" as described in Section B.3.b. of this attachment. d. The \" Budget Adjustment Factor ,\" as described in Section B.3.h. of this attachment, will be applied to determine the Facility Medicaid Rate. This interim rate will be paid until such time that the rate is rebased under the provisions of Section B.3.e of this attachment. 2. New hospital -based facilities will receive an interim rate equal to the average rate (expressed as a percent of charges) paid to all other hospital -based nursing facilities effective at the start of the state fiscal year in which the facility began providing services to Medicaid recipients. 3. A change of ownership exists if the beds of the new owner have previously been certified to participate in the Medicaid program under the previous owner's provider agreement. Rates paid to free -standing nursing facilities that have un dergone a change of ownership will be based upon the base rate and acuity data of the previous owner. The new owner's acuity data will be used to adjust the facility's rate following the rate adjustment schedule discussed in this rule. Facilities (hospital -based and free -standing) that undergo a change in ownership are required to file a closing cost report for the seller within 45 days of the date of sale. A new cost reporting period for the buyer will start on the effective date of the transaction. The interim rate paid to a new hospital -based owner will be the same interim rate the prior owner was receiving.

Each nursing facility resident in a facility, with a completed and submitted MDS shall be assigned to a RUG classification group on the first day of each calendar quarter. These RUG assignments will be based upon each resident's most current MDS assessment available on the first day of each calendar quarter. Using the facility's simple average of the individual residents' case mix indexes, two case mix indexes (CMIs) will be calculated for the facility. One being a facility wide CMI, which will be based upo n all of the facility's residents, and the other being the Medicaid CMI, which will be calculated using only the Medicaid residents for each facility. Both of these average case mix indexes will be rounded to four decimal places.

Supplemental payments are not available for nursing fac ilities owned by the State of Nevada or any of its political subdivisions. Fifty percent of the supplemental payment is based on Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality measures. Fifty percent of the payment is based on acuity. The amount available f or supplemental payments is computed quarterly and reimbursed in the quarter in three equal monthly payments. A. The amount available for Supplemental Payments to Nursing Facilities (NF) will be calculated each quarter based on actual net revenues from patie nt services and actual patient days for each facility during the Base Quarter. 1. The Base Quarter is defined as the quarter beginning six months prior to the quarter in which the supplemental payments are being distributed. (For the quarter beginning October 1, 2011, the supplemental payment computation would be based on actual net revenues and bed days for the quarter April 1 through June 30, 2011.) 2. The total amount available for Supplemental Payments is calculated by multiplying the net revenues from patient se rvices in the Base Quarter by 6% . 3. One percent of this amount each quarter is retained by Nevada Medicaid to pay administrative costs associated with the Supplemental Payment Program. The remaining funds are the amount available to pay the state share of Supplemental Payments to free -standing nursing facilities. 4. The amount available to pay the state share of Supplemental Payments to free-standing nursing facilities is matched by federal Medicaid funds calcul ated according to the formula in 42 CFR 433.10 (b). B. Calculation of Fifty Percent of Supplemental Payments Based on Medicaid Occupancy, MDS Accuracy, and Quality 1. Fifty percent of the amount available to pay the state share of Supplemental Payments to Nurs ing Facilities is paid out based on the facility's Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality scores. 2. Calculations for the Medicaid occupancy and MDS accuracy components of Supplemental Payments require bed day counts, which are the actual bed days rep orted by the free -standing nursing facilities for the Base Quarter. 3. The Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy and quality components are calculated by assigning points to each facility for each component according to the methodologies described below. The unit reimbursement value for each of the component points is determined b y calculating the amount available to pay the state share of Supplemental Payments to Nursing Facilities TN No. : 13-005 Approval Date: August 9, 2013 Effective Date: July 1, 2013 Supersedes TN No. : 11-012 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX O F THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -D Page 10 b for that component plus the federal Medicaid matching funds and dividing by the total points in the component for all facilities receiving Supplemental Payments for that quarter. Calculation of the Unit Reimbursement Value for a Component Total Dollars Available for Component Divided by Total Points for Component Equals Unit Reimbursement Value for Component 4. Supplemental Payment for Medicaid Occupancy, MDS Accuracy, and Qualit y Components i. Medicaid Occupancy Component: Distribution of 82% of the state funds available for the portion of the Supplemental Payments based on Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality plus the federal Medicaid matching dollars is based on Medicaid occupancy. The facility receives a Medicaid occupancy rate modifier, which is the Medicaid nursing facility and LTC hospice bed days divided by total occupied bed days times 100. The facility's Medicaid occupancy rate modifier is multiplied by the number of Medicaid nursing facility and LTC hospice bed days to yield the Medicaid occupancy points. The Medicaid occupancy points will be multiplied times the unit reimbursement value to determine the Medicaid occupancy component of the facilities' reimb ursement. Calculation of the Facility Specific Medicaid Occupancy Component of the Supplemental Payment: Facility Occupied Medicaid NF and LTC Hospice Bed Days Divided by Facility Total Occupied Bed Days Equals Facility Medicaid Occupancy Rate Times 100 Equals Facility Medicaid Occupancy Rate Modifier Times Facility Occupied Medicaid NF and LTC Hospice Bed Days Equals Facility Medicaid Occupancy Points Times Medicaid Occupancy Component Unit Reimbursement Value Equals Facility Total Medicaid Occupancy Com ponent Payment ii. MDS Accuracy Component: Distribution of 9% of the state funds available for the portion of the supplemental payments based on Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality plus the federal Medicaid matching dollars are based on MDS accuracy rate from the most current review performed by Medicaid s taff. To qualify for MDS accuracy payments, the facility must have an accuracy rate of 70% or higher. Accuracy rates will be rounded to the nearest whole percentage. If the partial TN No. : 11-012 Approval Date: April 6, 2012 Effective Date: October 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. : NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -D Page 10 c percentage point is less than 0.5%, it will be rounded down to the nex t whole percentage point. If the partial percentage point is 0.5% or greater, it will be rounded up to the next whole percentage point. Facilities who qualify for MDS accuracy payments will be assigned an MDS accuracy modifier as follows: Accuracy Rate Modifier 0 - 69% 0 70 - 79% 1 80 - 89% 3 90 - 100% 5 The MDS accuracy modifier is multiplied times the number of Medicaid nursing facility and LTC hospice bed days to determine MDS accuracy points. Each facility's MDS accuracy points will be multiplied by the unit reimbursement value to determine the facility's total reimbursement for MDS accuracy component. Calculation of the MDS Accuracy Component Facility MDS Accuracy Modifier Times Facility Occupied Medicaid NF and LTC Hospice Bed Days Equals Facility MDS Accuracy Points Times MDS Accuracy Unit Reimbursement Value Equals Facility Total MDS Accuracy Component Payment iii. Quality Component: Distribution of 9% of the state funds available for the portion of supplemental payments based on Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality plus the federal Medicaid matching dollars is based on quality measures. The quality component of the supplemental payment provides reimbursement for a facility's efforts to improve resident care and safety. Qu ality measures are selected from MDS data compiled by the Nevada State Health Division Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance (HCQC). Four quality measures are chosen based on MDS data and in put from HCQC and stakeholders. The four quality measures c urrently selected include: 1) Percent of long -stay residents who have moderate to severe pain; 2) Percent of high risk long-stay residents who have pressure sores; 3) Percent of long -stay residents who had a urinary tract infection; 4) Percent of long -stay residents who lose too much weight. Facilities receive one quality point for each percentage point they are better than the Nevada MDS average for each measure. Quality measure percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percentage. If the partial percen tage point is less than 0.5%, it is rounded down to the next whole percentage point. If the partial percentage point is 0.5% or greater, it is rounded up to the next whole percentage point. The facility's total quality points are multiplied by the unit rei mbursement value for the quality component to determine the facility specific amount of the quality component of the supplemental payment. Nursing facilities that are identified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as TN No. : 11-012 Approval Date: April 6, 2012 Effective Date: October 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. : NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -D Page 10 d Special Focus Facilities are not eligible for the quality component of the supplemental payments. Special Focus Facilities are nursing homes that have a history of persistent poor quality of care. These nursing homes have been selected for more frequent inspections and monitoring. A current list of Specia l Focus Facilities is available at the CMS Certification and Compliance website. 5. Facilities that do not have MDS or MDS Accuracy data available have MDS accuracy and quality component payments calculated using the average component points of all facili ties receiving Supplemental Payments for which data is available. Facilities that are not enrolled as Medicaid providers are not eligible for payments of the MDS accuracy or quality components or any other components of this supplemental payment for the qu arter. C. Calculation of the Component of the Supplemental Payments Based on Acuity 1. Nursing facility standard per diem reimbursement is calculated for each Medicaid provider quarterly based on methodology described in the Medicaid State Plan, Attachment 4.1 9-D, Pages 5a through 5i. The per diem rate is adjusted for acuity and fair rental value. Fifty percent of the funds available for Supplemental Payments plus the Federal matching funds is paid under this acuity component as described below. Calculation of the Supplemental Payment Portion Based on Acuity The weighted average total amount of reimbursement based on acuity per Medicaid nursing and LTC hospice bed day is calculated by dividing the total for amount available for the acuity compone nt of Supplemental Payments by the total nursing and LTC hospice bed days in the Base Quarter. This is added to the weighted average budget neutral per diem for all facilities to determine the total amount of reimbursement that will be based on acuity. Effective October 1, 2017, the weighted average budget neutral per diem is increased by 10%. Total Available for Supplement Payments Times 50% Equals Total Available for Supplemental Payments Based on Acuity Total Available Supplemental Payments Based on Acuity Divided by Total Medicaid Nursing and LTC Hospice Days Equals Weighted Average Acuity Supplemental Payment Per Medicaid Day Weighted Average Budget Neutral Per Diem Plus Weighted Average Acuity Supplemental Payment Per Medicaid Day Equals Weighted Average Portion of Reimbursement Based on Acuity The full rate per diem is calculated by dividing the number of Medicaid nursing and LTC TN No. : 17-015 Approval Date: January 19, 2018 Effective Date: October 1, 201 7 Supersedes TN No. : 11-012 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -D Page 10 e hospice bed days in the Base Quarter for facilities receiving Supplemental Payments into the total amount of reimbursement these facilities would have received if they were paid at the full per diem amount. The full rate per diem is the amount the faciliti es would receive if the budget adjustment factor in Nevada Medicaid State Plan, Attachment 4.19 -D, Page 5i, were not applied to the per diem rates. The weighted average portion of reimbursement based on acuity is divided by weighted average full rate per d iem to yield a budget adjustment factor for the acuity component of the Supplemental Payment. Total Full Rate Reimbursement for Facilities Receiving Supplemental Payments Divided by Total Nursing and LTC Hospice Days Equals Weighted Average Full Rate Per Diem Weighted Average Portion of Reimbursement Based on Acuity Divided by Weighted Average Full Rate Per Diem Equals Budget Adjustment Factor for Supplemental Payment The budget adjustment factor for supplemental payments is applied to the facil ity specific full rate per diem to arrive at a facility specific unit reimbursement value based on acuity. The facility specific NF per diem rate for each facility is calculated by multiplying the budget adjustment factor described in Attachment 4.19 -D, Page 5i, times the facility specific per diem rate. This budget adjustment factor also equals the weighted average budget neutral per diem for all facilities divided by the weighted average full rate per diem. The facility specific NF per diem rate is subt racted from the facility specific unit reimbursement value based on acuity to yield the facility specific unit reimbursement value for the Supplemental Payment based on acuity. The facility specific reimbursement unit value for the Supplemental Payment por tion based on acuity is multiplied by the number of Medicaid nursing facility and hospice days in the Base Quarter to determine the quarterly Supplemental Payment based on acuity. Calculation of the Facility Specific Supplemental Payment Based on Acuity Facility Specific Full Rate Per Diem Times Budget Adjustment Factor for Supplemental Payment Equals Facility Specific Unit Reimbursement Value Based on Acuity Facility Specific Full Rate Per Diem Times Budget Adjustment Factor for Base NF Rates Equals Facility Specific NF Per Diem Rate TN No. : 11-012 Approval Date: April 6, 2012 Effective Date: October 1, 2011 Supersedes TN No. : NEW STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State : Nevada Attachment 4.19 -D Page 10 f Facility Specific Unit Reimbursement Value Based on Acuity Minus Facility Specific NF Per Diem Rate Equals Facility Specific Unit Value of Supplemental Payment Based on Acuity Times Number of Medicaid NF and LTC Hospice Days in Base Quarter Equal s Facility Specific Quarterly Supplemental Payment Based on Acuity 1. The facility Supplemental Payment based on Medicaid occupancy, MDS accuracy, and quality is added to the facility specific Supplemental Payment based on acuity to yield the total facility specific Supplemental P ayment amount for the quarter. The quarterly facility specific amount is divided by three to calculate the monthly Supplemental Payment. 2. Nursing facilities with negotiated facility -specific rates that exceed the standard or special care rates in the Nevada Medicaid State Plan are ineligible for supplemental payments.

If the facility is unable to complete their cost report within this time frame, a request for a 30 -day extension can be requested from the DHCFP prior to the original cost report due date. Cost reports submitted by providers are audited by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy's contracted auditing firm. Any costs that do not meet standards of reasonableness per industry standards will be excluded from the reimbursement calculation described below. Standards of reasonableness are defined by 42 CFR 413 and are further specified in CMS Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part 1, 15 -1 and 15 -2. 3. For the current state fiscal year, interim rates will be determined using the most recent audited cost reports. The interim rate for the initial year of operation will be based on cost and utilization projections. 4. Interim rates for each ICF/IID Facility will be calculated by dividing the total allowable program costs by the total program days as reported in the most recently available au dited cost report. The annual rate is not to exceed 150% or decrease more than 25% from the facilities' prior year interim rate. Providers may request mid -year adjustments for costs not accounted for in the base period used to set the rate for the current fiscal year. Interim adjustments will only be made if the change to the rate results in an increase or decrease greater than 10% of the rate for the current fiscal year. 5. In general, underpayments will be paid to the provider in a lump sum upon discovery . Overpayments will either be recouped promptly or a negative balance will be set up for the provider. However, other solutions acceptable to both parties may be substituted. Cost reports must be submitted per the timelines described in subsection \"3\" above. Settlements will only be issued upon completion of the cost report audit. There will be no settlement for an \"as filed\" cost report.

The DHCFP TPL management is responsible for review and submission of injury accident questionnaires for worker compensation and vehicle accidents. Claims which edit for t rauma codes are referred to the Fiscal Agent ( FA) Subrogation Unit for follow - up if the billed amount of the claim is greater than the tolerance level. The claim is reviewed to determine the possibility of other liable parties for claim payment. Managed Care Organizations and the Dental Benefit Administr ator are required to data mine Medicaid enrollees through identifying potential casualty claims. The claim is reviewed to determine if the nature of the trauma is one which warrants follow -up (e.g., a broken leg as a result of a fall in individual's own h ome versus a traffic accident). If an investigation is not in process or probable liability has not been established at the time the claim was filed, the investigator will begin research to determine if a probable third party is liable.

This method was chosen as the most efficient and least costly due to the multitude of insurance companies utilized by Nevada residents. Also, insurance data is fed through a secured transmittal bill paying system on an individual basis . Direct contact is made by the fiscal agent TPL unit directly with insurance carriers and all available information is collected. The Nevada bill paying system has a direct connection to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' system. Cost savings occur when post-payment recovery is also incorporated. Criteria have therefore been established for both systems with emphasis on cost effectiveness and FFP compliance. 42 CFR 433.139(b)(3)(ii)(C) I. Cost Avoidance Method a. Claims with Medicaid paid amounts greater than zero are rejected on the remittance advice with insurance billing instructions and carrier information. b. Services identified by individual policies as non -covered are not subject to cost avoidance or recovery. 42 CFR 433.139(f)(2&3), 42 CFR 447.20 and 7 CFR 27 3.18(e)(8)(ii) II. Post-Payment Recovery a. Recovery - Provider 1. States only pursue recoveries from providers whenever Medicare is the primary source. 2. Claims which were unidentified or missed in cost avoidance are subject to claims with Medicaid outlined in 1. a above. Recovery is made by computer history adjustments. 3. Due to Medicare timely filing, r ecovery efforts are not attempted when more than 12 months have elapsed from date of service to the projected adjustment date. b. Recover y - Insurance Carrier 1. When necessary, direct recovery is attempted through individual insurance carriers. This can occur when providers are unsuccessful with billing attempts, but the fiscal agent (FA) has sufficient information to pursue collection. Claims with Medicaid paid amount s of less than $25 are not pursued. A. Claims with Medicaid paid amounts of less than $25 are not pursued. 2.

The methodology used by Nevada for determining cost effectiveness of paying individual or group health insurance premiums for existing coverage shall be as follows: a. Applicant must be on Medicaid Fee -for-Service (FFS) for a minimum of six months. b. The state will take the following steps: a. Total 6 months billed group health plan divided by 6 = Average Premium Cost. b. Total 6 months Medicaid Medical Expenditures divided by 6 = Recognized Average Medicaid Expenditures . c. Recognized Average Medicaid Expenditures greater than Average Group Health Plan Premium plus Administrative Expenditures = Cost Effectiveness . c. The average Medicaid cost includes the benefits covered under the Medicaid eligibility group for which the indiv idual would be determined eligible. d. Administrative costs include additional administrative cost to Medicaid for administering the premium assistance program as well as the following: Benefits wrap. If Medicaid services covered under the State Plan are not part of the services covered by a recipient's employer health care coverage, the recipient may obtain those services from participating Medicaid providers. ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ __________ N 4.22 Page 2 OMB No: STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State/Territory: Nevada Citation Condition or Requirements a. Cost-sharing wrap. The State will provide a cost-sharing wrap to any cost -sharing amounts that exceed the cost -sharing limits described in the State Plan. b. Premiums for non -eligible family members. Non-eligible family members are covered only if it is necessary in order to enroll a Medicaid eligible family member in the group health plan. e. The state may also cover a recipient who has an existing medical confirmed condition or illness that is determined to be cost -effective under the Health Insurance Premium Program (HIPP) expenditure methodology. 2. Individuals enrolled in the premium assistance program are afforded the same beneficiary protections provided to all other Medicaid enrollees. As discussed in the cost -effectiveness test above, the Nevada Medicaid program will provide a benefit wrap and cost-sharing wrap. To effectuate the cost sharing wrap: a. The State has a provider enrollmen t process for non-participating providers to ensure that providers that service Medicaid beneficiaries can be enroll ed and paid through the state Medicaid program f or any and all cost sharing amounts that exceed the Medicaid permissible limits ; b. The State will encourage non -participating providers to enroll by conduct ing outreach to the provider community to educate non - participating Medicaid providers on how to enro ll in Medicaid for the purposes of receiving payment from the Sta te. c.

An advance directive is generally a written statement, which individuals complete in advance of serious illness, about how they want medical decisions made. The two most common forms of advance directive are: - a \"Living Will,\" or \"Declaration\"; - a \"Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.\" An advance directive allows individuals to state their choic es for health care or to name someone to make those choices for them, if they become unable to make decisions about their medical treatment. In short, an advance directive can enable individuals to make decisions about their future medical treatment. They can say \"yes\" to treatment they want, or say \"no\" to treatment they do not want. WHAT IS A LIVING WILL OR DECLARATION? A Living Will or Declaration generally states the kind of medical care individuals want (or do not want) if they become unable to make their own decisions. It is called a \"Living Will\" because it takes effect while they are still living. WHAT IS A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE? A \"Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care\" is a signed, dated, and witnessed paper naming anoth er person, such as a husband, wife, daughter, son, or close friend as an \"agent\" or \"proxy\" to make medical decisions for an individual who should become unable to make such decisions. The power of attorney includes instructions about any treatment the ind ividual may want or wish to avoid, such as surgery or artificial feeding. IS IT REQUIRED TO WRITE AN ADVANCE DIRECTIVE UNDER THE LAW? No. It is entirely up to the individual. TN No. 91-23 Approval Date : 12/16/91 Effective Date Supersedes TN No. N/A State: Nevada ATTACHMENT 4.34 -A Page 2 CAN AN INDIVIDUAL CHANGE HIS/HER MIND AFTER A LIVING WILL OR HEALTH CARE POWER OF ATTORNEY IS WRITTEN? Yes. Individuals may change or cancel these documents at any time in accordance with state law. Any change or cancellation should be written, signed, and dated in accordance wi th state law, and copies should be given to the family doctor, or to others to whom the individual may have given copies of the original. If an individual wishes to cancel an advance directive while in the hospital, the individual should notify his/her do ctor, family, and others who may need to know. Even without a change in writing, wishes state d in person directly to an indi vidual's doctor generally carry more weight than a living will or durable power of attorney, as long as the individual can decide and can communicate his/her wishes. The individuals must be sure to state their wishes clearly and be sure that they are understood. This is a form of a \"Declaration,\" provided for under Nevada Statutes: DECLARATION If I should have an incurable and irr eversible condition that, without the administration of life - sustaining treatment, will, in the opinion of my attending physician, cause my death within a relatively short time, and I am no longer able to make decisions regarding my medical treatment, I di rect may attending physician, pursuant t o NRS 449.540 to 449.690, inclu sive, and section 2 to 12, inclusive, of this act, to withhold or withdraw treatment that only prolongs the process of dying and is not necessary for my comfort or to alleviate pain.

The bureau may request the welfare division to suspend all or part of the Medicaid payments to a facility for services fur nished to a Medicaid recipient on or after the date of the deficiency, regardless of whether the recip ient was admitted before, on, or after the date of the deficiency. 2. If the facility achieves compliance with the requirements, the bureau shall request the department of human resources to resume payments retroactively. CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES Sec. 106 The bureau may impose a monetary penalty alone or in addition to other penalties. The purpose of a monetary penalty is to provide a fund for protecting the health, safety, rights, welfare, and well -being of recipients and the property of residents in fac ilities and to deter future deficiencies. If a penalty is imposed, the criteria in section 107 below must be applied. Sec. 107 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the bureau may impose a monetary penalty on any facility that is not in compl iance with any federal participation requirement, regardless of whether the deficiency constitutes an immediate and serious threat. 2. If a monetary penalty is imposed, the initial penalty based on the severity and scope score of the deficiency must be i mposed as provided in section 111 below. 3. In addition to the initial penalty, the bureau may impose a monetary penalty for each day of noncompliance from the date the noncompliance occurs or is iden tified until compliance is veri -fied. 4. A facility is not subject to a monetary penalty for a de minimis deficiency. As used in this subsection, \"de minimis deficiency\" means a finding rated as having a severity level of one or two under federal survey guidelines.

The bureau shall impose an initial penalty pending a hearing or appeal. The payment of the penalty must not be stayed during the pendency of any administrative appeal. 2. The payment of any daily penalties that accrue while the facility has a hearing pending on the initial determi nation of deficiencies leading to the imposition of sanctions must be stayed pending the appeal. Sec. 109 If the bureau imposes a monetary penalty, the penalty must be imposed as provided in sections 109, 110, and 111 of this attachment. In imposing the penalty, the total penalty assessed against any facility bears interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum. Sec. 110 1. In no event may the principal amount of the total daily monetary penalty assessed against any faci lity exceed $1,000 per deficien cy per day. 2. Where more than one deficiency is subject to a monetary penalty, the total daily penalty assessed against a facility may not exceed the maximum daily penalty per facility permitted by 42 U.S.C. ' 1396r for monetary penalties assessed against Medicaid facilities. 3. If the maximum daily administrative penalty per facility per mitted by federal law for a facility of the type being sanctioned is less than that permitted by 42 U.S.C ' 1396r, the lower maximum penalty amount must be imposed. Sec. 111 1. In determining the amount of an initial penalty, the bureau shall consider the severity alone if the severity level is four. In determining the amount of the monetary penalty where the severity level is less than four, both severity and scope mu st be con sidered. In determining whether to impose a daily monetary penalty, the bureau shall consider the severity and scope and the factors indicated for increased and decreased penalties provided in sections 112 and 114 of this attachment. 2. For ini tial deficiencies with a severity level of four, an initial monetary penalty of $500 per deficiency must be imposed. In addition, a penalty of $10 per recipient per day may be imposed for each day the deficiency continues.

For initial deficiencies ra ted with a severity level of three and a scope level of three or more, a monetary penalty of $400 per deficiency must be imposed. In addition, a penalty of $8 per recipient per day may be imposed for each day the deficiency continues. 4. For initial defi ciencies with a severity level of three and a scope of level of two, an initial monetary penalty of $200 per deficiency must be imposed. In addition, a penalty of $4 per recipient per day may be imposed for each day the deficiency continues. 5. For initi al deficiencies with a severity level of two and a scope level of three, an initial monetary penalty of $100 per deficiency -cy must be imposed. The payment of this penalty must be suspended if the facility has corrected the deficiencies within the time specified in the plan of correction. In addition, a penalty of $2 per recipient per day may be imposed for each day the deficiency continues. Sec. 112 1. Penalties must be increased if deficiencies are uncorrected or repeated or compliance is falsely alle ged. 2. For each uncorrected deficiency present after the time specified by the bureau for correction of the deficiency, the monetary penalty must be computed at the rate of one and one -half times the rate that was or could have been assessed initially fo r a deficiency of that severity and scope 3. For each repeat deficiency present within 18 months after an initial finding of the deficiency, the monetary penalty must be computed at the rate of one and one -half times the rate that was or could have been a ssessed initially for a deficiency of that severity and scope. 4. The bureau may double the daily penalty that was or could have been assessed if the facility alleges compliance and the bureau finds on a survey that at the time compliance was alleged, the deficiencies continued to exist. Sec. 113 There is a rebuttable presumption that deficiencies identified on a subsequent survey were present on each day between the date of the initial finding and the date of the subsequent finding.

If a f acility against which a monetary penalty is imposed: (a) waives the right to a hearing; (b) corrects the deficiencies that were the basis for the penalty; and (c) pays the penalty within 15 days after notice of the penalty, the penalty must be reduced by 25 percen t and no interest may be charged. 2. If, before a survey by the bureau, the facility identifies and corrects the deficiencies that are the basis for the penalty, the penalty must be reduced by 50 percent and no interest may be charged if the assessment is paid within the time required by sections 52 to 147, inclusive, of this attachment. Sec. 115 If a monetary penalty is assessed on a daily basis according to the number of recipients and the number of recipients fluctuates, the penalty must be computed o n the basis of the average daily number of recipients during the three (3) months preceding the imposition of the penalty. Sec. 116 The effective beginning date of a daily monetary penalty is: 1. In the case of an immediate and serious threat, the date the deficiency occurred; and 2. In any other case, the day the deficiency is identified. Sec. 117 1.

Sec. 118 1. The daily accrual of a monetary penalty must end if the facility demonstrates that substantial improvements have been made to correct the deficiencies and that the health, safety, and well-being of recipients are adequately protected and safeguarded. 2. A monetary penalty may be imposed on a daily basis for no longer than six (6) months, after which the bureau shall deny, suspend, or revoke the license of the facility and, if the faci lity is a Medicaid facility and major deficiencies remain, request the welfare division to terminate the Medicaid provider agreement of the facility. 3. If a deficiency in a Medicaid facility presents an immediate and serious threat and continues to exist on the 23rd day following the appointment of temporary management, the bureau shall request the welfare division to terminate the Medicaid provider agreement of the facility. 4. If the provider can supply credible evidence that substantial compliance wit h participation requirements was attained on a date preceding that of the survey, monetary penalties accrue only until that date of correction for which there is credible evidence .

The health division shall provide proper notice of its intent to suspend the license of the facility. 3. If the facility fails to pay the penalty, including any addi tional costs incurred in collection of the penalty, w ithin 10 days after receipt of the notice, the health division shall suspend the license of the facility. The suspension must not be stayed during the pendency of any administrative appeal. Sec. 121 Any costs, including attorney's fees, incurred by the bureau or the health division in the collection of any monetary penalty may be recovered from the facility. Sec. 122 1. The amount of any penalty owed by a Medicaid facility, if it has been determined, may be deducted from any money otherwise owed to the facility by the welfare division. 2. If the facility does not pay a monetary penalty by the date it is due and no extension of time to pay is granted, the administrator of the health division shall notify the administrator of the welfare division of the amount of the penalty due and owing and shall request withholding of the amount owed. 3. The administrator of the welfa re division will take the appropriate steps to withhold the amount of the penalty owed, includ ing any interest and costs of collection, from the Medicaid payment otherwise due the facility.

TN No . 93-3 Approved Date: Employee Education About False Claims Recoveries a. The Medicaid agency meets the requirements regarding establishment of policies and procedures for the education of employees of entities covered by section 1902(a)(68) of the Soc ial Security Act (the Act) regarding false claims recoveries and methodologies for oversight of entities' compliance with these requirements. 1. Definitions. a. An \"entity\" includes a governmental agency, organization, unit, corporation, partnership or other business arrangement (including any Medicaid managed care organization, irrespective of the form of business structure or arrangement by which it exists), whether for -profit or not -for- profit, which receives or makes payments, under a State Plan appro ved under title XIX or under any waiver of such plan, totaling at least $5,000,000 annually. If an entity furnishes items or services at more than a single location or under more than one contractual or other payment arrangement, the provisions of sectio n 1902(a)(68) apply if the aggregate payments to that entity meet the $5,000,000 annual threshold. This applies whether the entity submits claims for payments using one or more provider identification or tax identification numbers. A governmental componen t providing Medicaid health care items or services for which Medicaid payments are made would qualify as an \"entity\" (e.g., a state mental health facility or school district providing school -based health services). A government agency which merely administ ers the Medicaid program, in whole or part (e.g., managing the claims processing system or determining beneficiary eligibility), is not, for these purposes, considered to be an entity. An entity will have met the $5,000,000 annual threshold as of January 1, 2007, if it received or made payments in that amount in Federal fiscal year 2006. Future determinations regarding an entity's responsibility stemming from the requirements of section 1902(a)(68) will be made by January 1 of each subsequent year, based upon the amount of payments an entity either received or made under the State Plan during the preceding Federal fiscal year. TN No. 07-004 Approval Date May 25, 2007 Effective Date January 1, 2007 Supersedes TN No. NEW 79y.2 State: Nevada b. An \"employee\" includes any officer or employee of the entity. c. A \"contractor\" or \"agent\" includes any contractor, subcontractor, agent, or other person which or who, on behalf of the entity, furnishes, or otherwise authorizes the furnishing of, Medicaid health care items or services, performs billing or coding functions, or is involved in the monitoring of health care provided by the entity. 2. The entity must establish and disseminate written policies which must also be adopted by its contractors or agents. Written policies may be on paper or in electronic form, but must be readily available to all employees, contractors, or agents. The entity need not create an employee handbook if none already exists. 3. An entity shall esta blish written policies for all employees (including management), and of any contractor or agent of the entity, that include detailed information about the False Claims Act and the other provisions named in section 1902(a)(68)(A). The entity shall include i n those written policies detailed information about the entity's policies and procedures for detecting and preventing waste, fraud, and abuse. The entity shall also include in any employee handbook a specific discussion of the laws described in the written policies, the rights of employees to be protected as whistleblowers and a specific discussion of the entity's policies and procedures for detecting and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. 4. The requirements of this law should be incorporated into each Stat e's provider enrollment agreements. 5. The State will implement this State Plan amendment on January 1, 2007. b.
