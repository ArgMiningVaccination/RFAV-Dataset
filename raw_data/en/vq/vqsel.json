The use of DTP vaccine to prevent the corresponding illnesses is essential. The cost of losing 84% extra lives to achieve this is totally unacceptable. The introduction of the earlier use of DTP vaccine was precisely to save lives. This is clearly not happening. The study coincides with the use of the accelerated scheme which dates back to May 1990 in the UK and presumably is the same for this country? The death of 4% of a nations children due to the use of a vaccine to save life is nothing short of a major catastrophe. The only other case which immediately comes to mind is the 2% deformity rate due to the use of thalidomide back in circa 1961. An immediate connection then comes to mind. In the thalidomide case and in respect of tetanus, (also diphtheria) a toxic compound is at the heart of the problem. The solution here is easier, however - we need to look at the purity of the vaccine, the age of infant, the amount used, the strength, be more careful about possible adverse reactions, where it is administered (can it enter the bloodstream rather than beneath the skin and with what result) and so on. The use of the DTP vaccine could also by analogy easily explain the daily death rate put down to cot death in the UK? The amount of tetanus toxin to cause death is microscopically small compared to the 0.5 gram injection commonly used. The time to cause death is never immediate and may be 5 hours or as long as three or four days. the link is therefore denied. Because we assume or accept Cot Death or put mothers in jail for murder are we missing a similar response to UK DTP vaccination? The same vaccine used on teenage children in the UK caused over 90% adverse reactions with systemic symptoms including difficulty in getting breath, when administered in the 1990s. This research again answers the simple question: are toxic chemicals toxic to life. The answer is clear: Toxic chemicals are indeed clearly toxic. When will we realise this and take appropriate care and control? John Fryer Analytical Chemist Competing interests: No competing interests Dear Sir - The findings of Kristensen et al's study(1) fall into place if there is a preexisting Th1 weakness / Th2 predominance of immune response in the community. That there is such a pre-existing condition in many parts of Africa is supported by the remarkable susceptibility to tuberculosis, measles, and HIV infection, all of which depend on a good Th1 response for successful resistance. BCG and measles vaccine, by stimulating a swing toward Th1 response, may in fact be returning the immune system to a relatively normal balance; diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and polio vaccination stimulate a Th2 response, and may swing the immune system further away from the ideal balance, and inhibit a good Th1 response. Dietary reasons why this preconditioning may exist have been put forward. In an otherwise deficient diet, heavy dependence on maize geographically parallels high incidence of diseases which should be resisted by the cellular immune response. A maize dependent diet is weighted so strongly with n-6 fatty acids that an excessive output of Prostaglandin E2 will occur unless there is also an adequate intake of other fats. Prostaglandin E2 is a suppressor of Th1 function (2). Children with kwashiorkor, an extreme example of what is usually a maize- diet malnutrition, have been described as having a \"nutritional thymectomy\"(3), and may have no demonstrable cellular immune response to tuberculin during the acute phase of their illness. Our understanding of potential control of the immune response is accumulating, and Kristensen et al's paper has taken us a tentative step forward.

Arch Dis Child 1975; 149-52 Competing interests: competing interests Both Tedd Koren and John P. Heptonstall did not understand our statements that \"Mortality was lower in the group vaccinated with any vaccine compared with those not vaccinated...However, recipients of one dose of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis or polio vaccines had higher mortality than children who had received none of these vaccines\". Note that we wrote \"none of these vaccines\" rather than \"no vaccine\". Because virtually all children having received diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio vaccines had already received BCG (see Table 4), the statement implies that among children who had received BCG, those who had been vaccinated with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio vaccines had a higher mortality than those who had received only BCG. The trend was the same among the few children who had received diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis and polio vaccines but not BCG. However, the main effect was among children who had already received BCG as also pointed out in Paul Fine's commentary. Both Tedd Koren and the paper emphasised the possible selection biases which may have influenced the mortality ratios between vaccinated and unvaccinated children: these include better contact with the health care system, and restriction of BCG vaccination to children with normal birth weight. However, it is difficult to understand how selection bias would work differently for different vaccines. If one believes that mothers complying with the vaccination programme have children with lower mortality, the beneficial effect of BCG and measles may have been overestimated whereas the harmful effect of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio vaccines would have been underestimated. Conversely, if one believes that sick children are more likely to be vaccinated when their mothers bring them to a health centre, the beneficial effect of BCG and measles would have been underestimated and the harmful effect of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis and polio vaccines overestimated. While we discussed the likelihood of these interpretations in the paper, the main point was that the estimated effects of different vaccines went in different directions, and that the non-specific effects of the vaccines are therefore likely to be important. Only further research can clarify the relative importance of the different vaccines. Children were not given vitamin A at the time they were immunised against measles. Vitamin A has not been used for general supplementation in Guinea-Bissau until the recent war in 1998-1999 (1). John Heptonstall, Liratsopulos Georgios et al, and Lorna Barton et al. raised questions about the causes of deaths. Virtually all the children died from infectious disease, which presented with fever, malaria, convulsions, diarrhoea, oedema, inflammation, malnutrition, vomiting, cough, respiratory problems, tetanus, measles, or contaminated maternal milk (that is the mother had broken the taboo against having sexual relations while breastfeeding). Only one death may have been due to an accident (burns). However, it should be recognised that the vast majority were recorded only as having fever, so the precise cause of death is unclear in most cases. As pointed out by Dr. Georgios et al, we have done verbal autopsies for women of fertile age (2). It is, however, quite a different matter to do verbal autopsies for child deaths in an animistic culture, where many child deaths will be ascribed to malevolent spirits. It is impolite to recall the death of a child in the presence of the mother. It might have been possible to obtain better retrospective information on the sequence of events leading to a child's death using a medically qualified interviewer. However, such a study would be offensive to the mothers, and would not provide definitive information about the causes of death. The study was large and complex and many potential details have not been adequately covered even in the long version of the paper. Several readers raised questions about the follow up, including John Heptonstall and Liratsopulos Georgios et al. It is noted that 686 children had died before the first visit, and that these deaths constitute such a large proportion of the deaths in the study that the conclusions of the paper are questionable. We have probably assumed too much familiarity with mortality patterns in developing countries. We had indicated that there were 437 stillbirths in the cohort, and one would normally expect a similar number of neonatal deaths in a developing country. In the present study there were 525 neonatal deaths few of which could have been affected by immunisations, since most neonatal deaths occur on the day of birth. The remaining 161 infant deaths occurred before we visited the village. Using a Cox proportional hazard model and adjusting for cluster as in the paper, the mortality rate ratio between 1 and 6 months of age was 0.88 (0.69-1.12) for children not yet visited for the first time compared with mortality following the first visit. Liratsopulos Georgios et al are saying \"Not accounting for the likely differential effect of the vaccination status of these 686 children introduces selection bias..\" It is not clear to us what differential effect there would be, and how it would introduce a selection bias. It may be appropriate to look at the study in the following way: Since all pregnancies were registered, we have been able to report on total perinatal mortality in the cohort. However, for immunization status we could only use the information collected at the 6-monthly visits. The visits can be seen as randomly distributed semi- annual events where we recruited the children alive at the visit. By the nature of this design, we would lose around 50% of the follow up time for children between 1 and 6 months of age, and it is therefore not surprising that many deaths occurred before we visited the village. For this procedure to introduce a bias, there should be differential mortality of vaccinated and unvaccinated children prior to the visit where the children were recruited for the vaccine analysis, e.g. that frail children died more quickly in the unvaccinated group, producing a higher proportion of frail children in the vaccinated group. A similar pattern could have produced higher mortality in the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccinated group. If that were the case in the present analysis, the difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated children should increase with age at recruitment, as the selection process had had longer time to produce an effect. The trend was actually in the opposite direction as can be seen from Table 4 in the paper. Furthermore, we are unable to understand how a selection bias related to inclusion-non-inclusion of certain children could produce a beneficial effect for BCG but a negative effect for diptheria, tetatnus, pertussis and polio vaccines. Lorna Barton et al emphasise that we stated that the study initially recruited 10,000 women, but that 15,351 were included in the analysis. As explained in greater detail elsewhere (2), at each 6-monthly visit we included young girls as they reached fertile age, as well as women moving to the compound. There is no contradiction between the statements on \"no loss to follow up\" and \"information was unavailable\", as \"no loss to follow up\" refers to information about survival status, whereas \"information was unavailable\" refers to vaccinations received between the first and the second visits for children who had died, or moved or were not present at the second visit. John Heptonstall suggests that we may have made \"subtle diversions, calculated measures to limit the impact of the real findings\". That was certainly not intended. As all totally unexpected observations, the study was not planned to prevent the major sources of potential bias. Therefore, a single study cannot be conclusive. The important test of unexpected observations is to see whether they are repeatable in subsequent studies - and that is certainly the case with our findings.

Maternal mortality in Guinea-Bissau: the use of verbal autopsy in a multi-ethnic population. Int J Epidemiol 1999;28:70-76 Competing interests: No competing interests In our study in Bissau, we found that different vaccines had opposite effects on mortality: BCG and measles vaccines reduced mortality, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and polio vaccines increased mortality. It would not have been ethical for us to randomise children to receive vaccine or placebo, so we had to perform a cohort study rather than a controlled trial. Hence, as we stated in the Discussion section of the paper, it is not possible to give precise estimates of the effect of the individual vaccines on mortality. We were therefore surprised that Professor Fine concluded that our study lacked the classical attributes of causality: gradient, strength, and coherence (2). As should be evident from the conclusion of the Abstract, we did not claim that our study had these attributes for each vaccine - our main conclusion was that the observed effects of the vaccines are unlikely to have been caused by confounding because selection bias should not produce opposite mortality trends for different vaccines. The strength of these trends should be the subject of future studies. Prof Fine gives several reasons for claiming lack of gradient, strength, and coherence. Firstly, the estimates only just reach conventional statistical significance. However, significance for each vaccine was not the focus of the paper. The important finding was that the trends in mortality were in opposite directions for BCG on the one hand, and DTP-polio on the other (see Table 3 in reference 1) - with the difference in trends being significant (p=0.005). Secondly, Prof Fine suggests that the association of BCG and measles vaccines with reduced mortality was surprising, and that it may have occurred because the mothers of vaccinated children make greater use of health services. He also suggested that the association of DTP with increased mortality could be due to DTP coverage being higher in the children of young mothers (who have increased mortality). In fact, Prof Fine should not have been surprised at these findings, as they have all been reported before: numerous studies have found that measles vaccine reduces mortality from diseases other than measles (3), BCG was found to be associated with reduced mortality from pneumonia in 1992 (4), and the association of DTP with increased mortality was reported in 1991 and 1995 (3,5). As stated in the paper, adjustment for the background factors listed in Table 2 had minimal effect on the estimates for the effect of the vaccines (1). Given the low prevalence of young mothers (Table 2), it is not surprising that the small increase in DTP coverage in the children of young mothers has only a trivial effect: the mortality rate ratio estimates for BCG, one dose of DTP, and two or more doses of DTP presented in the paper were 0.55 (0.36 to 0.85), 1.84 (1.10 to 3.10), and 1.38 (0.73 to 2.61), respectively; adjustment for mother's age gave estimates of 0.54 (0.35 to 0.84), 1.82 (1.08 to 3.07), and 1.37 (0.72 to 2.59), respectively. Thirdly, Prof Fine considers that the results are anomalous because mortality declines with age in BCG unvaccinated children, but increases with age among vaccinated children. This is true in Table 3, which compares BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated children, but not in Table 5, where mortality is declining with age for both measles-vaccinated and unvaccinated children (1). These findings are understandable if exposure to DTP does increase mortality. As seen in Table A, among children who survived to the second visit, exposure time to DTP and the number of DTP doses increased markedly with age in the BCG vaccinated group, whereas there was little change in the exposure time to DTP or number of DTP doses for children who had not received BCG prior to the first visit. The explanation for these patterns is presumably that children who have reached several months of age without receiving BCG are less likely to have contact with the health system, and are therefore less likely to receive additional doses of DTP during follow-up. On the other hand, when children have received BCG vaccine, the older they become, the longer they have had to be exposed to DTP. | | Fourthly, Professor Fine finds it strange that the effect associated with one dose of DTP is not significant for two or three doses. Because fewer children received two or more doses of DTP, it is not surprising that the effect is not significant in these children. However, Prof Fine is presumably emphasising that the estimate of 1.84 (1.10 to 3.10) for one dose of DTP declined to 1.38 (0.73 to 2.61) for two or more doses of DTP - but the difference between these two estimates is not statistically significant (p=0.250). We did not discuss this issue because the main point of the paper was that BCG and measles vaccines on the one hand, and DTP-polio on the other hand, have opposite effects on mortality. However, we did mention in the Discussion that the mortality estimates were conservative due to interference from subsequent vaccinations during the period of follow-up (1). The children who received two or more doses of DTP were much more likely to receive measles vaccine before or during follow-up (51% - among children who survived to the second visit) than children who received only one dose of DTP (28%) or no DTP (13%). If follow-up is censored at 9 months of age to minimize the effect of interference from subsequent measles vaccinations, there is minimal difference between the estimates for one dose of DTP (mortality ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.00-3.26) versus two or more doses of DTP (mortality ratio 1.75, 95% CI 0.86-3.59). Although we did not claim this in the paper, the non-specific effects of DTP-polio vaccination may well have had gradient, strength, and coherence in our study (1). As pointed out by Prof Fine, the DTP-polio effect was mainly measured among children who had already received BCG - this is to be expected in a developing country, where virtually all children get BCG as their first vaccine. We readily agree that a single study is not convincing, and that further studies of the non-specific effects of vaccines are needed - and this point was emphasized in the paper (1). It will be particularly important to see what happens when DTP- polio is used among children who have not received BCG.

Int J Epidemiol 1991;20:474-79 Competing interests: No competing interests Dear Editor, To my mind, Paul Fine's (1) comment of \"not convincing\" at the findings of Kristensen et al is not in good taste in epidemiologic parlance. Nonetheless, he tried to analyze the validity of the associations examined in the article as well as commented at the \"causality\" of such associations.Making judgments about causality from epidemiologic data involves a chain of logic. The \"classic\" attributes of causality cited by Fine are mere \"guidelines\". In epidemiologic research, causation must always remain a matter of belief or judgment based on those guidelines. Such a judgment can only be made in the context of all evidence \"available at that moment\". Since what is considered \"bilogically plausible\" at any given time depends on the current state of knowledge, the lack of a known or postulated biologic mechanism as pointed out by Fine does not necessarily mean that a particular relationship is not causal. Examples may be cited to demonstrate that epidemiologic observations have sometimes preceded biologic knowledge as most of the epidemiologists of today are aware of. Thus, there must often come a point at which it becomes prudent to act on the premise that a causal relationship exists rather than await further evidence, which necessarily does not happen. In fact, acting on the judgment of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a cause-effect relationship may well precede by years a complete understanding of the disease or its biologic mechanism. To conclude, Bradford Hill, who cautioned: \"All scientific work is incomplete- whether it be observational or experimental. All scientific work is liable to be upset or modified by advancing knowledge. This does not confer upon us a freedom to ignore the knowledge we already have, or to postpone the action that it appears to demand at a given time. Who knows, asked Robert Browning, but that the world may end tonight? True, but on available evidence most of us make ready to commute on the 8.30 next day.\" (2) Regards, Zubair Kabir References: 1.

No competing interests Competing interests: No competing interests Dear Editor I fully agree with Lisa (1) regarding the side-effects of vaccines such as autism occurring to a negligible proportions of children compared to the whole of child population vaccinated. This reminds me of the article published two years ago in the Lancet, which suggested that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism.(2) The same article was \"blamed\" for reducing the uptake in the United Kingdom from 90.4% to 87.6% as reported earlier.(3) The Irish National Disease Surveillance Centre today (the 4th of Jan) in its webpage said that 1597 cases of measles have been reported till 23rd of December 2000.(4) The Centre cannot say, however, whether the MMR vaccine uptake rate in Ireland has been influenced by the Lancet article. Nevertheless, parents in Ireland have been influenced by the \"Best\" case. The Supreme Court found in 1992 that Kenneth Best, a severely brain damaged adult, was affected by being given a dose from a toxic batch of pertussis vaccine. As a public health specialist, I believe that articles published such as Kristensen et al(5) should be interpreted with caution to reinforce faith in the general public. Further studies examining cause-effect relationship and measuring the strength of associations such as population attributable risk percent between vaccination and child survival in the populations are necessary before drawing such conclusions.

Competing interests: No competing interests Editor, Kristensen et al.'s (1) prospective cohort study of the effect of childhood vaccinations on survival could have significant implications on future immunisation programmes in developing countries. The conclusion that \"recipients of one dose of DTP or polio vaccines have higher mortality than children who receive none of the vaccines\" appears alarming but should be approached with caution. We concur with the comments already made on the lack of comparability of the study groups, (2) the complexity of the methodology (3) and the small numbers involved in some groups. (4) We noticed a significant discrepancy in the number of women recruited for the study, which is stated as 10,000 in the introduction and methods and 15,351 in the abstract and results. Further contradiction lies in the two statements:\"...there was no loss to follow up because it was always possible to get information on all children from relatives...\" and \"...information was unavailable for children who moved, died, or were travelling...\". Such lack of clarity leads to further doubt over the actual numbers involved in the study. The causes of death are never discussed, as touched upon by Liratsopulos, G. (3). This is presumably due to such information being unavailable in Guinea-Bissau. Knowledge of this would add further dimension to results already drawn. Congenital diseases and accidents, for example, could be completely unrelated to the unspecific effects of vaccines. Despite issues raised here and by others, the study's objectives were both original and worthwhile and its conclusions open doors for further research.

[http://www.BMJ.com](http://www.BMJ.com). interests: No competing interests Editor-In Guinea-Bissau, Kristensen et al.(1) followed up young children to determine rates of mortality associated with administration of BCG, DTP, polio and measles vaccines. A combined analysis for any vaccine, or BCG or measles vaccine was associated with lower mortality, compared with children not given these vaccinations. However, DTP or polio vaccines were found to increase mortality. Out of 10298 (see extended e-bmj version) children born alive, 686 children had died by the time that the field visits took place and so were not included in the study. This means that 6.6% of the total cohort of children (accounting for 49% of the total of 1438 deaths observed) were excluded from the analysis. As BCG, polio and DTP vaccines are scheduled to be given from birth and up to the age of 14 weeks, some (but not all) of these 686 children would have had at least one of these vaccinations. Not accounting for the likely differential effect of the vaccination status of these 686 children introduces selection bias and makes it difficult to reach firm conclusions from this study. Furthermore, no information is provided about the cause of death in children who died during the follow up period. This information can help to substantiate or refute the hypothesis that administration of, for example, DTP is associated with increased mortality. Although definitive diagnoses are unlikely to have been possible in the setting of the study, a syndromic categorisation of death causes (for example, \"diarrhoeal\" or \"febrile illness\", \"acute respiratory infection\") with which primary health care workers in developing countries are familiar would have been possible. This is particularly the case since the investigators are experienced with the \"verbal autopsy\" technique, which they used to ascertain cause of mortality of maternal deaths among the same cohort of mother-child pairs(2). We argue that the methodological problems we have raised make the correct interpretation of the study findings problematic but would welcome future robust research about the likely non-specific effects of vaccination.

Maternal mortality in Guineal- Bissau: the use of verbal autopsy in a multi-ethnic population. Competing interests: No competing interests For many years I have trawled through vast amounts of data on each and every child assessment I undertake. It took very little time before I realised that a small percentage of children had been affected by vaccine. In some cases the effect was dramatic and immediate. In others a gradual falling away of communication skills and an emergence, in some cases, of bowel problems. In a few startling cases video evidence showed a perfectly normal child the day before the vaccination - never to return. If a child swallows a noxious substance and then falls over or is sick, we would not dismiss the most obvious event which had just occurred as being possibly linked with the child's behaviour. In the children with autism who appear to have regressed and /or developed allergies and bowel problems after the vaccination, it was also clear that those children had been medically vulnerable children before the vaccine and /or children with allergies, say, to dairy products. There has been a vast increase in numbers of children with such presenting problems since the MMR, in particular, was introduced, but it is likely that these children are few in number compared to the whole child population who have been vaccinated, my heightened awareness more likely given that I specialise in autism. An open an honest approach by the Government would be far less likely to jeopardise the vaccination programme than ignoring what is a very real and increasingly obvious problem for many desperate families who have `lost ` their children to autism after vaccine. Recognising which children are vulnerable, whether the triple vaccine is actually viable and whether it is necessary to have 3 shots which could compromise the immune system just at the point in time when a child is developing a complex tapestry of cognitive skills, are surely reasonable questions to raise in a civilised society?
