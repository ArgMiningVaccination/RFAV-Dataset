Also, it's both effective and well-tolerated and is considered the first-line treatment of [diabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/introduction-to-diabetes/), as per the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Generally, Metformin does not create a problem for diabetic patients if they eat mindfully. But still, there are certain foods to avoid while taking metformin to ensure optimum effects and no complications. Read this article to learn about foods to avoid while taking metformin. What is Metformin? [Metformin](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/metformin-500-mg-tablets-diabetes-medicine) 500 mg Tablet is a drug recommended for treating Type 2 diabetes, [prediabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/prediabetes-a-warning-signal-to-avoid-diabetes/), and insulin resistance. Of the above 30 million diabetics, 90 to 95% of them have Type 2 diabetes, according to the CDC. Metformin belongs to the class of medications called biguanides, which are drugs that prevent the liver from forming sugar. Metformin also reduces the amount of sugar the body absorbs from the food a person consumes and improves the body's response to insulin.

Below are some types of foods not to eat while taking Metformin: Fats Trans fats and saturated fats should be avoided while on metformin due to their potential negative impact on cardiovascular health. Trans fats, often found in processed and fried foods, can raise bad cholesterol levels and increase heart disease risk. Saturated fats, commonly in red meat and full-fat dairy, can also raise bad cholesterol. Since metformin is used to manage conditions like diabetes, maintaining cardiovascular health is crucial, making it advisable to limit these unhealthy fats for overall well-being. Also Read: [Metformin Side Effects: Common, Severe and Long Term] Simple And Refined Carbohydrates When we eat simple and refined carbohydrates, like sugary foods and white bread, our body quickly turns them into sugar. This sugar rushes into our bloodstream, causing our [blood sugar levels](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/what-is-normal-blood-sugar-level/) to rise rapidly. Now, metformin is a medicine that helps keep our blood sugar levels steady, which is important, especially for [people with diabetes](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/exercises-for-people-with-diabetes/). But when we eat too many sugary and starchy foods, our blood sugar goes up a lot, and metformin might have a harder time controlling it. It's like trying to stop a car that's going really fast - it becomes more challenging. So, by avoiding too many of these fast-acting carbs, we're helping metformin do its job better. We're making sure our blood sugar levels stay in a safe and steady range, which is good for our health, especially if we're taking metformin to manage conditions like diabetes. High Fiber Foods There are some extremely [high-fiber foods](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/10-fibre-rich-foods-for-diabetes-diet/) in the list of foods not to eat while taking Metformin. Consuming fiber in diabetes is generally a good idea as it slows down how fast sugar gets into our blood. But it's not really good if not consumed in moderation along with medicines like metformin. Fiber is thought to absorb certain medicines and reduce their concentration in the bloodstream. If a person consumes huge quantities of fiber, the levels of Metformin might reduce. Keep the consumption of fibers below 30 grams per day. Also Read: [Normal Sugar Level For Women] Sodium Another type of foods to avoid while taking metformin also include sodium. Avoiding excess sodium while on metformin is recommended due to potential interactions with blood pressure regulation. High sodium intake can elevate [blood pressure](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/6-simple-exercises-to-regulate-your-blood-pressure/), and metformin is commonly prescribed to manage conditions like diabetes. Elevated blood pressure could exacerbate cardiovascular risks associated with these conditions. Additionally, excessive sodium might affect kidney function, which is monitored in metformin users. Prioritizing a low-sodium diet supports overall cardiovascular health and complements metformin's benefits in managing blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of complications, and promoting general well-being. A person must avoid consuming an excess of sodium while a person is on Metformin. Keep the intake of sodium below 2300 milligrams per day. Alcohol A person must avoid huge amounts of alcohol since it enhances the risk of developing low blood glucose as well as lactic acidosis. Alcohol is found to prevent the liver from storing and liberating sugar. Since diabetics already struggle to manage blood sugar levels, reducing the risk factor of alcohol intake is worth consideration. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach may result in low blood glucose as the Metformin alcohol reaction can be worse. This is true for individuals using insulin or other anti-diabetes medicines that enhance the levels of insulin. Metformin is found to amplify the quantity of lactate. Lactate is the underlying compound of lactic acid. Research confirms that an excess of alcohol in combination with a thiamine deficiency may give rise to lactate accumulation. Alcohol and Metformin together might cause excessive lactic acid in the blood. This may result in a severe condition, lactic acidosis. Overall, drinking in moderation is safe. Safe levels are one drink per day for females as well as 2 [drinks](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/know-about-energy-drinks-safe-for-diabetics/) per day for males. Also Read: [Metformin Oral: Uses, Side Effects, Dosage & Interactions] Grapefruit One study explored the [grapefruit](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/is-grapefruit-safe-for-people-with-diabetes/) effects on Metformin. Researchers found that the participants who had both Metformin and [grapefruit](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/is-grapefruit-safe-for-people-with-diabetes/) juice had a higher quantity of production of lactic acid as compared to the participants who had just Metformin. They might also have more weight gain. It was also established that grapefruit juice enhanced the build-up of metformin in the liver. This then brought up an increase in lactic acid production. It was also concluded from the studies that drinking grapefruit juice may result in a greater risk of lactic acidosis in patients consuming Metformin. Low-Carb Fruits Incorporating low-carb fruits into your diet alongside metformin is advantageous due to their minimal impact on blood sugar levels. These fruits, like berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), apples, pears, cherries, and kiwi, are rich in fiber and nutrients, causing gradual sugar release. This aids in maintaining stable glucose levels, which is particularly important for individuals using metformin to manage diabetes or PCOS. The fiber content slows sugar absorption, reducing the risk of blood sugar spikes. Opting for low-carb fruits supports overall glucose control and complements the effects of metformin in regulating blood sugar. Nuts And Seeds Incorporating nuts and seeds into your diet while on metformin offers benefits due to their [low glycemic index](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/what-is-glycemic-index-and-ways-to-calculate-gi-value-of-food-items/) and healthy fats. These foods provide sustained energy, aiding in blood sugar control alongside metformin. Examples like almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds offer fiber, essential nutrients, and omega-3 fatty acids. They help stabilize glucose levels, promoting overall metabolic health. Including nuts and seeds complements metformin's effects by supporting steady [blood sugar levels](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/chart-of-normal-blood-sugar-levels-for-adults-with-diabetes/) and enhancing the medication's efficacy in managing conditions like diabetes or PCOS. Also Read: [Side Effects of Metformin] Foods To Avoid While Taking Metformin For PCOS Women with conditions like PCOS need to be extra cautious about what they eat, especially when they're prescribed medications like Metformin. It's always a good idea to stick to a basic, healthy diet and avoid unnecessary [junk](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/does-junk-food-cause-diabetes/). Here are some specific foods to avoid while taking metformin for PCOS: Alcohol: The first in the list of foods to avoid while taking metformin for [PCOS](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/know-about-pcos-and-its-underlying-symptoms/) is alcohol. Drinking alcohol can make your blood sugar go down. If you drink too much with metformin, it might drop even more. If you want a drink while using metformin for PCOS, just have one per day, not more. Drinking more during PCOS can lead to metformin alcohol reaction. Sugary Drinks: Drinks like soda, sweet teas, and energy drinks have lots of sugar that can quickly make your blood sugar go up. If your body has trouble with insulin (a hormone), like in PCOS, it's smart to skip these drinks. This way, metformin can do its job better and help fix the insulin issue. Added Sugar Foods: Foods with lots of extra sugar can make insulin issues and PCOS problems worse. Doctors say it's best to keep your added sugar under 25 grams per day. Refined Grains: Refined grains are another addition to the list of foods to avoid while taking metformin for PCOS. Some grains lose the good stuff like nutrients and fiber, and these grains can quickly raise your blood sugar. If you're taking metformin for PCOS, it's wise to avoid these grains. Fried Foods: If your tummy feels funny with metformin, fried foods might be the reason. Cutting down on them could help. Plus, it might help with weight, which can make insulin work better and improve PCOS symptoms. Excess Salt: Having diabetes can make heart problems more likely. People worldwide often eat too much salt, which can raise blood pressure. It's wise to aim for 2,300 mg of salt or less every day. This helps keep your heart and blood pressure in a healthier range.

It remains unprocessed by a person's body and removed in the form of urine. A study discussed the effects of grapefruit with Metformin in non-diabetic people. Few people were exposed to grapefruit juice as well as Metformin. Others were exposed to only Metformin. It was found that there was an increase in the amount of production of lactic acid in the people who were exposed to Metformin as well as grapefruit juice. It was guessed that grapefruit juice increased the build-up of Metformin in the liver. This, sequentially, brought about an increase in lactic acid production. It is suggested that drinking grapefruit juice may cause an enhanced risk of lactic acidosis in people having Metformin.

This is a problem for diabetics as their bodies already fight to manage blood sugar. Furthermore, drinking alcohol on an empty stomach might bring about low blood sugar ( [hypoglycemia](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/management-of-hypoglycemia/)). This alcohol-associated complication is more common in individuals using insulin or diabetes medicines that enhance insulin levels. Metformin does not enhance insulin levels. Hence, alcohol-induced [hypoglycemia](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/management-of-hypoglycemia/) is less expected to take place in individuals who take it. Also Read: [Metformin Oral: Uses, Side Effects, Dosage & Interactions] Metformin-Related Lactic Acidosis When the body utilizes sugar as energy, lactic acid gets released. Metformin enhances the amount of lactate, the basic compound present in lactic acid in the bloodstream. This is classically a benign effect, however, as per a research study, an excessive intake of alcohol in addition to a thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency might lead to the accumulation of lactate. This combination of Metformin and alcohol might bring about an excess of lactic acid in the blood, a deadly condition that might give rise to lactic acidosis, in individuals having acute or chronic alcohol abuse. Metformin-related lactic acidosis (MALA) occurs rarely however, and is possibly dangerous. While the risk of lactic acidosis for diabetic people is low, his or her risk is greater if a person has congestive heart failure or impaired liver or kidney function. If a person is using Metformin, they must drink alcohol in moderation. \"Moderation\" signifies: - One drink per day for females - Males above 65 years of age - Two [drinks](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/know-about-energy-drinks-safe-for-diabetics/)per day for males below the age of 65 years. However, discussing the intake of alcohol with a healthcare provider as a no-alcohol lifestyle can be healthiest for him or her. Book your consultation with a Diabetes expert now.

Always consult a healthcare professional before making any changes to your medication regimen. Contrast Agents: If you're having a medical procedure that involves contrast agents for imaging, such as a CT scan with contrast dye, your doctor might advise temporarily stopping metformin. This is to prevent a rare condition called lactic acidosis, although the risk is low. Alcohol: Excessive alcohol consumption can affect blood sugar levels and metabolism, potentially interacting with metformin. Moderation is key, but it's best to consult your doctor about alcohol use while on metformin. Certain Blood Pressure Medications: Some medications for high blood pressure, like beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, might affect blood sugar levels. Your doctor can help you manage these medications alongside metformin. Some Diuretics: Certain diuretics (water pills) could impact kidney function and potentially interact with metformin. Close monitoring is important if you're prescribed both types of medications. Cimetidine (Tagamet): This medication, used for acid reflux and ulcers, can slow down metformin's removal from the body, possibly leading to higher metformin levels. Your doctor might adjust your metformin dosage if you need to take cimetidine. Also Read: [Vildagliptin and Metformin & Uses, Side Effects, & Certain Antidepressants: Some antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might influence blood sugar levels and interact with metformin. Discuss potential interactions with your doctor. Medications Impacting Kidney Function: Since metformin is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, medications that affect kidney function might impact metformin's safety and effectiveness. Always inform your doctor about any kidney-related medications. Other Diabetes Medications: Combining multiple diabetes medications, including different types of oral medications or insulin, should be done under medical supervision to avoid adverse interactions. Iron [Supplements](https://www.breathewellbeing.in/blog/best-vitamins-and-supplements-for-diabetes/): Taking iron supplements alongside metformin might decrease the absorption of both substances.
