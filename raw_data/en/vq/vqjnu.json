Our immune system is quite complex. Sound vibrations and sound therapy has an affect on our immune system which contains millions of white cells and protein, defending our body against, illness, sickness, disease or viruses. It is vitally important the we keep our immune system working at its peak performance. The immune system works away 'behind the scenes' and operates automatically to find, destroy and discard microbes, germs, antigens or other foreign substances that it recognises as alien to the health and well-being of our body. When our immune system is low or not operating efficiently, this can lead to autoimmune disorders, immune deficiencies and allergic conditions and diseases. At one time during a visual computer-based blood test, I had the opportunity to visually see this in action. When greatly magnified thousands of times, it is possible to watch these hard-working immune cells as they hurried around and found and discarded the alien microbes.

How is sound healing related to the immune system? The latest pilot research shows that low sound wave frequencies can help lower cortisol. Frequencies between 40Hz to 115Hz diminishes hematic cortisol concentration in 86% of those tested. This was based on volunteer feedback where the preferred frequencies were low frequencies as listeners being tested responded to the physical properties of sound-waves. Research further suggests that sound vibration and using your own voice for singing, chanting or humming produces vibrations throughout the body which can help to reduce adrenaline and cortisol which in turn can assist the immune system by reducing stress and anxiety. When our immune system is high, strong and working effectively we have more protection against, illness, sickness, disease and viruses.
