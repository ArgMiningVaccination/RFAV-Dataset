Last Revised: January 11, 2023 3 Note: On December 15, 2022, the California Occupational Safety and Health (\"Cal/OSHA\") Standards Board adopted non -emergency regulations to address COVID -19 exposure in the workplace. These regulations follow Cal/OSHA's emergency temporary standard (\"ETS\"), which will expire once the new regulations go into effect sometime in January 2023 (upon the approval of Office of Administrative Law). Upon their effective date, the regulations will remain effective for two years, except for recordkeeping requirements that will remain in effect for t hree years. Authority and Responsibility The Office of Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) has overall authority and responsibility for implementing the provisions of this CPP in our workplace. In addition, all managers and supervisors are responsible for implementing and maintaining the CPP in their assigned work areas and for ensuring employe es receive answers to questions about the program in a language they understand. All employees are responsible for using safe work practices, following all directives, policies and procedures, and assisting in maintaining a safe work environment. Identific ation and Evaluation of COVID -19 Hazards We implement the following in our workplace: Conduct workplace -specific evaluations to identify COVID -19 hazards in campus buildings, department spaces, offices, and other areas where employees work. Department man agers shall evaluate hazards in areas under their specific control. Appendix A: Identification of COVID -19 Hazards may be used to evaluate the workplace, or the department may draft other written guidance to communicate h azards to employees. Document the vaccination status of our employees by using the University Health Services (UHS) eTang application at etang.berkeley.edu where employees upload their vaccination information. We also use the People Cards system where managers and supervisors can view employee clearances. Evaluate employees' potential workplace exposures to all persons at, or who may enter, our workplace. Develop COVID -19 policies and procedures to respond effectively and immediately to individuals at the workplace who are a COVID -19 case to prevent or reduce the risk of transmission in the workplace. The most up to date information on our campus policies and procedures are found at the following sites: coronavirus.berkeley.edu ehs.berkeley.edu/covid -19 uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/health -information Review applicable orders and general and industry -specific guidance from the State of California, Cal/OSHA, and the local health department related to COVID -19 hazards and prevention. Evaluate existing COVID -19 prevention controls in our workplace and the need for different or additional controls.

Last Revised: January 11, 2023 4 Conduct periodic inspections using the COVID -19 Inspection form (a Google Form), and the Risk & Safety Solutions Inspe ct App . Use the Appendix B: COVID -19 Inspections form as needed to identify and evaluate unhealthy conditions, work practices, and work procedures related to COVID -19 and to ensure compliance with our COVID -19 policies and procedures. Employee Participation Employees and their authorized employees' representatives are encouraged to participate in the identification and evaluation of COVID -19 hazards by developing their own department -specific COVID -19 prevention plan, and by: Reviewing safety concerns or hazards with their supervisor Reporting safety concerns or hazards to their supervisor. Concerns may also be sent to EH&S at 510 -642- 3073 or ehs@berkeley.edu . Employee Screening We screen our employees and respond to those with COVID -19 symptoms by: Employees are required to self -assess their symptoms each day before coming to campus. Employees should not come to campus if experiencing any new or unusual symptoms of COVID -19 (not attributed to a previously known medical condition) in the last 24 hours. Refer to the Contact Tracing and Close Exposures webpage for additional guidance. Employees who test positive for COVID -19 are provided instruction for isolation and return to work via individual messaging through the eTang Portal. Healthcar e and Childcare workers are asked to contact Occupational Health at 510 -332-7192. Return to Work guidance is also available online at UHS . Remote workers should contact their primary care clinicians for information about testing and all employees should seek care from their primary care provider for evaluation and treatment if ill. Correction of COVID -19 Hazards COVID -19 hazards are treated like other workp lace injuries or illnesses as addressed in the campus Workplace Safety Program (WSP) . Managers and supervisors have primary responsibility for ensuring safe working conditions and correcting hazards. In the event of a workplace acquired infection, managers or supervisors will submit the Employer's First Report (EFR) through the electronic reporting system used for other injuries/illnesses. The Faculty / Staff Disability Management website provides instructions and a link to the system. EH&S is available for consultation and investigation support. Unsafe or unhealthy work cond itions, practices or procedures related to COVID -19 may be documented using the Appendix B: COVID -19 Inspections form provided in this CPP. Managers and supervisors shall correct hazards in a timely manner based on the s everity of the hazards, and shall follow up to ensure corrective actions have been taken. Contact EH&S for assistance.

Control of COVI D-19 Hazards Face Coverings Up-to-date face covering guidance for campus is available at coronavirus.berkeley.edu/masks . We provide all employees (regardless of vaccination status) with clean, undamaged, NIOSH certified respirators (e.g. N95) for voluntary use when requested. KN95 and other certified masks are no longer eligible as a qualifying voluntary use respirator. Th e face covering distribution schedule is updated regularly and available on the EH&S website . When employees are required to wear face coverings in our workplace, they may remove them under the following conditions: When an employee is alone in a room or a vehicle. While eating or drinking at the workplace, provided employees are at least six feet apart and outside air supply to the area, if indoors, has been maximi zed to the extent feasible. Employees are required to wear respirators in accordance with our respirator program that meets section 5144 requirements. Employees who cannot wear face coverings due to a medical or mental health condition or disability, or wh o are hearing -impaired or communicating with a hearing -impaired wear an effective, non -restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape on the bottom, if their condition permits it. Specific tasks that cannot feasibly be performed with a face co vering. This exception is limited to the time in which such tasks are being performed. Any employee not wearing a required face covering or allowed non -restrictive alternative, will be at least six feet apart from all other persons unless the unmasked employee is tested at least weekly for COVID -19. We will not prevent any employee from wearing a face covering when it is not required unless it would create a safety hazard, such as interfering with the safe operation of equipment, or lab researc h safety. Information regarding the voluntary use of N95 respirators is covered later in this CPP under Personal Protective Equipment . Engineering Controls For indoor locations (using Appendix B where relevant), we identify and evaluate how to maximize, to the extent feasible, ventilation with outdoor air using the highest filtration efficiency compatible with our existing building ventilation systems. We also determine the feasibility of using portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) COVID -19 Prevention Program (CPP) For additional information, visit ehs.berkeley.edu/covid -19 or contact EH&S at (510) 642 -3073 or ehs@berkeley.edu. Last Revised: January 11, 2023 6 filtration units, or other air cleaning systems to improve ventilation, in a manner that does not increase the risk of virus transmission. Each campus building is unique in its ventilation design, and engineering control strategies vary by building. The campus may decide to alter mechanical ventilation system operation in circumstances where the amount of outside air needs to be minimized due to other hazards, such as heat, wildfire smoke, or when t he EPA Air Quality Index is greater than 100 for any pollutant. The campus may also follow applicable orders and guidance from the State of California and the City of Berkeley Health Department related to COVID -19 hazards and prevention, including CDPH's Interim Guidance for Ventilation, Filtration, and Air Quality in Indoor Environments . Hand H ygiene To implement effective hand hygiene procedures, we: Encourage and allow time for employees to wash hands with liquid soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds at hand sinks available in restrooms, break rooms, labs, and other areas where sinks are present and stocked with supplies. Encourage the use of hand sanitizers after washing hands, or as a substitute in the absence of available sinks. The use of hand sanitizers containing methyl alcohol is prohibited. Personal protective equipment (PPE) used to control employees' exposure to COVID -19 We evaluate the need for PPE (such as gloves, goggles, and face shields) as required by section 3380, and provide and ensure use of such PPE as needed. Upon request, we provide face coverings as required by Cal/ OSHA and CDPH. Up -to-date campus guidance on face coverings is available here . Employees shall use N95 respirators in compliance with Cal/OSHA regulations, Title 8, Section 5144(c)(2) which descri bes voluntary use. Such respirators shall not create a hazard for the user. The user shall be medically able to wear the respirator, and shall ensure the respirator is cleaned, stored, and maintained so that its use does not present a health hazard to th e user. Voluntary users of N95s will be provided with information contained in Appendix D to Section 5144 of the regulations in the form of N95 Voluntary Use Training , which describes voluntary use conditions listed here: Respirators are an effective method of protection against designated hazards when properly selected and worn. Respirator use is encouraged even when exposures are below the exposure limit, to provide an additional level of comfort and protection for worker s. However, if a respirator is used improperly or not kept COVID -19 Prevention Program (CPP) For additional information, visit ehs.berkeley.edu/covid -19 or contact EH&S at (510) 642 -3073 or ehs@berkeley.edu. Last Revised: January 11, 2023 7 clean, the respirator itself can become a hazard to the worker. Sometimes, workers may wear respirators to avoid exposures to hazards, even if the amount of hazardous substance does not exceed the limits set by OSHA standards. If your employer provides respirators for your voluntary use, or if you provide your own respirator, you need to take certain precautions to be sure that the respirator itself does not present a hazard. You should do the follo wing: 1. Read and heed all instructions provided by the manufacturer on use, maintenance, cleaning and care, and warnings regarding the respirators limitations. 2. Choose respirators certified for use to protect against the contaminant of concern. NIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, certifies respirators. A label or statement of certification should appear on the respirator or respirator packaging. It will tell you what the respirator is designed for and how much it will protect you. 3. Do not wear your respirator into atmospheres containing contaminants for which your respirator is not designated to protect against. For example, a respirator designed to filter dust particles will not protect you against gases, vapors or very small solid particles of fumes or smoke. 4. Keep track of your respirator so that you do not mistakenly use someone else's respirator We provide and ensure use of respirators in compliance with section 5144 when deemed nece ssary by Cal/OSHA. We also provide and ensure use of eye and respiratory protection when employees are exposed to procedures that may aerosolize potentially infectious material such as saliva or respiratory tract fluids. Testing of Symptomatic & Close Con tact Employees The Cal/OSHA Non -Emergency COVID -19 Prevention regulations define \"Close Contact\" as described below, unless otherwise defined by regulation or order of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), in which case the CDPH definition sha ll apply: 1. In indoor spaces that are 400,000 or fewer cubic feet per floor, a close contact is defined as sharing the same indoor airspace as a COVID -19 case for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a24 -hour period during the COVID -19 case's infect ious period, regardless of the use of face coverings. Note that spaces separated by floor -to-ceiling walls (e.g., offices, suites, break rooms, bathrooms) are considered distinct indoor airspaces. 2. In indoor spaces that are greater than 400,000 cubic feet p er floor, a close contact is defined as being within six feet of the COVID -19 case for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24 -hour period during the COVID -19 case's infectious period, regardless of the use of face coverings. We make COVID -19 te sting available at no cost to employees, regardless of vaccination status, during employees' paid time. Information on testing is available at https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/tes ting-covid -19.

Last Revised: January 11, 2023 8 We are not required to make testing available to \"returned case employees\". A returned case means a COVID -19 case who returned to work pursuant to Return to Work criteria in 3205(c)(10) and did not develop any COVID -19 symptoms after return ing. A person shall only be considered a returned case for 90 days after the initial onset of COVID -19 symptoms or, if the person never developed COVID -19 symptoms, for 90 days after the first positive test. If a period or other than 90 days is required by a CDPH regulation or order, that period shall apply. Investigating and Responding to COVID -19 Cases We have developed effective procedures to investigate COVID -19 cases in high risk settings on campus that include seeking information from our employees re garding COVID -19 cases, close contacts, test results, and onset of symptoms. This is accomplished by using the Appendix C: Investigating COVID -19 Cases form, or via information obtained by UHS Occupational Health and EH&S in the course of investigating employee exposures. We also ensure the following is implemented: Employees that had a close contact are offered COVID -19 testing through UHS at no cost during their working hours, excluding: COVID -19 cases who were allowed to return to work per our return -to-work criteria and have remained free of symptoms for 90 days after the initial onset of symptoms, or for cases who never developed symptoms, for 90 days after the first positive test. The information on benefits described in Training and Instruction, and Exclusion of COVID -19 Cases, below, will be provided to employees. Written notice within one business day of knowledge of a COVID -19 case that people at the worksite may have been exposed to COVID -19. This notice will be provided to all employees (and their authorized representative), at the worksite during the infectious period. These notifications must meet the requirements of Labor Code section 6409.6 (as amended by AB2693), and in a form readily understandable by employees and can be anticipated to be received by the employee. When AB -2693 sunsets on January 1, 2024, if there is no successor statute, then notification of close contacts must be provided \"as soon as possible.\" System for Communicating Our goal is to ensure that we have effective two -way communication with our employees, in a form they can readily understand, and that it includes the following information: Employees should report COVID -19 symptoms to their supervisor, or to Occupational Health, including possible close contacts in the two days before symptom onset. Employees should report COVID -19 hazards to their supervisor, or to EH&S via phone 510 -642-3073 or email ehs@berkeley.edu . Employees can report symptoms, possible close contacts and hazards without fear of reprisal.

Last Revised: January 11, 2023 9 Employees with medical or other conditions that put them at increased risk of severe COVID -19 illness can request accommodations via their supervisor. Employees have access to COVID -19 testing through UHS when testing is required by campus policy, or in the event of a COVID -19 outbreak. The COVID -19 hazards to which employees (including other employers and individuals in contact with our workplace) may be exposed, what is b eing done to control those hazards, and our COVID -19 policies and procedures. Employee confidentiality will be maintained as required. COVID -19 information and updates are provided to employees via CalMessages email and through the coronavirus.berkeley.edu website. Training and Instruction We will provide effective employee training and instruction that includes: Our COVID -19 policies and procedures to protect employees from COVID -19 hazards, and how to participate in the identification and evaluation of COVID -19 hazards. Information regarding COVID -19-related benefits (including mandated sick and vaccination leave) to which the employee may be entitled under applicable federal, state, or local laws. The fact that: COVID -19 is an infectious disease that can be spread through the air. COVID -19 may be transmitted when a person touches a contaminated object and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. An infectious person may have no symptoms. The fact that p articles containing the virus can travel more than six feet, especially indoors, so physical distancing, face coverings, increased ventilation indoors, and respiratory protection decrease the spread of COVID -19 and are most effective when used in combinati on. The right of employees to request a respirator for voluntary use, without fear of retaliation, and our policies for providing the respirators. Employees voluntarily using respirators will be trained according to section 5144(c)(2) requirements: How to properly wear them. How to perform a seal check according to the manufacturer's instructions each time a respirator is worn, and the fact that facial hair can interfere with a seal. The importance of frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 2 0 seconds and using hand sanitizer when employees do not have immediate access to a sink or hand washing facility, and that hand sanitizer does not work if the hands are soiled.

Last Revised: January 11, 2023 10 Proper use of face coverings and the fact that face coverings are not respirat ory protective equipment. Since COVID -19 is an airborne disease, N95s and more protective respirators protect the users from airborne disease, while face coverings primarily protect people around the user. The conditions where face coverings must be worn a t the workplace. Employees can request face coverings and can wear them at work regardless of vaccination status and without fear of retaliation. COVID -19 symptoms, and the importance of obtaining a COVID -19 test and not coming to work if the employee has COVID -19 symptoms. Information on our COVID -19 policies and how to access COVID -19 testing and vaccination, and the fact that vaccination is effective at preventing COVID -19, protecting against both transmission and serious illness or death. COVID -19 train ing will be required of every employee before returning to work. EH&S provides this training at ehs.berkeley.edu/covid19 -training . EH&S maintains the training roster. Exclusion of COVID -19 Cases and Employees who had a Close Contact Where we have a COVID -19 case or close contact in our workplace, we limit transmission by: Ensuring that COVID -19 cases are excluded from the workplace until our return -to-work requirements are met. Information is ava ilable at: uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing -covid -19/what -do-if-test-positive Consulting current CDPH guidance regarding excluding employees that had a cl ose contact from the workplace until our return -to-work criteria have been met.

If the COVID -19 case was part of a distinct group of employees who are not present at the workplace at the same time as other employees, for instance a work crew or shift that does not overlap with another work crew or shift, only employees within that distinct group are part of the expos ed group . C. If the COVID -19 case visited a work location, working area, or a common area at work for less than 15 minutes during the infectious period, and the COVID -19 case was wearing a face covering during the entire visit, other people at the work locat ion, working area, or common area are not part of the exposed group . Note: An exposed group may include the employees of more than one employer. See Labor Code sections 6303 and 6304.1. This addendum will stay in effect until there are no new COVID -19 cases detected in the exposed group for a 14 -day period. COVID -19 Testing We provide COVID -19 testing at no cost to all employees, during paid time, in our exposed group except for: Employees who were not present during the relevant 14 -day period. For COVID -19 returned cases who did not develop symptoms after returning to work pursuant to our return -to- work criteria, no testing is required. COVID -19 testing consists of the following: All employees in our exposed group are immediately tested and then ag ain one week later. Negative COVID -19 test results of employees with COVID -19 exposure will not impact the duration of any quarantine, isolation, or exclusion period required by, or orders issued by the local health department.

Last Revised: January 11, 2023 20 After the first two COVID -19 tests, we continue to provide COVID -19 testing once a week of employees in the exposed group who remain at the workplace, or more frequently if recommended by the local health department, until there are no new COVID -19 cases detected in our workplace for a 14-day period. Employees who had close contacts shall have a negative COVID -19 test taken within three and five days after the close contact, or shall be excluded and follow the return to work requirements starting from the date of the last known contac t. We provide additional testing when deemed necessary by Cal/OSHA. We continue to comply with the applicable elements of our CPP, as well as the following: 1. Employees in the exposed group wear face coverings when indoors, or when outdoors and less than six feet apart (unless one of the face -covering exceptions indicated in our CPP apply). 2. We give notice to employees in the exposed group of their right to request a respirator for voluntary use. 3. We evaluate whether to implement physical distancing of at l east six feet between persons, or where six feet of physical distancing is not feasible, as much distance between persons as is feasible. COVID -19 Investigation, Review, and Hazard Correction We immediately perform a review of potentially relevant COVID -19 policies, procedures, and controls and implement changes as needed to prevent further spread of COVID -19. The investigation and review is documented and includes: Investigation of new or unabated COVID -19 hazards including: Our leave policies and practice s and whether employees are discouraged from remaining home when sick. Our COVID -19 testing policies. Insufficient outdoor air. Insufficient air filtration. Lack of physical distancing. Updating the review: Every thirty days that the outbreak continues. In response to new information or to new or previously unrecognized COVID -19 hazards. When otherwise necessary. Implementing changes to reduce the transmission of COVID -19 based on the investigation and review. We consider: Moving indoor tasks outdoors or ha ving them performed remotely. Increasing outdoor air supply when work is done indoors.

Last Revised: January 11, 2023 21 Improving air filtration. Increasing physical distancing as much as feasible. Requiring respiratory protection in compliance with section 5144. Buildings or structures with mechanical ventilation We will filter recirculated air with Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 13 or higher efficiency filters, if compatible with the ventilation system. If MERV -13 or higher filters are not compatible, we will use f ilters with the highest compatible filtering efficiency. We will also evaluate whether portable or mounted High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration units or other air cleaning systems would reduce the risk of transmission and, if so, implement the ir use to the degree feasible.

Last Revised: January 11, 2023 22 Additional Consideration #2 Major COVID -19 Outbreaks [This addendum is added to the CPP should 20 or more employee COVID -19 cases in an exposed group visit the workplace during the infectious period within a 30 -day period. Reference section 3205.2 for details.] This addendum will stay in effect until there are fewer than three COVID -19 cases detected in our exposed group for a 14-day period. We continue to comply with the Multiple COVID -19 Infections and COVID -19 Outbreaks addendum, except that the COVID -19 testing is required of all employees in the exposed group twice a week, or more frequently if recommended by the local health department. Employees in the exposed group shall be tested or shall be excluded and follow the return to work requirements starting from the date tha t the outbreak begins. In addition to complying with our CPP and Multiple COVID -19 Infections and COVID -19 Outbreaks addendum, we also: Provide employees in the exposed group with respirators for voluntary use in compliance with section 5144(c)(2) and det ermine the need for a respiratory protection program or changes to an existing respiratory protection program under section 5144 to address COVID -19 hazards. Separate by six feet (except where we can demonstrate that six feet of separation is not feasible and there is momentary exposure while persons are in movement) any employees in the exposed group who are not wearing respirators required by us and used in compliance with section 5144. When it is not feasible to maintain a distance of at least six feet, individuals are as far apart as feasible. Use remote work arrangements, density reductions, staggered arrivals/departures/work/break times as feasible to support physical distancing. Evaluate whether to halt some or all operations at the workplace until COVID -19 hazards have been corrected. Report major outbreaks to Cal/OSHA and i mplement any other control measures deemed necessary by Cal/OSHA.

Last Revised: January 11, 2023 23 Additional Consideration #3 COVID -19 Prevention in Employer -Provided Housing [This addendum applies to workers in employer -provided housing. Reference section 3205.3(a) for details.] Assignment of Housing Units We, to the extent feasible, reduce employee exposure to COVID -19 by assigning employee residents to distinct groups and ensure that each group remains separate from other such groups during transportation and work. Shared housing unit assignments are prioritized in the following order: Residents who usually maintain a household together outs ide of work, such as family members, will be housed in the same housing unit without other persons. Residents who work in the same crew or work together at the same workplace will be housed in the same housing unit without other persons. Employees who do n ot usually maintain a common household, work crew, or workplace will be housed in the same housing unit only when no other housing alternatives are feasible. Ventilation We ensure maximization of the quantity and supply of outdoor air and increase filtrati on efficiency to the highest level compatible with the existing ventilation system in housing units. If there is not a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 13 or higher filter in use, portable or mounted HEPA filtration units are used, where feasible, in all sleeping areas in which there are two or more residents. Face Coverings We provide face coverings to all residents and provide information and training to residents on when face coverings should be used in accordance with orders or guidance from CD PH and from the local health department. Screening We encourage residents to report COVID -19 symptoms to the housing director, manager, or to EH&S. COVID -19 Testing We establish, implement, maintain and communicate to residents effective policies and procedures for COVID -19 testing of residents who had a close contact or COVID -19 symptoms. COVID -19 Prevention Program (CPP) For additional information, visit ehs.berkeley.edu/covid -19 or contact EH&S at (510) 642 -3073 or ehs@berkeley.edu. Last Revised: January 11, 2023 24 COVID -19 Cases and Close Contacts We: Effectively quarantine residents who had a close contact from all other residents. Effective quarantine includes providing residents who had a close contact with a private bathroom and sleeping area. Effectively isolate COVID -19 cases from all residents who are not COVID -19 cases. Effective isol ation includes housing COVID -19 cases only with other COVID -19 cases and providing COVID -19 case residents with a sleeping area and bathroom that is not shared by non -COVID -19-case residents. Keep confidential any personal identifying information regarding COVID -19 cases and persons with COVID - 19 symptoms, in accordance with our CPP Investigating and Responding to COVID -19 Cases . End isolation in accordance with our CPP Exclusion of COVID -19 Cases and Return to Work Criteria , and any applicable local or state health officer orders.
