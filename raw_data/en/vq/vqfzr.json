Maria Kuman* Holistic Research Institute, USA *Corresponding Author: Maria Kuman, Holistic Research Institute, USA. Short Communication Received: September 16, 2019; Published: October 10, 2019 The symptoms and manifestation of autism are very similar to the symptoms and manifestation of mercury poisoning claims Bernard Rimland, Director of the Autism Research Institute, who consulted on the movie 'Rain Man'. He also claims that 'mercury is extraordinary toxic in small amounts, but some people are amaz - ingly susceptible to minute amounts of mercury' [1]. Thus, the amount of mercury in the vaccines may not be safe for everybody. This article is about who are these extra-sensitive people. We are not only body. We are body and nonlinear electromag- netic field (NEMF), which we call biofield and photograph with Kirlian photography as aura. Biofield is not the right name for it because everything material is a material body and NEMF [2]. The author had proved with measurements that the crystals NEMF in- fluences the human NEMF and can be used to balance the energy of our body, i.e. to heal [3]. Valerie Hunt [4] studied for many years the human biofield (NEMF). Her research showed that the major frequency of the hu- man NEMF could vary dramatically from individual to individual. The majority of people have NEMF with major frequency 200 Hz. However, people that are clairvoyant have NEMF with major fre- quency between 400 Hz and 800 Hz. People that can travel in other dimensions have NEMF with major frequency between 800 Hz and 900 Hz. Some people can even have NEMF with major frequency thousands of Hz. The higher is the major frequency of the NEMF, the higher is the sensitivity of the individual - emotional sensitivity, stress sensitiv - ity, and drug sensitivity. We said that the majority of people have NEMF with major frequency 200 Hz. What do we mean by major- ity? The answer is 90%. So, what is considered safe amount of mer - cury for the 90% of people may not be safe for the 10% with higher frequency NEMF and higher sensitivity. But let us go step by step. I spent 40 years measuring the weak NEMF. I had to develop sensitive enough equipment to be able to measure it because it is 1,000 times weaker than the biocurrents of the body. I found that this weak NEMF rules and regulates the functioning of all our or - gans. It is doing this with the information it carries, not with its weak currents. Since we don't have awareness for the functioning of our organs, the functioning of our organs is subordinated to the Subconscious.However, all our organs are holographically represented on the surface of the skin: on our palms, feet, ears, and the irises of our eyes. The acupuncturists know that they can treat the points of the sick organ on any of these representations with equal success [5]. Therefore, we have holographic representations of the organs on the surface of the body to tell us that our organs are ruled and regulated on holographic principle [6]. Since we use lasers to cre- ate holographic images and lasers are coherent waves with certain frequency, waves must regulate the functioning of our organs. In 1983, the author predicted with nonlinear mathematical model that each acupuncture treatment must generate electric im- pulse and wave [7]. The theoretically predicted waves were experi- mentally found one year later [8]. It was found that waves propa- gate along he acupuncture meridians all the time, but when a point of the meridian is treated with acupuncture, a wave is generated, which modifies the constantly running waves of our NEMF. Russian scientists investigated Bronnikov, who could see with his mind, and found [9] that he could see 3-dimensional holograph- ic image of the object in front of him (with his mind) when he was blindfolded and there was no signal propagating from his eyes to his brain. Who are the people that can see with their minds? These are the same high-sensitivity people (emotional, stress and drug sensitive) with high major frequency of their NEMF. Thus, if we use on these highly sensitive people vaccines with the same amount of mercury, which we use for low-sensitive peo- ple, the sensitive people will become damaged because the amount of mercury, which the low-sensitive people can tolerate, will be too much for them. And these highly emotional individuals are very in- tuitively creative [10]. So, with the high amount of mercury in our vaccines, we are disabling the most creative people, on whom the fast development of our civilization depends. From hypnosis, which puts the conscious to sleep to access the subconscious, we know that hypnotized people can calculate 10,000 times faster [11]. So, sophisticated quantum computer must operate in the Subconscious with the waves of our NEMF. Since, this is in the Subconscious, we don't have conscious awareness of it. However, the fact that people with high major frequency of their NEMF (400 to 800 Hz) are clairvoyant means that they can Citation: Maria Kuman . \"Who is Becoming 3.11 (2019): 86-87.DOI: 10.31080/ASNH.2019.03.0495Who is Becoming Autistic and Why? 87 use their Quantum Computer, which allows quantum jumps to the future and the past [12]. Also, in the film 'Rain Man', the mentally disabled man (with poorly functioning brain) could predict things or calculate with high speed, which indicate ability to use the Quantum Computer of the Subconscious. Mercury damages the neuronal connections in certain areas of the brain, which is considered to be the basis of the erratic autistic behavior. It damages mostly the emotionally sensi - tive individuals with high sensitivity to drugs, but we should do ev - erything to eliminate or drastically reduce the amount of mercury for all our children. Considering the damage, which mercury can do to the brain, I think the amount of mercury in the vaccines needs to be lowered at least 200 times or totally eliminated. Presently, the total amount of mercury in the vaccines is 200 times more than the amount that is considered safe by the CDC standards. The amount of mercury in the vaccines, which was considered safe, was calculated when the vaccines were 3 to the age of 6 and now they are 22 to the age of 2. The best thing is to find substitute for the mercury because the number of vaccines will continue to grow.
