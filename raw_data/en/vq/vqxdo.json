In support of that demarcation criterion, I evidence the breadth and strength ofmodernity's presupposition of the primacy of science to and for technology by showing itspreposterous hold upon social theorists\u2014Marx, Veblen, Dewey\u2014whose principles logi-cally required the reverse, viz. the primacy of practice; upon 19th and 20th century engi-neers and industrialists, social actors whose practical interests likewise required thereverse; and upon the principal theorizers in the 1970s of the role of science in late 20thcentury technology and society. The reversal in primacy between science and technologyca 1980 came too unexpectedly, too quickly, and, above all, too unreflectively to have resulted from the weight of evidence or the force of logic. Rather, it was a concomitant ofthe onset of postmodernity. Oddly, historians of technology have remained almost whollyunacknowledging of postmodernity's epochal elevation of the cultural standing of thesubject of their studies, and, specifically, have ignored technology's elevation relative toscience. This I attribute to the ideological character of that discipline, and, specifically, toits strategy of ignoration of science. Keywords: Technology as Forman is a curator at the Smithsonian Institution, DC 20013-7012. E-mail: 2P. Forman Liberation of our conception of technology from the functional dependence and cultural inferiority implied by 'applied science' was a principal constitutive program ofthe discipline of the history of technology, and so it has remained through four decadesto the present day. When the historians of technology first began to revolt against 'thelinear model' and its view of science as originative source, as unmoved mover, of tech-nological progress, they were setting themselves against prejudices deeply entrenchedin modern culture. 1 Meanwhile, however, the times have been achanging. To campaign today against the linear model is to throw oneself against a door that has been wideopen for two decades. In the epochal global transformation from modernity to post-modernity that has been taking place in recent decades, technology has acquired,beginning about 1980, the cultural primacy that science had been enjoying for twocenturies world-wide, and in the West for two millennia. Of this postmodern reversal of primacy between science and technology there is no more apposite evidence than the shift of the center of interest in all varieties of 'sciencestudies' from science to technology. That shift began about 25 years ago, and today, ifone asks a historian or sociologist or philosopher of science what they are working on,odds are they will describe an inquiry at the center of which is technology. This is trueeven also of those who are now old enough to collect their pensions, and who, conse-quently, having begun their scholarly careers at a time when science's primacy wasunquestioned, could not then have imagined ending it oriented as they are towardtechnology. 2 This turnabout has come about because we historians and sociologists and epistemologists have become so largely postmodern\u2014not postmodernists neces-sarily or even generally, but anima adapted to postmodernity. 3 In modernity, the cultural rank of science was elevated by that epoch's most basic cultural presuppositions\u2014not merely the presupposition of the superiority of theoryto practice, but more importantly the elevation of the public over the private and thedisinterested over the interested, and, more importantly still, the belief that the meanssanctify the ends, that adherence to proper means is the best guarantee of a 'truly good'outcome. Today, on the contrary, technology is the beneficiary, and science themaleficiary, of our pragmatic-utilitarian subordination of means to ends, and of theconcomitants of that predominant cultural presupposition, notably, disbelief in disin-terestedness and condescension toward conceptual structures. Some evidence of this unprecedentedly high cultural standing of technology in recent decades is presented in Section I of this paper. More particularly, I arguethere that only a sudden and drastic shift ca 1980 in cultural presuppositions could explain the evident inclination across the scholarly spectrum\u2014from philosophers tosociologists to scientists\u2014to ascribe to technology that primacy in role and rank thatpreviously all had ascribed to science. Did all ascribe such primacy to science prior to postmodernity? In order to establish the fundamentality of the postmodern reori-entation in cultural commitments, it is necessary to show that in the two centuries,at least, prior to ca 1980 the primacy of science to and for technology was a firm fixture in nearly everyone's thought, regardless of their philosophical commitmentsor social interests. Thus Section II, the bulk of this paper, is devoted to making outthat case.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 3 That effort is needful as there does not exist, to my knowledge, any scholarly exposition of the fact of the near universal belief in the primacy of science to and fortechnology prior to postmodernity. The absence of such an exposition is surely due ingood part to the fact that a generation ago, when we now pensionable historians andsociologists of science began our careers by taking science as our subject, we would haveregarded a proof of science's primacy as pointlessly pedantic. The transposition of ourpoint of view has meanwhile taken place so fundamentally and so complacently thattoday a presupposed primacy of science to technology is conceivable only as a prepos-terous, even malicious, mythology. 4 Although the primacy that science enjoyed in modernity\u2014a primacy not merely with respect to technology, but in cultural standing quite generally\u2014came to appearpreposterous only through the perspective enjoined by postmodernity upon laymanand scholar alike, not everyone in modernity approved of the fact that science enjoyedsuch primacy. Of that I take note repeatedly in the course of my exposition. Among themalcontents were the adherents of the emerging discipline of the history of technology,who in the course of the 1970s rejected the primacy of science and took as program-matic objective liberation of technology, and of themselves, from subordination toscience. I show in Section III that as their principal means of effecting that end, histo-rians of technology, as a group, chose ignoration of science, i.e. the exclusion of sciencefrom their purview and their histories (except for purposes of disparagement). Inconsequence of adopting that strategy, historians of technology have seriouslydistorted the views and motives of the subjects of their historical studies. They havealso\u2014and this is my main reason for examining their ideology here\u2014blinded them-selves to the reversal of primacy between science and technology, and therewith theepochal transition from modernity to postmodernity. 5 In a subsequent publication I will turn to the question of how to account for the extraordinary unanimity, in modernity, that science unquestionably held primacy toand for technology. That subordination of technology to science in modernitypoints, as it seems to me, to the foundational importance for the modern mind ofmeans, of process, of procedure. Contrary to a common view, the primacy of meanslogically does not, and in modernity did not, imply a high valuation of technology.Rather, the primacy of means implied a high valuation of science, for science wasmodernity's prime exemplar of progress through reliance upon a proper means, thescientific method. The commitment to 'methodism' was most obviously founda-tional for modern liberal democratic societies, but was by no means limited to them.Rather, Weber emphasized, the modern bureaucratic state, whatever its ostensivepolitical constitution, is characterized and legitimated by the regularity and imper-sonality of its administrative processes, i.e. by the primacy of procedure. To be sure,modernity knew many manifestations of romantic antipathy to methodical proce-dure, but only rarely and briefly did anti-methodism hold sway. Today, however, inpost-methodist postmodernity, the notion of a scientific method is regarded as na\u00efveand out-dated because ends have regained the primacy that, prior to the Enlighten-ment, had been ascribed to them always and everywhere. 6 This postmodern primacy of ends is a principal reason for the striking reversal since about 1980 of relative rankDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 4P. Forman and role between science and technology, to the advantage of technology and the great disadvantage of science. I. The Postmodern Primacy of Technology Of course, it would be na\u00efve simply to equate Postmodernism with technology .7 A recently published semi-popular, hemi-historical work of reference, American Women in Technology: An Encyclopedia , includes a list of 'Women Nobel Laureates in Science and Technology'.8 There is, of course, no Nobel prize for technology as such, and none of the individuals there listed would have regarded herself as technologistprimarily. The conflation of science with technology that pervades this work, and moreparticularly the capability of the title word 'technology' to comprehend science as well,are typical for postmodernity\u2014indeed, specific to postmodernity. Simplistically stated,the thesis of this paper that 'science' denotes technology too; post-modernity, when 'technology' denotes science too. More exactly, the cultural transval-uations that constitute postmodernity entail a reversal, in general discourse, of thedenotative capacities of the terms 'science' and 'technology'. That is, in modernity theprimacy of science to and for technology permitted the word 'science' to mean scienceand technology, but never\u2014or almost never\u2014permitted the word 'technology' to denote science as well. In postmodernity, with technology acquiring primacy, the word'technology' gradually becomes capable of including science in its denotative compass. 9 The capability 'science' possessed in modernity of standing also for and fully repre- senting technology appears clearly in the late-modern term 'big science'. Introducedaround 1960, the term was applied, almost without distinction, not only to large-scaleenterprises whose nominal goals were mainly, if not wholly, within science (pre-eminently, accelerator-based research on elementary particles), but also to enterprisesof a primarily technical, even politico-technical character (pre-eminently, getting a fewAmericans to the moon and back). 10 That is, in modernity science was conceived as so much the essence of every enterprise in which it had any role at all that a mere 'touch'of science sufficed to turn those enterprises into science of a sort. The desuetude of theterm 'big science' since the early 1990s is thus an indication of the loss of belief thattechnological miracles are worked by the kingly touch of science. Yet that loss of beliefdid not result from having learned better\u2014Section II will show the unteachability of modernity in this regard\u2014but from seeing differently, i.e. seeing technology as the broader, more inclusive entity. 11 Yet even though the extension of the meaning of the word 'technology' to include science may eventually become the clearest marker of the cultural shift from primacyof science to primacy of technology, it has not been an especially early or sensitive indi-cator of the onset of that shift. This is not surprising. The adjustment of discourse neces-sarily lags the emergence of new cultural presuppositions and their first expressions inpractice. Thus even the earliest instances of the word 'technology' covering science arelater than the first performances of the conflation of science with technology. So, forDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 5 example, in the early 1990s, Collins and Pinch wrote a popular book in the Latourian spirit of enlightenment, titled The Golem: What Everyone Should Know About Science (1993), in which all their examples are taken from basic scientific research and all theirconclusions are about technology. However, their sequel, published five years later, The Golem at Large: What You Should Know About Technology (1998), while not different in subject, analysis, or conclusions, exploits the newly realized denotative potential of'technology' to stand for both technology and science. 12 So when did we 'change our thinking caps'? It is often suggested, by advocates and antagonists alike, that the origins of a reversal of primacy between science and technol-ogy lie in the Second World War. 13 Against that view stands the fact that the presup- position of the primacy of science with respect to technology emerged greatlystrengthened from the Second World War. 14 More justifiable is to see the origins of this reversal of primacy in the cultural revolt of the 1960s. Yet although the undermining ofthe cultural standing of for-its-own-sake science was begun by the demand for 'rele-vance' that came forward so broadly and insistently in the 1960s, still, as I instantiate inSection II, the fundamentally modernist epistemological presupposition of theprimacy of science to and for technology continued to govern ideational constructs andtheir rhetorical expression into the late 1970s. The last years of that decade saw the firstindications of the reversal to primacy of technology\u2014not, initially, in intellectualiza-tions, but in sentiments regarding social life and the purposes of government asreflected in governmental science policy. 15 Only about 1980 did the rejection of the primacy of science to technology begin to take hold as presupposition for intellectual-izations. The word 'technoscience', coined in French at about that time, well expressesthe fact that the conflation of technology and science initially proceeded not from anyespecially high valuation of technology, but rather from a still modern preoccupationwith science, and a still more old-fashioned disapprobation accompanying the newlyarisen recognition of science's manifold entanglements with technology. 16 The reconception of 'science studies' as being the scholarly study of an entity tech- nology/science, without any difference or distinction between technology and science,and thus without any primacy imputed to science or subordination of technology,began to take place in the early 1980s. Stages in that reconception are clearly discern-ible in the writings of Bruno Latour, writings that brought him to center stage in'science studies'. Thus Laboratory Life (1979) was still modern in its total scientocen- trism. 'Give Me a Laboratory ...' (1983) shows Latour reorienting his attention towardtechnology while still presupposing the preposterous primacy of science, presupposingit so completely that he did not even speak of 'technology', but took as the phenome-non requiring explanation the extension of scientific results stabilized in the scientificlaboratory beyond the walls of the laboratory to encompass the world at large. ThusLatour was there obliterating the boundary between science and technology, but he didso from science outward, treating technology as super-stabilized science. 17 Somewhere in the following four years the relation between science and technology reversed itselffor Latour. Science in Action (1987) telegraphs in its subtitle, How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society , that Latour is equating and conflating scientists and engineers, science and technology. As indication of a cultural shift, more significantDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 6P. Forman than this conflation itself is that it is almost totally implicit, taken for granted, as though needing no argument or justification. As indication of the equally implicitepistemic shift accompanying this cultural shift: where Latour does, so very briefly,consider science and technology as distinguishable entities, primacy is accorded totechnology, now regarded as the greater miracle. 18 The staggering contradiction to that primacy of science that even just ten years earlier had still been the very nearly universally received view goes unnoticed by the1987 Latour. Yet however stylistically idiosyncratic Science in Action may be, Latour's representation of the relation between science and technology was anything but idio-syncratic. Quite the contrary: the huge success of that book must be ascribed toLatour's conflation of science and technology being right in line with the broad, largelyunreflected-upon, modern-to-postmodern cultural reorientation: among 16 scholarlyreviews of Science in Action , only three drew attention to Latour's conflation of scien- tists and engineers, and none took issue with it. 19 Nearly every other axiom of Latour's account was doubted by one or another of those 16, generally enthusiastic, reviewers.20 However, this one, the equation and conflation of science with technology, fundamen-tal to Latour's project and implied in his title, goes largely unnoticed and entirelyunchallenged by the reviewers of his book. Evidently, by the late 1980s the presumptionof the primacy of technology was well on its way to becoming just as universallyreceived a view as the primacy of science had been through the preceding two centuries. Not everywhere, however, was the primacy of technology received so thoughtlessly, and hence so universally, as in the Anglophone world. France sustains today the bestorganized and most outspoken philosophical-ideological contestation of the confla-tion of science with technology, in part because over the past three to four decadesFrance has been the locus of the best organized and most outspoken philosophical-ideological advocacy of that conflation, with its always implicit and often explicitreversal of primacy between science and technology. 21 Thus what Latour with Science in Action was the first influentially to perform in English, was then already a familiar contention in France, and the term 'technoscience', which Latour pretended to invent,was already widely used there to signify that contention. 22 Is this not surprising? Is it not, after all, in France that, as Pestre and Krige observed, scientists 'appear above all as the heirs to a tradition that continued to attach greatimportance to \"pure\" science and kept \"applied\" science separate', while, by contrast,in the USA 'between the 1930s and the 1960s ... was the emergence of a profoundsymbiosis previously unknown in basic science, a fusion of \"pure\" science, technology,and engineering'. 23 This ironic circumstance suggests that the actual, factual relation- ship between science and technology is relatively unimportant\u2014certainly not disposi-tive\u2014in forming the presumptive, putative, presupposed, relation between science andtechnology. Our presuppositions regarding the relation between science and technol-ogy have their basis, rather, in that wider culture definitive of the historical epoch. Thefollowing pages provide repeated occasions to affirm that view. The confusion of technology with science, which for a century past was deplored as a vulgar misconception by all who pretended to an informed view of science, is now anDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 7 accepted notion not only in all the disciplines that take science as their subject but even also among scientists. So we find in the 1 October 2004 issue of the prestigious Science an invited essay, 'What Kind of Science is Experimental Physics?' written by a historianof physics at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. Otto Sibum'sanswer is that experimental physics is a 'technical science'. The phrase, as any reader ofGerman literature on the science-technology relation knows, is an assertion that exper-imental physics is a constituent of, is subsumed within\u2014is\u2014technology. Sibumadvances his claim for the 'artificial technological character of experimental physics'from behind a stalking horse: Felix Auerbach, an early 20th century theoretical physi-cist, professor at the University of Jena, who was closely associated with the Zeiss opti-cal firm. Writing in the early 1920s, i.e. in the context of the resurgence in Germanyfollowing the First World War of romantic antagonism both toward physical scienceand toward technology, Auerbach, as was typical in that context, even for a physicistwith close connections to technology, half conceded the often-heard denigration. 24 Allowing that a phenomenon, such as X-rays, produced by physicists in their laborato-ries with the aid of instruments is 'not a \"natural phenomenon\"', Auerbach, as quotedby Sibum, further conceded that: Strictly speaking, physics with regard to its method is not a natural science like astronomy, geology, biology, etc.; it does not deal with natural phenomena but artificial phenomenaproduced by intentional acts of the researcher; in this sense we can speak of physics as atechnical science. 25 Sibum's translation of Auerbach is accurate, but only of the words he includes. Sibum omitted a qualification that Auerbach had inserted after the phrase 'physics with regardto its method'. What Auerbach had written is: 'physics with regard to its method (notits goal) is not a natural science'. Where Sibum ended his quotation, Auerbach contin-ued to elaborate that parenthetical but crucial qualification: ... in this sense we can speak of physics as a technical science. Understand me correctly: with regard to its method; for with regard to its goal physics is and remains a pure naturalscience, insofar as it does not aim (or at least not primarily) at technical applications, butserves pure cognition. 26 Clearly, for Auerbach the distinction between physics and technics remained of high importance, and that precisely because what distinguished physics qua science\u2014'pure cognition'\u2014placed it so much higher than technics on the scale of cultural values ofthat time and that place. The grossness of Sibum's misrepresentation of Auerbach'sview should thus be understood as a measure of the difference between the culturalvalues of Auerbach's still modern time and of our postmodern time. 27 Sibum's is by no means the most forward and categoric among the recent assertions of the primacy of technology over science. Those have come from philosophers. ToHeidegger, who 'apparently accords technology a dignity without precedent in thehistory of thought', 28 they commonly credit their 'sense that philosophy of technology is and ought to be broader than philosophy of science', that, Ihde writes, 'science,rather than being the origin of technology or technology as the application of science,becomes the tool of technology'. 29 William Lovitt, one of the first to be able to grasp theDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 8P. Forman importance Heidegger attributed to technology, has stated forcefully its elevation rela- tive to science: Seen as Heidegger would have us see it, the technology so familiar to us emerges as the supremely determinative phenomenon of our day. This according of decisive supremacy to technology must surprise us. What a sweeping derogation it is of the other phenomena of our age, most importantly of modern science!After all, is not technology a latecomer on the stage of history? Is it not in fact a kind ofderivative of science? And, far from its being supreme, does not the more fundamental,more far-reaching sphere of scientific activity and scientific knowledge actually holdpriority over it, offering us a viable and proven standing ground from which to launch ourtechnological enterprises, to assess and to control them? To this, Heidegger would unhes-itatingly reply that it is in fact precisely in technology's relation to modern science that thepriority belonging to modern technology is to be found most strikingly in play and that,accordingly, we cannot legitimately find in science any superior vantage point from whichto survey and cope with technology. 30 If one bears in mind that Heidegger has been in recent decades the most influential philosopher, world wide, hands down, then it seems probable that most of the versionsof Sibum's thesis which have appeared in the past thirty years base themselves uponHeidegger, albeit more often indirectly than directly. 31 Yet having denied a dispositive role to the factual relations between technology and science in forming our current cultural valuations of technology and of science,would we be warranted in granting such a role to a philosopher's ideas? The career ofHeidegger's influence in just this regard\u2014the importance attached to technology\u2014provides a striking example of the impotence of even the most emphatically expressedideas of the most highly regarded philosopher in the absence of a culturally createdand propagated purpose that those ideas are fit to serve. 'In all of Heidegger's work subsequent to 1930 technology is a primary issue', Borgman observed in 1987. Yet, in surveying the scholarly literature on Heidegger,Borgman found that this fact had been largely ignored through the 1960s and 1970s,and was coming to be recognized in Heidegger scholarship only in the 1980s. 32 No question, by the late 1930s Heidegger had come to regard 'modern technology' as the great danger for humanity and the great problem for philosophy. Salvation would come only through recognizing what he had recognized\u2014'the essence of technology'and the essentiality of that essence to philosophy. Notwithstanding that Heidegger saidthis loud and clear for 40 years, from that time forward to the end of his life, his epigoneto the West were simply unable to recognize the primacy that Heidegger attributed totechnology. They became able to do so about 1980, not because of anything thatHeidegger, then dead, said, but because the presuppositions and predilections of theirFrancophone and Anglophone cultures had so altered as to potentiate a recognition ofthat aspect of Heidegger's thought. As one among the many instances of this pre-postmodern incapability of 'hearing' what Heidegger was saying about the relation between science and technology, considerthe acute and learned Grene writing, in the mid 1960s, the article on Heidegger for theeight-volume Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy . [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 9 published a translation of Heidegger's 1938 essay, 'Die Zeit des Weltbildes', wrote in 'later' Heidegger\u2014i.e. the post- Sein-und-Zeit (1927) Heidegger\u2014'draws no line between pure and applied science'. In so writing she hadforgotten\u2014had presumably never gotten\u2014what Heidegger warned against at thevery outset of that 1938 essay: the construal of technology as applied science. ThereHeidegger had said, in her own translation, that: Among the essential phenomena of modern times we must count science. A phenomenon with the same degree of importance is mechanical technique. This should not be misin-terpreted, however, as a mere application of modern mathematical natural science topractice. ... Mechanical technique remains the most visible product to date of the essence of modern technology, which is identical with the essence of modern metaphysics. 33 To write that Heidegger 'draws no line between pure and applied science' Grene had not only to overlook Heidegger's warning against conceiving technology as appliedscience, she had also to overlook the radicality of Heidegger's conception of technol-ogy, of technology's primacy as evoker of science into its own service, and shaper ofevery other aspect of the culture of the age. In the mid 1960s modern preconceptionswere evidently still too strong for Grene to be able to assimilate sufficiently to restatewhat she herself had written in translating Heidegger. 34 Heidegger himself was so disturbed by this almost universal neglect of his main message that in the spring of 1976, just weeks before his death, as perhaps his last publicact, he sent a brief greeting and admonition to the participants in the tenth annualNorth American Heidegger Conference in Chicago: Is modern natural science the foundation of modern technology\u2014as is supposed\u2014or is it, for its part, already the basic form of technological thinking, the determining fore-conception and incessant incursion of technological representation into the realized andorganized machinations of modern technology? 35 Having posed this rhetorical question, Heidegger urged that 'each participant, in his own way, devote his attention to this question and accept it as stimulus for his own field'.36 The remarkable inability prior to the late 1970s to grasp what it was that Heidegger was shouting out and about is no less true\u2014and thus all the more remarkably true\u2014of his acolytes in France. They, after all, were so much in advance of the Americans inreceiving Heidegger, and so much more completely under his spell. 'For me Heideggerhas always been the essential philosopher', said Foucault at the end of his life. 'Myentire philosophical development was determined by my reading of Heidegger'. Thesame could be said for Derrida and for Lyotard, and for almost any other Frenchphilosopher who came of age after 1940. 37 Yet, notwithstanding that Heidegger's influ- ence in France has been enormous from the early 1950s onward, not until the last quar-ter of the 20th century was his view of technology, and more especially his view of therelation between science and technology, assimilable there. A different worldview\u2014thepostmodern world view\u2014was indispensable to 'getting' what Heidegger was saying. If we postmoderns are now able to think with Heidegger of technology as prior to science, possessing primacy over science, that is, in part because as postmoderns we areDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 10 P. Forman not bearing that load of animus which Heidegger's words express. Here too, the cultural determination of the freight and feel of Heidegger's 'influence' is striking: ingiving primacy to technology, postmodernity has by-and-large reversed the minus signthat Heidegger placed before technology. 38 We postmoderns have rejected that rejec- tion of modern technology that for two centuries had been characteristic of the broadand strong, chiefly German, romantic tradition in which Heidegger stood. 39 In that tradition, among the several grounds for the negative valuation of natural science,especially physical and mathematical science, was a view of such science as being noth-ing more, or other, or better than technology. 40 Of these motives and passions our postmodern society and culture\u2014albeit in other important respects romantic\u2014know nothing, care nothing. On the contrary, it is in part because technology is so positivelyvalued in postmodernity that it has now superseded science in cultural primacy. 41 While this paper is not, per se , concerned with the actual, factual relation between science and technology, it is difficult to doubt that if those who speak for science sharethese postmodern cultural values, then consequences will likely follow for the charac-ter, even the existence, of science. Technology\u2014which is not, primarily, an '-ology', butsimply the collective noun for all the many ways things are in fact done and made\u2014technology is what it is independently, largely, of our conceptions of it. The opposite isthe case with science, which is, largely, only what we think it is. That is, the boundarybetween science and non-science, as well as the bulk of the activities that are science, isnot primarily a matter of fact but of a cultural consensus. Consequently, science willtend to conform to its supposed relation to technology as that supposed relationinforms the expectations of actors, individual and corporate. The tendency today toemphasize the technological aspects of science so greatly as to obliterate the distinctionbetween science and technology is not limited to philosophers, sociologists and histo-rians of science, but has become common among spokespersons for science too. Thosemost influential in science not only emphasize the importance of new technology forscientific advance\u2014and minimize the importance of new concepts\u2014but also deny theexistence of any clear boundary or distinction between science and technology.Increasingly, these influentials are discarding science's claims to distinctiveness anddefining science in technological terms and through technological goals. 42 A striking example of the disparagement of scientific goals relative to technologic goals is the conclusion of de Gennes's 1994 Dirac Memorial Lecture\u2014a lectureshipcreated by Cambridge University to honor one of its three greatest, and most definitelyits purest, theoretical physicist.

'We' scientists, Cech observed, 'like to think that our smart ideas arewhat are driving science forward, but we keep realizing that ... the limiting factorreally is ... the technology'. 44 In so saying Cech, conceiving himself still as scientist, cleaves to a conception of science as something distinct from the technologies itemploys, however much his program for 'basic' research tends to defeat that distinc-tion. That defeat is the more certain as nowhere today are arguments advanced infavor of a distinction in principle between science and technology. Rather, what onehears are declarations such as that of the CEO of the American Association for theAdvancement of Science: I'm a simple man. I've never been able to understand the delineation between science and technology and engineering and innovation and all that stuff. To me it is all one thing.45 The modesty of the self-presentation is winning, even as it is abdicating of the founding purposes of that mid-19th century institution. Then Joseph Henry could say to itsapplause that 'We leave to others with lower aims and different objects to apply ourdiscoveries to what are called useful purposes'. 46 Today, in postmodernity, Henry's cynosure of for-its-own-sake science is without cultural understanding or support.Consequently, those who identify themselves as scientists have, overwhelmingly, noother ambition than to place themselves in the service of 'useful purposes'. In theexperimental sciences, biology especially, this process has been far advanced for almosttwo decades now. 47 To be sure, cosmic-discovery science and history-of-life-on-earth science continue, but less as exceptions than as 'useful' to an increasingly credulous,'spirituality'-oriented, romantic-illusionary, postmodern culture. 48 It should be clear, then, that the last place to look for transformative effects of this epochal shift in cultural values is in the most characteristically modernist of ourscientific enterprises, the high-energy, particle-physics accelerator laboratories\u2014'bigscience' institutions specifically constituted for the production of end-in-itself knowl-edge. 49 Not that such effects can long be absent from those institutions too.50 Yet by their very dedication to non-utilitarian, disciplinarily defined, means-justified ends,these institutions have little leeway to compromise with the demands of this our post-modern era. Their very existence depends upon limiting the impact of this revolutionin cultural values. The high-energy physicists must continue talking publicly in foun- dational terms, even while privately acknowledging that they have given up thinking insuch terms. 51 If we want to see postmodernization working radically and admittedly upon the scientific role and knowledge production, we should look, rather, into the'little science' academic laboratories that in high modernity were lauded as the sites oftrue science. With an irony that none could have anticipated 40 years ago, it is todayjust those 'little science' laboratories that have reoriented themselves most completelytoward technologically defined ends, while it remains to the earlier much-maligned'big science' laboratories to shoulder the burden of sustaining own sake', 17:39 23 April 2007 12 P. Forman One striking manifestation of this reorientation of little science toward technology is the burgeoning of nanotechnology. The nearly exponential rise of publication underthe rubric of 'nano' in the period 1986-2002, to the level of several thousand per year, 52 reflects a chain-reaction of 'free' choices by thousands of individual 'little' scientists ina wide range of disciplines, with each successive convert finding it correspondinglyeasier to turn their back upon their prior, disciplinarily defined research enterprise.Meanwhile, in this same period, role and rank have reversed so completely betweenphysics and biology that where previously 'physics envy' was commonly invoked toexplain biologists' behaviors, today the rush into nanotechnology is commonly attrib-uted to 'molecular biology envy'. Nor is it accidental that the concocted researchprogram 'nanotechnology' is so thoroughly analogous to molecular biology in itstinker-toy imagery and in its salvific rhetoric as well as its strictly technologic goals. 53 Physicists, aware that postmodern conditions are disintegrating their discipline, have turned to 'physics history' as a sort of cement. The effectiveness of that cementwill depend, inter alia , on just what counts as 'physics history'. What does count? In February 2004 the 'This Month in Physics History' column in the American PhysicalSociety's monthly newspaper commemorated 'February 9, 1990: Death of George deMestral'. 54 Who was de Mestral and of what discipline-defining importance was his work, that the fourteenth anniversary of his death was so celebrated? The editors knewthat among physicists de Mestral's was not yet a household name and so they explained:the honoree was a Swiss mechanical engineer, fond of pheasant hunting. Inspired bythe local cocklebur adhering tenaciously to his hunting clothes, de Mestral conceived,and persevered to perfect and market, Velcro\u00ae. Thirty years ago this column could haveintended only hilarity and could have been read only as a lampoon. In the fourth yearof the 21st century it was meant wholly seriously and as exemplary for the members ofthis, the principal disciplinary association of physicists in the USA\u2014indeed, in theworld. Certainly de Mestral manifested significant virtues, just as certainly as 30 years ago, physicists, then still being permitted their modernist conceits, would have beeninclined to consider those virtues relatively insignificant. Yet in holding de Mestral upto the members of the American Physical Society as a model to emulate, the society'seditors were implicitly disparaging those more esoteric virtues around which physicshad solidified itself as scientific discipline\u2014pre-eminently, the virtues manifested bythe conceptually creative abstract theorist disengaged from practical interests. 55 In lieu of those difficult and distinctive virtues, physicists were being urged to take as avatarthe technologist\u2014indeed the least abstract and the most entrepreneurial sort of tech-nologist. If such ideals come into effect\u2014and there is much evidence that theyhave 56\u2014then that tautologous evasion, 'physics is what physicists do', which three decades ago seemed to be a witty and effective put-down of those critical of what phys-icists were then up to, will fail for want of any distinctive group identifying themselvesas physicists. Ironically, the unavoidability in postmodernity of this primacy of technology is evident even in the argumentation of those conceiving themselves as most opposed topostmodern positions\u2014those polemically striving to sustain By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 13 attained truth, truth independent of every personal and institutional interest, hence unique and transcendent. The 'perspectivist' challenges to the unicity and transcen-dence of certified scientific knowledge that Gross and Levitt ridiculed in Higher Superstition (1994) were for the most part poorly founded in evidence and logic, because, like the newly asserted primacy of technology, so well grounded in postmod-ern prejudice. Yet Gross and Levitt, sophisticated critics that they were, knew that everyaffirmative defense of foundationalism is readily shown to involve itself in dubitable,question-begging postulations. Leaving it therefore to the 'serious philosophers ofscience' to 'refute, in abstracto, the constructivist view', Gross and Levitt themselvesoffered no other justification for science's truth claims than that, 'To put the matterbrutally, science works '. 57 This line of argument, in its evasion as in its rationale, is not modern but postmodern. However, the tough-minded stance that Gross and Levittassume is not the conclusion that postmoderns of any stripe need draw, nor shoulddraw. Whether one says with Heidegger that Gross and Levitt merely acknowledge thatthe essence of science is technology, or one remains at home with our leading Americanpostmodern pragmatist, Richard Rorty, and says that physics is the construct of acommunity with a shared interest in pushing objects around, 58 'science works ' may contribute to the maintenance of research budgets, but it undermines the conceptionof science that Gross and Levitt wish to defend. Wherever we look in contemporary culture, we find this astonishing elevation of tech- nology in rank and role relative to science. In every field of science, as in every field ofscience studies, technology forms both focus and epistemic fundament for our endeav-ors. 59 How to account for this? We will not comprehend so broad a cultural phenom- enon unless we connect it with still broader cultural phenomena, namely, thatconstellation of values and presuppositions contrasting markedly with those obtainingfor some centuries prior to ca 1980\u2014contrasting so markedly that the conversion to them constitutes a new historical epoch, postmodernity. Although, as Mirowski hasemphasized, 'it has now become commonplace in the science policy and science studiesliteratures to concede that something rather dramatic has happened to the organiza-tion of science and the university in the quarter-century or so since 1980', it hasremained far from commonplace to regard that 'something' as something fartherreaching even than the ecology of knowledge. 60 Broadly considered, a reversal of the presumed relation between technology and science involves nothing less than an inver-sion of our mode of being, and is therefore effectively a demarcator, both of state ofmind and of point in time, between modernity and postmodernity. II. The Primacy of Science in Modernity Technics is a translation into appropriate, practical forms of the theoretic truths ... of science.61 The fact of the primacy of science scientia , science as terested theoria \u2014is almost as hard for us postmoderns it was for theDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 14 P. Forman moderns to doubt. Hence this paper devoted largely to pointing out how unanimously the moderns elevated science over technology and how preposterously they overratedthe role of science in the advance of technology. The magnitude of the culturalphenomenon here in question can best be suggested by a concrete expression of thosepresuppositions. Consider the following affirmations by Gano Dunn in 1930\u2014thehighly successful head of a large engineering firm was addressing the alumni of his almamater, Columbia University: They are no idle boasts, those legends written under the dome of the beautiful temple of science in Washington, 'Pilot of Industry', 'Conqueror 'Eternal Guide Truth'. The priests who sacrifice in her temple know the joys of the freedom of the human intellect, ... the scientist's ecstasy of thought. But beside her priests science has her worshipers who go out into the world and are a part of it. They are the engineers. 62 However preposterous Dunn's imagery now appears to us, unquestionably it was meant entirely seriously, and, more to the point, was supposed by Dunn to be entirelyacceptable to his auditors. Dunn's affirmations bespeak two distinguishable respects or regards in which science was ascribed primacy to technology in modernity. In two words, those tworegards are 'rank' and 'role'. Rank is position in a hierarchy of ascribed value, reflectingdegree of manifestation or possession (or, conversely, privation) of leading values ofthe culture. This, I take it, is what Otto Mayr had in mind when, 30 years ago, heobserved that the aspect of the relationship between science and technology to whichhistorians ought to be attending is how science and technology rank, respectively, 'onour scale of values'. 63 Role, on the other hand, is a matter to be ascertained not by referring science and technology each separately and directly to 'our scale of values', but rather by consider-ing science and technology in relation to each other. Again, at issue here is not howtechnology and science 'really' relate to each other, but how these two entities aregenerally presumed and commonly alleged to relate, i.e. at issue is the putative relation between technology and science. For the cultural and intellectual historian the putativerelation is not less important than the actual, factual relation between technology andscience, and gains in historical importance precisely to the degree to which it differsfrom the actual, factual relation in the places and periods in question. Returning to Dunn's affirmations, what we find there expressed in such exaggerated terms is an ascription of far higher social-cultural rank to scientists than to engineers.The scientist exists on a plane that transcends the plane of practical life to which engi-neers are confined. On that exalted plane the scientist enjoys the most highly ratedattributes of thought. Second, as to role, the scientist, disconnected though he is frompractical life, is nonetheless the source not only of technology's material benefits, butalso of that far-seeing leadership by which they are realized. With all insight and inno-vation credited to scientists, the engineer's activity is necessarily subservient, depen-dent and derivative. The one element of originality that attributes to the engineerDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 15 is of a lower, constrained order: 'Engineering is the art of the economic application of science to the purposes of man'.64 Dunn's conception of science as playing the leading, guiding, originative role in rela- tion to technological innovation was very nearly universally shared in the first half ofthe 20th century\u2014and both halves of the 19th\u2014not only in America, but acrossEurope, and wherever in the world beyond the hope of catching up with the West wascherished. While most of the strongest affirmations of this primacy of science camefrom scientists, rather than technologists, often the circumstances of even those artic-ulations bespeak the scientist's confident expectation that such claims for sciencewould find ready acceptance in technical and industrial circles. So, for example, when,in January 1921, physicist Wilhelm Wien appealed for adherents to the association forthe support of 'physical-technical research' in German universities and institutes oftechnology, an association that he was then organizing together with several leadingfigures in Germany's iron, steel, electrical and chemical industries, he had no qualmsabout classifying 'metallurgical, mechanical, and electrical engineering' as 'appliedphysics'. 'If research in physics atrophies, then technology loses the scientific leader-ship, through which alone [!] it has worked itself up to its towering height.' 65 Of course throughout modernity there were national differences in the degree of unanimity regarding the primacy of science. The USA, perhaps surprisingly in view ofits populist traditions and its high valuation of technology, occupied a middle positionon this spectrum. Germany, albeit the country with the strongest tradition of pureresearch, had exceptionally outspoken engineers who took vehement exception toaffirmations such as Wien's. On the whole their protests were ignored because counterto the presuppositions of their culture too. 66 In France, as Pestre has stressed, the concept of 'scientific leadership' had both stronger underpinnings and wider applica-tion, for there it was seen as extending through all the institutions of French society,not stopping short of the political institutions, as it generally did in Germany and theUSA. 67 Yet these national differences are 'second order' differences. Far more promi- nent and significant is the high degree of transnational unanimity regarding theprimacy of science. The main concern of this paper is, then, to put into evidence the fact that a definite functional relationship between science and technology was almost universally takenfor granted in modernity\u2014namely, ascription of the value-ladened relational role ofleadership to science, and of dependence to technology. Obviously, role, specifiedthough it be through functional terms rather than posited cultural values, becomesvalue-ladened through the participation of those relational concepts in the hierarchiesof ascribed value that gave science and technology each separately their cultural rank.That there is thus, at bottom, considerable redundance between 'role' and 'rank' doesnot diminish the analytic utility of distinguishing between these two dimensions ofprimacy. This appears quite clearly when the several cultural values here involvedtransform differently in the transition from modernity to postmodernity. Such is thecase with the concept of 'leadership', especially leadership in innovation, which hasretained its high cultural value, even while theory and abstraction have fallen drasticallyin cultural value. 68 It is this relative constancy of the one hierarchy of cultural valueDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 16 P. Forman together with a drastic change in the other that has produced so strong an effect upon the science-technology relation. Now, if the proposition to be substantiated is true, if in modernity nearly all who gave any thought at all to the relation between technology and science gave primacy toscience, then the evidences of this are obviously boundless. Hence limitations to thisexposition are necessary. From here forward, I leave entirely aside all testimony ante-rior to the 19th century, as for the purposes of this argument modernity is most appro-priately conceived as the era emerging from the Enlightenment, the industrialrevolution, and the formation of nation states, especially those with democratic insti-tutions. Further, though at the cost of ignoring some of the most ardent affirmationsof the primacy of science to and for technology, I leave entirely aside articulations ofthat primacy by scientists, as being inevitably self-serving. 69 I put into evidence, rather, the views of just those who, given their intellectual postures and their social positions,ought to have been inclined to privilege technology. Here included are, first, philoso-phers upholding the primacy of practice; second, engineers and industrialists; third,modern man, the holder of public opinion, who experiences technology immediatelyin his daily life, but science only through hearsay; and last, scholarly anticipators of therole of science in late 20th century technology and society. Proponents of the Primacy of Practice Although there would be good grounds for going right back in the German tradition of 'practice' (and 'life') philosophy to the beginning of the 19th century\u2014and it willbecome necessary to refer so far back when taking cognizance of the presence andpower of romantic ideologies\u2014it is with Marx that our canonical historiographictradition originates the primacy of the material over the intellectual, of the economicand the technical over the scientific. On this point, however, Marx was no Marxian\u2014nor, by and large, were his Marxist followers. For all of Marx's acuity in seeingthrough ideologies to the actualities they dissimulate, and for all that Marx gave, inprinciple, a determinative role in the shaping of culture to the mode of production,when Marx turned to the relation between science and technology it simply did notoccur to him to suspect the preconceptions of his predecessors and contemporaries.While rejecting categorically the social-political views of the advocates of the benefi-cent hand, visible and invisible, in this connection Marx himself had just as little doubt as did they that the arrow of causation pointed from thought to practice, notfrom practice to thought. Along with all his educated contemporaries, Marx simply knew it to be true that industrial processes had their actual and their necessary basis in, and were evolvedout of, the natural sciences: 'natural science has intervened in human life and trans-formed it by means of industry'. 70 Consequently, Marx considered that historical materialism was the way of the world only prior to the full development of capital-ism, at which point 'general social knowledge has become an immediate force ofproduction, and therefore the conditions of the social life process itself have comeunder the control of the general intellect'. 71 The quotation is from the GrundrisseDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 17 (1857-8). In that impetuous draft of Das Kapital Marx even went so far as to equate industrial capital itself with 'technological application of the natural sciences': The transformation of the production process from the simple labor process into a scien- tific process which subjugates the forces of nature and compels them to work in the serviceof human needs, appears in the form of fixed capital in opposition to living labor. 72 And this identification of capital itself with applied science was repeatedly affirmed in the Marxian tradition right into the 1980s.73 Marx's unwavering presupposition of the primacy of science is reflected already in his reading program in Poppe's treatises on the history of science and technology\u2014thislate 18th century encyclopedic writer in the cameralist tradition being Marx's principalsource on these subjects as he prepared himself for his great work. Just as Poppe, Marxtook it as beyond question that theoretical mechanics, physics and mathematics werefoundational for technology. Consequently, Marx read Poppe's treatises on the historyof natural science and mathematics before proceeding to Poppe's history of technol-ogy. True, Marx's notes show his attention flagging badly as he read dutifully throughthese treatises on the history of science, in which he could not, of course, find much tohis purpose. In the end, only the notes that he took on Poppe's history of technologycame to be worked into Das Kapital . 74 Nonetheless, Marx's reading program, and his dutiful adherence to it, themselves bespeak his unquestioned presupposition of theprimacy of science. 75 In Das Kapital this thoroughly 'unMarxian' presupposition of science's primacy to and for technology and modern industry generally, is evident wherever Marx referredto the relation between technology and science. Thus in the first chapter Marxobserved that: The productive power of labor is determined by multiple circumstances, among others the average degree of skill of the worker, the level of development of science and of its techno-logical applicability, the social organization of the production process, the extent andeffectiveness of the production process, and by the obtaining natural conditions. 76 Here 'the level of development of science and of its technological applicability' enters the list of determinative factors just where one would expect to see reference to the levelof technology itself. Manifestly, it is in lieu of that reference: in Marx's mind the tech-nological level was determined by the level attained by science. Again, in the thirteenthchapter, 'Machinery and large-scale industry', Marx took it as a matter of course thatnatural science is the basis of machine production and the source of new types ofmachinery: The principle of machine production, namely analyzing the production process into its constitutive phases and solving the problems thus posed through application of mechan-ics, chemistry, etc., in short, the natural sciences, becomes everywhere determinative. 77 And again: In the sphere of agriculture, large-scale industry has its most revolutionary effect inasmuchas there it demolishes the bulwark of the old society. ... In place of the laziest habits andmost irrational organization of production there steps applicationof science. 78Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 18 P. Forman Clearly, then, the primacy of science's role in relation to technology, especially since the 18th century, was for Marx a fixed and firm matter of fact. If a thinker of suchgreat critical acumen, a thinker who was pre-eminently a systematist\u2014and his systemdemanding the opposite causation\u2014could not unthink the presumed primacy ofscience, not even when his historical investigations produced little evidence of it,then that presumption must have rested on an exceptionally broad and deep culturalfoundation. 79 How then does it stand with Thorstein Veblen, America's most original social theo-rist at the turn of the 20th century? 80 Running through Veblen's writings from the last years of the 19th century to the end of the First World War are various articula-tions of the primacy of practice, and, more pertinently still, articulations of theprimacy of technology as a formative factor in all of modern civilization's intellectu-alizations: 'The scheme of thought or knowledge is in good part a reverberation of thescheme of life' (1899), and more specifically, 'men have learned to think in the termsin which the technological processes act' (1906), that is, 'the habits of thoughtenforced by the current technological scheme' 'impose themselves as ruling principlesthat govern the quest for knowledge' (1918). 81 Though apothegmatic statements of the primacy of practice in respect of the relations between science and technology areplentiful in Veblen's writings, elaborations of them are to be found only in a pair ofessays published in 1906-8, 82 and in a couple of chapters of The Instinct of Workman- ship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1914).83 In the earlier essays Veblen proceeds from the observation that 'modern civilization is peculiarly matter-of-fact. ... Themodern civilized peoples are in a peculiar degree capable of an impersonal, dispas-sionate insight into the material facts with which mankind has to deal.' 84 This circumstance has a material cause: it is 'due chiefly to the ubiquitous presence of themachine technology and its creations in the life of modern communities'. Moreover,'this characteristic of western civilization comes to a head in modern science', with its'quest of matter-of-fact knowledge'. For it is, namely, 'those changes that took placein the field of industry' 'which seem to have had the most serious consequences forthe methods and animus of scientific inquiry'. 85 So, through this series of (causative) connections, Veblen arrives at 'the reason why scientific theories can be turned to ... technological purpose'. The explanation\u2014and itis much like that which Heidegger would later offer for this circumstance, only that itis nominally naturalistic rather than explicitly idealistic: is not that he [the scientist] aims, or can aim, at technological improvements. His inquiry is as 'idle' as that of the Pueblo myth-maker. But the canons of validity under whose guid-ance he works are those imposed by the modern technology, through habituation to itsrequirements; and therefore his results are available for the technological purpose. 86 While Heidegger, as idealist, could regard the finally achieved relation between tech- nology and science as sufficient cause of its becoming, and so brush aside temporalorder as a triviality, 87 Veblen, as scientist constrained to efficient causes, could not so easily accommodate the historical fact that the world-view of modern science arose andDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 19 established itself long before machine technology began to dominate the 'scheme of life'. The inconsistencies in Veblen's exposition engendered by this awkward fact aremore pervasive in The Instinct of Workmanship (1914), where he vacillated between having the mechanistic approach of modern science reflect the technology of theIndustrial Revolution, reflect that of the early modern period, or reflect that of the latemedieval world, and, still more fundamentally, vacillated between attributing primacyto technology or to economics. For if economics, not technics, is taken as fundamental,thus making every feature of the modern world a consequence of 'the price system',then the mind-set of modern science is the product not of technological practice, butof that which also determines technological practice: 'modern science may, indeed, be taken as the freest manifestation of that habit of mind that comes to its more concreteexpression in the technology of the time'. 88 Veblen returned to this question of the relation between science and technology in Absentee Ownership and Business Enterprise in Recent Times (1923). In failing health, Veblen was no longer able to withstand the truisms of his time. In place of the primacyof technology to and for science, Veblen's theme there is 'The Technology of Physicsand Chemistry'. Where earlier he had often alleged that 'men have learned to think inthe terms in which the technological processes act', now it is the other way around.Now the technologists are applied scientists who have learned to think in the termswhich science provides them: 'the state of the industrial arts, as it runs on the lines ofthe mechanical industry, is a technology of physics and chemistry'. 'The twentieth-century engineer ... feeds' upon 'those material sciences physics and chemistry'. 89 As an after-effect of Faraday's experiments and speculations ... the dynamo and the electrical industry came into the technologist's world in the course of the latter half of thenineteenth century. 90 Similarly 'exact and calculable processes worked out by detailed experiment and computation in the chemical laboratories' transformed metallurgy, dyeing, tanning,baking, and brewing into 'recondite matters of applied science'. 'Industry has progres-sively shifted to a footing of applied science' and its day-to-day operations are now inthe hands of 'men grounded in the material sciences'\u2014Veblen's term for physics andchemistry collectively\u2014'and instructed in the specialized application of them'. 91 In order, then, to make Veblen out as attributing primacy to technology, one must, most obviously, overlook Veblen's late reversal of his position on that question. Onemust also choose to ignore Veblen's persistent inconsistency between attributingprimacy to technology and attributing primacy to economics. Even ignoring Veblen'sinconsistencies, one would not have reached more than half way to the primacy of tech-nology: the primacy thus dubiously established would be only 'primacy for'; 'primacyto', cultural rank, was for Veblen a different matter. On this issue of the valuation ofthe intellectual, Veblen was of the conventional view from the 'get-go'. For this reason,if for no other, his assertions of the primacy of technology were for him intellectualexercises rather than statements of a deep conviction. Wavering and inconsistent in hisaffirmation of the primacy of technology, Veblen, like Marx, quite consistently placedpure, for-its-own-sake science far above technology in cultural rank and value. Of thisDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 20 P. Forman we have had a hint already in Veblen's vaunting the impossibility of the scientist, qua scientist, having a technological aim\u2014we will encounter this again with Dewey\u2014andvaunting the habit of mind of the scientist as being the freest of all, while that of thetechnologist is encumbered by the concrete in which he must mix. Veblen laid this outcategorically and dramatically right at the outset of 'The Place of Science in ModernCivilization' (1906): The making of states and dynasties, the founding of families, the prosecution of feuds, the propagation of creeds and the creation of sects, the accumulation of fortunes, theconsumption of superfluities\u2014these have all in their time been felt to justify themselves asan end of endeavor; but in the eyes of modern civilized men all these things seem futile incomparison with the achievements of science. They dwindle in men's esteem as timepasses, while the achievements of science are held higher as time passes. This is the onesecure holding-ground of latterday conviction, that 'the increase and diffusion of knowl-edge among men' is indefeasibly right and good. ... and no other cultural ideal holds asimilar unquestioned place in the convictions of civilized mankind. 92 True, Veblen concluded this essay expressing doubts about whether 'the manner of man which this quest of knowledge produces or requires comes near to answering tothe current ideal of manhood'\u2014much the same doubts that William James had beenexpressing so much more prominently and emphatically for a decade and more as ofthat date. 93 Certainly Veblen, like James, was ambivalent about the impersonal, dispas- sionate, matter-of-fact mind and character with which the then prevalent conceptionof scientific method invested the scientist. 94 These, however, were only reservations\u2014 never even close to rejections.95 Veblen's most fundamental commitment was to science as the highest cultural value and that necessarily meant placing a high value onthe character requisite for its pursuit. This is evident from the un-ironically positiveconnotations of the terms 'science', 'scientist' and 'scientific', so frequently used byVeblen. To take but one example: writing at this same time (1906) of Karl Marx, Vebleninsisted that 'As to the motives which drive him and the aspirations which guide him,... he is primarily a theoretician busied with ... a consistent and faithful system ofscientific knowledge'. As Veblen, like Marx, saw himself as a scientist, so, like Marx,Veblen regarded 'scientist' with its implication of disinterestedness as, on the whole,the most estimable of identities. Consequently, Veblen denied that Marx's 'propagan-dist aims have in any substantial way deflected his inquiry or his speculations from thefaithful pursuit of scientific truth'. 96 The work most revealing of Veblen's own values, the work in which he most completely put aside his posture of social-scientific skepticism and spoke pro domo , is The Higher Learning in America (1918). Not, of course, that Veblen avowedly abandons his historical materialist perspective in this polemic subtitled A Memorandum On the Conduct of Universities By Business Men . On the contrary, as business is the hegemonic institution in American life, its 'pecuniary values ... will necessarily leave their mark onthe ideals, aims, methods and standards of science and scholarship'. 97 So Veblen says\u2014 and then he proceeds to insist that it just ain't so. For although, There are many of these workday interests extraneous ... to that disinterested pursuit of knowledge in which the characteristic intellectual bent of modern civilization culminatesDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 21 ... there is no general or abiding consensus among the various classes of the community in favor of ... including in the peculiar work of the university anything beyond the pursuit ofknowledge for its own sake. 98 Similarly, notwithstanding his general principle that modern man formulates such for- its-own-sake knowledge in mechanistic concepts, Veblen regarded as essential that 'thefinal test of this reality about which the inquiries of modern men so turn is not [ sic!] the test of mechanical serviceability for human use'. 99 Rather, Veblen insisted, in 1918 as in 1906, that, ... during the past few generations, this learning has so far become an avowed 'end in itself' that 'the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men' is now freely rated as the mosthumane and meritorious work to be taken care of by any enlightened community or anypublic-spirited friend of civilization. The expediency of such 'increase and diffusion' is nolonger held in doubt, because it has ceased to be a question of expediency among theenlightened nations, being itself the consummation upon which, in the apprehension ofcivilized men, the advance of culture must converge. Such has come to be the long-termcommon sense judgment of enlightened public opinion. A settled presumption to somesuch effect has found lodgment as a commonplace conviction in the popular mind, inmuch the same measure and in much the same period of time as the current body ofsystematic knowledge has taken on the character of matter of fact. For good or ill, civilizedmen have come to hold that this matter-of-fact knowledge of things is the only end in lifethat indubitably justifies itself. So that nothing more irretrievably shameful could overtakemodern civilization than the miscarriage of this modern learning, which is the most valuedspiritual asset of civilized mankind. 100 The great length of this quotation is justified by its great interest and pertinence: for all that Veblen as historical materialist theorizes technology's primacy to science, la titre Heidegger's explanation for 'the easy copartnership' between modern science and modern technology, so that they 'play into one another's hands',Veblen as modern mandarin brushes the historical materialist aside and insists thatend-in-itself scientific knowledge is the highest value of modern civilization. More,Veblen insists on this not merely as his own view, but as the universal view of his age. As previously with Marx, we see here once again with Veblen the helpfulness of the distinction between rank and role\u2014between the 'absolute' rankings of science and oftechnology on scales of cultural values and the 'relative' roles of science and technologyin their relationship with one another. Such primacy as Veblen, in exploring the conse-quences of his historical materialist principles, inconstantly conceded to technology'srole in the science-technology relationship was crushingly trumped by science's rank-ing on Veblen's scale of cultural values. Veblen's German contemporary, Werner Sombart, economic historian and political economist, was less the historical materialist than Veblen, but even more the admirerand emulator of the author of Das Kapital . 101 Though Sombart's reputation, much higher than Veblen's in their own time, has deservedly not held up so well as Veblen's,he is cited by historians of technology as a weighty figure who conceded to science noprimacy in rank or role in relation to technology. 102 Such citations point, regularly, to Sombart's 1911 essay, 'Technik und Kultur', and to a in the concludingDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April Forman volumes of Sombart's Der moderne Kapitalismus (1927), which section opens with a declaration that 'modern technology ... is a twin sister of modern science'.103 Sombart continued this thought on the following page, insisting that it is 'a useless, indeed afalse, question (one that I myself once posed) which of the two is genetically the earlier,which generated the other. They are simply one, and consequently their course ofdevelopment is one and the same.' 104 Nonetheless, it is with Sombart just as it was with Veblen: that parity accorded to technology in their programmatic statements evaporates in their subsequent exposi-tion because at bottom both writers believe in the creed of the mandarins\u2014believe thattheoretical, abstract and, above all, interest-free, for-its-own-sake, knowledge standshigher than every and any practical activity. Thus Sombart in the immediately follow-ing lines of Der moderne Kapitalismus inferred from this unity and identity of science and technology that 'We can therefore determine the main features of the stages ofmodern technology from the stages of the development of natural-scientific knowl-edge'. 105 Without offering the slightest suggestion of a symmetrical determination of science by technology, Sombart proceeded then to list the major advances in rationalmechanics associated with Galileo, Newton, Euler and Lagrange, and, likewise, themajor advances in chemistry associated with Lavoisier, Priestley, W\u00f6hler and Liebig,concluding: If natural science conceives the world as mechanical or chemical, then technology creates artificially a world that runs according to the formulas that natural science has set up forthe world as a whole. 106 So quickly does Sombart forget that parity of technology with science that he had declared two pages earlier, and reascribes to science an unqualified foundationalprimacy to and for technology. Being so much more affective a thinker than Marx orVeblen, Sombart was so much quicker and opener in confusing science's functionalrole in technology with science's superior rank on his own scale of cultural values. For all that they admired Marx and, like Marx, gave primacy in principle to practice, neither Veblen nor Sombart was a Marxist. Surely a life-long Bolshevik NikolaiIvanovich No: for Bukharin too,it was beyond question that science was both the originative source of technologicalinnovation and the most needful aide and guide in the tasks of socialist constructiongenerally. Lenin apart, Bukharin was the one true scholar-intellectual in the leadership of the pre-Revolutionary Bolshevik movement and afterwards in that of the Soviet regime\u2014until liquidated in the great purge of 1937/38. Admittedly, Bukharin was so much ahistorical-materialist theorist in his own right that Lenin had doubts about the ortho-doxy of Bukharin's Marxism. Admittedly, Stalin, who had shared supreme power withBukharin after Lenin's death in 1925, stigmatized Bukharin as a rightist deviationistwhen forcing Bukharin out of his most important leadership positions in 1929.Admittedly, among Bukharin's conflicts with Stalin leading to that ejection frompower was his disagreement with Stalin's concept of the Five Year Plan and specificallyDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 23 Stalin's principle of the priority of heavy industry. Bukharin's contrary view, as his biographer Stephen Cohen stressed, was that genuine industrialization would have tobe based on a technological revolution, and that therefore ' the scientific-research network must grow faster than even the leading branches of socialist heavy industry '. 107 Yet it is unlikely that Stalin, whose Five Year Plan aimed quite deliberately at a vast expansion of existing technology, could have imagined any objection to Bukharin'simplicit minor premise: a technological revolution\u2014were that the goal\u2014would have to be based upon scientific research. 108 In April 1931, Bukharin, then in his much reduced position of director of the Supreme Economic Council's Scientific-Technologic Department\u2014the very namebespeaks shared assumptions of the Soviet leadership\u2014gave the keynote address at anAll-Union Conference on the Planning of Scientific-Research Work. The text of thisaddress 'The Methodology and Planning of Science and Technology'\u2014with which I amacquainted through an as yet unpublished English translation prepared by ProfessorAlan Mackay, Birkbeck College\u2014shows quite clearly that the reason the harnessing ofscience to the tasks of socialism seemed to Bukharin so necessary and important wasscience's putative primacy to and for technology. 109 Of course Bukharin begins his address with the hackneyed, but canonical, demon- stration that 'Science grows out of practice, from the practice of the economy and fromthe practice of the class struggle'. Indeed, it is 'known to everyone that astronomy arosefrom the necessity of of orienting ourselves ... . Chemistry arose on the basis ofmining.' 110 More interesting as revealing the German idealism at the base of Bukharin's materialism is his proof of this origination of science out of technology through the factthat the inverse relation obtained in the Western world of his day. Thus after quotinga number of recent writers\u2014one British, one German, one American, one French\u2014allemphatic that contemporary technology is, and is increasingly, applied science,Bukharin, with much the same logic employed by Heidegger, insists that if we bearthese statements in mind 'we are directly required to formulate the position that thepractical roots of scientific disciplines are now uncovered'. 111 Does then the fact that, on the one hand, science originates from technology, while, on the other hand, science originates technology, imply to Bukharin an identitybetween science and technology? No, a historical-materialist revision of the bourgeois-idealist conception of science is not at all Bukharin's aim. On the contrary, his thesis isthat only the socialist state knows how to value science for its own sake; only undersocialism does science become truly free: The practice of the bourgeoisie really disparages science, putting it at the service of the exploiters, making it an exploiting science. This leads science into a cul-de-sac. Proletarianpractice liberates both the productive forces and science ... . 112 Bukharin does not condemn the bourgeois ideology of end-in-itself knowledge on the grounds that Marxism shows it to be an impossibility, but on the entirely practicalgrounds that the new state had urgent need of everything that science could provide:'the slogan: all in the service of the great socialist construction and the defense of theproletarian country. This slogan is the central directive of the whole planned scientificDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 24 P. Forman research work, the alpha and omega ... .'113 Idealizing and romanticizing science quite as highly as any bourgeois writer, Bukharin concludes his address with a paean toscience\u2014to science as something that, though not entirely self-sufficient, is yet in itsessential principle quite distinct and distinguishable: The bigger the elements of planning, reasoning, weighing, in the social economy, in living, in all social life, so much greater must be the role of science , which fulfills the principle of reason . Thus: Only ... increasing the specific weight of science in the whole social life of the Union, only courageously uniting it with the industrial and agricultural economy above all, will we beable to endure the great, world-historic examination standing before us. 114 It is no wonder, then, that 'pure science', generously supported by the socialist state (albeit not under just that rubric), flourished in Russia in the following four decades asnever before. 115 John Dewey Turning back from Russia to the Western world, there is one further proponent of the primacy of practice whose views must be considered. John Dewey was not merely themost prolific philosopher writing in English in the period between the two world wars;he was also the most influential. His stance, after freeing himself in the last years of the19th century from the thrall of Hegelian idealism, 116 was radically instrumentalist: Dewey was, during the entire first half of the 20th century, the most important andconsistent exponent of an instrumental conception of knowledge\u2014of every brand ofknowledge, but first and foremost, of science. Ihde, paying Dewey the highest compli-ment that a postmodern philosopher of technology has at his disposal, credits Deweywith having 'simultaneously with Heidegger argued for a precedence of technologyover science'. 117 Wrongly. As our review of the Marxian tradition of the primacy of practice has primed us to anticipate, it was simply beyond the capacity of a modernistintellectual, however radical and consistent an instrumentalist, to unthink the primacyof science to and for technology. Dewey, having exchanged the Hegelian world spiritfor that of science, would have been among the last to do so. To be sure, Dewey inscribed many a text that, taken out of context, implied some such precedence of technology over science. We can find in Dewey the same hackneyedattribution to technology of genetic precedence to science that we found in Bukharin: As the arts and crafts develop and become more elaborate, the body of positive and tested knowledge enlarges, the sequences observed become more complex and of greater scope.Technologies of this kind give that common-sense knowledge of nature out of whichscience takes its origin. 118 Further, in various ways and various places Dewey insists that 'the gist of scientific knowledge is control of natural energies', that 'the scientific attitude ... is ... a practicalattitude. ... Its interest in change is in what it leads to, what can be done with it, to whatDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 25 use it can be put.'119 Moreover, the practice and progress of science is inseparable from technology: The history of actual scientific advance is marked by the adoption and invention of mate- rial devices and related techniques\u2014of complex and refined forms of apparatus and defi-nite related techniques of using apparatus. 120 More than that, said Dewey in his Gifford Lectures (1929), The progress of inquiry is identical with advance in the invention and construction ofphysical instrumentalities for producing, registering and measuring changes. 121 Not only does science have its origin in technology, and retain a technological character and orientation in its modern development, but science, Dewey at least once went sofar as to say, 'is itself essentially a technology of apparatus, materials and numbers'. 122 Yet we must not allow ourselves to be misled by these statements, no matter how factually correct they may be. However far Dewey went in articulating an instrumentalview of science, and however often he repeated his indictment of the ancient despise ofcraftsmen as philosophy's original sin, setting it on the wrong path for millennia, 123 it is obvious that he himself assumed implicitly the superiority of teoria to techne and measured degree of good with a yardstick handed down from antiquity.124 This is evident in Dewey's off-handed use of hierarchical metaphor when referring to thosetwo activities: 'no matter how great his learning' the physician who merely subordi-nates the individual case to a general rule 'sinks to the level of the routine mechanic';and again, 'scientific inquiry has raised activities, materials, tools of the type onceregarded as practical (in a low utilitarian sense) into itself'. 125 Although Dewey assumed, he only rarely and only barely asserted, this social and moral superiority ofteoria to techne . 126 Yet the quoted terms in which Dewey disparages practice\u2014'in a low utilitarian sense'\u2014alert us to a set of more conscious and explicit prejudices,namely, the moral as well as intellectual superiority of disinterested to interestedknowledge. Of disinterestedness as virtue in every human endeavor, and categorically in every social endeavor, Dewey was both certain and assertive. That inferiority of the interestedto the disinterested, which Dewey as pre-postmodern took to be beyond question,alone and of itself condemned technology to a lower rank than science in civilization.Thus although the above quoted passage from Dewey's Gifford Lectures very nearlyequating science with 'invention and construction' continues with Dewey insistingthat, 'Moreover, there is no difference in logical principle between the method ofscience and the method pursued in technologies', 127 the 'in ... principle' conflation of science and technology ends right there. In the next sentence enters a 'practical' differ-entiation between science and technology, based upon a differential moral ranking ofthose two practices. The difference is practical; in the scale of operations conducted; in the lesser degree of control through isolation of conditions operative, and especially in the purpose for thesake of which regulated control of modifications of natural existences and energies isundertaken; especially, since the dominant motive of large-scale regulation of the courseof change is material gain. 128Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 26 P. Forman To our postmodern sensibility this reference to 'material comfort or pecuniary gain' suggests no disparagement of technology. Indeed, quite the contrary! However, wemust bear in mind that Dewey\u2014like Veblen, whom he greatly admired, and to whomhe stood politically close\u2014was of a very different mind. These two proponents of prac-tice shared a strong distaste for 'the pecuniary institution'\u2014as Veblen termed it\u2014bothas entrepreneurs in an antithetic economy of ideas, and again as political and economicsocialists. 129 Expressions of antipathy toward pecuniary aims and motives, and equa- tions of disinterestedness to virtue, are found everywhere in Dewey.130 To take just one especially passionate expression delivered at a depression-era conclave: Our discoveries and our inventions in the field of electricity and radio\u2014did the business men who operate our economic system produce these things? No, I say again. They wereproduced and invented by the scientists who were working disinterestedly and honestlyand who then placed the fruits of their labor at the disposal of others. 131 Consistent with his insistence that nothing truly good came from the efforts of the interested, nothing enraged Dewey more than the construal of his instrumentalism asan individualistically interested utilitarianism: when truth is defined as utility, it is often thought to mean utility for some purely personal end, some profit upon which a particular individual has set his heart. So repulsive is aconception of truth which makes it a mere tool of private ambition and aggrandizement,that the wonder is that critics have attributed such a notion to sane men. 132 An antipathy to the interested, especially the pecuniarily interested, has, since antiquity, been integral with a conception of the intrinsic superiority of science to technology.133 This ancient prejudice Dewey, like other moderns, shared. He took it as a matter ofcourse that science\u2014and the scientist, too, qua scientist\u2014being as such necessarily disinterested, are inherently morally good; not neutral, but good. Technology, however,is only potentially good, only contingently good, and more often than not, is not: 134 The technologies of industry have flowed from the intrinsic nature of science. For that is itself essentially a technology of apparatus, materials and numbers. But the pecuniary aimswhich have decided the social results of the use of these technologies have not flowed fromthe inherent nature of science. 135 Thus, Dewey's assertion quoted above that science 'is itself essentially a technology', seen here in context, turns out to be Dewey's foil\u2014just as the like assertion had beenAuerbach's\u2014in making the opposite point, namely, that there is in just this regard an intrinsic difference between science and technology, a difference that makes all thedifference. What Dewey here voices is what in every era prior to postmodernity nearly everyone firmly believed: the pursuit of science is intrinsically incompatible with the motivesthat ordinarily orient technological activities. We have seen even a Veblen insist uponthis, and so we should not be surprised that Dewey did too. Among the manyinstances\u2014early and late\u2014none better points up the alieneity to postmodernity of thatpresupposed incompatibility than the fantasy by which Dewey, addressing HarvardUniversity's Tercentenary Conference (1936), sought to convey 'the difference betweenthe aim and operation of the free individual in the sphere of science and in that ofDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 27 current individualistic economic enterprise'. To grasp this difference\u2014a difference that we in postmodernity no longer recognize\u2014Dewey urged upon his auditors their, ... stretching the fancy to the point of imagining a scientific inquirer adopting the stan- dards of the business entrepreneur. Imagine the scientific man who should say that hisconclusion was scientific and in so saying maintain that it was also the product of hisprivate wants and efforts goading him on to seek his private advantage. The mere sugges-tion of such an absurdity vividly discloses the gap that divides the manifestations of indi-vidual freedom in these two areas of human activity. 136 That is, what today we take as a matter-of-course mix of motives in any and every scien- tist, whatever the setting and the goals of their seeking, seemed to Dewey totally immis-cible motivations. So much so that Dewey could offer his Harvard Tercentenaryaudience the fantasy of their easy coexistence in a scientist as a reductio ad absurdum proof of the incompatibility between being personally interested and being scientific. 137 Dewey's conviction of the intrinsic goodness of science was no less modern than ancient\u2014and all the more modern in that he identified science with the methodemployed more than with the knowledge attained. However, there was a problem, avery large problem for a philosopher largely concerned as Dewey was with the inequi-ties and iniquities of the world as it is: factually speaking, the present human scene, for good and evil, for harm and benefit alike, is what it is because ... of the entry into everyday and common (in the sense of ordinaryand of shared) ways of living of what has its origin in physical inquiry. 138 But if physical inquiry\u2014and the emphasis is Dewey's\u2014is the veritable fons et origo of the modern world, then Dewey, having traded his theistic Hegelianism for an atheisticscientism, needed a scientistic theodicy. It was this: if the success of physical inquiryproduced much harm and evil on the human scene, that was proof only that mankindhad not yet learned enough from the success of physical inquiry\u2014had not learned toemulate that success and to order by intelligence the human scene as well. 139 Dewey stated and restated that faith over and over through five decades. Writing early in 1927, at the broad peak of his influence, he concluded his reply to an attackupon pragmatism by Lewis Mumford\u2014an attack that Dewey had reason to feel to betraitorous as well as insulting: The implied idealization of science and technology is not by way of acquiescence. It is by way of appreciation that the ideal values which dignify and give meaning to human lifehave themselves in the past been precarious in possession, arbitrary, accidental andmonopolized in distribution, because of lack of means of control; by lack, in other words,of those agencies and instrumentalities with which natural science through technologiesequips mankind. Not all who say Ideals, Ideals shall enter the kingdom of the ideal, butthose who know and respect the roads that conduct to the kingdom. 140 Dewey's reference here to 'those agencies and instrumentalities with which natural science through technologies equips mankind' is indicative of a view of technology asderivative from science. It was indeed Dewey's view that science held such comprehen-sive primacy to and for technology. Nor could it possibly have been otherwise. The 'inprinciple' primacy of practice not withstanding, By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 28 P. Forman and astronomy in practical activities not withstanding, the view of science as 'essen- tially a technology of apparatus' notwithstanding, Dewey was so firmly possessed by somany prejudices ranking science above technology in so many respects, that when headdressed the relation between the two he had necessarily to regard technology assubordinate and derivative entity. Over and over again Dewey states his completecertainty that 'modern industry is so much applied science'; 141 that 'in fact, the entire modern industrial development is the fruit of the technological applications ofscience'; 142 that 'practically every phase of our present technique of industry and commerce has its roots in some discovery made somewhere in some laboratory bysome scientist engaged in physical or chemical research'; 143 'that the application of natural science, through the medium of inventions and technologies, is the finallycontrolling and characteristic fact of modern life'. 144 One would be hard pressed to find any firmer or more categorical assertions of the primacy of science to and for tech-nology than those Dewey provides, in plenty. 145 Engineers and Industrialists We have seen that in modernity even grand theorists who took as axiomatic the deter- minative role of a society's material practices for the character and the contents of itshigher cultural productions, disregarded the logic of their intellectual positions whenaddressing the relation between science and technology. Similarly, as is now to beshown, in modernity nearly all of those who earned their livings maintaining, multiply-ing, and milking their society's material practices disregarded the logic of their socialpositions and affirmed science's primacy to and for technology. The evidence herepresented relates to the USA and to Germany, only. There are, however, in all Europeancountries\u2014and, in consequence thereof, in India, China, Japan and elsewhere aroundthe world\u2014many indications of prevalence of the conviction of the primacy of scienceamong engineers and industrialists, as well as among the elites exercising the powers ofgovernment. 146 France, in particular, is regarded by all who have made her their special subject as pre-eminently a country and culture affirming the primacy of science, andmore especially 'of pure science, of ivory tower science'. 147 At the other pole, ideolog- ical and geographical, anti-occidental Japanese racial and cultural nationalists of the1930s, though they rejected imitation of the West and insisted on 'a uniquely Japanesepath of technological development', nonetheless took the primacy of science as beyondquestion: The existence of scientific research, which may give birth to this new technological creativ- ity, will provide a firm basis for the cultivation of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and for thisreason the promotion of such research is currently an urgent necessity. 148 Between these two poles, stretching from the one very nearly to the other, Soviet Russia, just as Tsarist Russia, gave quite preposterous primacy to science in its ever-renewedeffort to 'catch up and surpass' the West. 149 The main focus of the case that I seek here to make is the USA, and so I return to GanoDunn, the man of affairs and influence at the national, even international, level, whoseDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 29 extravagant obeisance to science I quoted at the outset of this exposition of the primacy of science in modernity. Kline has amply documented the near universality of the over-estimation of science among American engineers from the late 19th century to the mid20th century, and shown that it is only in rhetorical excess that Dunn departed fromthe commonly expressed view of his peers. 150 Thus Dunn's affirmations to his fellow Columbia University alumni in 1930\u2014which reproduced in heightened rhetoricthe content of his 1912 presidential address to his fellow members of the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers\u2014were, Kline points out, very similar to the proposi-tions that J. J. Carty, chief engineer of American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), putto that same professional association in 1916 in his presidential address. 151 Indeed, Kline found that throughout the half-century before the Second World War 'presidentsof engineering societies followed the time-honored tradition of tying their field toscience (in a subordinate manner)'. 152 That subordination of technology to science was both in respect of science's role and in respect of science's rank: 'The investigator in pure science', said Carty, may be likened to the explorer who discovers new continents or islands or hitherto unknown territory. He is continually seeking to extend the boundaries of knowledge. The investigator in industrial research may be compared to the pioneers who survey the newly discovered territory in the endeavor to locate its mineral resources, determine theextent of its forests, and the location of its arable land, and who in other ways precedethe settlers and prepare for their occupation of the new country. 153 Ironically\u2014and because ironically, significantly\u2014the enormous expansion of indus- trial research in the USA in the early 20th century, far from diminishing the putativepurity of the extra-industrial investigator, had the opposite effect on the commonrepresentation of the scientist: in order to differentiate science from industrial research,even spokespersons for engineering and industry were pushed to heighten still furtherthe asserted cultural rank of the pure scientist, exaggerating still further science'sprimacy relative to technology. Thus Carty, continuing with this exaltation of thescientist, explained to his audience of electrical engineers that 'the work of the purescientists is conducted without any utilitarian motive, for, as Huxley says, \"that whichstirs their pulses is the love of knowledge and the joy of discovery...\"', and conse-quently that in the scientist 'there must be some of the divine spark and for him thereis no higher motive than the search for truth itself'. 154 Such extraordinary virtue and merit as Carty attributes to the scientist must needs create a corresponding moral obligation in engineers, and all the more so as engineersare so directly and so heavily dependent upon the results of the scientists' inspired efforts.Thus Carty, in concluding his 1916 presidential address, urged upon his audience: By every means in our power, therefore, let us show our appreciation of pure science and let us forward the work of the pure scientists, for they are the advance guard of civilization.They point the way which we must follow. 155 Carty's declaration was made as leading figures in American science, following the example of European countries locked in the First World War, were beginning to turntheir attention from making discoveries to making weapons. It was reaffirmed nearlyDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 30 P. Forman 30 years later in a late phase of the Second World War, with its far more thorough mobilization of scientists into technologists, by the man who then held Carty's hugelyenlarged research portfolio: 'all that we call Jewett, headof AT&T's Bell Telephone Laboratories, 'is nothing but the application of fundamentalscience discoveries and the employment of scientific methods for useful or desirablepurposes'. 156 This conviction was in no way peculiar to the Bell System. On the contrary, Kline found that in the inter-war years 'leaders of industrial research atGeneral Electric advocated the ... pure-science ideal more strongly than Jewett'. 157 The form of Carty's above-quoted invocation of T. H. Huxley shows that hisengineering audience was well familiar with his authority and his theses. Indeed, one ofthe stereotypic tropes through which American engineers exalted the pure science idealand enacted ritual self-disparagement was affirmative quotation of Huxley deploring'this phrase \"applied science\".' In 1880 at the inauguration of Josiah Mason's ScienceCollege at Birmingham, and specifically in the context of defending the plannedscience-based curriculum for that institution\u2014whose purpose the eponymous bene-factor had defined as being 'to promote the prosperity of the manufactures and theindustry' of Britain\u2014Huxley had said: I often wish this phrase, 'applied science,' had never been invented. For it suggests that there is a sort of scientific knowledge of direct practical use, which can be studied apart fromanother sort of scientific knowledge which is of no practical utility, and which is termed'pure science.' But there is no more complete fallacy than this. What people call appliedscience is nothing but the application of pure science to particular classes of problems. 158 That is, Huxley deplored the concept of 'applied science' because it could lead the prac- tical-minded person to think that pure science is unnecessary to his practical interests,as though there were some other form of science that is sufficient to the needs of thepractical man. To the contrary, Huxley insisted that pure science is not only the onlyscience, it is also the only significant source of such technologies as involve science. Kline set Huxley's statement as epigraph to his paper. In his most direct reference to it Kline wrote: In 1928 Charles Richards, former dean of engineering at two mid-western universities, repeated Huxley's argument of nearly fifty years earlier when he said that engineering 'cannot be classed as a fundamental science. ... It has often been classified as an applied science,although the term would seem to be a misnomer, for there is no other science than purescience.' 159 I.e. Richards regretfully renounced engineering's claim to be science of a sort. Survey- ing presidential addresses to American engineering societies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Kline found that they 'ignored the autonomous sense of applied science and moved its meaning toward the subservient end of the spectrum.' 160 Similarly, toward the end of that period, '[MIT vice president Vannevar] Bush and other advo-cates of engineering research in academia took rather weak rhetorical stances againstthe ... pure science ideal.' 161 If Gano Dunn was in any way out of line with his rhetor- ically extravagant obeisance to science, it was rather that: Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 31 By calling the engineer's creativity 'art,' the traditional definition of engineering, Dunn allowed his profession some autonomy within a hierarchical relationship that subordi-nated it to science. 162 Thus Kline stressed that in the seven decades following Huxley's 1880 address, Ameri- can engineers often construed technology not as 'applied science,' but as the applica-tion of pure science. In so doing they underscored the primacy of pure science and the indispensability of the pure scientist for technological advance, and they affirmed acultural hierarchy subordinating technology to science. A further indication of the American engineers' posture of proud subservience to the interests of higher forms of culture, and to those embodying them, is their appropria-tion of Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem, 'The Sons of Martha'. 163 The poem celebrated engineers as spiritual sons of Martha, Lazarus's sister\u2014she who, though she performedfor Jesus all the practical services of hospitality, was disregarded by Jesus in favor ofLazarus's sheerly worshipful sister, Mary. 164 The poem opens: The Sons of Mary seldom bother, for they have inherited that good part; But the Sons of Martha ... must wait upon Mary's Sons, world without end, reprieve, or rest. and its concluding stanza is: The Sons of Mary smile and are blessed\u2014they know the Angels are on their side.They know in them is the Grace confessed, and for them are the Mercies multiplied.They sit at the feet\u2014they hear the Word\u2014They see how truly the Promise runs.They have cast their burden upon the Lord, and\u2014the Lord He lays it on Martha's Sons! Ruth Oldenziel has drawn attention to the pervasive and continuing appeal to engi- neers of Kipling's parabolic presentation of the ideal of selfless self-sacrifice for thegood of the truly good. 165 While it must be said that citation of 'The Sons of Martha', in contrast with quotation of Huxley on 'applied science', provided engineers withdefinite grounds for self-esteem, the implication of their subordination in culturalrank, and their (self-imposed) subservience to those of higher cultural rank, remainsjust as clear and strong as in Dunn's characterization of the relation between the engi-neer and the scientist. 166 Pride of place, rather than of service, is the privilege of persons devoted to higher cultural goods and functions, among whom pure scientistsheld primacy. 167 This preposterous disparagement by technologists of themselves and of their worksrelative to 'pure science' was, manifestly, a general and consistent feature of Americantechnological ideology from the Gilded Age into the first decades of the Cold War. Thisis not to be rationalized by reference to any direct material or social interest of the engi-neers. On the one hand, as Seely has shown, through most of this period\u2014indeed, wellinto the 1930s\u2014American engineering education was not, and did not seek to be, basedon science in any direct or substantial way. 168 That is, American engineers held and articulated a primacy-of-science ideology through a half-century during which theirpractice was not, in general, based in science, and during which they were making noserious effort to alter their practice in that direction. At MIT in the first decades of the20th century the trustees chose a succession of physicists to head the institution, ofDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 32 P. Forman which the first, theorist Robert C. Maclaurin (1909-20), was highly successful in raising money from wealth industrialists on its board with a rhetoric of pure science as base forengineering. 169 This remained largely merely rhetoric until in 1930 trustees Gerard Swope, head of General Electric, and Frank Jewett, head of AT&T's Bell TelephoneLaboratories, initiated the transformation of MIT into a science-based university bybringing in Karl T. Compton, who did not merely insist 'that \"purely scientificresearch\" was \"absolutely prerequisite and basic to invention and development\"', butenergetically set about a corresponding reform of the institution. 170 Neither was this paradoxical exaltation of science over engineering a stratagem enabling leading engineers and industrialists to evade concern with or responsibilityfor the support of 'pure science'. On the contrary, as early as 1880, R. H. Thurston, asPresident of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, had 'exhorted the mechan-ical engineers to \"find for these self-sacrificing students of science, pure and applied,means sufficient to enable them to work efficiently and productively\"'. 171 As we have seen, in his 1916 presidential address to the IEE, Carty coupled his exaltation of thescientist with an explicit appeal to his fellow engineers to forward the scientists' work'by every means in our power'. 172 Two decades later, in the depths of the Great Depression, one finds again that same sense of obligation to, and concern for, the welfare of 'pure research', but with anemphasis upon practical benefits, befitting that time and the altered importance inpractice of science in the interim. Such is reflected in the formation by the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers of a Joint Committee on Scientific Research. Thatcommittee, on which scientific research was represented by pure scientists almostexclusively, had as announced objective 'to raise the standard of living and otherwisebenefit society as a whole through increasing production and employment by means ofa more widespread use of scientific research in industry'. To this end it undertook to'Study the importance of pure research to the public generally and the problem of itsadequate financing', and to 'Promote the thought of employing scientists in industryfor the purpose of interpreting the trends and results of pure research'. 173 Similarly, Kline found that 'industrial researchers at RCA, the Mellon Institute and AT&T ... allpaid homage to research in \"pure\" or \"fundamental\" science, either in universities orin their own laboratories, as the basis of their success'. 174 Fully consistent with these circumstances is the fact that, notwithstanding the great change in the typical life-world of a physicist as a result of the enormous growth ofindustrial research, the pure science rhetoric and ideology adopted in the last decadesof the 19th century by American physicists did not change in any significant way duringthe first decades of the 20th century. 175 The explanation for this unchanging ideology despite substantially changed institutional reality lies, presumably, in the increasedsupport that ideology received, not only in the culture at large but more specifically fromleaders of industrial research and technologic enterprise. This, again, is fully consistentwith the historiographic thesis here advanced, namely, that the actual, factual relationsbetween science and technology are not, in the main, determinative of the historicalsuccession of assumptions and opinions about that relation: the putative relationbetween science and technology is not, primarily, a matter of fact, but of cultural values.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 33 In the decade following the Second World War the ideology and self-image of US physicists did indeed change in important ways,176 but not at all in regard to the rela- tion between science and technology. This comes forward clearly with 'the Bushreport'\u2014in its title, in its text and in the history of the writing and the reading of Science, the Endless Frontier . Thus the stereotypic metaphor of exploration, embodying the indispensable leadership of science, is patent in its title just as it underlies its text. Bush's'idiosyncratic' advocacy of Wright Brothers'-like innovative activity as also being prop-erly within the scope of the proposed National Research Foundation was ridiculed byhis drafting committee. He obtained the inclusion of more elevated sorts of engineeringresearch only by overriding his committee. 177 'Yet', Kline observed with evident disap- pointment, even 'these modifications to the pure-science-ideal\u2014amounting to whatmay be called a \"basic research\" ideal\u2014seem to have been overlooked by most readersof Science, the Endless Frontier \u2014then and now.' 178 Rather, what almost all readers took away from the Bush report was what they brought to it, the unqualified affirmation of'the linear model' of technological innovation: Basic research leads to new knowledge. It provides scientific capital. It creates the fund from which the practical applications of knowledge must be drawn. New products and newprocesses do not appear full-grown. They are founded on new principles and new concep-tions, which in turn are painstakingly developed by research in the purest realms ofscience. 179 That 'age of faith in the linear model', as Hounshell aptly characterized the two decades following the Second World War, brought a proliferation of industrial research facili-ties in splendidly modernistic architectural isolation from manufacturing activities. 180 Viewed from postmodernity, the preposterous credulousness of that mindset seems asalien as that of the age which expressed its faith through the architecture of gothiccathedrals. 'If the General Electric laboratories have taught any lesson', a 1950 editorialin The New York Times stated, 'it is this': There is nothing so impractical in science as the man who thinks only of profits when he endows research; there is nothing so practical as the theorist who gives not a thought tomoney. 181 That faith in science\u2014in 'pure' science, the fons et origo of all major technological advancement, remained virtually unchallenged through the early 1960s.182 Indicative of this postwar persistence of the preposterous primacy of science to and for technology is William O. Baker's prepared response to C. P. Snow's address, 'TheMoral Unneutrality of Science', at the 1960 meeting of the American Association forthe Advancement of Science. 183 Baker, in the direct line of descent from Carty and Jewett, had come up through the ranks at Bell Telephone Laboratories, becomingdirector of research in 1955; he would head the laboratory, 1973-1979. Himself a phys-ical chemist, Baker had been chosen 'to respond on behalf of the community of scien-tists'. 184 He proposed instead to 'remark on a rather practical aspect of the matter, as becomes an industrialist'.185 Yet so far from bringing any perspective that we could today regard as appropriate to an industrialist, Baker disregarded the openings offeredDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 34 P. Forman by Snow to stress that engineering too was a source and an embodiment of moral values. In particular, Snow had insisted that the engineer was the scientist's peer inrespect of the aesthetic aspect of their activities. We should not restrict the esthetic values to what we call 'pure' science. Applied science has its beauties, which are, in my view, identical in nature. ... Right down in the field ofdevelopment, the esthetic experience is as real to engineers. When they forget it ... engi-neers are the first to know that they are lacking in virtue. 186 Baker, however, found in engineers\u2014that class of researchers forming the overwhelm- ing majority of his laboratory's workforce\u2014no virtues worth mentioning, and insteadplaced all hope\u2014including hopes for 'a cure for cancer, ... a defense against nuclearweapons, ... more reliable moon rockets'\u2014upon 'the ideas of scientific discovery' that'come one at a time from one person and one mind at a time'. 187 Astonishing, but true\u2014and what is even more astonishing, and more important for the historian to bear in mind, is that no one was astonished at that time. Yet howquickly that time would pass! It had taken more than three centuries for faith in disin-terested science as generator of technology's miracles to reach this height; in less thananother three decades that faith had all but vanished. The very rapidity of the descentfrom that height is a strong argument that the rise of skepticism about science as sourceof technological innovation is not to be attributed to the few, partial, and equivocalempirical disproofs of the alleged dependency of new technology upon scientificdiscovery that appeared here and there in the 1960s. 188 Rather, that descent, most precipitous in the decade between the mid 1970s and the mid 1980s, was a concomitantof the melting away of the modernist cultural presuppositions upon which science'sexalted rank and role relative to technology were based. 189 Among engineers and industrialists Americans were not exceptional in accordingpreposterous primacy to science relative to technology. In Germany too leading indus-trialists accorded science a primacy that was, as historians of technology there haverecently observed, 'more ideologically than rationally based'. 190 This circumstance I illustrated above through the conception of 'physical-technical research' put forwardin founding the Helmholtz-Gesellschaft in the aftermath of the First World War. Twodecades earlier, that same deference to natural science on the part of German industri-alists and engineers was displayed more prominently, more indicatively and moreinfluentially in founding the Deutsches Museum. Conceived and directed by Oskar von Miller, a highly successful and highly energetic electrical engineer, Das Deutsche Museum von Meisterwerken der Naturwissenschaftund Technik in M\u00fcnchen (The German Museum of Masterworks of Natural Scienceand Technology in Munich), founded in 1903, quickly became the world's foremosttechnological museum. Receiving its financial support largely from German industry,the museum was intended to be a monument and an inspiring testament to the achieve-ments of technologists, most especially German technologists. 191 Nonetheless\u2014no, not nonetheless: necessarily\u2014natural science was given precedence in its title. In its 'logo',similarly, the owl of science was perched above the gear wheel of technology. ThisDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 35 matter of the relationship between science and technology was dealt with quickly and decisively by its 'Protector', His Royal Highness, Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, as the open-ing speaker at its founding meeting: It is not my task here to make a long speech, but surely I am allowed to draw attention to the great significance of technology. Technology is nothing other than physics and physicsnothing other than natural science. The difference consists in this: physics teaches us theo-retically about the forces of nature and their utilization; technology carries that utilizationinto practice. 192 However pompous, the prince was not being idiosyncratic. The preliminary statutes adopted at that founding meeting defined the purpose of the Deutsches Museum as 'toshow the influence of scientific research upon technology and to make visually appre-hensible the historical development of the various industries, especially throughoutstanding and typical masterworks'. 193 If this statement left open just how exclusively the museum would propagandize for a conception of technology as dependent upon science for every step forward, the question was effectively decided through the adopted guidelines for collecting andexhibition: Such of the various branches of technology as stand in close connection with science are to be presented developmentally by means of historic apparatus, models, other typical andoutstanding masterpieces, as well as by means of drawings and documents. Attention is tobe given both to those branches of industry that originated out of scientific research andalso to those branches whose later development has been outstandingly influenced bymeans of scientific efforts. 194 In the following years this programmatic primacy of science was indeed extensively realized in the museum's practices, with physics dominating the collections and astron-omy being given an especially large and prominent place in the initial exhibition. 195 While we today would regard astronomy as well suited to illustrate a view of science asbased in and dependent upon technology, 196 such was by no means the museum's message. Rather, here as elsewhere, 'the technical artifacts stood above all else for scien-tific disciplines or were scientific ideas materialized' 197\u2014with the astronomer who conceived and employed the instrument, not the exceptionally skilled and ingeniousinstrument-maker who created it, accorded the role of its 'inventor'. 198 Yet it is also true that in Germany, unlike the USA, protests were raised against this intellectual and cultural subordination of technology to science, and more especiallyagainst the social subordination of the graduates of the Technische Hochschulen , the German engineering schools. The last years of the 19th century saw a revolt in theTechnische Hochschulen against the large place that had earlier been accorded mathe- matics in the education of engineers\u2014a revolt occasioned in large part by the disciplin-ary drive of mathematics toward increasing abstraction. 199 At the same time, and pointing in rather the opposite direction, these institutions began to agitate to obtainthe right to confer doctorates\u2014in consequence of which that right was accorded thePrussian institutes of technology in 1899 and to the others soon after. 200 The 'Dr.Ing.' and the subordination of mathematics to engineering instruction in the TechnischeDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 36 P. Forman Hochschulen put an end, largely, to organized efforts for institutional reforms, but some few individual engineers remained outspoken in deploring the continuing socialand cultural subordination of Technik . Loudest and probably most influential among these voices of protest was that of Alois Riedler, professor of mechanical engineering atthe Technische Hochschule in Berlin. For Riedler, who had been instrumental in fomenting the revolt against pure mathematics in the Technische Hochschulen , had the ear of the technology-friendly Kaiser Wilhelm II . When the constitutive documents of the Deutsches Museum came to Riedler's attention, he wrote von Miller demandingthat the museum not be used to pay homage to science, but to promote a conceptionof technology as culture. 201 Although our present day historians of technology are generally inclined to side with Riedler, and thus to attribute considerable importanceto his protest, F\u00fcssl points out that it found no resonance at that time, in that place:'scarcely one of Riedler's academic colleagues, to say nothing of the majority of tech-nologists and engineers, joined with his critique'. 202 'Revolts' Against Science Can the matter really stand as I have presented it? Is not the putative primacy of science already disproved by the fact of revolts against science, of which historical scholarshiphas recognized quite a few in the last two or three centuries of modernity? However, thehistorical-conceptual category 'revolt against science' is itself rather broad and loose. Itrequires to be examined in order better to understand what bearing the episodes socomprehended can have for the thesis of this paper, the primacy of science to and fortechnology in modernity. While some 'revolts' make seemingly inescapable difficulties,most of the episodes that have been categorized as revolts against science testify eitherto a conviction that science in fact enjoys a primacy that 'rightly' it should not have, orto a conviction that science is primarily responsible for the world being in so bad a wayas it is\u2014or both. Either way, they are implicit confirmations, fully or partially, of theprimacy of science. The revolts against science that present the clearest contradiction of my contention that modernity was characterized not only by a presumption, but also by an affirma-tion, of the primacy of science to and for technology are the populist revolts. NationalSocialism was such a populist revolt. 203 Similarly populist were the anti-intellectual ideologies of Jacobin France, Jacksonian America and Bolshevik Russia.204 Denials of science's science's right to primacy from any perspective, but specificallywith regard to its role in relation to technology\u2014followed from each of these rejectionsof, even assaults on, the alleged hegemony of a learned elite with its claims to superiorknowledge. Yet these aberrations gained traction for only relatively brief periods, thelongest by far being that of the Jacksonian decades in antebellum America. From about1820 into the 1840s the American popular mind was intimidatingly disrespectful of allforms of elite culture. 205 That phase passed, and by about 1850 the American cultural elite was giving voice to a sense of relief.206 By contrast, the romantic revolt against science that thrived in Germany in the last decade of the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th, for all its romanticizationDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 37 of 'the people', was never populist, always tended toward elitism in relation to culture as in ethical and aesthetic sensibilities. In that regard, but still more in the breadth andduration of its appeal, romanticism makes the most serious difficulty for my thesis ofthe cultural primacy of science in modernity. For unlike the populist aberrations,romanticism remained a powerfully influential tradition in German society into thelate 20th century, while elsewhere\u2014everywhere\u2014significantly influencing the outlookand the self-conception of self-consciously creative types: artists, most especially, butin varying degrees also scientists, and humanistic scholars, and, yes, even engineers.Indeed, some of the most romantic self-fashionings were those of engineers. 207 Yet by and large neither the episodic society-wide romantic revolts, such as that aris- ing in Germany following its defeat by Napoleon Bonaparte, and again that followingits defeat by Woodrow Wilson, nor the continuing romantic strain in the mindset ofthose self-consciously creative of culture, altered the role and rank relations betweenscience and technology in modernity. Making allowance for elements of an inversionof those relations with Heidegger and a few of his contemporaries, the primacy ofscience to and for technology was never in question among pre-postmodern roman-tics. This was in no small part because however much romanticism deprecated naturalscience, it deprecated technology even more. 208 All the aforementioned revolts against science present some difficulty, more or lessserious, for the thesis of this paper. It is therefore with some relief that I turn to the'revolts against science' in 20th century America. For these quite consistently are of the'science is responsible' sort, and are as such implicit acknowledgements of science'sprimacy. 209 This is evident if one bears in mind that such revolts are but the reverse of the almost universal readiness to credit science for all changes in the life-world that arefound wonderfully good. This readiness, so commonly noticed as to be a clich\u00e9, wasplaced on a scholarly foundation by Marcel Lafollette. 210 From her quantitative study of the representation of science in American middle-brow magazines over the first halfof the 20th century, she too gained the strong impression that 'Each new product andsocial improvement brought praise to scientists, no matter how little they had actuallycontributed to its development'. 211 It is therefore only logical that the 'dilapidated waterfronts, ... hideous ... factories, endless rows of monotonous dwellings, theunceasing roar and grind of urban life', led the Bishop of Ripon, joining in 1927 with'humanist' critics of modern civilization on both sides of the Atlantic, to call for amoratorium on scientific research. 212 That is, with the same logic, if the material conditions of life were deplorable, the blame was laid upon science, no matter thatscience actually contributed little, either directly or indirectly, to producing thedeplored conditions. Similarly, when the Great Depression set in, albeit that the massive unemployment was commonly described as 'technological', it was again science that was widely held tobe responsible. 213 For nuclear weapons science largely escaped blame, partly because the first to deplore them were the atomic scientists, partly because science was so gener-ally seen as indispensable to deterring Soviet aggression, but partly also simply becauseat that moment the general inclination was to praise, not blame, science. When, out ofDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 38 P. Forman the 1960s, there emerged intense anxiety about the effects of altered environmental conditions upon health, it was once again science that was blamed. President Johnson,handing out the 1968 National Medals of Science, reminded the attendees that 'Anaggrieved public does not draw the fine line between \"good\" science and \"bad\" tech-nology'. 214 While for critics farther on the left there was no line left: 'precisely science which should have been the wind of truth to clear the air, has polluted the air ...'.215 Unmistakable in these reproaches is the presumption of science's comprehensive responsibility for the world in whatever way and to whatever extent it has recently beenaltered by man. It follows then, both logically and in fact, that through the first threequarters of the 20th century the public looked to science's leadership in the remedia-tion of perceived social problems as much as in the achievement of new technologicalgoals. The Bishop of Ripon had his tongue half in cheek in 1927 when surmising that'the sum of human happiness, outside of scientific circles, would not necessarily bereduced if for, say, ten years every physical and chemical laboratory were closed', buthe then went on show his own faith in science by suggesting more seriously that thoseevicted researchers could, if they then put their minds to it, make a big contribution tosolving the problems of human society. 216 It was therefore a more than logical response to 'the rising revolt against science'\u2014 science as responsible for the industrial system in collapse\u2014that in 1933 PresidentRoosevelt appointed a Science Advisory Board, 217 and so likewise the National Association of Manufacturers's appointment four years later of a pure-scientist-dominated Committee on Scientific Research. 218 If FDR's exceptionally un-ideological, planning-oriented, inner circle expected little immediate relief of the nation'spressing economic and social problems to come from the expenditure of large sums forfundamental research in the natural sciences as was recommended by the president'sScience Advisory Board, their skepticism did not extend to doubts that science wasfundamental to every form of engineering, social as well as industrial. 219 In any case, the success of the mobilization of scientists to develop new technologies during theSecond World War quashed almost all skepticism from whatever direction and greatlystrengthened the public's faith in technical leadership by scientists. 220 The fullest expression of this faith in the scientist as both seer and masterer of tech- nology was the appointment by President Eisenhower, late in 1957, in response to thecrisis created by the Soviet Union's launch of an earth satellite, of a President's ScienceAdvisor and a President's Science Advisory Committee. Although the committee wascomposed almost entirely of scientists\u2014and those by no means 'rocket scientists', butbasic researchers\u2014science was the smallest part of its 'flabbergasting array of respon-sibilities'. The President, pressed and supported by the Congress, had accorded toscientists the roles of critic, judge, and leader in all matters relating to technology, rang-ing from new technologic systems, through remediation of problems with deployedtechnologies, to technologic aspects of economic policy. 221 In a very similar way in West Germany, as Carson and as Osietzki have pointed out, the members of the Deutscher Forschungsrat \u2014formed around 1950 to advise the central government on matters of science policy, and perhaps to play a more thanadvisory role in the distribution of research funds\u2014were initially drawn almostDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 39 entirely from the pure, natural, sciences, for it was taken as a matter of course that such scientists could and should speak also for technical fields.222 Likewise, Carson found, in the conception and promotion of a nuclear reactor station for West Germany in themid 1950s, The plans for the center, like many of that era, were instinctively predicated on the predominant linear model of technology development\u2014new science generates new tech-nology, and new technology changes the world. ... Science, finally, would supply theknowledge, imagination and (though this was negotiable) a substantial component ofleadership. 223 Just how unthinkable at that time was any other direction in which to seek salvation is suggested by the views of the otherwise iconoclastic Robert M. Hutchins. Then direct-ing his Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, Hutchins organized in 1962a 'Conference on the Technological Order', inspired directly by Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society . 224 Notwithstanding that Ellul explicitly denied science's primacy for technology, and notwithstanding that Hutchins was at about this same timeexpressing a very derogatory view of the moral character of natural scientists, at thisconference Hutchins, quite in agreement with the other conferees, saw only one prom-ising approach to the solution of the problems of the technological order: the recruit-ment of scientists into government to work on those problems. 225 Lewis Mumford In the 1960s and early 1970s Lewis Mumford reached the apogee of a career that had begun about 1920. Over six decades as wide-ranging and hugely prolific critic,synthesist, and proponent of cultural renewal in the broadest sense\u201425 books, over a1000 articles, columns, and reviews\u2014Mumford was one of the most prominent 20thcentury American 'public intellectuals', and he remains to this day a figure of primeimportance for several scholarly fields, the history of technology most especially. 226 Only with The Pentagon of Power (1970), however, did Mumford achieve the book- of-the-month-club middle-brow success that against 'the megama-chine' and 'science as technology' seem to spokespersons for science as among themost serious attacks they had to confront in that mutinous time. 227 Mumford was widely taken then, and he has been taken by historians of every stripe since then, asplacing little value and much blame on science, science both as a mode of thinkingand science as shaper of the contemporary life-world. Not without some reason:all Mumford's writing was imbued with 'Life' rhetoric and appeals to romantic-lebensphilosophisch values, a claptrap with distinctly anti-scientific filiations. 228 Thus Mumford's view of science, and more particularly of the relationship between scienceand technology, is both a necessary test of my contention of the continued primacy ofscience in Western culture generally through the 1970s and a necessary preparationfor discussion of the exclusion of science from the history of technology over thecourse of the 1970s. To anticipate: Mumford, for all his exceptionality, was in thisrespect\u2014affirming the technology\u2014noexception.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 40 P. Forman Born in 1895 in New York City, Mumford was of a generation of US artists and intellectuals who came to conceive themselves as in revolt against Victorian values,including, in particular, that full faith in science on which Deweyan pragmatism wasfounded. 229 Roughly speaking, most of my generation began as pragmatists. I studied Pragmatism and A Pluralistic Universe before I had read a word of Plato ... and the very first biographicnote appended to an article of mine in 1914 proudly stated that I was a pragmatist. 230 At the date mentioned, and for almost a decade after, Mumford identified himself primarily with science and as scientist.231 Now, however, early in 1927, addressing Dewey in the third person with some scorn and sarcasm\u2014'where on earth has he beenthese last ten years, not to have felt the sting of this criticism before?'\u2014Mumfordproclaimed his generation's recognition of the insufficiency of Dewey's 'belief thatsimply by understanding science and technology conceived as instruments we are in abetter position to fulfill the ends of life itself'. Acting alone, without a counterpoise in the creative imagination, our narrow instrumen- talism has left us impotent: all the 'agencies and instrumentalities with which naturalscience through technologies equips mankind' will not in this situation help us much morethan the king's horses and men helped Humpty-Dumpty. 232 Mumford was not taking issue with the subordination of technology to science implicit in the phrase 'natural science through technologies', already quoted in discussingDewey. There Mumford could not have imagined disagreement. What Mumforddeplored was pragmatism's 'preoccupation ... with science and technology' and 'thepragmatic acquiescence' to American materialism in the decades following the CivilWar. Turning to Dewey's version of pragmatism, instrumentalism, Mumford turnedad hominem . style 'mental rhythm', Mumford judged that 'Mr Dewey's pages are as depressing as a subway ride', that 'protectivecoloration' was a predominant quality of Dewey's mind, and that instrumentalism wasall too similar to the worldview of 'Mr Babbitt'. 233 Strenuously though Mumford, sometime pragmatist, sought circa 1926 to distance himself from Dewey\u2014as part of his program of exchanging his scientist persona forthat of a man of letters\u2014Mumford remained fundamentally the Deweyan: to almostevery one of Mumford's dicta over the following years regarding desirable transforma-tions of social and cultural life, one can pair a very similar Deweyan dictum. 234 As to the matter at issue\u2014'natural science through technologies'\u2014Mumford's appraisal ofscience, and not merely of science's role in relation to technology, was about as close toDewey's as was possible given that Mumford sided with the romantic artist's insistenceon personality as source of creativity, 235 and deplored the hegemony exclusive of Life that the abstract, mechanistic view of the world had won over man.236 That is, the Mumfordian romantic- lebensphilosophisch indictment of physical science affirmed the primacy of science for technology in the strongest, most categorical terms, insisting on the causal, determinative, originative role of science in relation to technology. The original mistake, which was responsible for all this misery, was committed when our scientists began to create a new world of steel and iron and chemistry and electricity andDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 41 forgot that the human mind ... marches from one to three hundred years behind the small group of courageous leaders.237 Only if science is supposed to have such a role in relation to technology could Mumford's critique of the world view of physical science constitute an exposure of thebasis and reason for our life world, the modern industrial-technical world, being asmiserable as it is. Mumford's romantic rejection of scientism not only bespoke hispresumption as modern of the primacy of science, but, ironically, led him, when heturned to the history of technology, to exaggerate science's putative primacy to and fortechnology. The earliest version of Mumford's repeatedly retold dramatization of the historical process by which the worldview of physical science became hegemonic, becamemodern man's incontestable ontology, appears in the opening chapter of The Golden Day (1926): Once the European, indeed, had abandoned the dream of medieval theology ... he turned to what seemed to him hard and patent reality: the external world. ... he took refuge inabstractions, and reduced the rich actuality of things to a bare description of matter inmotion. Along this path went the early scientists, or natural philosophers. By mathematicalanalysis and experiment. ... weighing, measuring, timing, decomposing, isolating\u2014alloperations that led to results. ... A new view of the universe ... was accepted ... because itwas accompanied by so many cogent proofs of science's power. ... science was ready, notmerely to bake the bread, but increase the yield of the wheat, grind the flour, and eliminatethe baker. 238 The protagonists in this 'drama ... of the coming of the machine into modern society', as Mumford would come to call it, are not technicists but philosophically engagedphysicists. And the image of the scientist latent here is the well-familiar metaphor of thepathfinder\u2014pathfinder in the realm of the mind, first of all, and then, consequentiallyand decisively, in the material world of technology and industry. In 1930 in an essay in Scribner's Magazine , Mumford, then in his brief philotechnic phase, expanded his account of the coming of the machine and strengthened it withfurther metaphors\u2014notably, scientists as a group constituting a military general staff: [T]he army of machines could not take possession of modern society until every depart- ment had been trained; above all, it was necessary to gather a group of creative minds, ageneral staff, who would see a dozen moves beyond the immediate strategy and wouldinvent a superior tactics. These are the physicists and mathematicians; without theirabstract descriptions, the useful habit of isolating certain movements and sequenceswould not have been adopted, and invention would probably have sought to repro-duce\u2014as in fact it first did\u2014cumbrous mechanical men or mechanical horses, instead oftheir abstract equivalents, namely, steam-engines, locomotives, rifles, cranes. Behind thescientific advance-guard came the shock troops, the miners, the woodmen, the soldiersproper, and their inventive leaders. Five centuries were needed to set the stage for themodern world. 239 All these metaphors and mechanisms by which scientists take precedence over techni- cists\u2014that is, precede modern technologies and technologists At: 17:39 23 April 2007 42 P. Forman A series of thinkers, Bacon, Descartes, Galileo, Bacon, Pascal, defined the province of science, elaborated its special technique of research, and demonstrated its efficacy. ... Atthe end [of the 17th century] despite the relative sterility of invention itself during thiscentury, there existed a fully articulated philosophy of the universe, on purely mechanicallines, which served as a starting point for all physical sciences and for further technicalimprovements: the mechanical Weltbild had come into existence. 240 The general staff of science had worked out the strategy of the campaign long before thecommanders in the field had developed a tactics capable of carrying out the attack in detail.... Leonardo, Andreae, Campanella, Bacon, Hooke ... and Glanvill ... wrote down inoutline the specifications for the new order: the use of science for the advancement of tech-nics, and the direction of technics toward the conquest of nature were the burden of thewhole effort. 241 That precedence of science to technology which Mumford ascribed there to the 16th and 17th centuries he then affirmed still more emphatically in describing the unfoldingof this drama in the 19th and 20th centuries. Directly out of physical research and theextension of its methods to other subject matters was emerging a new and better phaseof technological history, the neotechnic: With the neotechnic phase, two facts of critical importance become plain. First, the scien- tific method, whose chief advances had been in mathematics and the physical sciences,took possession of other domains of experience: the living organism and human societyalso became the objects of systematic investigation, and ... the extension of science herewas to have a particularly important effect upon technics. 242 Moreover, In the neotechnic phase, the main initiative comes, not from the ingenious inventor, butfrom the scientist who establishes the general law: the invention is a derivative product. ...The translation of the scientific knowledge into practical instruments was a mere incidentin the process of invention. 243 We have already heard from Dewey such denigration, relative to the abstract and disin- terested scientist, of those many engaged in making things that work. Mumford, to theend of his life an unreconstructed cultural elitist, was much less inhibited than wasDewey in affirming a continuing adherence to a hierarchy of values deriving throughPlato and Aristotle from antiquity: ... the fact was that a liberated scientific curiosity might at any moment prove as valuable as the most factual pragmatic research. Indeed, this freedom, this remoteness, this contem-plative isolation, so foreign to the push of practical success and the lure of immediate appli-cations, began to fill up a general reservoir of ideas ... it [science] came during thenineteenth century to act as a counterweight to the passionate desire to reduce all existenceto terms of immediate profit and success. The scientists of the first order, a Faraday, aClerk-Maxwell, a Gibbs, were untouched by pragmatic sanctions: for them science existed,as the arts exist, not simply as a means of exploiting nature, but as a mode of life: good forthe states of mind they produce as well as for the external conditions they change. 244 In just this regard Mumford's view of science changed drastically in the following decades\u2014not Mumford's view of the ideality, nor the ultimate reality, of science sodescribed, but his view of what in fact the pursuit of science had largely come to be inDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 43 the course of the 20th century. Yet in all of Mumford's subsequent railing against 'the expansion of science as mass technology' through which science has 'become demoral-ized by its very success as an agent of technology' and 'the scientist has forfeited thequalities that were exalted in the past as his special hallmark: his detachment fromworldly gains and his disinterested pursuit of truth', there is no mistaking either theprimacy that science continued to hold over technology in Mumford's mind\u2014primacyin rank as well as in role\u2014or the antipathy toward technologic activity as such that runsthrough all of Mumford's later writing. 245 The Mumford emerging from the Second World War increased still further theprimacy that in the 1930s he had attributed to science relative to technology. This cameabout in two ways, oddly antithetic but both typical for that period. On the one hand,this followed for Mumford, just as for his contemporaries generally, from the successof the wartime mobilization of scientists as technologists, especially their achievementof nuclear weapons. 246 The scientists' creation of new military technologies confirmed for Mumford his earlier view that the neotechnic technologies, those emerging in thelate 19th and early 20th centuries, were to be ascribed almost wholly and solely toscience. On the other hand, Mumford, like so many others, came out of the SecondWorld War even more strongly committed than he had been in earlier decades to 'theprimacy of mind'. 247 With Mumford this late-modern mentalism expressed itself as a further diminish- ment of the importance to be attributed to 'tool-technics' and to those occupationalroles engaging directly with them. Already in 1944 Mumford was half apologetic forTechnics and Civilization having been 'wholly devoted' to technics. 248 In the remaining three decades of his writing life, Mumford down-graded 'tool-technics' and increasedthe importance, throughout all recorded history, of theoretical science and of thepersons creatively engaged with it. Regarding material technics, generally, and tool-technics, more especially, as 'but a fragment of biotechnics: man's total equipment forlife', Mumford insisted that 'man's overdeveloped and incessantly active brain' was farand away the most important part of that equipment. 249 In the first volume of The Myth of the Machine (1967)\u2014and one of the intended allu- sions in that title is doubtless to his new big idea of the small importance of 'nuts andbolts' machines\u2014Mumford moved the epoch crucial for inception of mechanizationback from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 4th millennium BC. The decisive technicaltransformation at that dawn of civilization was the creation of the 'megamachine', a'radically new type of social organization', that is, a merely 'abstract mechanicalsystem'. Composed wholly of men and ideas, 'a product of myth, magic, religion, andthe nascent science of astronomy', the megamachine 'sprang directly' from 'astronom-ical observations and scientific calculations'. 250 Evidently, then, from early to late, Mumford affirmed emphatically the primacy of science for technology, elaborating accounts of how technology, ancient and modern,originated from science. More than that: Mumford affirmed not only the modernpresumption of the primacy of science for technology, but also the presumption, both modern and premodern, of the primacy of science to technology. Worse than that:Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 44 P. Forman Mumford, as romantic, had a consistently unfavorable view of technology, and of engi- neers more especially\u2014excepting, but only partially, the years from 1927 to 1935.251 In 1927, Mumford quite suddenly acquired, and then around 1934, almost as suddenlylost, a belief in functional architecture and the machine aesthetic as embodying andsymbolizing the emergence of a new cultural synthesis. 252 Yet far from that brief upward saltation in Mumford's valuation of technology being accompanied by adiminishment of the value Mumford placed on science, just the opposite was the case:given Mumford's presupposition of the primacy of science for technology, any eleva-tion of technology could serve only to elevate Mumford's valuation of science thatmuch more. 253 Even as Mumford was writing Technics and Civilization (1934), his philotechnic phase was waning. The telos of Mumford's narrative in that book, and the prospect that loosed his effusions there were of a life-fulfilling 'neotechnic' era in which man, societyand culture once again form a beautiful whole, as they had in medieval Europe. 254 Yet by 1934 Mumford was no longer able, as he had briefly been a few years earlier, to beenthusiastic about the engineer, i.e. about those persons professionally engaged in thecreation, deployment and maintenance of neotechnics. Notwithstanding that theneotechnic is exactly coincident with the period in which the professional engineerbecomes the characteristic, indeed nearly exclusive, operative and improver of technicsin all its aspects, Mumford gave the credit for neotechnics only to scientists, plus a few'distinguished individual inventors like Edison, Baekeland, and Sperry'. 255 In so doing, Mumford expressed disdain for 'the specialized, one-sided, factual education of theengineer', and adduced as its typical product Hans Castorp, the 'half-baked nauticalengineer' in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain . 256 As Mumford downplayed 'tool-technics' in the following decades, he found no occa- sion to elevate the engineer, not even the 'systems engineer'. In all of those laterbooks\u2014and not least in Mumford's biggest, The City in History (1961)\u2014even where the subject itself demands attention to the engineer, Mumford pays almost none. Theaccomplishments of engineers, if they are described at all, are treated cursorily andgrudgingly. 257 Thus the engineer and engineering are almost absent from The Pentagon of Power (1970)\u2014are not to be found in the index\u2014notwithstanding that the book's temporal focus is the 20th century. The valuations underlying that absence of the engi-neer and engineering were made explicit in an essay, 'Prologue to Our Time' (1975),that among Mumford's late writings comes closest to being a testament. Looking backon the 19th century\u2014for that century was the prologue to his time and was the last century whose art he approved\u2014Mumford found: Ranged alongside Rodin were the many mighty spirits of the nineteenth century\u2014scien- tists no less than artists\u2014who were equally exalted by a fresh vision of life. ... If all the tech-nical triumphs since 1815 had been wiped out the instant they occurred, the exuberantcreativity of the Western mind would still have made this one of the most notablemoments in human culture. 258 Science and art flourishing and enduring, while technology is obliterated. That, for Mumford, was ideal.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 45 The 1970s Were Still Modern: Erlangen School and Starnberg School Germany, because of its romantic tradition, presents a special case\u2014a case that remains special even disregarding the National Socialist period as extra-special. Onthe one hand, romantics denigrated physical science because of its close connectionwith technology, denigrated it as inseparable and indistinguishable from technology.Of this the later Heidegger is the most pertinent example. 259 On the other hand, German romanticism was always a Lebensphilosophie , a grounding of knowledge and value in 'life'\u2014'life' as the fundamental, irreducible, not-further-explicable, ground ofthe good. 260 To the extent that purposiveness was presupposed in this appeal to 'life' as grounding, Lebensphilosophie was a form of pragmatism. As such, German thought from the early 19th century to the late 20th century should, logically, have attributedprimacy to technology. Nonetheless, as we saw with Marx and with Sombart (andwith Veblen too, whose outlook was close to theirs), even the most principled propo-nents of the primacy of practice were prevented from being so logical by equallyfundamental prejudices regarding the moral and cultural value of disinterestedunderstanding. Thus little originality or independence of mind was required to proceed from the romantic animus against technology and physical science, if joined with a deep culturalpessimism, as it usually was in Germany, to a 'discovery', such as Heidegger's, of theprimacy of technology. 261 What required originality\u2014or, more than originality: radi- cal culture change\u2014was to break sufficiently with the romantic devaluation of technol-ogy, on the one side, and with the exaltation of the idea/ideal on the other side, in orderthen to be able to view technology without disdain and to view science without animos-ity as technology. No such un-antagonistic, non-punitive categorization of science astechnology was ever advanced prior to postmodernity. 262 However, on the threshold of postmodernity, in the wake of the 1960s revolt against value-free science\u2014whichnaturally found an especially strong resonance in Germany due to the romantic-lebensphilosophisch coloring of almost all German thought 263\u2014there appeared conten- tions regarding the real or required relations between science and technology that insome manner or degree assert the primacy of technology. It is then to sharpen thedistinction between the modern and the postmodern views of the relation betweenscience and technology, and to justify my taking the difference between those view-points as demarcation criterion between modernity and postmodernity, that I considerthe positions developed on this issue in the 1970s by the Erlangen school and by theStarnberg school. In 1962 the metamathematician-logician Paul Lorenzen, age 47, was appointed to a chair of philosophy at Erlangen University, joining there his friend, the philosopher-theologian Wilhelm Kamlah. 264 Their principal collaboration and the work that drew wide attention to 'the Erlangen school', was the anti-Heideggerian Logical Propaedeutic: Pre-School for Talking Sense (1967), which in 20 years sold some 50,000 copies.265 I surmise, however, that the book was written almost entirely by Kamlah, as Lorenzen,far from wishing to defame Heidegger, had much sympathy for at least the earlyDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 Heidegger's lebensphilosophisch pragmatism. Thus Lorenzen, in his principal program- matic essay, published in both English and German in 1965, quoted Dilthey's ... remarkable statement: 'Knowledge cannot Erkenntnis nicht zur\u00fcckgehen.) ... as a formula in which a fundamental change in thedirection of philosophy is contained, beginning in the nineteenth century and slowlyprevailing in the present time. 266 Lorenzen then pointed to Heidegger (and Georg Misch) as having 'made clear what it means that thought must begin with life'.267 Lorenzen was, namely, a metamathema- tician in the intuitionist direction and his program as philosopher was to carry thetranscendental pragmatism underlying intuitionist constructivism over to naturalscience. Through the construction of a 'protophysics' of length, mass and time, on thebasis of elementary physical operations, secure and indubitable foundations for natu-ral science would be created in a manner analogous to the intuitionists' founding ofmathematics wholly and uniquely upon elementary numerical operations. 268 Not yet in 1965, but eventually, Lorenzen would describe those fundamental physical opera-tions as 'technical'. 269 It is one further illustration of how close together, epistemologically, Lebensphiloso- phie brought the political left and the political right in Germany, that leftist Lorenzen credited Hugo Dingler, a radically rightist philosopher of physics of the previous gener-ation, with originating this foundationalist program and adopted Dingler's label'methodical'. Beginning with the edition of Dingler's unpublished 'Aufbau der exaktenFundamentalwissenschaften' (1943), Lorenzen devoted much effort to the resuscita-tion of Dingler's reputation as epistemologist. 270 Down to the present day tributes to Dingler have continued to be a distinguishing mark of the work of the Erlangen schooland its prolongation at Constance University. The principal elaborator and standard-bearer of Lorenzen's 'protophysics' program, and curator of Dingler's legacy, was Lorenzen's student, Peter Janich (PhD1969). Advancing rapidly to a professorship at Constance University (1973), Janich, aproduct of the 1960s revolt against value-free science, urged in his inaugural lecturethe desirability of a reformation of physics through which, 'in place of the musty ideol-ogy of the researcher who unravels nature's secrets, the physicist will understandhimself to have just one task: enabling technology '. 271 From that typical late-1960s new left 'ought'\u2014an 'ought' that remains modernist in its presupposition of technology'sdependence upon physics\u2014Janich advanced five years later to a seemingly postmod-ern epistemic 'is': doing experiments is more an activity to produce technical effects , which can be described appropriately as engineering rather than as a scientific activity, properly speaking, as aconstruction of machines rather than as an inquiry into nature, as an attempt to produceartificial processes or states rather than as a search for true sentences. 272 Then two pages later, from that epistemic 'is' to a seemingly postmodern 'ought': Consequently, the relation between natural science and technology will have to be definedin a new way. Natural science is to be understood as a secondary consequence of technologyrather than technology as an application of natural science. 273Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 47 Janich's epistemic 'is' parallels that of Felix Auerbach, whose 1923 book he probably knew.274 In that first quoted passage Janich denied experimental science the dignity of true, truth-seeking science, demoting it to the level of engineering. Janich, however,reveals through his rhetoric that, unlike Auerbach, he is not merely restating but actu-ally sympathizing with this long-familiar romantic canard directed against thosesciences not content to contemplate Nature but desiring rather to master Her. Thusbetween that 'is' statement and the following 'ought' statement there is a difference ofworldview: not only has Janich dropped the distinction between observational andexperimental sciences on which he had built his case, he has also reversed the differencein rank between science and technology. Though his arguments lacked logic, Janich did unquestionably deny science's primacy to and for technology, indeed reversed primacy as between science and tech-nology, and did so at a date, 1978, that must be regarded as not yet over the thresholdto postmodernity. In this radical form, Janich's 1978 claim remained an anomaly. So far as I have seen, neither Lorenzen nor any other member of the Erlangen school made a science-as-technology claim that went nearly so far. 275 True, in the late 1970s and early 1980s Technik was a key word for them, but it remained nothing more than that: a key word to which no content or thesis was attached.276 Janich was a prolific writer, but so far as I have seen he made the statements I have quoted only that once\u2014and that once wasonly in English. Far from this being his entrance into postmodernity, by the late 1980sJanich had quite backed away from this contention. 277 When it appeared again in his writings in the late 1990s it was no longer a demotion of science to the level of technol-ogy, but the elevation of technology as model for all higher cultural constructions, with science one among the others. 278 In this later form the asserted primacy of technology is quite in the spirit of postmodernity: pragmatic, pluralist, and free of the romanticanimosity and punitive intent that are so evident in Janich's contentions two decadesearlier. With an institutional prominence and intellectual-political controversiality far greater than any product of the Erlangen school was the 'finalization theory' proposed by theStarnberg school. This 'process through which external goals for science becomethe guide-lines of the development of scientific theory itself' was the conception ofthe task-group on 'Alternatives in Science' at the Max Planck Institute to Explore theLife-Conditions of the Scientific-technical World. 279 That institute had been brought into existence on January 1, 1970, to enable Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker to pursueon a larger scale the analyses, initially of nuclear weapons policies, that had engaged himstrongly ever since he put together the 1957 'G\u00f6ttingen Declaration' of German atomicscientists foreswearing work on nuclear weapons. The institute's title reflected the factthat von Weizs\u00e4cker, leaning out of his chair as professor of philosophy at HamburgUniversity, had been overseeing such extra-university analytical work, with extensionsto environmental preservation policies and third-world development policies, quite inaccord with the general extension of interest in the 'implications of science' amongscientists throughout Europe and America in the of the 1960s. 280Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 48 P. Forman Situated in the lovely town of Starnberg, on the large and largely unspoiled Starnberg Lake, 30 minutes on the S-train south of Munich, the institute afforded von Weizs\u00e4ckerand collaborators a sufficiently distanced view of the scientific-technical world, yetready access to the Munich headquarters of the MPG: the creation of the institute hadbeen largely on the initiative of its Executive Director and its President, who looked tovon Weizs\u00e4cker for advice on science policy and hoped that he would develop a solidscientific basis for government policies supportive of the MPG. As von Weizs\u00e4ckerhimself had relatively little interest in science policy and as he held no reins on his collaborators, his 'Alternatives in Science' task-group on science policy, made uplargely of left-leaning students and assistants brought along from his Hamburg philo-sophical seminar, turned from practical science policy questions to world-historicaltheorizing with the intention of providing a foundation for the 1960s demand for 'rele-vance' in scientific research. 281 Quite in contrast with the home-grown hermeneutical tradition that inspired the Erlangen school, the principal inspiration of the 'Alternatives' enterprise came fromtheir discovery of the writings of Edgar Zilsel on the social origins of modern science,and, still more, from the recent, Kuhn-dominated, Western historical-philosophicalliterature theorizing scientific development. Thus while the Starnberg group recog-nized in the Erlangen school its most pertinent, and largely similarly intentioneddiscussion partners, and shared the Erlangen animus against discipline-directed, for-its-own-sake science, the Starnberger emphatically rejected the Erlanger's demotion ofscience to technology (and, likewise, the Erlanger's 'Dingler-Komplex'). 282 Gernot B\u00f6hme, the Starnberger's leading spokesman, insisted that: Yes, the protophysicists maintain that the rules of thumb of the handworker reappear to a certain extent in science in a 'highly stylized' form. ... [However] the high stylization thattransforms manual rules into regulative ones giving a compulsory form to scientific behav-ior consists namely in this: that the determinative objects or conditions of the manual craftare transgressed, becoming ideals, and consequently the craft rules become criticizable andcorrectable on the basis of those ideals. 283 Thus the Starnberger, no matter that they devoted themselves to Zilsel-inspired essays on the origins of pre-paradigmatic science in craft techniques and practices, had nodoubt that science, being science, necessarily transcended its technological origins; thatthe creation of a science, any science, involves 'detaching the scientific experience fromits prescientific-technical origins'. 284 Far from challenging the epistemic presuppositions of modern disciplinary scien- tific realism, the Starnberger saw the world as comprising just so many natural kinds,to each of which there corresponded a science, and to every science a three-stageprocess of development. That is, to Kuhn's pre-paradigmatic and paradigmatic stagesin the development of every science they added a third stage of post-paradigmatic or'mature' science. The concept and warrant for this final stage they drew, ironically,from the overreaching claims of the theoretical physicists of that day, specifically thenotion of 'a closed-off theory' promoted by Heisenberg: 285 Thus using Heisenberg against Kuhn, had the para- digmatic stage of scientific development end the 'closed-offDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 49 theory' specific to that science. With its intrinsic truth realized, there remained no future for the now mature science except the acceptance of its 'finalization', that is, thedetermination of its future course of development by extrinsic, socially defined ends inplace of the internal logic of disciplinary development characteristic of the paradig-matic stage: The finalization thesis postulates that in the course of its development a science (discipline, or field of knowledge) reaches a state of maturity as a result of which it can be said to havecompleted its work. The fundamental problems of a discipline are resolved when a generaltheory for its subject matter is formulated. 286 Indeed, we assume 'theoretical maturity' to be the property by which the integration of externalgoals into the theoretical research program of a field is made possible and is required. 287 Thus, the paradigmatic phase of scientific development, often presented as the 'Golden Age' ofscience, must eventually come to a close in all disciplines. This does not, however, meanthe termination of theoretical developments within those fields; rather, it signifies thebeginning of the possibility of theoretical development in pursuit of social goals. 288 \u2014in other words, reorientation of research from disciplinarily defined goals to techno- logically defined goals. In this final stage of development of a science, any science, everyscience, 'scientific advance becomes goal-oriented and technologies are planned inconformity with theories'\u2014or should be. 289 Thus, far from intending to suggest an end of science as such in creating the term 'finalization' for that post-paradigmatic stage ofreconvergence upon technology, the Starnberger conceived that a science not onlyretained its elevated position relative to technology, but greatly increased its leadershiprole in relation to technological innovation\u2014and did so quite specifically through thepredictive power of its 'closed' theoretical apparatus. 290 That there is in the theory of finalization an array of unreflectively modernist preconceptions\u2014among which the primacy of science to and for technology is only themost pertinent\u2014becomes especially clear in the proposals made in the late 1990s forthe revival of that theory by two of its original proponents. 291 In the face of all the evidence of postmodernity, Krohn and van den Daele were still insisting on theinternal-external distinction and on the autonomy of science when scientists are beingscientists. 'We believe it'\u2014the internal-external distinction\u2014 all the more important and necessary in order to account adequately for both the involve- ment of scientists in the networks of innovation, on the one hand, and the functionaldifferences that remain between doing research and making money. 292 Krohn and van den Daele are perhaps even more out of touch with culture and schol- arship in postmodernity in continuing to conceive that 'science offers its mode ofoperation' as a model for modernizing societies to emulate: 'social and politicalmodernization assimilate the modes of scientific operation'. 293 The notion that science, as institution and as a mode of operation, embodies in the highest degree thevirtues of liberal, democratic, progressive societies, and hence any society aspiring toDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 50 P. Forman such virtues ought to take science as their model, was indeed widely accepted in the middle decades of the 20th century. It disappeared, however, and rather abruptly, atjust about the time that the Starnberg institute was shut down, on 30 June 1980. 294 The 1970s Were Still Modern: Bell and Lyotard Examination of the Erlangen and Starnberg schools has shown that even in Heidegger's homeland the 1970s remained on the whole very modern as regards the availableconceptions of the science-technology relation. An anti-modern, romantic view of thatrelation was possible, but a postmodern view was not. It is, then, all the less surprisingthat to the West, in France and in the USA, through the 1970s the primacy of scienceto and for technology remained firmly in place in the minds of even the most forwardlooking. As exemplary of this persistence of modernity, right up to the big break ca 1980, I offer the two principal late-modern conceptors of the future of the economy-society-culture complex, Daniel Bell, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard. Daniel Bell was the broadest, brightest, most imaginative and insightful sociologist analyzing culture and society in the USA in the 1960s and 1970s. He was also the mostwidely known and widely influential\u2014worldwide. 295 His 500-page The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting (1973) was the fruit of a dozen years of active reflection on the likely characteristics of an anticipated transformationof the conditions of production and of social life, in the USA in the first instance andeventually in the world at large. The venues for his forecasting efforts were chairs ofsociology\u2014at Columbia University (1959-69) and then at Harvard\u2014the NationalCommission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress (1964-6), and,more especially, the Commission on the Year 2000, which he founded in 1964 underthe auspices of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Cambridge, MA). 296 Those transformed conditions of production and of social life that Bell saw becom- ing established in America and Western Europe, and that he projected as becomingfully realized in the course of the next three decades, constituted what Bell called 'post-industrial society'. 297 Without any of Mumford's ambivalence, Bell saw historical stages as technological phases.298 Nonetheless, for Bell, just as for Mumford, technol- ogy was always only an epiphenomenon, a by-product of the codification of theory.Thus, at the core of Bell's anticipations of the coming post-industrial society is theprimacy of generally, centrality of theoreticalknowledge as the source of innovation and policy formulation for the society'. 299 Bell's implicit reliance upon his American Academy colleagues for his examples of 'the centrality of theoretical knowledge' as 'the basis of innovations in technology'appears in categorical assertions regarding physical-technical connections: The computer would not exist without the work in solid-state physics initiated forty years ago by Felix Bloch. The laser came directly out of I. I. Rabi's research thirty years ago onmolecular optical beams. 300 Bell's acceptance and exhibition of such exaggerated claims\u2014claims typical of the self-understanding and self-representation of physicists 1960s, claims whoseDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 51 scientific substance Bell himself only half understood\u2014is indicative of how fully Bell shared the physicists's presumption of the primacy of their science.301 Behind and beneath Bell's postulation of the primacy of theoretical knowledge, forming the bedrock of his imaginings, was an ideology: modernist, meritocratic,mandarinism\u2014a Deweyanism minus the faith in democracy. 302 To this ideology Bell gave voice toward the end of his big book in answer to its most basic question (onemight say its 'axial' question): 'Who Will Rule?' If the dominant figures of the past hundred years have been the entrepreneur, the business- man, and the industrial executive, the 'new men' are the scientists, the mathematicians, theeconomists, and the engineers of the new intellectual technology. ... In the post-industrialsociety, production and business decisions will be subordinated to, or will derive from,other forces in society; ... they will be based upon the government's sponsorship ofresearch and development, ... . The husbanding of talent and the spread of educationaland intellectual institutions will become a prime concern of the society; not only the besttalents but eventually the entire complex of prestige and status will be rooted in theintellectual and scientific communities. 303 Bell's 'venture in social forecasting', being in this regard so largely the wishful thinking of a modernist intellectual, appears now, from postmodernity, sheerest fantasy. Wellbefore the year 2000 it was clear that in anticipating continued growth of the power andprestige of scientists, and the triumph of meritocracy more generally, Bell's forecast wasdead wrong. 304 For the 1999 reissue of The Coming of Post-Industrial Society , Bell provided a lengthy foreword. Where previously the primacy of theoretical knowledge had been his 'axialprinciple', Bell titled this updating of his thesis 'The Axial Age of Technology'. Bell didnot consciously intend that title phrase to be an acknowledgement that he had beenwrong in the 1970s in subordinating technology so largely and fundamentally toscience. Blind to his past blindness, Bell's adoption of that title is another instance ofour unreflectively falling in with postmodernity's presuppositions, another example in postmodernity of all memory of modernity's presuppositions and of ourearlier attachment to them. 305 Bell was already well known in France when The Coming of Post-Industrial Society appeared in 1973. He had resided for a year in Paris as director of international semi-nars for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, 1956-7, and much of what he gatheredinto The End of Ideology (1960) had first been presented at conferences and seminars in Europe. 306 His new book drew even wider attention there than the earlier one and, notwithstanding its great length, a French translation appeared in 1976.307 Bell was thus a thinker of first importance for Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard as he approached hiscommission from the Quebec government to prepare a report on 'the condition ofknowledge in the most highly developed societies', published in 1979 as La condition postmoderne . 308 That there is a great deal of Bell's conception of post-industrial society in Lyotard's conceptualization of the postmodern condition alerts us to just howmodern this principal April P. Forman Lyotard shared with Bell the pre-postmodern belief in the primacy of ideas, including the centrality of the intellectual and social legitimation of ideas, and the intrinsicimportance of those making and shaking ideas. Moreover, Lyotard, exceptionallyamong the postmodernists, followed Bell in giving cultural primacy to science andspecial importance to scientists. Thus the main theme and thesis of La condition post- moderne is the emergent 'crisis of narratives', a growing disbelief in 'grand narratives', i.e. in those comprehensive, 'universal' social, cultural, and cognitive goals whose good-ness, rightness, and inevitability we conveyed to ourselves through narratives of theirprogressive realization. Science is centrally involved in this crisis because the grandnarrative, the characteristically modern mode of legitimation, is itself legitimated solargely by a narrative of legitimation about science, a narrative then being discreditedthrough widespread acceptance of anti-progressive conceptions of science. 310 Yet for Lyotard himself the incredulousness towards grand narratives that demar- cates postmodernity from modernity did not deprive science of its primacy. On thecontrary, as Fredric Jameson wrote in his foreword to the English translation, Lyotard transfer[s] the older ideologies of aesthetic high modernism, the celebration of its revolu- tionary power, to science and scientific research proper. Now it is the latter's infinite capac-ity for innovation, change, break, renewal, which will infuse the otherwise repressivesystem with the disalienating excitement of the new ... . 311 For all that the still half-modern Lyotard, much like the late Mumford, continued to look to science for mould-breaking novelty, for the truly revolutionary, the postmod-ern Lyotard recognized that the failure of credence in grand narratives, in collectivegoals, and in transcendent ideals implied a far-reaching pragmatic utilitarianism. Morethan that, the postmodern Lyotard recognized that such utilitarianism brings with it afundamental revaluation of science, of technology and of their relationship. Lyotard himself acted out this revaluation through that now familiar line of fallacious reasoning subsuming science into technology: because experiment decides scientificissues, and experiments depend on technology, technology is prior to and inclusive ofscience. 312 Most probably, Lyotard, like most others making use of this argument since the late 1970s, had it from Heidegger\u2014in Lyotard's case, most probably quite directly.313 For Lyotard, however, the function and application of this argument was different: notmetaphysical, but historical. Rather than being a romantic put-down of all modernscience, from the 17th century forward\u2014as it was for Heidegger\u2014for Lyotard it servedto distinguish the postmodern from the modern era: now, only now, in postmodernity,'The relationship between science and technology is reversed'. ('Le rapport de la scienceet de la technique s'inverse.' 314) Lyotard did not elaborate on this thesis\u2014nor could he, while placing his hopes for a 'saving power' in science\u2014but his intuition was very good,his statement prescient. As the 1970s ended, Lyotard was becoming distinctly postmod-ern\u2014and so also, unconsciously, was all the Western world. III. The Primacy of Ideology among Historians of Technology SHOT is a tightly knit organization, and, among its members, the distinction between outsiders and insiders remains highly salient.315Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 53 It is, I have argued, a defining characteristic of postmodernity that technology's putative role in the production of culture has risen enormously above and beyond that whichmodernity ascribed to it. Technology has now replaced science not only as the principalmodel for knowledge production, but has also replaced science as principal model forall those 'ordering' activities that constitute culture. Thus, as Lyotard presciently said,in postmodernity the relation between science and technology has reversed: technologyhas now not only the cultural primacy that science had enjoyed in modernity, but tech-nology has also assumed the leadership role in the science-technology relationship.Whereas in modernity science received most of the credit (and blame) for significanttechnologic change, and scientists were regarded as the most competent anticipators ofthe technologic future, in postmodernity science is reduced to technology's servitor,while scientific advance is itself conceived to be, hence made to be, primarily the resultof the application of new technology. Among the first to recognize this epoch-making change in the cultural significance and valuation of technology should be the historians of technology. They should havethe historical perspective enabling this recognition, and, one might think, their self-interest should support this recognition. While philosophers of technology, generallytaking Heidegger's writings as their prophetic texts, have been claiming prime impor-tance for technology\u2014and, as is their wont, absolutizing, not post-modern revaluation of the science-technology relation\u2014historians of technology,while wisely avoiding Heidegger, have also largely ignored this epochal elevation oftechnology, or, if noticing it, have generally deplored it and dismissed it as a failing ofthe popular mind. 316 Such unwillingness to recognize or accept an epochal cultural reorientation that affects so favorably the general regard of their subject, technology, and hence, poten-tially, of their discipline, the history of technology, is contrary to expectation anddemands explanation. The explanation lies, as it seems to me, in the peculiarly ideo-logical character of that historical discipline and in the specific ideology adopted by it,as it took its present shape between the late 1950s and the early 1980s. Ambivalencetoward technology, verging on antagonism, was characteristic of most of that disci-pline's founding figures, leading to a consensus that the mission of the discipline wasto keep technology down. At the same time, the predictable resentment over inferior-ity to science and to the history of science that modernity imposed upon their subjectand their discipline was dealt with through a consensus among historians of technol-ogy to keep science out\u2014and, where it could not be kept out, to put it down. Ideolog- ically set against recognizing that in postmodernity technology has 'gotten up', wayup, in cultural rank and in cultural role, and similarly set against allowing science tofigure in their history of technology\u2014or, if it must figure in some way, then as villain\u2014the historians of technology have rendered themselves effectively incapable ofrecognizing the reversal in recent decades of the rank and role relations betweenscience and technology. 317 Ever since its institutionalization at the end of the 1950s, the US division of thehistory of technology discipline has attributed enormous importance to Technics andDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 P. Forman Civilization and to its author, Mumford.318 Kranzberg, the principal entrepreneur of that disciplinary formation, considered Mumford's work as a model of the 'integrative'scholarship that his projected disciplinary association and journal should strivetoward. 319 Three of the eight the articles that Kranzberg assembled for his first number of Technology and Culture referred to Technics and Civilization , two of them offering highly complimentary notices of it in their texts.320 Over the next 6 years Kranzberg published some five pieces by Mumford in Technology and Culture , partly by printing what Mumford had already published elsewhere, had promised for publication else-where, or probably could not have published elsewhere. 321 Kranzberg was by no means alone among the founding figures in his admiration for Mumford. Hughes has been aneven greater as hisown goal the thoroughly Mumfordian endeavor 'to change our way of thinking abouttechnological and scientific change from the mechanical and analytical to the system-atic, organic and holistic'. 322 Moreover, the high rate of citation of Mumford in articles and reviews in Technology and Culture from its earliest to its most recent volumes testifies to the sustained esteem for Mumford among historians of technology.323 Thus Mindell, opening Between Human and Machine (2002) with several pages on Mumford, explained that, 'I begin this history of control systems with Technics and Civilization because historians of technology consider it a foundational text'.324 Mindell's senior colleague at MIT, Williams, at the time of this writing president of the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT), sought in 1990 to articulate just whyMumford was so important to her field: What is so untraditional ... is the way Mumford 'enlarges the canon of culture' to include technology. ... In Mumford's own words, to see technics as 'an integral part of higher civi-lization' represents 'a shift in the whole point of view'. This is his fundamental and lastingcontribution. 325 Taking on this task again in 2002, Williams then found, rather, that: His singular innovation and enduring contribution is his insistence on technics as anexpression of human personality. 326 Each of these assertions of an innovative and enduring elevation and humanization of technology sounds a bit forced, and, when the two are juxtaposed, even a bit desperate.327 This is not surprising when we bear in mind just how little support for such an elevationof technology turned up in our examination of Technics and Civilization \u2014and still less in Mumford's earlier and later writings. Surprising is, rather, that Williams and Hughes,and all those other historians of technology praising Mumford for his signal contribu-tions to the elevation of the subject of their study, could have read Mumford in that way. Indicative in this regard is Molella's construction of 'Mumford's enthusiasm for technology', of a Mumford 'fascinated by technology since childhood'. According toMolella, Mumford's interest in the history of technology originated in part in his fascination with machines ... . His youthful interest in technical devices, technical processes, and industrialpractices endured, ultimately informing his masterwork. 328Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 55 To see Mumford so, it is necessary to ignore Mumford's almost invariably pejorative references to every form of enthusiasm for, or fascination by, technology\u2014and thatdisdain is especially evident in Mumford's references to his own youthful interest in acareer in electrical engineering. 329 Similarly, one must ignore the clear and constant message of every one of Mumford's five pieces in those early volumes of Technology and Culture : 'because our own society is in fact over-determined by its excessive and almost exclusive preoccupation with technology', and because 'as a consequence wetend to read our own assumptions and habits into the behavior of other societies', allhistories of early man and early civilizations have mistakenly emphasized tools ratherthan ideas. 330 Ignoring Mumford's derogations of technology has a curious correlative, viz. ignoringMumford's emphasis on the importance of science and scientists for technologicaladvance over the preceding four centuries, indeed over the preceding six millennia. 331 Molella, after doing so through the course of his 1989 and 1990 essays on Mumford justquoted, finally acknowledged on his penultimate page Mumford's attribution ofprimacy to science for technology throughout history. Molella adduced this discredit-able fact only in order to explain why Mumford held to the, obviously false, belief 'thattechnology itself advanced': Accepting the conventional wisdom, he [Mumford] saw technology essentially as the product of prior scientific discovery working itself through successive levels of practice, aprocess of discovery and development that had gone on throughout history. Such beliefs,at least at the writing of Technics and Civilization , left him basically receptive to technolog- ical advance and optimistic about the future. 332 To anyone not initiated into the true beliefs of the historians of technology the quoted sentences are perplexing. To initiates, as we shall see, there is no uncertainty about theintellectual, even characterological, failing that Molella means to be pointing out inwriting of Mumford, 'left him basically receptive to technological advance and opti-mistic about the future'. Nor is there any doubt about the direct and necessary connec-tion between regarding 'technology essentially as the product of prior scientificdiscovery' and the belief 'that technology itself advanced': because it is impossible for any modern to deny that science advances, 'the conventional wisdom' that technolog-ical advance results from the advance of science must be rejected if historians of tech-nology are to be free to deny that technology does in fact advance. Consider Williams's handling of this same matter of the significance attributed by Mumford to science. In Williams's 2002 essay on Technics and Civilization there is, in truth, nothing to consider: the word 'science' never appears. 333 She manages to describe Mumford's conception of the neotechnic without any reference to science.Though she quotes and affirms Mumford as having presented technics as 'an integralpart of higher civilization', she explicates this not by referring to any higher elementsof civilization but to 'social and physical realities'. When she comes to Mumford's 1930essay, 'The Drama of the Machines', she refers only to 'miners, monks, soldiers, finan-ciers', notwithstanding that, as was evident in the long quotation from that essay givenDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 56 P. Forman above, Mumford put scientists forward as the primary actuators of this drama, as well as the most prominent actors in his portrayal of it.334 In her 1990 essay Williams had a more extended exposition of this drama, and with it her antagonism toward scientists found more overt expression. Mumford, as we saw,used a military metaphor for machine civilization's conquest of the West, describing'the physicists and mathematicians' as 'a group of creative minds, a general staff, whowould see a dozen moves beyond the immediate strategy and would invent a superiortactics'. Paraphrasing Mumford, Williams used a metaphor that inverted Mumford'affirmative valences and rendered the scientists' role sinister, while also diminishing itsdistinctiveness. Mumford suggests that industrialization is a sort of conspiracy, a takeover by hostile forces within, a revolutionary coup. Even more precisely, he implies a Leninist theory ofrevolution. The footsoldiers are workers ...; they are directed by a 'general staff', a party ofideologists (physical scientists and the like) 'who would see a dozen moves beyond theimmediate strategy and would invent a superior tactics'. 335 In Williams's, as in Molella's, 'handling' of Mumford we are encountering the antago- nism toward science and the ambivalence toward technology characteristic of thoseprofessing our contemporary history of technology orthodoxy\u2014which antagonismand ambivalence have rendered the orthodox unprepared to recognize the reversal ofprimacy of between science and technology in postmodernity, and have, more gener-ally, rendered them unprepared and unwilling to recognize the epochal cultural shiftfrom modernity to postmodernity. Thus alerted to the ideologies and strategies thathave disabled that recognition, let us consider them more generally and genetically. With the same purely symbolic concreteness characteristic of other creation myths, the source of the animus among historians of technology against science and the history ofscience is identified in the creation myth of the American division of the history oftechnology discipline. The story of the origin of their clan that every American histo-rian of technology knows and the great majority still believe, is set as epigraph to thefirst chapter of the book about the intellectual constitution of their discipline thatevery American historian of technology reads. 336 In 1957, as that story goes, a small group from among the still few practitioners of the history of technology in the USAapproached the History of Science Society, through the person of its then president,Henry Guerlac, with a request that the history of technology be accorded a placewithin that society, on the program of its meetings, and in the pages of its journal,Isis. Receiving the group at his home on a hill above the Cornell University campus, Guerlac, the highly cultured historian of French chemistry, rebuffed them: the Historyof Science Society would not 'condescend' to include the history of technology, and'Isis is not going to publish any articles dealing with it'. Walking back down the hill, that group, led by Melvin Kranzberg, resolved there and then to create a society, ajournal, and a discipline of their own. 337 This story continues to be generally believed and often repeated, even though histor- ical research by Seely, published more than 10 years ago in Technology and Culture , has shown it to be exactly the opposite of the truth.338 Seely found that officers ofDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 57 the History of Science Society had made overtures to the historians of technology then being assembled by Kranzberg under the auspices of the American Society forEngineering Education. Offering increased emphasis upon the history of technology inthe meetings of the History of Science Society and in the pages of Isis, Guerlac conveyed the society's enthusiastic interest in cooperation. But Kranzberg, ambitious, entrepre-neurial and confident that there were large constituencies with only marginal interestsin history that would be recruitable to a history of technology banner, already hadfirmly in mind to create a society and a journal of his own. 339 Inversion of circumstances seems to be the rule in the formation of disciplinary creation myths, but rarely is the psychodynamics of the inversion\u2014'they rejected usfirst'\u2014so transparent. Yet such inversions can arise and take hold only at some distancefrom the events requiring to be misremembered. Thus although, as Seely observed,'One way to distinguish between the history of science and the history of technologywas to distinguish science from technology', prior to the late 1960s that task of differ-entiation seems to have been pursued without much evident animosity toward scienceand the history of science. 340 Staudenmaier, in his systematic examination of the mate- rial appearing in Technology and Culture , 1959-1980, found that 'No theme, in SHOT's early years, seemed as well focused, as important, or as interesting as the relationshipbetween science and technology'. 341 Not until the late 1960s, fully a decade into the life of their new discipline, as it appears from my limited reading, did the historians of tech-nology begin to express antagonism toward science\u2014at first while still deeply engagedwith the conceptual problem of relating technology to science. 342 Only a decade later, roughly about 1980, did historians of technology turn their backs on that problem and,simply cutting the knot, declare the divorce of technology from science. Therewith thedisciplinary creation myth, with its 'they rejected us' thrust, acquired greater impor-tance and currency. This change in outlook\u2014from an unquestioning affirmation of the fact and the desir- ability of technology being imbued with and inspired by science, to an antagonistic atti-tude toward science (and historians of science) in conjunction with an endeavor toestablish disciplinary autonomy for the history of technology\u2014is traceable especiallyclearly in Layton's writings. 343 Contrary to the reading that historians of technology today incline to give The Revolt of the Engineers , Layton does not there contemplate a revolt against subordination to science. Published in 1971, but begun almost twodecades earlier as doctoral dissertation, the book opens, page one, line one, with a flatstatement of fact: 'The engineer is both a scientist and a business man'. 344 The revolt that Layton there had in mind\u2014the revolt that Layton found, and favored, amongAmerican mechanical engineers in the first decades of the 20th century\u2014is of the engi-neer as scientist against his pecuniarily interested alter ego, the business man. Here inthis book\u2014which when it finally appeared no longer fully represented its author'sviews in this regard\u2014Layton, whose original orientation was emphatically social-scientific, was still full of admiration for science, was in favor of whatever of sciencecould be found in the engineer, and fully in favor of the engineer thinking of himself as'an applied scientist': Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 58 P. Forman The cement binding the engineer to his profession was scientific knowledge. All of the themes leading toward a closer identification of the engineer with his profession rested onthe assumption that the engineer was an applied scientist. It was the cumulative characterof scientific knowledge that gave weight to engineers' claims to be the agents of progressand enlightenment. Similarly, the self-image involved transferring to the group attributesof science such as logic and impartiality. 345 Without a suggestion of ideological distance from the scientizing of that era, Layton was at once describing and affirming the perspective of the progressive engineers whosecause Layton made his own. While the book was still in press, Layton was writing 'Mirror-Image Twins: The Communities of Science and Technology in 19th Century America', presented in 1970at an important conference on science in 19th century America, and published inTechnology and Culture in 1971. 346 In that paper Layton remained, fundamentally, the admirer of science that he had always been.347 Overlaid upon adherence to the tradi- tional conception of science's moral superiority to insistencethat the 'technological sciences', or 'engineering sciences'\u2014created in the of the19th century by what 'might be termed \"the scientific revolution in technology\"'\u2014were to be regarded as the essentially autonomous and exclusive producers of new tech- nology in the 20th century. 348 Withal Layton's exposition remained temperate; there were no villains; no one had yet denied that engineers have minds and think. Thefarthest Layton there went was to complain that: The significance, indeed the very existence, of the scientific revolution in technology has been obscured by a commonly accepted model of the relationships between science andtechnology. In essence, this holds that science creates new knowledge which technologiststhen apply. 349 As exemplary articulation of this commonly accepted model, Layton adduced, in an entirely neutral way, that passage in Science, The Endless Frontier in which it is asserted that 'New products and new processes ... are founded on ... research in the purestrealms of science'. No antagonism was yet evident in the exposition. 350 Moving on three years to Layton's 'Technology as Knowledge', appearing in Technology and Culture in 1974, we find again this same quotation from Science, The Endless Frontier .351 Now, however, Layton is on the warpath; now the quoted assertion provokes an outburst\u2014principally, however unfairly, against historians of science: Clearly, if basic science is the source of all new technical knowledge, then technology itself produces no new knowledge, and the technologist's role becomes that of applying knowl-edge generated elsewhere. And this is precisely the theory we find in Singer, Holmyard,and Hall's History of Technology . Indeed, it was through the work of Hall and certain other historians of science that this theory was introduced into the writing of the historyof technology. 352 Two years later still we come in Technology and Culture to Layton's 'American Ideologies of Science and Engineering'. There he exhibited once again this same quota-tion from Science, The Endless Frontier , continuing it to twice its previous length to include text whose moderated claims of science's primacy ought to have been some-what mollifying. 353 But Layton was unappeasable. quotationDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 59 was that, 'In short, the scientific ideology interprets a symbiotic relationship as a case of intellectual parasitism'.354 There was something oddly retrograde in Layton's ideological development in the early1970s, turning away from the issue of social responsibility just when his milieu, and theengineers too, were turning toward it; advocating an epistemic conception of technol-ogy just when history of science was turning away from the intellectual to the social,and well after history generally had made that turn. 355 The logic lay of course in the issue of autonomy for the history of technology, for in modernity all (science-like)knowledge was entitled to autonomy. By much the same implicit reasoning that hadshaped the history of science in previous decades\u2014but by then no longer\u2014there couldbe no autonomy for the history of technology without autonomy for technology. ThusLayton was far from alone in conceiving emancipation of the historians of technologyin cognitive terms. In Technology's Storytellers (1985) Staudenmaier adopted and extended Layton's analysis, taking it that big step farther to the conclusion of a divorceof technology, and of its history, from science. He reasoned as follows: the popularityof the theme of the science-technology relationship among historians of technologycontributing to Technology and Culture ... is due to their concern to establish the irreducibly distinct nature of technological knowledge against a claim that modern technology is nothing more than an application ofscientific knowledge ... . For: the claim that science is the only objectively valid form of knowledge leaves technology'mindless', bereft of its own intellectual method. However: ... if technological knowledge is irreducibly distinct in its own right, then science cannotclaim the role as technology's sole source of knowledge ... . 356 From which Staudenmaier, moved by something more than logic, concluded 'that the science-technology relationship is an inadequate frame of reference', indeed an 'inap-propriate frame of reference'. 357 Behind this non-sequitur was an emerging consensus: the science-technology relationship was 'a thematic dead end in our field', was a prob-lem better ignored than addressed. 358 Thus if, as Seely said, 'One way to distinguish between the history of science and the history of technology was to distinguish sciencefrom technology', another way was intentionally and systematically to ignore science inwriting the history of technology. 359 Following Staudenmaier, historians of technology generally, and as a corporate body, have taken that latter course\u2014at the cost of misrep-resenting the mentality of modern generations past and of failing to apprehend thementality of our present postmodern generation. 360 Yet if there is any respect in which the historians of technology are today definitely postmodern in their assumptions and their practices, it is in their abandonment ofthat earlier program of fashioning the history of technology around the conception oftechnology as a specific sort of knowledge, i.e. in their ceasing to seek an epistemicDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 60 P. Forman basis for the asserted autonomy of technology, and hence their autonomy as histori- ans of technology.361 Nonetheless, their policy of ignoration of science, which policy they originally rationalized by an allegedly distinctive cognitive essence of technology,remains very much in place today. 362 One ground for this continued ignoration of science and the history of science is the perennial appeal of a 'they-rejected-us-first'disciplinary identity. 363 That is, if one considered only how very many protests by historians of technology against the primacy of science were being published at aboutthe time that Technology's Storytellers (1985) appeared, and have continued to be published in the following two decades, 364 one might be inclined to regard those publications as manifestations of the postmodern reversal in primacy then underway. However, taking into consideration the fact of their being protests, angryprotests, against a primacy that science was improperly thought to hold, they must beregarded as still fundamentally modern. 365 A case in point is Wise's chapter on 'Science and Technology' in Historical Writing on American Science (1985), the first volume of the new series of Osiris , published by the History of Science Society. Wise opened with an account of the then recentlypublished article by William Broad in the New York Times on Derek Price's last publi- cations, in which Broad found a rejection of the 'remarkably widespread wrong ideathat has afflicted generations of science policy students ... that science can in somemysterious way be applied to make technology'. 366 As stated by Wise, that 'wrong idea' of 'policymakers' ... depicts science and technology as an assembly line. The beginning of the line is an idea in the head of the scientist. At subsequent work stations along that assembly line, operationslabeled applied research, invention, development, engineering, and marketing transformthat idea into an innovation. A society seeking innovations should, in the assembly-lineview, put money into pure science at the front end of the process. 367 So far the argument could be a manifestation of the postmodern reversal in primacy. Then, making 'science policy-makers' the bad guys, 'historians' the good guys\u2014lumping'historians of science and technology' together as 'historians' without distinction(perhaps as the condition of publication of this protest under the auspices of the histo-rians of science)\u2014Wise's principal contention and conclusion was that: Refuting the assembly-line model stands as a main contribution of the historians to the discussion of the relation of science and technology in modern America. In its place, mosthistorians have asserted the autonomy of technology in relation to science ... . All knowl-edge is not science; technology is knowledge, too. 368 The breadth (and lack of depth) of this search for autonomy is evident in Wise's observation that: Historians of science and technology ... have put forward metaphors depicting science and technology as mirror-image twins, a married couple, a lemon and lemonade, opposingarmies, opposing meteorological fronts, or sovereign states. The key idea behind all themetaphors is autonomy. 369 So much stronger was Wise's concern to establish as fact the autonomy of technology from science than to inquire into the factual relations between science and technology,Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 61 that he proposed definitions of science and of technology specifically constructed so as to 'make the assertion that science provides the knowledge base for technology mean-ingless'. 370 Thus it is hardly surprising that in his review of the historical literature on technology in relation to science in the 19th and 20th centuries\u2014what forms thesecond half of his paper\u2014Wise quite ignored the primacy given science by nearly allwriters in that period, as also the view, almost universally held through that period, oftechnology as applied science. As cohesive principles for the discipline of the history of technology, the animus against science and the commitment to ignoring science have been inseparable\u2014with animusgenerally pointing the way. There is, of course, a certain incompatibility between thatmotive and that modus: one cannot ignore science entirely while still giving expressionto the animus against it. Typically\u2014and we have seen this already with Williams' repre-sentation of Mumford\u2014the animus can be glimpsed only here and there, while theexclusion of science holds almost everywhere. Thus the greater distortive effect uponthe representation of the past results from this exclusion of science from the history oftechnology. That distortive effect is the grosser the more important a place science didin fact have in the minds of technological thinkers and actors. In modernity that wasalways a highly important place, indeed a preposterously important place, as this studyhas shown. 'Marx and the Machine' (1984), MacKenzie's often-cited essay, is a good example of this motive and this modus working effectively together to distort the views of\u2014andthus our view of\u2014one of modernity's main men. Nominally examining the questionwhether Marx was a technological determinist, MacKenzie proceeded from theconviction, now a matter of course among historians of technology, that no good guycould be a technological determinist. Since Marx was, without argument, a good guy,MacKenzie found it unnecessary to make out a case that Marx was not a technologicaldeterminist. Quoting Capital over and over on the awful meaning of machine produc- tion for the production worker, MacKenzie simply avoided the question of Marx'sview of the cause and source of technological advance\u2014even on the page or two wherehe said he was discussing it. 371 Instead, MacKenzie focused upon Marx's definition of machine. Marx defined a machine as a mechanized hand-tool, a definition whichMacKenzie seemed to find quite insightful (but even Mumford knew better). 372 Marx, according to MacKenzie, rejected definitions which saw a continuity between the 'tool' and the 'machine', defini- tions typical of 'mathematicians and experts on mechanics'. While it is true that anymachine is analyzable as a complex of more basic parts 'such as the lever, the inclinedplane, the screw, the wedge, etc.' that 'explanation is worth nothing, because the historical element is missing from it' . 373 This is the first of just two, quite brief, 'by the way' passages in MacKenzie's 30-page text that address Marx's views on the contribution of science to modern industry.With science essentially excluded from MacKenzie's analysis, the slur upon 'mathema-ticians and experts on mechanics' is entirely gratuitous: even if Marx intended one\u2014and he did not\u2014it is irrelevant to anything that MacKenzie was arguing about MarxDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 62 P. Forman and technology that in Marx's time mathematicians and experts on mechanics typi- cally employed another definition of 'machine'.374 What, it seems, was important to MacKenzie was to draw out from among Marx's many references to science one that lent itself to an insinuation of a hostile and dismiss-ive attitude toward scientists on Marx's part. This is borne out by the one other passagein MacKenzie's text relating to science: The theorist of this waging of class struggle by technical means was Andrew Ure. His 1835 Philosophy of Manufactures concluded that 'when capital enlists science into her service, the refractory hand of labour will always be taught docility'.375 Among MacKenzie's numerous references to Ure\u2014all of them, apparently, second- hand from Capital \u2014this is the first, longest and the most strongly emphasized. Presenting Ure's thesis as though obviously correct, MacKenzie immediately providedevidence of Marx's whole-hearted endorsement: 'Marx cited inventions discussed byUre as means of doing this', etc. It is only later in MacKenzie's paper, in conjunctionwith another quotation of Ure to this same effect (briefer and without reference toscience), that MacKenzie revealed that scholarly inquiry did not support Ure's conclu-sion. 376 Marx had given MacKenzie a choice of a dozen juicy quotations from Ure's Philosophy of Manufactures , almost any one of which would have served MacKenzie's (impertinent) purpose of emphasizing that mechanization was obviously not in theinterests of the working class. 377 MacKenzie chose that one containing a jab at science\u2014though science was no part of MacKenzie's argument\u2014one whose 'conclu-sion' MacKenzie knew he would eventually have to question, but yet presented asunquestionably true. With both his references to science\u2014his quotation of Marx and his quotation through Marx of Ure\u2014MacKenzie had broken his otherwise strict silence regardingthe importance for technology that Marx attributed to science. In doing so MacKenzieadroitly insinuated into Marx an animosity toward science that was, presumably,MacKenzie's own. 378 Furthermore, the MacKenzie case suggests that animosity toward science and ignoration of science were not specific to the development of the Americandivision of the history of technology discipline, that, on the contrary, by the early 1980sthey were, or were becoming, international orthodoxies. Twenty years earlier, while the historians of technology were still seeking their disci- plinary identity through distinguishing technology from science, their future policyof treating technology without reference to science was being put into practice in thefield of American Studies. 379 Through its emphasis upon 'material culture' and its conception of the cultural history of American technology, American Studies wouldexert a major influence on the history of technology at large. In particular, The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America (1964), Leo Marx's description and critique of technological enthusiasm in the United Statesfrom the 1790s to the 1850s, had become by the early 1980s one of the half-dozenworks most frequently cited by American historians of technology. 380 Marx's roman- tic concerns, so like those of the Mumford of The Golden Day , are amply evident inDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 63 his title, and his view of the machine was and remained quite as negative as Mumford's had been in that early book. However, where Mumford, in discussing theEmersons and Hawthornes, the best who thought and wrote in the ante-bellum period, stressed the high value they placed on science, Marx ignored whatever thoseadmired writers may have thought and written about science\u2014and not only they, butall their contemporaries too. Not that Marx had a good appreciation, let alone madea good case, for the Jacksonian populist insurgency against the primacy of scienceand other forms of high culture that was occurring in the midst of his period. Hecited a couple of contemporary contestations of science's primacy, but, withal, seemsto have remained largely unaware of just how far and just why the era that he exam-ined was exceptional in that regard. 381 Rather, in line with the anti-science ideology emerging in American Studies in the early 1960s, Marx simply ignored his sources'references to science, or, if taking notice of them, construed them as references totechnology. 382 Marx's extended exposition of Timothy Walker's 'Defense of Mechanical Philosophy' (1831) is a striking example of willful ignoration of science.383 The very title of Walker's essay, 'Defense of Mechanical Philosophy', indicates clearly enough that he took theprimacy of science to and for technology entirely as a matter of course. Exactly thatallowed Walker to shift the issue from the machinery of modern civilization up to the higher ground of mechanical philosophy and to do so without the need for even a lineof justification. 384 Marx, however, represented Walker as holding a 'theory of the tech- nological basis of culture' and simply ignored everything that Walker said to thecontrary, even in the displayed quotations. 385 Another still more striking example of Marx's ignoration of science is his lengthy exposition and discussion of Daniel Webster's address at the opening of the NorthernRailroad in 1847. Touting Webster as 'keen politician, his ear nicely tuned to theprevailing mood', Marx displayed a long quotation from that address, of which the firsthalf is Webster's declaration that: It is an extraordinary era in which we live. It is altogether new. The world has seen nothing like it before. I will not pretend, no one can pretend, to discern the end; but every bodyknows that the age is remarkable for scientific research into the heavens, the earth and whatis beneath the earth; and perhaps more remarkable still for the application of this scientificresearch to the pursuits of life. 386 One might think it hard to overlook the importance, indeed the primacy, that Webster here gives to science, both as such and as source of all the technological advances thatWebster then points to. Marx managed not to mention science, and not only here, butalso in his repeated reuse of this quotation in his subsequent writings. 387 Although by the late 1970s Marx's interpretive approach had been severely criticized from the point of view of historical method and his topic had been redone much morethoroughly, rendering unsustainable his opposition between the popular technologi-cal enthusiasm and the sensibilities of that era's most sensitive writers, his reputationamong historians of technology continued to grow. Meikle thus found some difficultyin his recent 'Classics Revisited' review of The Machine in the Garden in Technology and Culture with 'the question of why this book has enjoyed such a major scholarlyDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 64 P. Forman reputation, especially among those who address the cultural history of technology'.388 In explanation of this unreasonably high regard Meikle suggested that: Even an internalist historian of technology could applaud a literary scholar who, however uncertain his technical knowledge, had chosen to situate the subject of this formerlymarginalized area of study at the very center of American culture. 389 Doubtless, this must be part of an explanation\u2014and, even as far as it goes, it is not much to the credit of the historians of technology as scholars. Yet it is insufficient\u2014most obviously insufficient in failing to explain an acclaim that is indifferent toMarx's manifest anti-technological bias, which bias led him to restrict ante-bellum technological enthusiasm to the less sensitive strata of the population. Or is it thatMeikle could and did take for granted that Marx's anti-technological bias was consen-sual among historians of technology generally, but 'especially among those whoaddress the cultural history of technology'\u2014that that is the unspoken understandingbehind Meikle's explanation? Meikle is also silent about science; nowhere does that word appear. It was obviously important to Meikle that Marx was wrong to underrate the pervasiveness of technolog-ical enthusiasm in America in the early 19th century, was wrong to belie that enthusi-asm in Emerson, Hawthorne et al ., for Meikle points Marx's error out in several places. 390 From his silence about science should we infer that Meikle thought Marx right in ignoring the great extent to which, in that technologically enthusiastic era,science got the credit? Was that again the expression of an unspoken understandingwith the readers of Technology and Culture ? 391 To be sure, there are exceptions to prove this rule of ignoration.392 That exception most pertinent to this study is Kline's 'Construing \"technology\" as \"applied science\"'(1995)\u2014published, oddly, not where the historians of technology who most neededto see it would see it, but in Isis, the journal of the History of Science Society. Upon Kline's deep and detailed knowledge of the ideological literature of engineering Irelied heavily in order to put in evidence the far-reaching affirmations by Americanengineers and industrialists of the primacy of science to and for technology, affirma-tions reaching even to professions of subservience to science. 393 Kline heard those engineers exceptionally well. Manifestly, he did not like what he heard. Not liking it,Kline sought to delegitimate it in the usual way, namely by imputing to those engi-neers inestimable motives: self-interested considerations of social status, of publicimage, of professional politics. Over and over, in one way and another, Klineasserted that, ... engineers, and industrial researchers construed ... the relationship between what we now call science and technology under the umbrella label of applied science , in order to promote their ... self-interests regarding status and financial support.394 For this 'self-interests' interpretation of engineers' and industrialists' construals of technology as applied science, Kline offered no evidence of his own\u2014none whatsoever.The one study, the only study, that Kline cited for such evidence, the study that remainsto this day conventionally cited for this evidence\u2014Layton's Revolt of the EngineersDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 65 (1971)\u2014provides none. Nor should it have, for Layton himself held no such view of 'his' progressive, science-emulating engineers.395 To my knowledge, substantial evidence supporting this 'self-interests' interpretation of engineers' and industrialists'construals of technology as applied science has never been brought, neither before norsince Kline's writing. 396 Unwilling to allow 'their' technologists sincerely to believe what, in modernity, everybody believed\u2014viz. technology's subordinate rank and role relative to science\u2014historians of technology regularly dismiss such affirmations by technologists as beingpolitical, if not cynical, tactics to gain social or economic advancement. This way ofexplaining such affirmations away has become a canonical trope among historians oftechnology, who would thus seem to believe that the dignity of their subject is mosteffectively revidicated by attributing self-interested motives and disingenuousdiscourses to their subjects. Such is their animus against science and their need toexclude it from the history of technology, that rather than allowing their technologistssincerely to depreciate themselves relative to science and scientists, they prefer todisparage their technologists' motives. How can it be that historians of technology are so preoccupied with freeing their subject from subordination to science and its history that they take it as an acceptable meansto that end to impute motives to their subjects that are narrowly, even basely, self-inter-ested? How can the passion to liberate their subjects from subjection to science bringthe historians of technology so to disparage and delegitimate their subjects' earnestlyprofessed beliefs? For this there is no adequate explanation without invoking a consti-tutive ambivalence toward technology in the discipline of the history of technology.How else could the founding figures have been such Mumfordolaters, soliciting forpublication in the early volumes of Technology and Culture his diatribes against tech- nology? How else could The Machine in the Garden , clearly deploring the enthusiasm for technology that it described, be taken up with such enthusiasm by the historians oftechnology? 397 Nor has that ambivalence generally been absent from the (ever-shrink- ing) sector of the discipline inclined to take the essence of technology as somethingtechnological, and whose very mission, therefore, was to vindicate that special andspecific form of knowledge. Layton, for example, although vehemently championingthe independence, autonomy and self-sufficiency of the engineering sciences in thecreation of new technologies, remained from first to last highly critical of the engineers'social values and social role. The categorical denial of technological determinism, and anathematization of anyone entertaining that heresy\u2014'No greater crime could be imagined' 398\u2014is surely the clearest and most consequential manifestation of that ambivalence about technol-ogy as fact and factor. Still, the route by which 'SHOT's antipathy to the ideology oftechnological determinism' became established as the 'official posture' of historians oftechnology was roundabout. 399 Within the diverse assemblage of ambivalent attitudes generally to be found in any adherent to the Society for the History of Technology inthe first decades of its existence, horror at the reality of technological determinism wasmore frequent than was denial of it. Even in the late 1980s, Hughes' stated oppositionsDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 66 P. Forman to technological determinism alternated with evidences of his continuing belief in tech- nological determinism.400 The younger generation gave greater importance to disciplinary ideology, thus entangling itself in quite a different inconsistency: by the end of the 1970s there was astrong consensus against 'autonomous technology', 401 but there was also, as we saw above, an almost equally strong consensus for the autonomy of technological knowl- edge. So, for example, Wise placed immediately following his claim, quoted above, that'most historians have asserted the autonomy of technology in relation to science', theparenthetical qualification: '(at the same time as they have been emphasizing that tech-nology itself is not autonomous in relation to economics, politics, and internationalrelations)'. 402 This contradiction remained irresolvable while historians of technology directed the thrust of their liberation movement towards the reconception of technol-ogy as an autonomous form of knowledge. 403 Since the mid 1980s, however, as the discipline lost interest in the quest for the cognitive essence of technology, and camemore and more to agree with Daniels that 'the big questions for us, then, will all haveto do with technology as a social phenomenon', radical denials of both technologicaldeterminism and of the autonomy of technology have become an orthodoxy. 404 With one significant exception: the loudly asserted 'autonomy of technology in rela- tion to science', to be accomplished by the necessarily tacit policy of ignoration ofscience in relation to technology. For this exception there is even logical reasoning: Since 'Technology' is defined as the application of modern (Western) science, and since Science is understood to operate free from all bias in its pursuit of objective truth, technol-ogy must not be impeded ... . 405 If historians of technology do not all reason so themselves, so at least they see their contemporaries as reasoning: science is too autonomous, its progress too indubitable,to allow technology to be considered as the application of it while still denying tech-nological progress and/or technological determinism. Science must be kept out iftechnology is to be kept down. Thus there is an anti-determinist orthodoxy, and anyone visiting the SHOT website will find posted a notice stating it and warning against violating it: While the notion that technology marches of its own predetermined accord still has a strong hold on popular sensibilities, specialists in the interaction of technology and culturenow understand that it cannot do anything of the sort. Technology is not autonomous;rather, it is impelled by choices made in the context of circumstances in ambient realms,very often in the context of disputes over political power. 406 In keeping with this doctrinal tenet, for the past quarter century SHOTites have taken as their mandated mission combating the mistaken 'popular' belief that technology isan autonomous agent in the ceaseless transformation of our life worlds. 407 That their message was more ideological than empirical, could not be admitted. Hence the almostwholly unearned importance attached to the social construction of technology (SCOT)and the ritual citations of The Social Construction of Technological Systems (1987), as though the mere statement of such a program constituted a conclusive proof of thefalsity of technological determinism. 408Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 67 The fact is, however, that postmodernity has disempowered most of the forces that in modernity were supposed capable of exercising some governance over technology.Among them, science, as we have seen. Consequently, technology is today not onlywidely, but correctly, regarded as 'unleashed'. Only by willfully blinding themselves tothe very real liberation of technology in, and in consequence of, postmodernity is itpossible for the historians of technology to regard the belief in technological determin-ism that they encounter at every hand as merely a persistent popular misconception. A constitutional ambivalence toward technology, and not merely an ignoration of science, must underlie this unwillingness to see how largely technology has risen inrecent years. The effect of that ambivalence is aggravated by the preoccupation of histo-rians of technology with their 'official posture', with the collective project of definingand policing an ideological stance. From the time that project got seriously under wayaround 1970, the historians of technology have been unusual in the extremity of theirdemands for doctrinal uniformity and for exclusivity of 'ownership' of the broad fieldof technology in history. 409 Although priding themselves upon their receptiveness\u2014 'We talk a lot in SHOT about the generous-spirited nature of our annual meet-ings' 410\u2014the historians of technology have distinguished themselves rather by their concern about 'sociological boundaries' and 'bedrock principle', about who has andwho has not 'closely adhered to established disciplinary precepts', about what theymust do 'in order to maintain their disciplinary identity', about the 'task of takingcommand over all the high ground of our subject', and about 'who is best suited to tellthe story of technological change'. 411 Never realistically attainable, and never in the interest of more and better historical understanding, that quest for ideological ortho-doxy seems today, with modernity abdicating in favor of postmodernity, not merelyexorbitant but antediluvian. 412 IV. Conclusion It is now fully 30 years since Mayr urged his fellow historians of technology to set themselves the task 'not to discover what the science-technology relationship actuallyhas been in history but what previous eras and cultures thought it to be'. 413 It is more than 10 years since Kline, introducing his exposition of 'Construing \"Technology\" as\"Applied Science\"' by quoting have heeded Mayr'sinjunction': Although [a] large body of literature has discredited the simple applied-science interpre- tation of technology\u2014at least among historians and sociologists of science and technol-ogy\u2014little attention has been paid to the history of this view and why it (and similarbeliefs) has been so pervasive in American culture. ... why historical actors described therelationship between science and technology the way they did and ... what this may tell usabout the past. 414 Yet this deficiency of the historiography of US technology to which Kline rightly drew attention is also a deficiency of what Kline himself there added to it. 'Construing\"Technology\" as \"Applied Science\"', so creditable for its demonstration of the perva-siveness of this technology-as-applied-science view among US engineers, did notDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 68 P. Forman pursue the question why US engineers held that view, and did not address at all the larger and more fundamental questions: why that view 'has been so pervasive inAmerican culture', and 'what this may tell us about the past'. Indeed, Kline deprivedhimself of the opportunity to address those questions when he opted to delegitimatethe engineers' discourse by stigmatizing it as a parole intended to advance social andeconomic self-interests. 415 To be sure, delegitimating discourse is what the history of technology, and the history of science too, has so largely been about in these past three decades. It is also,largely, what this expos\u00e9 of the preposterous primacy of science is about, but herewith an important difference. Whereas it has been a common conceit in our disci-plines since the 1960s that reduction to 'the social' provides the most satisfactoryexplanation of whatever it is that we pull out from the past\u2014a conceit now increas-ing pass\u00e9 416\u2014this paper casts further doubt on the explanatory adequacy of the 'the social' and makes a case for reference to 'the cultural' as a more satisfactory explana-tion for beliefs held by historical actors. 417 Thus, in order to explain discourse diverging so flagrantly from the demands of social self-interest as that found amonglate-19th and early-20th century American engineers, or from the demands ofsystematically elaborated intellectual positions as we found with Marx, and Veblen,and Dewey, the historian must needs invoke a power greater than social interests andlogical consequence. That power, the power that makes an historical era, is thepower of 'the cultural'. It is 'the cultural' that in large measure decides what the social interests of an era's actors are. Where it does not determine those interests themselves, it largelydetermines the extent to which an era's actors act in fact in accord with their inter-ests. To suppose, on the contrary, that we know those interests a priori , without first grasping the constellation of presuppositions constituting a cultural epoch,must necessarily lead the historian into anachronistic imputations\u2014as has been thecase with the 'social interests' explanation of the American engineers' self-subordi-nation to science. 418 The proper role of social and, especially, institutional explana- tions is then ancillary, with their greatest service lying in the explanation ofdepartures from the pattern or norm created by and answering to the reigningcultural values of the historical era. 419 Foundational is the existence of that norm, of those preposterous, but yet taken-for-granted, prejudices shared by persons sosocially, politically, and philosophically opposed to one another as a Marx and aUre, as a Dunn and a Dewey, as Thorstein Veblen and the National Association ofManufacturers. 'The cultural' can perform this 'epoch making' service only if it is not postmodern- ized into a multiplicity of coexisting incoherent cultures; can perform this serviceonly if, as modernity would have it, culture is conceived as a constellation of presup-positions integrating the outlooks of actors in diverse social situations over anextended period of time; can perform this service only if the historian's task is under-stood to be delineating that constellation of cultural values by connecting the 'dots' oftemporally, socially, and intellectually 'scattered' articulations. Without this, admit-tedly quite old-fashioned, conception of hardDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 69 pressed to conceive of, let alone define, distinct historical eras. If, furthermore, we reject the notion of historical eras as a modernist illusion, or, worse, oppression, weare inevitably also rejecting history as a scholarly discipline. 420 The imperviousness to the force of facts so evident in modernity's beliefs about the relation between science and technology exemplifies a circumstance often encoun-tered by the historian: culturally determined valuations are regarded as self-evidentinferences from obvious facts. Thus today, when notice is taken of the demotion ofscience in cultural rank, of the loss of confidence in the trustworthiness of scientists,and more especially of the loss of belief in basic research as the key source of techno-logical innovations\u2014all gradually gaining more force and effect since the late 1970s\u2014this change in our view of science is attributed to the force of facts; but to differentfacts by different folks. When asked for the specific grounds of our disillusionmentwith science, the softer heads say that science has been the source of deplorable newtechnologies, while the harder heads say that science has failed to deliver on its prom-ise to spawn new technologies. As always, what is fundamental is what is common toboth: a presumption that 'technology'\u2014where 'technology' stands for the totality ofreal world utilities\u2014is the only relevant point of reference. Thus the facts of the matterare of secondary importance; of primary importance are the cultural values\u2014andspecifically here, today, seeing no value in science except in reference to its productive-ness of technology. How differently matters stood in modernity! So differently that to some of us it came to seem urgent to bring into light and sight the true fact of the matter, namely, thatmodern science, and especially late modern science, was not really as modernityconceived it and lauded it; that only the smallest part of what governments supportedunder the rubric 'research' approximated to the widely accepted conception of scienceas for-its-own-sake pursuit of understanding. This task came to seem especially urgentwhere and as the scientists' confabulations regarding 'science' obfuscated the very largerole that the military was playing in the making of science through the generation anddistribution of that governmental support for 'research'. As Edgerton said a decade agoregarding modernity's insistence 'that science and war were antithetical to each otheror, at least, radically different enterprises': These stories, which were intended to be taken literally, were fairy stories, but ones that have bewitched many students of the relations of science, technology and war. The diver-gence between this picture and the most straight-forward empirical analysis of the rela-tions of science and war ... will astonish even the most hard-bitten cynic. Although manydetails of the relations of science, technology and war were not known by contemporaries,and much remains to be discovered today, the divergence cannot be explained by secrecy.There was always sufficient information in the public domain to yield a very differentpicture ... . 421 That 'divergence' between accepted truth and actual, available, even obvious fact, which Edgerton rightly found astonishing, is but another example of the impotence offacts when pitted against widely and strongly held cultural values. As we historians, inthe course of our studies of late modern science, became aware of this 'divergence' andof the more or less intentional obfuscation of involvement with theDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 70 P. Forman military, it seemed most needful to draw attention to what in modernity nearly every- one preferred to ignore.422 Today, however, in fuller consciousness of our postmodern condition, it is, on the contrary, most needful for us as historians to remind ourselvesof the strength and pervasiveness of modern values in the modern era\u2014values sostrongly held by so many as to cause Edgerton's obvious facts to be ignored. Hence theinvestigation that forms the core of this paper. Asking after the putative relation between technology and science in a sample of peri- ods, theorists, and practitioners, all biased toward technology, we have found that,prior to ca 1980, the primacy of science in cultural value to technology, and in cultural practice for technology, was very nearly universally presupposed, notwithstanding that the primacy of science itself as cultural value was continually challenged in modernityby a powerful romantic tradition among artists and intellectuals, and intermittently bypopulist upsurges. The rapid reversal about 1980 in the more than merely modern\u2014the millennial\u2014primacy relations between science and technology is unquestionablyepoch-making. If identified with the transition from modernity to postmodernity, thatreversal in the science-technology relation gives to this historical-cultural transition agreater specificity and a still greater significance. 423 There remains, however, the question 'why historical actors described the relation- ship between science and technology the way they did and ... what this may tell usabout the past'. My endeavor here to bring clearly into view the fact\u2014and the date\u2014of the reversal of primacy between science and technology is therefore appropriatelyconcluded with a brief indication of what seems to me the single best answer to thatquestion. The primacy of science to technology, and even the primacy of science for technol- ogy, has a long history extending back through premodernity. Consequently, inmodernity the primacy of science to technology was sustained not only by specificallymodern cultural values, but also by cultural values carried over from premodernity\u2014notably disinterestedness, the high value of which in the Greek philosophical traditionwas reinforced by elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition. If, however, it is moder-nity, specifically, that we wish better to understand, then it is the specifically modernvalues sustaining the primacy of science that demand our attention. Among those, themost pertinent and distinctive was modernity's 'methodism', its stress upon propermethod in all its doings, its insistence that the means are prior to ends, that the end isjustified, indeed sanctified, by the means and only by the means employed to attain it. The strength of the terms of deprecation that modernity directed against the maxim 'the end justifies the means' is a good indication of the strength of the cultural valueagainst which those adopting that maxim offended. Even in the restricted sphere ofrelations between states, where, as Realpolitik , that maxim was generally followed in practice, and had apologists for so doing, the acceptability of 'the end justifies themeans' was constantly contested, and that maxim was never asserted by its apologistswithout stated or implied reservations. Today, on the contrary, 'the end justifies themeans' is unapologetically asserted as rationale for policy and practice not only in polit-ical conflicts, but by all manner of institutions (institutions of research and higherDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 71 learning emphatically included). More, 'the end justifies the means' is the operative maxim in all personal relationships. Today, all is fair in love and war, what in moder- nity (as in premodernity) could be said only with irony. Modernity's preoccupation with method is evident in natural philosophy already in the 16th century and over the following three centuries science in all its forms came tobe identified ever more completely with method rather than with ascertained knowl-edge. By the mid 19th century 'the means legitimate the end' had become the axiomfrom which all epistemology proceeded. Similarly in modernity 'the means legitimatethe end' became the overriding regulatory axiom in conceptions of the state and of itssubjects, normative for, if not actually characteristic of, almost all aspects of theconstitution and conduct of authority. Method was at the center of such otherwisedivergent developments as British legal and parliamentary procedures on the one side,and Continental statist bureaucracies on the other side. Again, by the mid-19thcentury 'methodism' had become the only generally acceptable theory of the state\u2014pre-eminently of the liberal-democratic state, but scarcely less of the bureaucratic-technocratic administered state, and even, in a perverse way, of der F\u00fchrerstaat . In liberal-democratic states, or in such parties within the state, methodism was the guiding conception not only of the conduct of authority vis-\u00e0-vis the subject but also for achieving collective social progress. Because science was also the most persuasiveexemplar of collective progress through 'methodism', its cultural standing was doublyhigh: so high at the middle of the 20th century that science could be put forward as\u2014and widely accepted as\u2014a model for the functioning of a liberal-democraticsociety. 424 Today only unreconstructed modernists, like those seeking to revive the finalization theory of the Starnberg school, cling to so thoroughly outdated an ideal\u2014outdated above all through the postmodern disinclination toward, and loss of faith in,methodism. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the argument for science's high cultural standing as resulting from modernity's attachment to methodism applies withfull force only to\u2014and thus undergirds the esteem enjoyed in modernity by\u2014'purescience', science as for-its-own-sake knowledge. What validated such knowledge asknowledge was not its serviceability to some preset end, but the propriety of the means,the method, with which that knowledge was attained. To be sure, 'pure science', whileit was thought to exist, was esteemed not solely as methodist. I have repeatedly empha-sized disinterestedness in the foregoing exposition, and I could have emphasizedautonomy\u2014both of these virtues, in the modern mind, being especially, if notuniquely, characteristic of for-its-own-sake science. In all these regards, technology is the antithesis of for-its-own-sake science. Though like scientists, technologist could try to excuse themselves by distinguishing betweenthe essence and the use of their work, that excuse never worked so well for them as itdid for scientists. Technology's incapacity to create and warrant its own ends\u2014andconsequently its inherent lack of autonomy\u2014necessarily and unavoidably implied inmodernity a depreciative regard, a subordinate cultural rank. Moreover, modernity'smethodist motto, 'the means legitimate the end', is inherently inapplicable to technol-ogy. For technology the 17:39 23 April 2007 72 P. Forman technology is by definition a set of means to an end or ends, and it is to the efficacy and efficiency with which that end is attained that we necessarily look in order to eval-uate the goodness and rightness of the means employed (having bundled into ourmeasures of efficacy and efficiency whatever other ends are to be taken into consider-ation). In postmodernity, however, when the end does indeed justify the means, thereis an intrinsic coherence between technology and the perspectives guiding ourthought and action, a coherence that implies a high cultural ranking of technology.More than that: in postmodernity\u2014pragmatic-utilitarian, primacy-of-ends postmo-dernity\u2014technology is simply all there is, all there is apart from our de gustibus , not- to-be-argued-with, ends.

As regards the demarcation of postmodernity from modernity,the thesis here developed was presented briefly at the meeting of the Society for theHistory of Technology in Amsterdam in October 2004, and more fully in December2004 at the monthly Historical Seminar on Contemporary Science and Technology atthe National Air and Space Museum. The text of the earlier presentation, under the title'When is the Laboratory Postmodern?' was helpfully criticized by Robert Bud, OskarBlumtritt, Jonathan Harwood, Lewis Pyenson and Alex Roland. Notes 1[1] Edgerton, '\"The Linear Model\" Did Not Exist', provides ample evidence of the present popu- larity of pummeling 'the linear model'. Already in 1983 Callon, 'Society in the Making', 83,thought it important to stress that 'I am not simply repeating the already countless criticismsof the notion of innovation as a linear process'. Godin, 'Measuring Science', cites numerousexaminations of the historical relation between science and technology in the past 40 years. 2[2] 'The Turn to Technology in Science Studies' (1991) was recognized early on by Woolgar, and appropriately reflexively: 'In recent years there has been an almost indecent rush by somesociologists of scientific knowledge (SSK) into the social study of technology (SST), thisauthor being no exception'. Having made this observation, Woolgar could hardly avoid rais-ing the question, 'What accounts for this move from science to technology?' However, he didavoid addressing it, turning instead to the more urgent matter of the 'danger of forgetting thestrategic theoretical significance of the sociology of scientific knowledge'.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 73 3[3] I drew attention to the unwarranted confusion of postmodernism, a theory and ideology articulated by intellectuals in the 1970s and 1980s, with postmodernity, the historical era thenincipient, in Forman, 'Recent Science'. Postmodernism was a manifestation of the onset ofpostmodernity, but by no means the whole of it, nor even an accurate description of it. 4[4] Eloquent in this regard is Dear, 'What is the History of Science the History Of?' (2005). 'The question in my title', Dear explained, 'arises from an anxiety that the history of science as ascholarly specialty is less obviously self-defining than it once was'. Yet Dear, whom one wouldexpect to be among the last to renounce science as natural philosophy, is not protesting the confusion of science with technology by historians of science. Quite the contrary. Dear isincensed by 'the basic ideology of modern science', namely, its presumption that the instru-mental effectiveness of science is a result of the truth of its theoretical constructs. Dear insiststhat 'the instrumentality in modern science need not be seen as necessarily reliant on science'snatural philosophy' (pp. 404-5), i.e. even Dear now sees science as technology. 5[5] Fifteen years ago, at a meeting devoted to critical problems in the history of science and the history of technology, Laudan, 'Natural Alliance or Forced Marriage? Changing Relationsbetween the Histories of Science and Technology', S26, stated presciently and forcefully that'Where once technology was subsumed under science, now science is on the brink of beingsubsumed under technology; the old hierarchy is being turned on its head. If this inversionis adopted, we will have a version of the history of the relations of science and technologyin which the history of technology\u2014or technologies\u2014takes the lead and in the modernperiod science appears simply as one more technology. Moreover, the technology of arti-facts and processes that has dominated the history of technology will be seen as simply onesmall part of the bigger world of techne '. This radically postmodern prospect, deriving prin- cipally from the philosophy of technology, has largely been ignored among historians oftechnology. See, also, notes 29 and 31, below, and Section III generally. 6[6] With the very big difference that today our ends are totally 'individualized', i.e. are relative to, and chosen by, the individual person or corporate entity (Bauman, The Individualized Society ), and with the qualification that pre-modern Western legal traditions, both Roman and Germanic, have included a conception of justice as a means-sanctified end. 7[7] Harding, 'The Melancholy of Technology'\u2014but, as I noted above, it would be an even more serious mistake simply to equate 'Postmodernism' with postmodernity. 8[8] Zierdt-Warshaw et al., American Women in Technology , A3. 9[9] Kline, 'Cybernetics... as a Keyword, 1948- 1985', has accumulated evidence to test this conjecture, and his exposition includes thefollowing quotation, dated 1985, implicitly supporting it: '\"Information technology in itsstrictest sense is the new science of collecting, storing, processing, and transmitting informa-tion.\"' Yet because Kline was preoccupied with nursing a grievance over discourse 'subjugat-ing information technology to information science ' (529), he was not well prepared to see a reversal in discourse setting in at about that time\u2014a reversal exemplified, I surmise, by hisquotation. But to so specific and far-reaching a claim\u2014that in modernity 'technology' never denoted science too\u2014 counterexamples are not hard to find. For me, the nearest lying is the name\u2014National Museum of History and Technology\u2014given the museum which employs me ascurator of its modern physics collection when that museum was created in the early 1960s.Weightier as counterexample is The Engineering Ideal in Biology (1987), the program of Jacques Loeb and his students identified and described by Pauly. But Loeb's conception,emphatically an aberration in its early 20th century context, aroused Pauly's interest becauseof the emergence in the mid 1970s of our contemporary conception of molecular biology asengineering. That conception, arising out of the recombinant DNA controversy and firstappearing in the term 'genetic engineering', was initially opprobrious (e.g. George Wald, 'TheCase Against Genetic Engineering', The Sciences , Sept. 1976, as reprinted in Watson and Tooze, The DNA Story , 110). The opprobriousness At: 23 April 2007 74 P. Forman research program bespeaks its origin in a scientific milieu still modern. The neutralization of the negative connotations of 'genetic engineering', and the wide acceptance of that appellationby about 1980, reflect the incipient postmodernization of the general cultural milieu. 10[10] Capshew and Rader, 'Big Science: Price to the Present'. The reference is, of course, to Derek J. de Solla Price (Price, Little Science, Big Science ), the most ingenious of the historians of science of his generation. 11[11] Thus in 1992 Galison, writing 'Introduction: The Many Faces of Big Science' for the volume he edited with Hevly, treated 'big science' as an entirely serviceable term, the intent of theirvolume being to 'explore the many kinds of activities that are subsumed under the term \"bigscience.\"' Five years on, in Image and Logic , 553, Galison was contemptuous of that term: 'My view is this: as an analytic term, \"big physics\" is about as helpful to the historian of science as\"big building\" would be to the historian of architecture'. 12[12] Collins and Pinch, The Golem and The Golem at Large . The displacement of 'science' by 'tech- nology' is not the only postmodernization apparent in the title of their sequel: the displace-ment of 'everyone' by 'you' and Jamison, Hubris on the inverted order, 'tech- nology and science', and in their chapter titles speak not at all of science but only of 'techno-science'. However, Jacob and Stewart, Practical Matter , like Jacob's earlier work, Appleby et al. , Telling the Truth about History , is a defense of modern presuppositions\u2014here the primacy of science\u2014under a half ironic, half postmodern title. A contrived slap (p. 45) atShapin and Schaffer, Leviathan and the Air Pump , without naming them, let alone citing them, is indicative both of Jacob's anti-postmodern position and of the way in which she hereconducts her argument for keeping science ahead of technology. 13[13] For example, the 1992 parole of Nicholas Metropolis quoted in Forman, 'Recent Science', 119: 'Since World War II the discoveries that have changed the world were not made somuch in lofty halls of theoretical physics as in the less-noticed labs of engineering and exper-imental physics. The roles of pure and applied science have been reversed.' An early, indica-tive, and influential example in the history and philosophy of science is Hacking,Representing and Intervening (1983), with its 'anti-theoretical' intent stated in his preface. Kwa, 'Interdisciplinarity and Postmodernity', 339-41, draws attention to high theory's lossof primacy in the environmental sciences in the past two decades. Shinn, on the contrary,has argued for the central role of 'research technologies' throughout the 20th century, andconsequently argued against the existence of a postmodern discontinuity: Shinn, 'NewSources', and earlier publications cited there. 14[14] Typical for the period is Gilpin, France in the Age of the Scientific State (1968). Between his own preconceptions and French 'science' rhetoric, Gilpin remained oblivious to how littlehis quoted sources were in fact speaking about science. That capacity of 'science' to covertechnology long remained especially strong among the political scientists and science policyscholars, in good part because they have thought of themselves as scientists. Their discoursetoo began to shift in the mid 1980s, but only slowly. So, for example, although Rouban,L'\u00c9tat et la science: La politique publique de la science et de la technologie (1988), gets technol- ogy too up there in his subtitle, but in his very detailed table of contents 'science' appears 23times, 'technologie' only once. Needless to say, by rights the ratio should have beenreversed, for this work too is concerned with science only secondarily, with technologyprimarily. 15[15] Mirowski, 'Caveat emptor', drew attention to the acuity of David Noble and David Dickson who so early as 1981 ('By Force of Reason') were able to recognize the fact of a fundamentalshift having taken place in the USA in the late 1970s in the assumptions about what govern-ment science policy was for, and was to do. That long paper and also Dickson's The New Politics of Science (1984) are impressively perceptive, informed and documented descriptions of the reversed relation between science and technology. It is thus the more striking thatNoble and Dickson were not then yet able to unthink the primacy ofDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 and Technology 75 science , which assumption enabled 'science' to stand for technology too, not only in the title of Dickson's book but through the text as well. (As noted below, note 73, a Marxian perspectivestrongly supported that assumption.) By 1985 Elzinga had recognized that 'The science policy of the 1960s underwent a transformation into what is more properly called technology policyin the 1970s and thereafter innovation policy in the 1980s. The end result has been the end ofscience policy. Science policy\u2014in the sense of polity for science\u2014ceased to exist'. Elzinga,'Research, Bureaucracy', 194, to which my attention was drawn by Kwa, 'Interdisciplinarity',337-8, again making that point. Likewise, Kwa, 'Programming', abstract: 'Prior to 1980, fund-ing agencies spoke in the name of science to the national states, articulating the needs ofscience. They now speak to science'. 16[16] Already in 1979 Lyotard, La condition postmoderne , 77 ( The Postmodern Condition , 47), had asserted that 'Le rapport de la science et de la technique s'inverse' ('The relationship betweenscience and technology is reversed'). Beginning in the early 1980s, Lyotard began to use theterm 'technoscience'\u2014which he neither invented, nor claimed to have invented. In anotherpaper I will explore the origins and progress of 'technoscience' in some detail, likewise asindex of the course of the modern-postmodern transition. 17[17] Latour and Woolgar, Laboratory Life ; Latour, 'Give Me a Laboratory', 159-69. 18[18] Latour, Science in Action , 131-2, 168-9. (My attention was drawn to Latour's two very brief discussions of the science-technology relation by Radder, 'Technology and Theory inExperimental Science', 158.) Probably important for that reversal in Latour's conception ofprimacy in the science-technology relation, but certainly important for the introduction ofthe primacy of technology into the history of science, science studies, and humanistic studiesmore generally, were Leviathan and the Air-Pump (1985). 19[19] The scholarly reviews of Science in Action that I have seen are by Amsterdamska, Bijker, Etzkowitz, Goldman, Hacking, Jardine, Myers, Oldroyd, Overman, Pinch, Rocque, Rose,Shapin, Shrum, Star and Yearly. Those taking notice of Latour's equation/conflation ofscience and technology are Etzkowitz, Goldman and Shrum. 20[20] It received its highest praise in the Times Literary Supplement , where Jardine concluded his review: 'This is no mere bricolage, but a coherent and powerful framework for research. Ipredict that Science in Action will have an impact comparable to that of Thomas Kuhn'sStructure of Scientific Revolutions both as a provocation to philosophers and as an inspira-tion to sociologists and historians of science'. 21[21] A good indication of the organized resistance to the conflation of science with technology is Lecourt's prefatory material to Dictionnaire d'histoire et de philosophie des sciences (1999). And a good indication of what is being resisted is Tekhnema: Journal of Philosophy and Technology , http://tekhnema.free.fr, or, still better, the career of Bernard Stiegler, the second successor toPierre Boulez as director of the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique(Ircam) at the Centre Pompidou. For biographical background and interviews, see: http://www.rouge.com.au/3/ister.html; accessed 16 November 2004. 22[22] In Science in Action , 29, Latour claimed to be coining the term and the Anglophone world of science studies has taken him at his word; so, for example, Shapin in his review of the book inSocial Studies of Science . Then, in a note (n. 1, p. 548) added in proof, Shapin reports a personal communication from Latour admitting that he had not in fact invented the wordand alleging that he had it from Heidegger. That too is an invention\u2014and not on Latour'spart only (as I will show in another paper)\u2014an invention indicative of the importance givenHeidegger by Latour and by the philosophic milieu in France. (On which see note 37, below.) 23[23] Pestre and Krige, , 4. Numerous examples of such rhetorical concessions by physicists and mathematicians to thepost-First World War cultural milieu of German Central Europe are given in Forman,'Weimar Culture'.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 76 P. Forman 25[25] This invidious distinction between observational and experimental sciences, i.e. between those attentive to nature and those tormentive of nature, was quite generally maintained by Germanromantics from and Goethe onward. Humboldt's experiments on animal electricity: 'It isthe naked knife of reason that shamelessly wants to measure out Nature, who is alwaysungraspable and in all her points honorable and unfathomable'. H\u00f6pfner, Wissenschaft wider die Zeit , 58-62, arguing agreement between Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg) and Goethe regarding experimental science, and more especially physics, displays parallelquotations deploring such science as 'tearing phenomena out of their context', 'tearingoff Nature's limbs on the torture rack' or 'with sharp knife cuts'. (The image goes back ofcourse to Francis Bacon, but not the animus.) And Riese, 'The Impact of Romanticism on theExperimental Method', 19, Goethe-idolizing physiologist Johannes M\u00fcller:'The text of M\u00fcller's inaugural academic lecture, delivered in 1824 and printed in 1826,contains a chapter entitled \"Observation and Experiment\" (\"Beobachtung und Versuch\").Whereas M\u00fcller believed observation to be natural, patient, assiduous, faithful, unprejudiced,he called experimentation artificial, impatient, eager, digressive, passionate, unreliable.Nothing is easier, M\u00fcller said, than to make a series of so-called interesting experiments. Allyou need is to tempt nature by force; in her emergency she will always make a painful reply.'See also note 40, below. Chemical experimentation was regarded more favorably by late 18thcentury German romantics as standing between the mechanical and . I could find no discussion of the above in Richards, The Romantic Conception of Life. 26[26] Auerbach, understand that, how, why, in modernity a distinction was drawn between experimental physics and technology appears also in Sibum, 'Experimentalists in theRepublic of , 144. Lecourt's appraisal is Janicaud, Heidegger France , 1: 442. 29[29] Ihde, Instrumental Realism , 140, 55. (The grammar is all Ihde's.) Similarly, Kaplan, Readings in the Philosophy of Technology , 431, writes: 'Science is embodied in its technologies, and technologies determine what is science'. 30[30] Lovitt and Lovitt, Modern Technology , 265. Wm. Lovitt, a blind scholar, had been one of the first to reach this insight, and the first to translate Heidegger's principal primacy oftechnology texts. 31[31] Historians and sociologists of science and also, more surprisingly, of technology have remained largely unaware of just how important Heidegger has become, and consequentlyhave become themselves only unconsciously Heideggerian. Again, Laudan, 'Natural Alliance',S25-6, pointed out rather early on that this unprecedented primacy of technology 'derivesfrom from an old tradition, but it is not the analytic; rather, it is the tradition of Continentalphilosophy, of hermeneutics stemming ultimately from Husserl and Heidegger. It is this thathas supplied the underpinning for most recent sociology of science. The insistence on thecentrality of praxis (which has been transmuted into the talk about practices that is so popularin contemporary history of science), the talk of mediations and transparency, and the verybroad interpretation of techne as purposive action all come from outside the analytic tradition that has informed history of both science and technology for most of this century'. SheDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April and Technology 77 continued to observe (S27): 'But historians of technology have tended to stay with their tradi- tional definition of technology as having to do with artifacts and have not embraced the widerdefinition of techne that is becoming popular among historians of science'. Earlier still, T. P. Hughes noticed the Heideggerian affinities of actor-network theory: Hughes, 'The SeamlessWeb' (1986), 288, and the unsigned but obviously Hughes-authored introduction to Part I inBijker et al ., The Social Construction of Technological Systems . Hughes, American Genesis (1989), 6, offered a definition of technology that he himself regarded as Heideggerian. Morerecently, however, Hughes excluded Heidegger entirely from his reflections on 'how to thinkabout technology and culture': Hughes, Human-Built World (2004). Latour, who 'laundered' so much of that hidden influence of Heidegger into science studies in recent decades, nowargues openly for Heideggerization of science studies as the way from 'critique' to 'concern':Latour, 'Why Has Critique Run out of Steam?'. Borgman, Question of Heidegger and Technology' (1987), 107-8. Alderman, 'Heidegger's Critique of Science and Technology' (1978), exemplifies the inability prior to the 1980s to graspHeidegger's subordination of science to technology. 33[33] Grene, 'Heidegger, Heidegger, 'The Holzwege , 75. The best translation of this work that I have seen is Heidegger, 'The Age of the World Picture' (translated by Youngand Haynes). 34[34] A more forceful deprecation of the notion that technology is applied science occurs in Heidegger's 'Die Frage nach der Technik': Heidegger, The , 21-3. Interestingly, Heidegger's is exactly contemporaneous with the first and most forcefuldeprecation of that notion by Ellul, in La Technique (1954), translated as The Technological Society , 7-8: 'Everyone has been taught that technique is an application of science. ... This traditional view is radically false.' Never again, however, would the prolific Ellul, though hepublished lots more on technology, issue anywhere near so strong a denial that technology isapplied science. 35[35] , 11, opens his learned book on Heidegger by quoting this sentence and surmising that this text was Heidegger'slast. Wolf, however, missed the admonitory point of Heidegger's undmoderne Technik\"'\u2014what Heidegger would certainly have welcomed, but what was in factstill unthinkable at that date. In 2001, Michael Kelly introduced his report of the 35thannual meeting of the North American Heidegger Society with the observation that 'partici-pants both commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of Martin Heidegger(May 26, 1976), and breached a twenty-five year rejoinder to his letter to the tenth conven-ing of the society, April 11, 1976. In this letter, Heidegger called us to consider \"TheRelation of Modern Science to Modern Technology,\" which became this years theme.' 37[37] Foucault, Politics, Philosophy, Culture , 250; Rockmore, Heidegger and French Philosophy ; Janicaud, Heidegger en France . See also note 22, above. 38[38] Against my characterization Heidegger would have objected that his fullest statement, Heidegger had said\u2014and the statement is often quoted\u2014that'Die Technik ist Vortr\u00e4ge und Aufs\u00e4tze , 20). However, as Heidegger's exposition there and on the following pages makes clear, he was toying with his audience, knowing that those who came to hear him wouldfind that 'implication' of his argumentation uncomfortable. To his audience's relief,Heidegger then explained the difference between good Entbergung and the bad Entbergung by modern technology. Some part of Heidegger's denial can be accepted by distinguishingbetween the early Heidegger, the son of a village cooper, who expressed a romantic attach-ment to traditional handicrafts, and the later Heidegger, who was dominated by an equallyromantic antipathy toward modern technology. As for Heidegger's categorical denialquoted by Wolf, a historian is unwise to accept without question anyone's denials,especially a philosopher's, and most especially Heidegger's. So, to take an example whosepertinence will appear in Section II, Heidegger anathematized Lebensphilosophie , but, as Krell, himself, Hermeneutik und Technik , have shown, he was emphatically within that tradition. More generally, from the romantic tradition, and italone, came Heidegger's conviction that in poetizing he was philosophizing. E.g. Schaeffer,Art of the Modern Age . 39[39] The romantic antipathy to technology was not nearly so strong, or at least so uniform, in the British-American context, but tended to approximate to the German attitude as the 19thcentury advanced. A text of huge importance in that tradition, creating the concept of 'the ageof machinery' along with its romantic indictment, was Thomas Carlyle, 'Signs of the Times',published in 1829\u2014though Carlyle himself was quite ambivalent, for modern industry wasalso proof of the prowess of the British. See Sussman, Victorians and the Machine . 40[40] Gode-von Aesch, Natural Science , 24-31, is both description and expression of the romantic antagonism toward technology and, therewith, forms of science aiming at mastery of nature.See, also, note 25. 41[41] In this regard, as my only half ironic epigraph suggests, postmodernism was right about post- modernity. So, for example, Lecourt, Similarly Kroker, The Possessed Individual , 1: 'Read the French, therefore, to learn a language for thinking anew the empire of technology'. Thus itseems to me that Ezrahi et al., Technology, Pessimism and Postmodernism , have the case just backwards in linking postmodernism with technological pessimism . 42[42] Robert Frosch, physicist, sometime head of NASA, in Frosch, 'The Notes', reviewing the two Golem books, said 'I am in the peculiar position of agreeing with the message of the golem books, often disagreeing with how it is said, and thinking that it is dangerously incomplete'.Thus Frosch took no notice of, let alone issue with, Collins and Pinch's conflation of scienceand technology, himself writing of 'processes of science/technology' without commenting onthe union. Historians of technology are generally leery of defining technology, just as histori-ans of science are leery of defining science, but for opposite reasons: historians of technologyare afraid of including too much, historians of science of including too little. A satisfactorydefinition of technology is easily formulated, but would include far too much for a disciplinethat is preoccupied with its own coherence, as the history of technology has been. Though asatisfactory definition of science is not to be found, science is inseparable from workingdefinitions of science, as Gieryn, Cultural Boundaries Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 79 constituted by an ongoing process of drawing boundaries between what is and what is not included in science, or in a particular science. 43[43] De Gennes, Soft Research Mix'. Similarly, Kaiser, Science : 'Janelia Farm director Gerald Rubin says he wants to recreate the close-knit feeling of legendary labssuch as the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, where well-funded investiga-tors free of grant-seeking pressures work in small groups. There will be at least one difference:Janelia will emphasize technology.' There is also Wade, 'New Hughes Haven', who, as usual,distorts as he reports. 45[45] Alan Leshner, the then new CEO, addressing the Council of the AAAS, 17 February 2002, on the revised statement of the mission of the Association ('Advancing science and promotinginnovation ...'), as recorded by me. 46[46] Joseph Henry, in his retiring address as the Association's second president, 1850, admonished its members to 'Hold stubbornly to the essentials of our faith in science. Avoid clashes butgive not an inch', promising them that 'Ours is the future'. (And for a hundred years it was.)Reingold, 'Joseph Henry', 159, 167. 47[47] Weintraub et al., 'Through the Glass Lightly'. Not one of the biological scientists among the 45 contributors pointed to other than technologically defined goals. Indicative in this regard is thestudy by Klevorick et al., 'On the Sources', Tables 1 and 3, showing that as early as the mid 1980s\u2014i.e. before molecular biology had become a leading factor in the technical and commer-cial orientation of biology\u2014academic biological research was far less like that in any otheracademic science, far more like that of academic engineering research, in the degree to whichindustrial R&D directors rated it as important to their own interests\u2014ten times more likely tobe so rated than academic physics research! By the early 1970s, Erwin Chargaff, Heraclitean Fire , saw this coming. Indeed, Peter Medawar was advocating it as early as the 1960s: Medawar, 'Americans' Increasing Belief in Life after Death'; Walter and Waterhouse, 'A Very Private Belief: Reincarnation in Contemporary England'; Kaminer,Sleeping with Extra-terrestrials ; Fogel, The Fourth Great Awakening ; Frank, One Market Under God; Rifkin, The Age of Access ; Schiller, Irrational Exuberance ; Fuller, Spiritual ; Jenkins, The Next Christendom ; Clark, From Angels to Aliens ; Forman, 'From the Social to the Moral to the Spiritual'. 49[49] More particularly, it seems to me unwarranted to construe the development of the enormous and enormously complex multi-mode particle detectors used in conjunction with the highestenergy accelerators as postmodern manifestations, as did 553-5, 684-5, and 'Three Laboratories'. Nothing, on Galison's us to regard theconception of such 'hybrid' instruments\u2014'hybrid' only if one accepts Galison's themata ofdetector types, and invests those themata with archetypical powers\u2014as other than obviousresponses to the exigencies of observing just those special sorts of processes that the high-energy accelerators were being built to produce. (It is so much easier to impose upon thedevelopment of particle detectors stylistic analogies to postmodern architecture if oneignores, as Galison the innocuous realm of style, declined to see any loss of scientific identity in postmodernity,insisting on 'a picture in which scientific and engineering cultures are treated on a par, but notin any way homogenized'. A more up-to-date statement of this inoffensive postmodernism isJohnson, 'Revisiting Technology as Knowledge': 'Technology is neither subsumed underscience nor completely outside of it; communities of technologists and scientists constituteinterdependent, parallel, epistemologically equivalent bodies, what Layton calls \"MirrorImage Twins.\" These views, while perhaps radical in the 1970s, have come to be acceptedwithout argument in the twenty-first century.' (Johnson's misrepresentation of Layton'sthesis is the common one. See notes 346-8, below.) If, however, I am anywhere near right thatDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 80 P. Forman in the postmodern laboratory technology subsumes science, no such separation is sustain- able\u2014and all the pressure to merge is exerted upon the scientists. In this connection, it isinteresting to see that there, in the high-energy particle-accelerator laboratories, where ageneration earlier just such a separation between the scientific and engineering 'cultures' hadarisen as a modernist functional differentiation between the (higher status) experimentalphysicist and the (lower status) accelerator designing, building, and operating physicist, now,today, the experimental physicists are seeking to repossess the technologic role, seeing a valuein the definition of themselves as inventors that simply did not exist for them 30 years ago:Tigner, 'Does Accelerator-based'. 51[51] Cao and Braun and Diospatonyi, 'A Simplistic Approach'. I am grateful to Professor Braun for communicating these results to me prior to their publication. Kwa, 'Programming ', 457 et passim , draws attention to another characteristic form of postmodern science in which 'disci- plinary \"little science\" structures seemingly continue to exist', even as the work of those littlescientists is continually being reprogrammed by science policy officials steering their '\"distrib-uted megascience\"'. 53[53] Baird et al., Discovering the Nanoscale ; McCray, 'Will Small Be Beautiful?'. There is already a superabundance of 'science studies' literature on nanotechnology, and a tsunami in the offing,for one aspect of the US National Nanotechnology Initiative's emulation of the HumanGenome Project has been the reproduction of the HGP's set-aside of a small percentage of itsbudget for studies of the social and ethical import of its research program. Characteristic isthat even the most insightful critical examinations of nanotechnology\u2014for example, Milburn'Nanotechnology'\u2014elide completely the distinction between science and technology and usethe terms interchangeably. 54[54] 'This Month in Physics History'. See also the quotation of Nicholas Metropolis in note 13. 55[55] Again, the contrast with the founding purposes of this turn of the 20th century institution could hardly be greater. Thus, Henry A. Rowland's address as first president of the society,Rowland, 'The Highest Aim', 826: 'Above all, let us cultivate the idea of the dignity of ourpursuit so that this feeling may sustain us in the midst of a world which gives its highest praise,not to the investigation in the pure ethereal physics which our Society is formed to cultivate,but to one who uses it for satisfying the physical rather than the intellectual needs of mankind'. 56[56] For example, Taylor, Laser: The Inventor, the Nobel Laureate, and the Thirty-Year Patent War , which takes as protagonist a lotsa living, laying, and liquor physicist ('the inventor') who quitshis failed scientific career to devote his efforts to an entrepreneurial patent suit, hoping tomake a fortune out of his early anticipation of how a laser might work. 'The inventor' finallywins big, overturning in the courts the claims of the patent holder\u2014'the Nobel Laureate'\u2014aphysicist of the highest distinction, both in his discipline and in public service, and a paragonof Protestant ethics. 57[57] Gross and Levitt, Higher Superstition , 48-9. The emphasis is Gross and Levitt's. In their discussion (57-60) of Latour's Science in Action , no notice is taken of, let alone exception to, Latour's conflation of science and technology. Similarly, the very title of the follow-up book,Levitt, Prometheus Levitt writes (104) that 'Some critics [of science] have taken to using terms like\"technoscience\" to signal their commitment to the idea that science and technology not onlymove in lockstep, but are merely different names for the same thing'. 58[58] Rorty, 'An Antirepresentationalist View', 125, 128. out elsewhere (Saatkamp, Rorty & Pragmatism , 211, n. 6), he there remains in the most authentic tradition of pragma- tism: 'In a famous footnote to Pragmatism , James quotes [physicist] W.S. Franklin as saying that \"the healtiest notion\" of physics is as \"the science of the ways of taking hold of bodies andpushing them.\"' But Rorty the postmodern, by taking the value of any enterprise as a functiononly of the moral intentions of those engaged in it, and setting science at zero (its practitionersintending neither good nor ill), makes most of technology rank above all of science.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History Technology 81 59[59] So, for example, physicist Srdjan Lelas, Science and Modernity , 274, professedly intending to 'provide a powerful basis for our belief in the reliability and truthfulness of science', finds thebasis for that belief, as well the means for achieving the believed-in knowledge, 'physical inter-action with nature by way of Lelas, his concept of 'the global privatization regime' with inception about 1980, cited publications by half a dozenother scholars locating a restructuring of knowledge production at about that date.

Or, without the ellipsis, 'Technics is a translation into appropriate, practical forms of the theoretic truths, implicit or formulated, anticipated ordiscovered, of science'. 62[62] Dunn, 'The Relationship'.

And in so saying Mayr admonished his fellow historians of technology to 'Consider how they'\u2014science and technology\u2014'have risenand fallen, both absolutely and relative to each other', from century to century. Hevly,'Afterword', 358, similarly stressed that the alleged relation between science and technologyis to be taken as an ideology that 'itself needs to be understood historically, rather thanaccepted as historical explanation'. 64[64] Dunn, 'The Relationship'. In 1912 Dunn had told the members of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, as its president, that 'Engineering is Science's handmaid following afterher in honor and affection, but doing the practical chores of life'. As quoted by Kline,'Construing \"Technology\"', 204. See my discussion of 'Sons of Martha' at note 163, was intended for industrial circles only. Wienwould have said the same to any audience until just a couple years earlier, but the romanticreaction following Germany's defeat in the First World War made it more than unwise toemphasize before an academic audience physics' close connection with technology. Forman,'Weimar Culture', 40-4, 49, 55. Regarding romanticism's reprehension of the physics-tech-nology connection, see the discussions of Heidegger, above, and of the Erlangen School,below. 66[66] Thus Georg Klingenberg, one of the principal lieutenants to AEG chief Felix Deutsch, wrote his boss, who had accepted the position of treasurer of the Helmholtz-Gesellschaft, a scath-ing critique so soon as the documents of the founding meeting came to hand: 'I can't possi-bly assume that the expression \"applied physics\" is supposed to include technology[Technik ] proper, since the expression \"applied physics\" is just about the falsest and most erroneous designation which can possibly be found for technology [ Technik ]'. The original German is quoted in Forman, 'The Helmholtz Gesellschaft', 115, from letter in Werksarchiv,Farbenfabriken Bayer AG, Leverkusen, signature 46/8. Klingenberg's protest was to noeffect\u2014in part, it must be said, because the industrial leaders were at this juncture muchinterested in making political alliances with the leaders of science and scholarship: Forman,'The Financial Support'. 67[67] Pestre, 'The on Marie Curie, under- scored 'the leading role she attributed to scientists themselves.

Forman 68[68] Exemplary for the modernist adulation of abstraction (the epitome of the theoretical) is Whitehead, Science in the Modern World , 25, 31-2, and all of ch. 10\u2014the more indicative for the wide range of politico-epistemic positions from which this book was praised whenpublished in 1925 and in following decades. Such adulation of abstraction in modernity didnot prevent, but only trumped, high regard for the material and practical, as Whiteheadhimself testified at other points in this book, e.g. the passage in the fourth paragraph of theseventh chapter underscoring the centrality of instruments in the progress of science, quotedbelow, note 120, as quoted by Dewey. 69[69] Gillispie, 'The Natural History of Industry' (1957), took this stance 50 years ago in one of the first historical studies to examine, without prejudice, the relation between science andtechnological advance. More generally, historians of science pointed out the preposterous-ness of the traditional assertions of the primacy of science relative to technology well beforehistorians of technology found it important to do so. Thus as late as 1973, Molella andReingold, 'Theorists', 129 (1973), 139 (1991), attacked Gillispie and ofscience for MEGA [Marx-Engels, Gesamtausgabe ], I, 3: 122; Habermas, Knowledge and Human Interests , 45 (found under Habermas, Erkenntnis ). Marx was certain that science was the highest of all possible cultural forms, and consequently his own highest aspiration was to be a scientist,like, but more completely than, any natural scientist. Habermas, Erkenntnis , 62-3, 66-8 (Knowledge and Human Interests , 45-6, 50), pointed out this aspect of Marx's thought, but found it incomprehensible. this insis-tence that (only) fully developed capitalism is to be equated with technology as appliedscience ought to have led Marx to give some attention to the question of the sources of tech-nological advance in earlier periods, only here in this one passage in Grundrisse does he do so: 'the development of machinery enters upon this path only as and when large-scale industry[grosse Industrie] has reached a higher stage and all the sciences have been caught up andpressed into the service of capital. ... But this is not the road by which machinery, by andlarge, arose, and even less the road by which it progresses in detail'. That road is 'the divisionof labor, which gradually transforms the workers' operations into more and more mechanicalones' so as then to be replaceable by mechanisms. Evident here in the anti-mechanical animusis the romantic anti-mechanism that would trap Marx into regarding the machine as a mech-anized hand tool. See, also, note 372, below. 73[73] What Marx took to be true of the machine technology of his time, Braverman, writing in 1974, made the result of the more nearly science-based technologies of his time: 'The keyinnovation is not to be found in chemistry, electronics, automatic machinery ... or any ofthe products of these science-technologies, but rather in the transformation of science itselfinto capital'. As quoted by Noble, America by Design , 6. Similarly, Dickson, The New Politics of Science (1984), 6: 'decision making over science\u2014the key to the development of the forces of production'. Likewise, Schmidt, The Concept of Nature in Marx (1971), where 'science' stands so completely both for itself and for technology that 'technology' is Marx took from Poppe the cameralist concept of Technologie as the science that systematized artisanal knowledge, and that Marx employed this perspective in conceptualizing modern industry. It seems to me, however, that, contra Frison,Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History Technology 83 Marx's use of Technologie in the cameralist sense of the science of artefaction is exceptional in Das Kapital , where the word is used more often as a synonym for Technik . So, for example, in the following passage Marx continues from one of his rare cameralistic uses of Technologie in the first sentence ('the modern science of technology') to an equation of Technologie with the 'application of natural science' in 23: available 23 Marx, Capital , 1: 616-7. Recently, Schatzberg, ' Technik Comes to America', 494\u2014who kindly communicated this paper to me prior to its appearance\u2014accepting and extendingFrison's contention, has alleged that in Germany during the second half of the 19th century'Technik and Technologie were the focus of independent discourses and almost never compared'. I can readily imagine that ' Technik and Technologie were ... almost never compared', but only because, as Marx's usage implies, they were not 'the focus of independent discourses'. 75[75] Marx maintained into his last years his preoccupation with the merely conceptual: Mathematical Manuscripts of Karl Marx (1983). There is, of course, Engels' oft-quoted private letter disparaging the notion of science's primacy for technology: 'If technology is chieflydependent on the extent to which science is advanced, as you say, then [I must insist that] thelatter is far more dependent on the degree to which technology has advanced as well as itsrequirements. If society has a need for a certain technology, then this does more to advancescience than can ten universities' (quoted, in translation, from Marx-Engels, spontaneous expression is Engels' public declaration, in which he claimed to speak forMarx as well, that 'knowledge of mathematics and natural science is essential to a conceptionof nature which is dialectical and at the same time materialist', and in consequence of thatconviction Engels too, on retirement from business, turned his attention immediately and foryears to mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

Rosenberg, 'Karl Marx on the Economic Role of Science', 126, complainingthat 'Many of the most interesting aspects of Marx's treatment of technological change havebeen ignored, perhaps because of the strong polemical orientation which readers from allshades of the political spectrum seem to bring to their reading of Marx', drew attention tonone of the above quoted passages. Rather, Rosenberg himself polemicized for the perfectcorrectness of Marx's (correctly understood) views on the relation between science and tech-nology/industry, without even bothering to distinguish between what Marx wrote and whatEngels wrote. That Rosenberg 'argues that Karl Marx should be the foundation of all thinkingin the history of technology' was noted also by Roland, 'What Hath Kranzberg Wrought?',705, citing Inside the Black Box , 34. 80[80] For Veblen, even more the romantic than Marx, historical materialism was even less a matter of belief or preference: it was a working hypothesis, the obligatory working hypothesis for ascientist. Veblen had not only more concerns in common with John Ruskin and WilliamMorris than he cared to admit, but even also values. So, e.g. Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class , 162, and 'Arts and Crafts'. Diggins, The Bard of Savagery , emphasized the romantic Veblen with that title phrase taken from Perry Miller's discussion of Veblen. For the enor-mous influence of Ruskin Learning , 6. As the quotations suggest, Veblen's use of the noun 'technology' as well as the adjective 'tech-nological' was quite as loose as Marx's, i.e. used sometimes in the cameralist sense of ascience of productive activities, but more often used to designate the productive activitiesthemselves. To repeat re: Veblen what I have already said re: Marx in note 74, above, Ican see no basis for the claims in Schatzberg, ' Technik comes to America', 504-5, that Veblen employed a specific and sophisticated concept of technology. Still less can I see asempirical Schatzberg's contention there that 'Veblen's analysis of the science-technology relationship was possible only because of his Technik -centered definition of technology . There were no discussions of this relationship in the nineteenth century, when technology was clearly understood as a field of science and the relationship was simply that of part towhole'. The articulation of so insupportable a proposition would not, I think, be possiblebut for the hegemony of an anti-science ideology in the discipline of the history of tech-nology. 82[82] Veblen, 'The Place of Science'; Veblen, 'The Evolution'. The second of these papers elaborates and qualifies the historical materialist thesis that is advanced, still quite summarily, in thefirst\u2014the broader, more balanced essay.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: April 2007 History Technology 85 83[83] Veblen, The Instinct of Workmanship , chs 6 and 7. A similar but briefer discussion is Veblen, Imperial Germany , 110-20, where Veblen refers the reader to The Instinct of Workmanship for fuller discussion. 84[84] Veblen, 'The Place of Science', 585. This thesis, which we now commonly associate with Max Weber, was a commonplace at that time. Diggins, The Bard of Savagery , 114-18, compares Veblen and Weber. 85[85] Quotations from Veblen, 'The Place of Science', 595, 608, 586, 608. This 'ubiquitous presence of the machine technology' is, however, characteristic only of the period since 'the so-calledindustrial revolution' (Veblen, 'The Evolution', being anera of handicraft, 'the concepts of the scientists came to be drawn in the image of the work-man' (Veblen, 'The Place of Science', 595), but in the period since the early decades of the19th century 'the technological ascendancy of the machine process brought a new and charac-teristic discipline into the cultural situation' (Veblen, 'The Evolution', 54). In this later phase,'whether in technological work or in scientific inquiry ... men have fallen into the habit ofthinking in terms of process rather than in terms of the workmanlike efficiency of a givencause working to a given effect'. In physics and chemistry this produces 'a highly impersonalinterpretation of phenomena in terms of consecutive change ... with the disappearance ordissipation of all stable and efficient substances', i.e. Veblen offers a historical materialistinterpretation in place of contemporary positivist polemics against the older, cause-effectconception of scientific explanation. 86[86] Veblen, 'The Place of Science', 598. To be especially noted, for it is essential to Veblen's assign- ment of high cultural rank to science, is his insistence here that the scientist, as scientist, cannotaim at technological ends. Cf. the discussion of Dewey, below. In this connection notice shouldalso be taken of an indicative inconsistency in Veblen's exposition of 'the reason why scientifictheories can be turned to ... technological purpose'. Having first given the quoted explanationfor this 'applicability' of science\u2014the fact that 'the canons of validity under whose guidance he[the scientist] works are those imposed by the modern technology'\u2014Veblen, evidently uncom-fortable with the consequences of the primacy he has attributed to practice, restates the issuein the next paragraph in such a way as to demote technology from primacy to parity: 'Moderntechnology makes use of the same range of concepts, thinks in the same terms, and applies thesame tests of validity as modern science. ... Hence the easy copartnership between the two.Science and technology play into one another's Imperial Germany , 110-20, 268-70, involves the same inconsistencies. Andrew Jamison, 83, quoted from Imperial Germany , 268: 'the most characteristic habit of thought that pervades this modern civilization, in high or low degree, is what has, in the simplest terms hitherto given it, been called themechanistic conception. Its practical working-out is the machine technology, of which theintellectual precipitate and counterpart is the exact sciences'. Although Jamison exhibited thisquotation as illustrative of the primacy that Veblen allegedly gave to technology, it exempli-fies, rather, Veblen's vacillation between attributing primacy to technology ('precipitate') it to economics ('counterpart'). 89[89] Veblen, Absentee Ownership , 261, 255. The chapter, X, is titled 'The Technology of Physics and Chemistry'. Diggins, Bard of Savagery , 24-6, appraised this book Veblen's 'most somber , 265-6. 91[91] Ibid., 259. It is an indication of how far Veblen had bought into the ideology of primacy of science that he cites Edwin Slosson, Creative Chemistry for evidence of this dependence of industry upon science. That Veblen had then only very recently accepted this view of thescience-technology relationship is suggested by the fact that science is very nearly absent fromVeblen, The Engineers ; an isolated exception is the reference on p. 52 to 'the material sciences' as a resource upon which 86 P. Forman although Veblen could refer in Imperial Germany , 198, to 'the range of applied science called the machine technology', that too remained an isolated exception. 92[92] Veblen, 'The Place of Science', 587. The phrase, 'the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men', which Veblen quotes here (and he is quoted below quoting it again in 1918) willbe recognized as the operative mandate in James Smithson's bequest establishing the Smithso-nian Institution. The history of that institution over the past thirty years can be understood asmanifold manifestations of the diminished power and allegiance of its modernist mandate aspostmodern presuppositions have taken ever firmer hold. 93[93] Ibid., concluding paragraph; James, The Will to Believe . 94[94] That ambivalence made James an enthusiast for Bergson and rendered Veblen half Hollinger, 'Justification by Verification', 127, while recognizing the disinterested research scientist as a cultural ideal widely shared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,excepted William James. Hollinger there described James as having 'parodied' the contempo-rary conception of science in referring to the edifice of science as having been built by andupon '\"thousands of disinterested moral lives\"' (quoting James from pp. 17-18 of the 1979critical edition of The Will to Believe ). Hollinger cited no evidence for imputing a parodic intent to James, a reading not consistent with the text, its context, or the alterations that Jamesdeliberated in preparing it for publication (pp. 405-6). 96[96] Veblen, 'The Socialist Economics', 576. 180-1: 'Thus in The Higher Learning Veblen acknowledged what he had slighted in his previous works\u2014the eminence of the academiccalling even in a capitalist culture. ... Even under the corrosive influence of business princi-ples the ideals of scholarship could survive'. 99[99] Veblen, The Higher Learning , 8; Diggins, The of Savagery , 29-30, not grasping that what Veblen said is what everyone thought, was astonished and perplexed that Veblen'attempted to turn utilitarianism on its head by claiming, against every canon of empiri-cism, that science progresses only to the extent that it serves no immediate useful purpose.... It was, perhaps, the residue of Kantianism in Veblen that led him to see science as prac-tically liberating only so long as the mind remained theoretically free from the demands ofpracticality'. 100[100] Veblen, technology have seen in Sombart's 'Technik und Kultur' a celebration of the value ofTechnik for Kultur , that requires ignoring Sombart's expression there April 2007 Technology 87 108[108] There is, however, Joravsky's counter-thesis, developed to explain the extraordinary inter- ventions by Soviet political leaders, beginning with Stalin, into scientific and scholarly ques-tions and controversies\u2014what Joravsky identified as 'the central mode of self-justification inthe mentality of communist leaders. Since practice is the ultimate criterion of truth, and thepolitical leaders of the historically progressive class are the supreme readers of the lessons ofpractice, they are the ultimate arbiters of truth. In short, one learns in many ways, but mostof all by bossing. The higher up the boss, the greater his realm of practical mastery, the morehis 'big truth' supersedes the 'little truths' perceived by the lesser creatures down below,scholars and scientists included. That was probably Stalin's most significant innovation inMarxist theory'. Lysenko Affair . Yet I think it is not impossible to see an implicit attribution of primacy to science even also in this very compulsion for self-justification by the political leaders, Stalin inparticular. 109[109] Bukharin, 'The Methodology'. This event and speech are the subject of Graham, 'Bukharin', which is largely incorporated in Graham, The Soviet Academy . For all that Bukharin was in strong disagreement with Stalin on policies for Soviet economic development, nowhere in hisdiscussion does Graham suggest that Bukharin's views on the primacy of science for technol-ogy could be other than consensual in the Soviet Union. Likewise, Andrews, Science for the Masses: The Bolshevik State , 154-6, in arguing that the Great Break at the end of the 1920s brought a new emphasis upon the application of science to industry and to the creation ofnew technology implicitly confirms that the presumption of primacy of science for 2. Bukharin's positions here in 1931 are not essentially different, but more strongly expressed than those taken ten years earlier in his book Historical Materialism. There, in ch. 6, Section g. 'The Significance of the Superstructure', Bukharin allowed that 'Thousandsof examples prove that a true scholar, or artist, or theoretical jurist, loves his vocation as heloves himself, without regard to its practical phases. But ... man's view of his labor is not iden-tical with the role, the significance, of his labor for society . ... Knowledge formerly served practice, even in men's minds; it still serves practice, but the minds of the closeted specialistsrepresent knowledge as entirely divorced from practice. ... the superstructure is not \"child'splay\". We have shown that a destruction of the capitalist state would make capitalist produc-tion impossible, that a destruction of modern science would involve also that of large-scaleproduction and technology; ... Science likewise (let us suppose we are speaking of the naturalsciences) ultimately serves as a guide for the process of production, increases its effectivenessand regulates its operation'. 113[113] Bukharin, 'The Kojevnikov, Stalin's philosophy into the postmodern period'. Hickman himself has been a principal perpe-trator of this misrepresentation of Dewey, foisting upon him a postmodern conflationof science and technology in which science loses its primacy to technology. See, Hickman,'Pragmatism', 72-87; Hickman, Philosophical Tools . 118[118] Dewey, (in Dewey, The Middle 12: 86). Similarly, but rather stron- ger, Dewey, 'By Nature and by Art' (1944), as in Dewey, The Later Works , 15: 88: 'The scientific revolution may be said to have been initiated when investigators borrowedapparatus and processes from the industrial arts and used them as means of obtainingdependable scientific data'. It is likely that when writing these lines Dewey was aware of EdgarZilsel's publications, specifically, 119[119] Dewey, Reconstruction , 42, 126 (in Dewey, The , 12: 103, 152). 120[120] Dewey, Logic , as Dewey, The Later , 12: 388. Dewey there gave, as illustra- tive, a list of instrumental advances in astronomy during the preceding half-century, andadded a footnote: 'The following passage [from Whitehead, Science in the Modern World ] is worth citation as one of the comparatively few instances of recognition, from the side oftheory, of the importance of this point: 'The reason why we are on a higher imaginative leveltoday [in science] is not that we have finer imagination, but because we have better instru-ments. In science, the most important thing that has happened in the last forty years isthe advance in instrumental design. ... These instruments have put thought on to a new level'.[I have corrected some small inaccuracies in Dewey's quotation from the fourth paragraph ofthe seventh chapter.] 121[121] Dewey, The Quest for Certainty , 84 (in The Later Works , 4: 68). 122[122] Dewey, 'Science and Society', here quoted from Dewey, The Later Works , 6: 57. So far as I have seen, Dewey's strongest and most fully theorized assertion that modern science is 'a mode oftechnology' is in 'By Nature and by Art', where (89, note 3) he credits the Veblenist economistClarence E. Ayres with being the first explicitly to say this. Dewey founds this contention onthe one hand on the historical fact of science originating in artisanal knowledge, and on theother hand on an extremely broad definition of art, broader even than that employed bycultural anthropologists, namely as including the responses of even 'low-grade organisms' toexternal stimuli (88). From this definition of art it follows necessarily, but vacuously, thatscience too is art. Dewey then proposes to use the word 'technology' for 'the art which isscience', thus making science not 'a mode of technology', but 'pragmatists such as Dewey turn away from thetheoretical scientist to the engineers and the social workers'. In a somewhat softer form byWestbrook, 'Lewis Mumford', 311: 'Dewey idiosyncratically (for his time if not ours) consid-ered science to be, above all, practical reason, and he regarded the abstraction of modernnatural science to be a methodological move made in the interest of gaining control 125[125] Dewey, Works , 12: 176, 276). Note that the first quotation is from what Dewey wrote in 1920, while the second quotation is from the longintroduction that Dewey wrote in 1948 for the republication of that book, i.e. note theconstancy of this prejudice. 126[126] 'Philosophers in setting experience down as inherently inferior to rational science were truth- ful', Quest for Certainty , 82 (in Dewey, The Later Works , 4: 66). 127[127] Dewey, Quest for Certainty , 84-5 Dewey, The Later Works , 4: 68). 128[128] Ibid. The passage continues with Dewey insisting that 'the technique of modern industry, in commerce, communication, transportation and all the appliances of light, heat and electricity,is the fruit of the modern application of science'. 129[129] So, with increasing pejorativeness, dominant , 11:274-81, on 279. 132[132] Dewey, Reconstruction , Middle Works , 12: 170). Dewey's vehemence here shows his awareness that reconciling his instrumentalism and hisdeprecation [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 89 133[133] The point is made quite briefly by Habermas in opening his 1965 inaugural lecture at Frankfurt University (Habermas, 'Erkenntnis und Interesse'). 134[134] And this requires Dewey to walk a rather narrow line\u2014though in fact he rarely notices the necessity\u2014for it follows from his principles that 'What is sometimes termed \"applied\"science, may then be more truly science than is what is conventionally called pure science. Forit is directly concerned with not just instrumentalities, but instrumentalities at work in effect-ing modifications of existence in behalf of conclusions that are reflectively preferred. ... Thusconceived, knowledge exists in engineering, medicine and the social arts more adequatelythan it does in mathematics, and physics'. Dewey, Experience , as reprinted in Dewey, The Later Works , 1: 128; Jordan, Machine-Age Ideology , 228, exhibits this quotation and asserts that 'This conception remains notably consistent throughout Dewey's writings of the 1920s and 1930s',for 'As a pragmatist, Dewey embraced a scientific ideal at odds with the purity of experimentalinvestigation as an end in itself. ... his version of science mirrored engineering, not merelyinquiry'; but Jordan is wrong, both about Dewey's ideal and Dewey's consistency. 135[135] Dewey, 'Science and Later Works , 6: 57-8. Dewey said the same more concretely and less concisely two decades earlier: 'The modern warship ... couldnot exist were it not for science: mathematics, mechanics, chemistry, electricity supply thetechnique of its construction and management. But the aims, the ideals in whose service thismarvelous technique is displayed are survivals of a pre-scientific age, that is, of barbarism'.Dewey, 'Science as Subject-Matter', 127. Dewey is, I suppose, influenced by Veblen here. Seenote 58, above, for Rorty's antithetic Dewey, 'Authority and Social Change', 188 (in Ratner, Intelligence in the Modern World , 359, and in Dewey, The Later Works , 11: 142-3). 137[137] An early instance of the same presupposition of the incompatibility of pecuniary interest with behaving scientifically (and morally): Dewey, 'Logical Conditions' (1903), as reprinted 138[138] 269). 139[139] How hard it is for an intellectual historian today\u2014especially today\u2014to recognize and allow the primacy that Dewey ascribed to science is shown by the unwillingness of Dewey's bestbiographer to do so: Westbrook, 'Lewis Mumford', 321, 311, otherwise entirely on Dewey'sside in his clash with Mumford in 1927, is unable to accept Dewey's highly affirmative view ofscience. There and only there he declares Dewey wrong and Mumford right. 140[140] Dewey, 'The Pragmatic Acquiescence' (1927), concluding lines. Dewey's title is that of ch. 4 of Mumford's The Golden Day , which work, then recently published, contained harsh indict- ments of pragmatism\u2014to be considered below, at notes 230-34, in examining Mumford'sview of the science-technology relation. The traitorousness of Mumford's attack was institu-tional as well as intellectual: Mumford had been a junior editor on The Dial in 1919 when this new journal, with Dewey at the head of its editorial board, was at the center of pragma-tism-inspired theorizing of social reconstruction following The Great War. Dewey andMumford were both regular contributors in the following years to The New Republic , a maga- zine that likewise carried the reputation then, and among historians since, as inspired bypragmatism. 141[141] Dewey, Reconstruction in Philosophy , 41 (in The Middle Works , 12: 102). The emphasis is Dewey's. 360 and Dewey, The Later Works , 11: 143). And elsewhere at about this time, Dewey, The Later Works , 11: 182, 267, 311, 364: 'all the physical features of the present regime of production and distribution ofgoods and services are products of the new physical science'; 'modern industry in productionand distribution of goods is the direct product of science'; 'these mechanical inventions are, ofcourse, the product of scientific discovery'; 'the cause of the release of productive energies wasthe rise of experimental science and its technological application'. 143[143] Dewey, 'Philosophy', as reprinted in Forman 144[144] Dewey, The Quest for Certainty , 80 (in The Later Works , 4: 64). This fact, Dewey explained, was 'The practical reason for selecting such a technical matter as the method of physicalscience' as the main topic of his Gifford Lectures. 145[145] This 'inconsequence' of Dewey as instrumentalist is the more noteworthy as he was in other respects remarkably consequent in his instrumentalism. Thus Howard, 'Two Left Turns', atnote 38, has pointed out that Dewey was a more consistent naturalist than were the logicalpositivist/empiricists who refused science a role in the construction or selection of ends.More pertinent to the present issue, Dewey was so consistent a naturalist as to affirm thatmere knowledge\u2014i.e. thought as the act of knowing\u2014not only can, but must, have physicalconsequences. (Howard, ibid. , 2nd para. before note 31, citing Dewey, The Quest for Certainty , 211 (in The Later Works , 4: 195).) This axiom that knowledge alters the real world became then the metaphysical base for the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechan-ics, Bohr having been strongly influenced by Dewey. Einstein, as is well known, opposed thisaxiom, and so also did Karl Popper. Indeed, as pointed out by Shields, 'Karl Popper's', 'theissue that virtually obsessed Popper [was] does human knowledge have physical effects?' Ifone bears in mind that to insist that mere knowing has physical consequences is to negatethe possibility of any distinction in principle between science and technology\u2014as also, asmore commonly noted, between science and mysticism\u2014it is easy to understand why thisissue had to be important for Popper, whose constant concern was the demarcation ofscience from non-science. Cf., note 42. Yet, impressively consistent though Dewey was inregard to this matter of naturalism, as in his instrumentalism, it remained beyond the limitsimposed by modernity for him to apply those principles to the relation between science andtechnology. 146[146] Adas, Machines ... and Ideologies of Western Dominance , took the primacy of science so much for granted\u2014presumably because his non-Western subjects and sources, no less than hisWestern, did so also\u2014that he did not find it necessary even to raise the question. 147[147] Pestre , Physique , 285, quoting and 'The French Science', 322-5, showed the strong influence of industrial inter-ests in providing the funding and in setting the programs of French university science facultiesin the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His exposition leaves open, however, the questionwhether this altogether surprising circumstance is evidence against the common view that theFrench scientist made the ideal of for-its-own-sake science 'very specially his own' (Guerlac),or, on the contrary, should be taken as supporting that view, i.e. supporting it to the extent\u2014and it was, Shinn indicates, to a considerable extent\u2014that French scientists were unenthusias-tic about the influence of industrial interests. 148[148] As quoted by Tessa Morris Suzuki, as quoted by Walter Grunden in Walker, Science and Ideology , 49. 149[149] Kojevnikov, Stalin's Great Science , 2-5. An implicit indication of the Russian tradition of scien- tific purity is offered by Vucinich, Science in Russian Culture (1970), which, with an index containing more than 1500 entries has none for 'technology' or 'engineering'. Zvorikine,'Technology and the Laws of Its Development' (1962), stated the official Soviet line at thattime: 'The primary prerequisite for the conversion of science into a direct productive force islarge-scale development of theoretical natural science'. By 1980 it was possible to say that 'Anexaggerated respect for science as the motive force of change (capsuled in the phrase 'the scien-tific-technological revolution', or STR) has generates progress'. Valkenier, 'Development Issues', 497-8. However, as we have seen,this was the traditional Soviet concept of what generates progress. 150[150] Kline, 'Construing \"Technology\"'. As Rose, 'Science as an Idiom' (1987), 4, had noted, 'the recent monographic literature suggests that scientists exercised only a modest influencewithin corporate and political arenas'. Thus, since 'the proposition that technology was iden-tical with science appeared routinely in the assertions of opinion leaders', it should be taken as'evidence of its existence as an artifact of culture among educated Americans'. In 1975,Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 91 Hughes, Changing Attitudes , 6, could still present evidence of this artifact without taking umbrage at it. Pursell, 'Engineering Organization' (2006), provides unintended and unwillingsupport: he portrays Dunn, Carty, and their peers, men of the widest experience of the worldof affairs and with the closest connections with the wealthiest and most powerful in America,as allowing themselves to be bilked by scientists who exploited their inordinate admirationand respect for science. Noteworthy is the bit of evidence that Pursell brings that the rank-and-file engineer did not exalt science and scientists so greatly above himself as did the eliteengineer speaking down to him. 151[151] Kline, of Pure Science', 514. Conant, Modern Science and Modern Man (1952), 54-8\u2014lectures containing the kernel of the views developed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Thomas S. Kuhnin the following decade\u2014gives much space to a critique of this commonplace simile likeningscientists and explorers. It is in this connection that Conant repudiates the conception ofscientific constructs as successively better approximations to reality\u2014'In short, the wholeanalogy between a map and a scientific theory is without a basis'. In lieu of the scientist asexplorer, which was a version of the conception of the scientist as 'virtuous', Conant thereadvocates a conception of the (true) scientist as virtuoso, which conception was then in factbecoming the common self-conception of scientists. Forman, 'Social Niche and Self Image'. Kline, 'Construing \"Technology\"', 210, points to G. E. Hale as quoting Carty in two 1919 addresses. 156[156] Jewett as quoted by Kline, ibid., 217. where NRC pure-science ideal'.

What, however, the poem says, and what engineers were affirming as self-image in their quotations of it, is scarcely discerniblethough Oldenziel's presentation. Rossiter, 'The Matthew Matilda Effect', 334-5, had alreadyshown how strongly the image appealed to women engineers. Similarly, Dillon, 'MargaretMead', 336, had emphasized how strongly the image appealed to Margaret Mead. Veblenhimself quoted a couple stanzas in Absentee Ownership , 255. 166[166] Invocations of the poem and its laudation of subservience have by no means disappeared: In 1964 the Professional Engineers Ontario (Canada) created 'the Sons of Martha Medal, torecognize outstanding contributions to the profession through the association': http://www.peo.on.ca/events/awards/OPEA/OPEA_piperarticle_celebrating.htm (accessed 25 June2006). In 1995 the commencement speaker at the graduation of industrial engineers fromNorth Carolina State University could still say: 'I am unaware of any comparable literary workin the English language that so honors any other profession. This poem is reprinted in thefront of your graduation bulletin along with a Biblical quotation that explains the context ofthe poem': http://www.ie.ncsu.edu/jwilson/gradf95.html (accessed 25 [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 92 P. Forman indication of the unwillingness of historians of technology to report the resonance that this poem sustained with the self-conception of American engineers that an electronic search ofthe entire run of Technology and Culture turns up not one article containing the phrase 'Sons of Martha'. 167[167] Oldenziel, Making Technology Masculine , 128, considering that 'The import of the poem lay in its celebration and validation of the thankless, subjugating nature of hard physical labor',alleged that 'Kipling realized only later, the explicit, irreverent treatment in his poem of thosewho did not get their hands dirty\u2014God and Mary's sons alike'. However, Kipling was clearlynot denying the higher goodness of those whom the sons of Martha served and Oldenziel'sonly evidence for Kipling's alleged reconsideration is a statement by Christopher Harvie,'\"The Sons of Martha\"', 276, regarding Kipling's increasingly unsympathetic view of laborunions\u2014which is evidence only if one accepts Oldenziel's unfounded identification of thesons of Martha with manual laborers. Harvie himself more rightly considered that '\"The Sonsof Martha\" can be read as a straightforward tribute to engineers, but the values it endorses arethose which most managers would advance as justifying their elite status'. Or, rather, so theywould 11, 16. See, e.g. Maclaurin's inaugural address as president available at http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/inaugurations/maclaurin.html (accessed12 October 2006). 170[170] Quoting Lecuyer, 'The Making of a Science Based Technological University', 180. Kline, 'Construing \"Technology\"', 213, says that following his appointment Compton's rhetoricchanged. However, on his own evidence it changed very little. Nor should we expect it tochange much, given the rhetorical obeisance to science of his industrialist supporters. 171[171] Thurston quoted from ASME, Transactions , 'The Scientist', 47, note 7. 172[172] Note 155, above. Earlier in his address Carty had declared, 'I consider that it is the high duty of our institute and of every member composing it, and that a similar duty rests uponall other engineering and scientific bodies in America, to impress upon the manufacturersof the United States the wonderful possibilities of economies in their processes andimprovement in their products which are opened up by the discoveries in science'. Carty,'The Relation of Pure Science', 512. 173[173] National Association of Manufacturers, News Letter . The representatives of research on the committee were: K.T. G.B. Pegram, E.R. Weidlein (Director of the Mellon Institute),H.A. Barton (Director of the American Institute of Physics), Julius Weinberger (RCA). I amindebted to Marcel Lafollette for drawing my attention to this document, upon which shecame in working through the Science Service records in the Smithsonian Institution Archives. 174[174] Kline, 'Construing \"Technology\"', 212. Physicists , chs II-IV, gave a good account of the pure science ideology as articulated by late 19th century American physicists. Weart, 'The PhysicsBusiness', 301-2, emphasized the rise of industrial physicists to numerical predominance inthe early 20th century. For the growth of industrial research generally, see Thackray et al ., Chemistry in America . Kline observed in concluding 'Construing \"Technology\"', 220, that 'neither the gospel of industrial research, nor the increasing respect for engineering research,nor the new terminology of the 1930s seriously challenged the established epistemologicalrelationship between pure and applied science'. 176[176] Forman, 'Social Niche'. 177[177] England, Science , 14. Reingold, 'Vannevar Bush's', 301 (1991, 287) extended England's point, discussing in some detail 'Bush's rather idiosyncratic position' and the factthat his contemporaries 'consciously or not ... were choosing a different future than VannevarBush'. Kevles, 'The National Science Foundation', 9-10, 17-19, 26, showed how largely thedrafting committee, chaired by the very conservative Isaiah Bowman, addressing the questionDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 93 '\"What might the government do to aid research generally in public and private institu- tions?\"', was crafting 'a political document, a textual weapon for the political battles of 1945 to1950 over the shape, purpose, and choice of federal policy for research and development in thepostwar era', a weapon directed specifically against the populistic proposals of Senator HarleyKilgore. But Kevles saw no need even to raise the question of agreement or disagreementbetween Bowman and Kilgore over basic scientific research as the ultimate source of technog-ical innovation. 178[178] Kline, 'Construing \"Technology\"', 219. Kline, ibid., 213, suggested that the spokespersons for engineering 'deferred to an NRC ideal of pure science ... probably in an effort to present aunited front with the scientists', but he presented no evidence for this motive. Recently, Kline,'Cybernetics...The Emergence of \"Information Technology\"', 527-9, has touched on thequestion of the persistence into the early 1960s of 'adherence to the ideal of \"pure science\", inwhich basic science is viewed as the fount of all new technology', again making evident hissense of grievance that those invoking 'a pure-science ideal' were 'subjugating information technology to information science '. 179[179] Bush, Science, The Endless Frontier , 13-14. Similarly, the 'Summary of the Report' states, in its first paragraph, that 'New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous addi-tions to knowledge of the laws of nature ... . This essential, new knowledge can be stated briefly and vividly by Mirowski, 'Caveat Emptor', at note 32. 181[181] New York Times, 'Research Milestone', recognizing the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of GE's Schenectady research laboratory. By the end of that decade this theme was part of anypresidential speechwriter's stock. In the spring of 1959 President Eisenhower said: 'in ouryoung, vigorous, and rapidly growing society, the uninformed often referred in slurringterms to what we called the \"impractical scholar\". Fortunately, we ... have learned thatthe apparently visionary researcher is likely to produce unexpectedly practical results.'Eisenhower, 'Science', 137. Four years later President Kennedy said much the same, asquoted by Greenberg, The Politics of Pure Science , 254: 'If I were to name a single thing which points up the difference this century had made in the American attitude toward science, itwould certainly be the wholehearted understanding today of the importance of pure science.We realize now that progress in technology depends on progress in theory; that the mostabstract investigations can lead to the most concrete results'. Thus I was half wrong in sayingof Kennedy that 'the first President who was prepared to tell them that was also the lastPresident who would be willing to tell them that' when quoting this in Forman, 'RecentScience', 185. 182[182] That in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s both the military and industry believed in the linear model, i.e. 'the notion that radical technological innovation rests exclusively onadvances in basic science', is the conclusion that Asner drew from his close examination ofpolicy and practice of the US DoD in the funding of research in conjunction with contractsfor industrial production: Asner, 'The Linear Model' (2004). Asner's paper followed in thesymposium volume by Edgerton's byHounshell, 'Industrial Research', who, drawing upon his knowledge of research policy atDuPont, rebutted Edgerton. See, further, note 422, below. 183[183] Snow, 'The Moral Unneutrality', including an introduction by Warren Weaver and responses by Father T. M. Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame University, and W. O. Baker,vice president for research, Bell Telephone Laboratories. Like several other of Snow's 'morallessons of science' lectures at about this time, this too drew wide notice and was reprinted inseveral places. 184[184] Baker, 'Response'. 185[185] That 'practical aspect' was the conflict in values between the truth-seeking scientist and the pragmatic orientation of the world of affairs, with Baker insisting on the impossibility ofDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 94 P. Forman the scientist making any compromise: 'Never can the scientist deal with [i.e. deal half truth'. 186[186] Snow, 'The Moral Unneutrality', 257. Snow had already said in his 1959 Rede Lecture, 'The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution', that it 'was not to our credit' that the attitude ofyoung researchers at Cambridge in the 1930s, and he among them, 'was to take it for grantedthat applied science was an occupation for second-rate minds', and that the more distantone's work appeared to be from 'any practical use ... the more superior one felt'. Snow thereacknowledged his obvious debt to Ashby, Technology and the Academics , 88, 85, who had argued that 'Universities have adapted themselves considerably to the scientific revolution,but in adaptation to technology\u2014which is one of the consequences of that revolution\u2014theyhave not yet reached equilibrium', i.e. not yet taken technology as 'the core of a new twenti-eth-century humanism'. Snow, taking 'A Second Look' five years later, went even farther.Repudiating any attempt, including his own earlier attempts, 'to draw a clear line betweenpure science and technology', Snow avowed that 'The more I have seen of technologists atwork, the more untenable the distinction has come to look. If you actually see someone designan aircraft, you find him going through the same experience\u2014aesthetic, intellectual, moral\u2014as though he were setting up an experiment in particle physics'. Snow, The Two Cultures , 32- 3, 67. Thus Snow, the governmental administrator of scientific and technical affairs, droppingall reservations such as Auerbach had used to elevate science above technology, advanced to avery nearly postmodern position; only the retention of pure science as the standard and basisof comparison keeps it from being such. Similarly strong repudiations of the priority of puritywere expressed shortly after by Medawar, 'Two Conceptions'. 187[187] Baker, 'Response', 262. thrust of 'the Grinter Report', the major self-evaluation of engineering education carried out in the early 1950s, was that engi-neering at its best was applied science, and that not all fields of engineering were doing well bythat standard. Wisnioski, 'Engineers and the Intellectual', 102-4, quotes from the republica-tion of that report in Journal of Engineering Education , January 1994: 'The continued growth of our knowledge of basic science has opened vast new areas to engineering endeavor and hasenlarged the foundations underlying many of the existing engineering fields. Some fields ofengineering have been reasonably alert in assimilating new scientific advances into theirteaching programs. It is one purpose of this Report to encourage all fields of engineeringeducation to move in this direction.' 188[188] Once that faith had failed it became conventional to attribute great importance to the results of 'Project Hindsight': Sherwin and Isenson, 'Project Hindsight' (1967). Yet when thoseresults were first published they were accompanied by strong reaffirmations of that faith inthe face of the evidence presented. Declaring that 'It is clear that, on the 50-year or moretime scale, undirected science has been of immense value', the authors of that report advo-cated that the U.S. Department of Defense devote 10% of its science and technology expen-ditures to such undirected research\u2014in effect double the percentage that agency hadmaintained in the previous two decades. The authors of the two other investigationscommonly cited as empirical disproofs of the dependence of invention upon science, Jewkeset al ., The Sources of Invention (1958; 1969), 38, 60-2, 224, and Schmookler, Invention (1966), 8-9, were similarly disinclined to draw from their researches general conclusions atvariance with the presumed primacy of science for technological development since the late19th century. Jewkes, himself a Polanyi-admiring conservative, was even opposed to the bythen conventional view that science and scientific knowledge played a minor, even negligi-ble, role in invention prior to the end of the 19th century. 189[189] http://www.bell-labs.com/about/history/presidents.html has a portrait of each of Bell Laboratories' presidents and 75-word summary of the laboratory's accomplishments duringtheir tenure. Only two of these summaries mention Nobel prizes: that of the first president,Jewett (1925-40), where at the end of the summary the fact of the laboratory winning its firstNobel prize is stated; and that of Baker (1973-9), where the summary begins with, and isDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 95 largely filled with, a recitation of the research fields in which Bell Laboratories' researchers won Nobel Prizes in physics. Thereafter, Nobel prizes are no longer considered noteworthy,but the summaries contain careful listings of National Medals of Technology won. J. K. Smith,Jr, 'Review Essay', 129-30, reviewing the then recent historical research on American indus-trial research, found it 'remarkable how similar the postwar experiences' of the several indus-trial research powerhouses were. Quite independently of such factors as the extent of theirparticipation in government-funded research, in each at about the same time 'managementbegan to lose patience with the denizens of these ivory towers' that management had itselfconstructed. 'What was the source of this discontent?' Smith was as ready to pin it on 'a fewoutspoken executives or management consultants' as on an empirically realized failure of 'thepromise of science-based invention'\u2014i.e. he saw no reasonable explanation. Which suggeststhat the failure of that faith in science was scarcely more reasonable than the faith itself. 190[190] 'Die deutsche of 'German industry' and the past century quite generally. My contention, however, is that the German industrialists were, in this regard,not on a 'Sonderweg' but on the Bayern\u2014restated this view less pomp-ously, and thus more concisely and clearly, at the 3rd Ausschusssitzung, 12 November 26. And two years later, at the 5th Ausschusssitzung, 1 October 1908, Prince Ludwig carried this thought a step farther: quoted from the protocol of the 11 May 1903, meeting of the WissenschaftlicherAusschuss Old Order , where Gispen P. Forman Kritik mit'. Further details on the replies of there was significant opposition to Riedler's anti-theoretical stance. It is an indication ofhow alone Riedler was in his Technik als Kultur stance, Ulrich Wendt, then writing Die Technik als Kulturmacht , 2, could say that Roscher and Engels were the only writers in which he found even hints of the importance throughout history of 'die Technik als Kulturfaktor'. 203[203] 'As to [National Socialist] ideology and rhetoric, three central elements have to be noted: the ideal of a heroic will tempered by a soldier-like character; the praise of Anschauung ; and the utilitarian move': Mehrtens, 'Mathematics and War', 101. In 1934 the Reichsminister f\u00fcrVolksaufkl\u00e4rung und Propaganda could still write that 'working under the flag of sciencewould bring us successfully to our goals', but by 1938 such a statement was evidently out question: Doel et al., 'National Polity in France , 195-209, drawing attention to the alliance between the artisans and the artists based on a common romantic confidence in genius. Joravsky, The Lysenko Affair , as discussed in note 108, above, drew attention to the populistic, anti-intellectual dimension of Soviet 'science policy'. With reference to the USA, see next note. 205[205] Had Perry Miller lived to complete The Life of the Mind in America (1965), 321-4, we would have a well-documented account of the challenge to high-culture values in the Jacksonianperiod. To my knowledge, no such account has been provided even to this day. Hindle,Technology in Early America , 87-8, noted an 'anti-intellectual and anti-scientific impulse' in such works as Amos Eaton, Art without Science (1830), but did not invoke Jacksonianism or otherwise suggest a connection with more general features of that period. Molella andReingold, 'Theorists and Ingenious Mechanics' (1973; 1991), without referring to Hindle orhis evidence, inferred a refusal by American mechanics to credit mechanical inventions to themechanical philosophy from Joseph Henry's polemical counter-assertions, which theyencountered in editing his papers. They cited (in their note 41) only one statement of the viewagainst which Henry remonstrated. Their failure to find more evidence they excused with theobservation that 'Actually documenting the viewpoints and alleged prejudices of these stillunknown mechanics is a difficult and intricate task' (note 26). Still they were confident that a'viewpoint like Henry's was only considered seriously by a minority. The practical labors ofpractical men were self-evident causes for technical improvements to most Americans of thatday, judging by the evidence so far uncovered' (p. 139). The matter of this Jacksonian revoltagainst science is not engaged by Daniels, American Science in the Age of Jackson , nor by Greene, American Science in the Age of Jefferson , nor by Bruce, The Launching of Modern American Science, 1846-1876 ; nor by Sinclair, Philadelphia's Philosopher-Mechanics: A History of the Franklin Institute, 1824-1865 , who has Perry Miller's book in his bibliography, but does not cite it in his notes. 206[206] Reingold, 'Joseph Henry'. Kevles, The Physicists , 6, emphasized rather the fact that in 1850, as in 1832, Henry still saw a serious problem in the public's regard of 'abstract science' but thatin 1874 Henry expressed himself in the Smithsonian's Annual Report as seeing a 'great change' having occurred in the previous quarter century in the public's 'appreciation of abstractscience as an element in the advance of modern civilization'. 207[207] Especially aviating engineers, e.g. Siegmund-Schultze, 'A Non-Conformist'. 208[208] Although the opposite has been asserted of Victorian Britain by distinguished scholars, I incline to regard such claims as more ideologically than empirically founded, as I argue atgreater length in Section III in regard to early 19th century America. Notable here is Sussman'scontention, Victorians and the Machine , 6, that 'Seeing the machine as symbol of the spirit enabled Carlyle to welcome the machine while excluding intellectual mechanism. To accepttechnology while rejecting scientists, he brings the inventor into the context of Carlylean hero-ism'. A Carlylean move 'to accept technology while rejecting scientists' is simply notsupported by 'Signs of the Times', on which Sussman chiefly relies. My disposition to setSussman's thesis aside as ideological rather than empirical is strengthened by finding it quotedDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 97 approvingly, but vacuously, in a recent paper that, on my reading, contributes no evidence in support of that thesis: Miller, '\"Puffing Jamie\"'. On this issue of the primacy of science, whichis for us the main issue, Sussman reversed himself in the latter half of Victorians and the Machine , stating correctly, as I think, in his concluding paragraph (233) that 'In the machine, then, the Victorian literary imagination saw incarnated the power of the scientific intellect ...the deeper conflict between rationalism and intuitionism, between scientific and organicmodes of thought ... is the true subject of the Victorian writing on the machine'. SimilarlyBerg, The Machinery Question , 149, 155, stated that the assumptions underlying the British mechanics institutes 'fostered the views ... that science was merely an appendage of techno-logical knowledge'. However, her evidence points in the opposite direction, namely to thecentrality of science in the conception of the new sort of artisan that such institutes wouldcreate. As with Sussman, but even more so, Berg's quoted contention regarding the subordi-nation of science to technology is antithetic to her main thesis, which was that 'the scientificmovement' constituted in that place and period 'a far-reaching cultural sphere' (151). If thethen common notion that science stood at the center of technological progress was, as Berg sowished to emphasize, 'a mythical one' (145), 'was rhetorical only' (177), that is not evidence that science was viewed in Britain at that time as 'merely an appendage of technologicalknowledge', but the reverse: that technology was viewed as merely an appendage of scientificknowledge. 209[209] The 1930s and 1940s saw publication of a considerable number of books deprecating the primacy that science had come to have in modernity, a fair fraction from the University ofChicago, among them Morgenthau, Scientific Man . This book, like so many such, for all that it polemicizes against science's cultural primacy, testifies to it. So, e.g. pp. 136-9, 144-5. To theextent that Morgenthau directs himself against the engineer, as in his concluding section 'TheStatesman vs. The Engineer', pp. 219-231, it is only because he takes it as a matter of coursethat the engineer is an applied scientist\u2014what I stress because it is overlooked by Jordan,Machine-Age Ideology , 9, in quoting Morgenthau. 210[210] Lafollette, Making Science Our Own ; Jordan, Machine-Age Ideology , 185-92, though in general leaning over backward to ignore his sources' emphasis on science, in describing the Chicago1933 'Century of Progress' exhibition points out that the 'organizers in Chicago hadconceived of the entire fair as a testimony to the power of science', and quotes the OfficialGuide Book of the Fair that 'in virtually everything we do we enjoy a gift from Science'. Heincludes a photograph of the towering 'Hall of Science', which building, 'initially called theTemple of Science, constituted the architectural focal point of the fair'. Likewise Rose 'ScienceAs an Idiom', 3, though the fact displeased him, stressed that 'By the 1880s, articulate Ameri-cans'\u2014i.e. 'leaders in professions'\u2014'routinely technologywith science'. 211[211] Lafollette, Making Science Our 9. Nor was this just middle-brow thinking: Dewey's philosophy was largely an elaboration of this conviction. 212[212] Kevles, The Physicists , 180-4, quoting Charles Beard, 1930. On Beard, Jordan, Machine-Age Ideology , 214-21, who brings out Beard's heroizing of the engineer in the early 1930s, and his hopes for social salvation in the application of engineering methods, without, however, notic-ing the coincidence with Beard's taking his son, an MIT engineer, as collaborator, nor draw-ing attention to Beard's taking it as a given that whatever effectiveness engineering achievedwas due to science underlying it. 213[213] Kevles, The Physicists , 237, ch. 6, et passim . That science was held responsible is not Bix's thesis, but is evident in her evidence. Meier, 'The TechnologicalConcept', vii, quoted as indicative Roosevelt's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace,writing in Mechanical Engineering in March 1934: 'Yet science all this time has been creating another world and another civilization that simply must be motivated by some conscioussocial purpose, if civilization is to endure'. 214[214] As Forman 215[215] Paul Goodman, New Reformation , p. 21, as quoted by Winner, Autonomous Technology , 4. Goodman speaks not of 'technology' but of 'science'. Nonetheless, Winner puts forward thequotation in illustration and explanation of why technology was then becoming a matter of such general concern. 216[216] The Bishop of Ripon's brief remarks from a Leeds pulpit, and specimens of the huge uproar in the press they occasioned, are quoted in The Literary Digest , as reprinted in Hughes, Changing Attitudes , 217-21. 217[217] The Physicists , ch. XVII. Striking here with Roosevelt's Science Advisory Board, as with the composition of the President's Science Advisory Committee 25 years later, is its over-whelmingly 'pure' science membership. That initial cohort was supplemented by additionalappointees a year later\u2014 not in order to remedy the absence of applied scientists\u2014let alone engineers\u2014but to remedy the relative absence of life scientists: Cochrane, The National Academy of Sciences , 652-5. 218[218] National Association of Manufacturers, News Letter (19 November 1938). See note 173, above. 219[219] Jordan, Machine-Age Ideology , 9, 217, 219, unreflectively conflates science and technology, doing so half in the scientistic spirit of the era that he describes, and half in technologisticspirit of postmodernity: 'The term engineer could generically connote inventors and scientists as well as professional applied scientists'. But though Jordan gives primacy to technology, theprimacy of science for his subjects keeps popping out of his exposition. Thus in his pages onRexford Tugwell (247-51), his leading example of a convinced technocrat empowered by theNew Deal, Jordan speaks always of Taylorism and social engineering, while in his exhibitedquotations Tugwell speaks of science. 220[220] Needell, Science, Cold War .

Also in 1962 Hutchins' Center sponsored a 'Conference on the Role and Responsibilities of Science Executives in the Federal Service' andpublished its report, Science and Democratic Government (1963). In the 4 October 1963, issue of Science , Greenberg, 'Reaction to Snow' quoted Hutchins, at some length, from a recent 'Occasional Paper' of his Center, developing the thesis that 'professors are somewhat worse[morally] than other people, and that scientists are somewhat worse than other professors'.Greenberg's intent was likewise to ridicule the notion that 'we should permit ourselves to beruled by scientist-kings', but that very premise of Greenberg's piece is evidence that scientistswere then being looked to as philosopher-kings. 226[226] Miller, Lewis Mumford , is the authorized biography and a considerable achievement, though having many deficiencies, among them the want of a 'theory' of Mumford\u2014for which seeForman, 'How Lewis Mumford Saw Science'. side of Mumford most seriously neglectedby Miller, namely Mumford's steady concern with architecture, is the subject of a dissertationby Wojtowicz, 'The Lewis Mumford Decades', and of a it: Mumford and American 11, judged Mumford 'the most important architectural critic produced by the United States in the twentiethcentury', and that judgement is affirmed by Mallgrave, Modern Architectural Theory , 293.

Both Marx and the editors of that volume acknowledge for the term 'publicintellectual', Jacoby, The Last Intellectuals , where Mumford, with his 'singular oeuvre, almost unequaled in American letters' (191), figures importantly. As regards the history of technology, Hughes has been Mumford's longest and steadiest proponent. Mumford is all through Hughes, American Genesis , where he figures both as historical actor and as repeatedly affirmed historical-cultural interpreter. (In addition to themany pages listed in the index of that book, Mumford appears also on pp. 354-60, 369, 453,454, 458.) Further evidence of Mumford's high importance for the historians of technology isprovided below in Section III. As regards American Studies, Mumford makes a case forhimself in opening his 'Introduction to the 1957 Edition' of The Golden Day . As of 24 October 2005, Googling 'American Studies' + 'Alan Trachtenberg'\u2014he being perhaps the most widely andhighly regarded American Studies scholar at work today\u2014produced 780 web pages. 227[227] Mendelsohn, 'Prophet of Our Discontent', 355, 357: 'the scientific community, and especially its leaders, saw him as posing a direct challenge to them'; saw Mumford, The Pentagon of Power 'as an attack on the very core of their practice and their thought'. 228[228] Hughes, American Genesis , 359, placed himself squarely with Mumford on the side of 'life'. Regarding Lebensphilosophie , see the notes to the sub-section below on the Erlangen and Starnberg schools. Among the seventeen contributors to Hughes and Hughes, Lewis Mumford , many point to the centrality of the organic and of 'life' in Mumford's thought, but only one recognizes Lebensphilosophie as the appropriate term, and the German intellectual tradition as pertinent context for Mumford's thought: Molesworth, 'Inner and Outer', 252. 'How Lewis Mumford'. See also notes 139 and 140, above. 232[232] Mumford, 'The Pragmatic Acquiescence: A Reply'. The from Dewey, 'The Pragmatic Acquiescence'. The Humpty-Dumpty simile was a he had used it in Mumford, 'Via vitae', and would use it again in Technics Civilization , 447. 233[233] Mumford, The Golden 94, 131, 135-6. The reference to 'Mr Babbitt' was, of course, to the title character of Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt (1922) who had been seized upon immediately as the perfect expression of the philistinism that Mumford's generation found most antipatheticin the middle-class American. The characterization of Dewey's mental habitus as 'protectivecoloration' was due to Mumford's admired older contemporary, Bourne. In orderto disdain Dewey's instrumentalism as Babbittry, Mumford had to misrepresent Dewey'sranking of on the scale of cultural values: 'Mr Dewey's instrumentalism is boundup with a certain democratic indiscriminateness in his personal standards: a Goodyear and aMorse seem to him as high in the scale of human development as a Whitman and a Tolstoi'.Mumford, The Golden Day , 134. This misrepresentation of what we have seen to be Dewey's views serves Mumford's endeavor to distinguish himself from Dewey by affirming the roman-tic orthodoxy of the artistic circles into which Mumford had thrown himself in the previoustwo or three years. The continuing antagonism between Mumford and Dewey from that dateto the early 1940s is closely and broadly considered by Westbrook, 'Lewis Mumford, JohnDewey'. (It should be noted, however, that Mumford did seek to make a generous gesturetowards Dewey in 1938, one that he succeeded in making in 1946: Mumford, Values for Survival wide of the mark', and that the two 'were kindred spirits to a greater degree than eitherDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 100 P. Forman was willing to admit'. Repeatedly through that essay Westbrook exhibited quotations of Dewey indicative of the similarity with Mumford in social philosophy and view of art(pp. 307, 308, 310, 311, 312). Likewise, Blake, 'The Perils of Personality', 287: 'Mumford owedmore to is absent from Mumford's autobiogra-phy of his early years, Sketches From Life . 235[235] Thus in his man of letters phase, running from the mid 1920s to the late 1930s, Mumford insisted that contemporary man's greatest need is for 'the ability to conceive new forms andchannels for life to run in, the ability to think creatively with the artist who says \"I will\" ratherthan Pragmatic Acquiescence:A Reply'. 236[236] A hegemony won above all through 'the very success of the physical sciences in their applica- tions to technics': Mumford, Values for Survival , 83. 'Philosophy is reclaiming the place which science so confidently pre-empted on the basis of its pragmatic applications': Mumford, 'TheGrain of Things' (1930), the pertinent paragraphs of which Mumford reprinted, under theheading 'The Sciences and Philosophy', in Findings and Keepings , 193, and again in My Works and Days (1978), 190, where Mumford, not insignificantly, modified it to 'its many successful pragmatic applications'. Even in these middle years of primary identification with the artist,Mumford vacillated on the question whether to deny physical-mathematical science its scien-tistic place as highest cultural value. So, for example, in Technics and Civilization , 361, Mumford judged 'creating a neutral world ... the great general contribution of modernanalytic science. This contribution was possibly second only to the development of our origi-nal language concepts.' In The Golden Day , 132, Mumford had even gone so far as to say that 'with the introduction of the scientific method, men began to think consciously as wholehuman beings'. 237[237] Mumford, 'The Proud Pageantry of Man' (1922), and more fully at about this same time in The Story of Utopias , 271: 'On the basis of the precise knowledge of physical relations which became available in mathematics, physics, mechanics, and chemistry the startling changeswhich have been crudelly labeled the \"industrial revolution\" were carried through ... . Theactual world of machinery is at present, it seems fair to say, a parasite upon this body ofknowledge, and it would speedily starve to death if the host were annihilated'. See, also, note61, above. 238[238] Mumford, The Golden Day ch. 1, as reprinted in Mumford, Interpretations , 7-8. The corresponding pages in The Golden Day are 6-8. The same is restated there more concisely on p. 137. 239[239] Mumford, 'Drama , 57. It must be allowed that there are a couple of passages in the 1930 Scribner's Magazine essay (in Mumford, Interpretations and Forecasts , 229, 231) in which Mumford asserts the opposite causation, as would be expected from romantic- lebensphilosophisch principles of the primacy of practice, and more especially from that version of them avowed by Veblen. Thus acouple pages after developing his 'general staff' metaphor for the role of scientists, Mumfordhas a couple paragraphs developing the thesis that 'The woodman was the chief contributor tothe precise arts: ... in his creation of the engine lathe ... he handed on the most useful perhapsof all machine tools, for without it accurate machines and instruments of measurement couldnot be made. ... From the woodman's primitive distillation of tar to the thousand dyes andmedicines and poisons that come from the destructive distillation of coal,' etc. ThereMumford even says that the machine 'has created for the accomplishment of certain physicalresults a universal language: the language of exact science'. Yet these statements are so inconsistent with his most fundamental preconceptions that Mumford just cannot believe what he finds himself saying. So, in the midst of that passagemaking the woodman the real source of modern technology and modern science too,Mumford reinserts 'the General Staff' to make By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 101 planted, once the General Staff was ready to supply a broad stream of abstract ideas and suggestions, the time had come for the machine to take possession of Western civilization: atlast the derivative products of industrialism could spawn and multiply'. Otherwise, through this essay it is, over and over, the primacy of science to and for technology that comes to expression: 'Hitherto the sole influence upon machine design had been thephysical sciences' (234); 'the three greatest monuments' of 19th century engineering, theCrystal Palace, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Eiffel Tower, were 'created with the aid of physicsand mathematics and their special technologies' (235); 'the machine has given us a nobleausterity of form' in consequence of 'its background of scientific concepts and abstract cate-gories' (239). Long, 'Lewis Mumford', 171-2, points out the primacy disparagement of engineers. and Civilization , 216. Importance of Science'\u2014has as opening sentence: 'The detailed history of the steam engine, the railroad,the textile mill, the iron ship, could be written without more than passing reference to thescientific work of the period'. Mumford, as reader and writer about the history of technol-ogy knew this to be so, but as modern was incapable of assimilating the stated fact andreconciling it with his presuppposition of the primacy of science for technolgy. As a resultMumford stated this antithetic fact only as a rhetorical foil for an exposition of 'TheImportance of Science'. 243[243] Ibid., 217-18. Two years later, in reviewing J. G. Crowther's Men of Science ('Science Out of the Cloister') Mumford wrote: 'Mr Crowther picks up the thread at the point where Smilesdropped it: but instead of dealing with derivative motors of industry, he deals with the primemovers\u2014the physical scientists who opened new fields of exploration, formulated new prob-lems, and laid the basis for a thousand practical applications'. 244[244] Mumford, Technics and Civilization , 218-19. The affinity Veblen and Dewey is to be seen in Mumford's frequent pejorative use 'pecuniary', as in Mumford, 'Toward Civilization?'(1930), 50: Mumford, The Pentagon of Power , 122-3. Mumford incorporates here in chapter 5, 'Science as Technology', in great part a paper that he had published in 1961: 'Bacon: Science asTechnology'. The primary, leading, nearly exclusive, role of science in the creation of newtechnologies is emphasized repeatedly in this earlier paper (159, 161, 163-6) as it is in the1970 book (65-73, 120-1). 246[246] Among innumerable instances testifying to Mumford sharing the common perception of a heightened primacy of science, The Myth of the Machine I , 3, opens: 'The last century, we all realize, has witnessed a radical transformation in the entire human environment, largely as aresult of the impact of the mathematical and physical sciences upon technology'. 247[247] Mumford wrote to his friend Benton MacKaye in 1964 that 'the primacy of mind' was the concept underlying The Myth of the Machine , his two-volume work then in progress. Miller, see also 456. 'The Primacy of Mind' the title of the opening section of Mumford's 'The Human Heritage', first published in 1972 and republished in Mumford, My Works and Days , 468-84. Mumford's argument there is, again, against homo faber , insisting that man's discovery of the capabilities of his big brain long preceded development of even thecrudest tools. Already in 1951 Mumford, arguing against Bergson's homo faber , asserted that 'the chief source of this [i.e. man's] particular form of creativity was not fire, tools, weapons,machines, but two subjective instruments far older than any of these: the dream and theword': The Conduct of Life , 40. This was of course Mumford's leaning from early on, but in Technics and Civilization , 370, it appeared not as a thesis, but as inadvertent lapse: 'the tools and instruments society has developed through history\u2014words, symbols, grammar, logic'.Mumford's reassertion of the primacy of mind post-Second World War was quite in line withthe general shift to mentalism that appears strikingly in the history of the history of science.See Mayer, 'Setting Up a Discipline'. P. Forman 249[249] Mumford, The Myth of the Machine I , 7, with the volume as a whole being devoted to mini- mizing the role of the tool and the machine. This feature, as well as his discovery that the mostimportant technics in early civilizations were organized bodies of human beings, were empha-sized by Mumford in 1959 as the points in which his thought departed from and advancedover Technics and Civilization : Mumford, 'An Appraisal Long, 'Lewis Mumford', 170-1, underscores of a mountain ofhand-axes'. 250[250] Mumford, The Myth of the Machine I , 11-12. Recapitulating this argument early in the second volume of The Myth of the Machine , Mumford emphasized that 'the priesthood of science, whose mathematical measurements had first disclosed and utilized this source of cosmicorder, lacked the faintest premonitions of the possible consequences. In all innocence, astron-omy and celestial mechanics laid the foundation for a more absolute order, political andindustrial ...'. Mumford, The Myth of the Machine II , 30. Miller, ' The Myth of the Machine ', 155-56: 'Mumford argues that the critical tools that led to the assembly of the megamachinewere inventions of the mind: mathematics and astronomical observation ...'. 251[251] Up until 1927 the difference between Mumford's treatment of scientists and of engineers is drastic: the scientists generally considered admirable and their activities all-important; theengineers generally insulted, and their actions almost always injurious. Thus in The Golden Day, Mumford speaks of science, affirmatively, on 7-9, 14, 50, 54, 93, 98, 113, 115, 132, 141, 144, and of technology and engineers, negatively, on 49, 87-8, 118, 132, 134-7, 141.Mumford, who in his handling of technology here is heavily indebted to his admired contem-porary Van Wyck Brooks, simply ignores the affirmations of it by 19th century Americanwriters\u2014or, rather, does so up to his antepenultimate page where he says: 'Need I recall thatWhitman wrote an apostrophe to the locomotive ... that Thoreau, who loved to hear the windin the pine needles, listened with equal pleasure to the music of the telegraph wires?' So farfrom having previously stated anything of the sort, Mumford had earlier in that book explic-itly denied Whitman and Thoreau such sympathies. In 1927/28 Mumford underwent a seachange, and could say that 'engineering shares with music the supremacy in the arts duringthe last hundred and fifty years'. Mumford, 'The Arts', 303, 305, 312. For evidence that arefusal to see the results of engineering functionalism as aesthetic remained Mumford'spredominant attitude 297, 300, 446, ignoring the the anomalousness, and the transience of Mumford's post-1927 philotechnic phase, represented him as having from 1921onward 'experienced the technological enthusiasm of the interwar years'. Hughes presentedMumford as avant garde , where in fact his aesthetic sensibility was very conservative\u2014close to that of Ruskin, the main influence on his aesthetic formation. More generally still, if I amright in the argument of this paper, American Genesis is misconceived in taking 'technological enthusiasm' as being simply or even primarily an enthusiasm for technologists. That Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm, 1870-1970 , was much rather\u2014and for Mumford, most emphatically\u2014an enthusiasm for science and scientists, and they not merely but also asthe creative agents giving birth to new technologies. 253[253] This is striking in Mumford's survey of 'The Arts' (1928), where for all that he elevates engi- neering, he presents science as the main motor, for the fine arts as well. (One must rely uponcontext to construe the meaning of the word 'art' in Mumford's writings prior to the late1930s, for he used it not only to refer to aesthetic endeavors but also at times in the archaicsense of the industrial arts, technics.) 254[254] Prior to the early 1930s Mumford had declined to accept his mentor Patrick Geddes' concep- tion of an emergent neotechnic era, and he would begin to turn against it again shortly aftercompleting Technics and Civilization . On this point By: [Forman, Paul] 255[255] Mumford, Technics and Civilization , 216-20; quotation on 218. Hughes, American Genesis , took much the same pro-invention, anti-engineering stance. I have seen one statement byMumford regarding the actors to whom technics are due that places engineers first and scien-tists last: Mumford, 'An Appraisal of Civilization , 219-20. The German term is Schiffsbauingenieur , but had he translated it as 'naval architect' Mumford would have found it difficult to make fun of itsbearer. Upon publication of Whither Mankind? , the volume edited by Charles A. Beard that included Mumford's 'The Arts', a group of engineers protested the neglect of their contribu-tion to human progress, with the upshot that Beard edited a sequel, Toward Civilization (1930), authored by that group. Reviewing it, Mumford, 'Toward Civilization?', showed onlycontempt for engineers (while using a scientist as avatar of the virtue they would fain possess):'interspersed with innumerable references to the wisdom, integrity, fairness and general apti-tude of the engineer, a class of illumined minds who, according to the authors\u2014and whowould know better?\u2014combine the chivalry of intellectual resourcefulnessof a Faraday ... . Is there any notion, among these distinguished contributors, that their arthas as its social foundation the destructive occupations of mining and warfare? ... and thatthis mixture of mining, warfare and finance has been the specific medium in which engineer-ing has germinated and spread ... . Without this specific medium, engineering would be animportant but subordinate art: while the medium exists, scarcely any other art than engineer-ing is capable of flourishing.' Ergo, let us ignore it. 257[257] Mumford, The City in History , a 600-page tome on the city from antiquity to the 20th century\u2014the city especially in its physical aspects, including provision for the physical needsof city dwellers\u2014that has scarcely a dozen pages on civil engineering! Indicative is the firstentry in the index under 'Engineering', viz. 'inadequacy of Roman and American'\u2014Mumfordis contemptuous of its 'flatulence'. 'Engineers, fortifications need for' leads to the assertion that'The development of the art of fortification shifted the emphasis in building from architectureto engineering', and that this was a 'prelude to the wider technics of the machine' (360). As thisinvolved a shift in emphasis 'from esthetic design to material calculations of weight, number,position', Mumford will not go there. The grossly unsanitary conditions in English cities andtowns in the mid 19th century are portrayed over many pages in graphic detail, but their reme-diation is dealt with by a wave of the hand toward 'those improvements which three genera-tions of active legislation and massive sanitary engineering have finally brought about' (462). 258[258] Mumford, 'Prologue Our Time'; Mumford, My Works and Days , ch. 1. First published in The New Yorker in 1975; it had been drafted more than 10 years earlier. The essay concludes with Mumford exhilarated by the discussion of black holes 'at a lively luncheon of astrophysi-cists which I attended ... The astrophysicists are daringly open-minded fellows,' andit is from the stimulus of their ideas that 'my own faith blithely flourishes. Let the curtain riseon the twenty-first century\u2014 and After !' 259[259] See Section I, notes 25, 33-40, particularly, and notes 260-70, below. 260[260] Schn\u00e4delbach, Philosophy in Germany, 1831 -1933 (1984), ch. 5, particularly 142-7, asserted the lebensphilosophisch unanimity, right to left, but acknowledged (142) that 'no real research has yet been done into the roots in social and ideological history of this basic mood'. 261[261] Although evidence of this romantic tradition of disparagement of technology and experimen- tal science is plentiful, no scholarly account of it is known to me. Herf, Reactionary Modernism , who, given his topic, ought to have investigated the romantic tradition, did not. Promisingexplorations of the post-Second World War intellectual-political scene focusing on theappraisal of technology in relation to science are being undertaken by Beyler, 'The Demon ofTechnology', and 'Physics and the Ideology'. Carson, as Instrumental Reason', hasextended her close attention from Heisenberg to Heidegger and Habermas in a paper that shehas kindly allowed me to read in draft. 262[262] To my knowledge, the closest to come to such an elevation of technology was Friedrich Dessauer, who indeed was a true original. (See, 'Friedrich Dessauer,Downloaded By: [Forman, http://www.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/paf/paf84.html [accessed 12 October 2006].) Dessauer's Philosophie der Technik (1927) is unique in its claims for the value of technology in every dimension of culture, from economics and ethics to epistemologyand ontology, and on to religion ('approach to the throne of God'). Dessauer made an argu-ment there for an invention being something more wonderful than a scientific discovery(what we postmoderns simply assume): the discovered phenomenon or law was out there allalong, but through 'Erfindung ... neue Qualit\u00e4t in die Erfahrungswelt zum ersten Malehineinkommt' (61). He even presented such scientific achievements as weighing the planets astechnical (3). Nowhere, however, did Dessauer explicitly assert that science as such is technol-ogy. Rather, as one expects from a physicist, for all that Dessauer put the technical objectforward as the highest form of 'realization', priority remained with the laws of many additions and reformulations in Streit um die Technik (1958) was to weaken his claims for the epistemic primacy of technology. McCormmach, 'On Academic Scientists', 162, said Wendt, Die Technik als Kulturmacht (1906), had argued 'that technology now determined the science of the time rather than thereverse', but I am not able to find that argument in the book. True, Wendt (8-10, 315), likeRiedler, was However, Wendt did not deny that dependence of modern technology upon natural science. On the contrary, as Marxian socialist Wendt believed in it, but alsobelieved formed 'die Erg\u00e4nzung der Naturwissenschaft', rather thanscience being an end in itself. 263[263] The West German Constitution includes a guarantee of the freedom of science\u2014which free- dom is commonly understood as guaranteeing the production of truth through the absence ofany constraint on the course of scientific work due to political interests. That constitutionalguarantee reflects the fact that the pre-postmodern self-conception of the scholar as necessar-ily disengaged from the hurly-burly of ordinary life, and more especially of political life, hadfound stronger cultural support in Germany than in any other country. Yet, paradoxically,even more characteristic of German culture has been the lebensphilosophisch consensus that 'life' is the fundamental basis of knowledge\u2014the only legitimate basis of knowledge\u2014thuscreating a deep conviction, on the right as on the left, that value-free science was both impos-sible and undesirable. 264[264] M\u00f6sgen, 'Wilhelm Kamlah'; Roberts, 'Lorenzen, Paul'. A couple essays by each of some eight members of the Erlangen school are translated and published in Butts and Prop\u00e4deutik . My sales figure is upped slightly from that as of 1983 given in Lorenzen's preface to his Normative Logic and Ethics , 3. The criticism of Heidegger in Logische Prop\u00e4deutik is largely implicit; they criticize Heidegger directly in only one short section (pp. 111-12 in the English translation), where they\u2014or, rather, Kamlah\u2014show thatone, the central one, of Heidegger's many cockamamie etymologies is sheer invention. Kamlahhad taken Heidegger to task for his use of insupportable etymologies\u2014'zur Erdichtung IhrerIhnen vollends eigent\u00fcmlichen Begriffsmythologie'\u2014in nach der Kamlah, 'Martin Heidegger'; Kamlah had studied with Heidegger ca 1930, but was excluded from an academic career by the National Socialist regime. He had opted for clarity in the mid 1930s, butthat open letter was his first published attack on Heidegger.) 266[266] Lorenzen, 'Methodisches Denken', 36-7. The capitalization of 'Life', as also the inclusion of the original German of the quotation of Dilthey, is as it appears in the English version. TheGerman version is reprinted as title 2007 History and Technology 105 (quotation from p. 26), and retranslated somewhat more freely in Lorenzen, Constructive Philosophy . The title of Lorenzen's essay and book signals both a continuation of Dingler's program (see note 270) and what distinguished Lorenzen's program from the sheerly roman-tic tendency of most Lebensphilosophie , namely his affirmation rather than rejection of method. Grappling with this issue from a position much closer to Heidegger, was Gadamer,Truth and Method [original German edition, 1960], especially 214-35 on Dilthey. 267[267] Regarding Heidegger as Lebensphilosoph , see note 38, above. What interested Lorenzen in Misch is suggested by the title of a recent publication of Misch's lectures at G\u00f6ttingen in thelate 1920s: in Erkenntnisse und Interesse , and it is that which made Peirce so attractive to him. (Dewey, considered as political thinker,ought to have been Habermas's man, but was disqualified by his naturalism.) Habermas,emphatically in the tradition and spirit of Lebensphilosophie , in Erkenntnisse category \"subjective experience\" [\"Erlebnisse\"] was from the outset a key for his theory of the Geisteswissenschaften'. In thatbook Habermas quoted Dilthey more often than any other writer. Among the very few refer-ences in it to contemporary thinkers there is a highly complimentary one to Lorenzen's work(90, n. 2). 269[269] Lorenzen, 'Wie ist die Objektivit\u00e4t'. The fullest exposition of the 'protophysics' program in English is Janich, Protophysics of Time . A critique of the program was made by Wilhelm Kamlah's son Andreas in the Festschrift for Lorenzen's sixtieth birthday: Andreas Kamlah, 'Zur Diskussion'. A recitation of the main loci of methodische Philosophie = konstruktive Philosophie = Schule his 'Vorwort' to Janich, Entwicklungen , that volume being composed of papers presented at the Festspiel for Lorenzen's 75th birthday. An exposition entering rather more into substantive issues isprovided that reading back into Dingler of a reduction of science to Technik which will become characteristic of the Erlangen/Konstanz school (with the notable exception of J\u00fcrgen Mittelstra\u00df). Dingler would not have beenpleased with this reconstruction of his program. No more than Auerbach did Dingler intendto reduce physics to technics. On the contrary, Dingler took pride in having elevated and vali-dated experimental physics (over against theoretical physics), what Dingler thought necessarybecause experimental is to be expected, Dingler was a passionate Lebensphilosoph: see the bouquet of brief quotations of Dingler's lebensphilosophisch declarations in Weiss, 11. My attention was drawn to Janich, and thus to the Erlangen school, through the quotation of this passage by Hans Radder, 'Technology and Theory', 155. 273[273] Janich, 'Physics', 13. Janich recognizes that this contention requires that physical laws be regarded as the codification of technical experience, and he asserts this to be the case (24), buthe does so entirely without argument or example. 274[274] Auerbach, Entwicklungsgeschichte , 4. See notes 24-6, above, and the discussion in the text. 275[275] So, for example, Tetens\u2014whom Weiss, Hugo Dinglers , 1, identifies as 'grandson' of Lorenzen, i.e. student of a student\u2014obviously wants to say in his 1984 essay Tetens, '\"Der Glaube an die Weltmaschine\"' that physics is from the outset technology, that the very method of experi-ment is technological, but he just cannot bring himself to assert it. When Edge reviewed The Dynamics of Science and Technology , the volume carrying Janich's 'Physics' in The British Journal of Sociology , largely unfavorably, he made no mention of Janich's contribution\u2014 perhaps because Edge, for all his interest in instruments, remained quite modern in his view ofDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 106 Forman them as merely instrumental. Knorr ('Review of Krohn'), however, reviewing it in 1981 in Isis, featured Janich's essay: 'Most removed from a historical investigation, but nevertheless quitefundamental in its implications, is Peter Janich's answer to the question whether physics itselfmust not be considered a technology rather than a traditionally conceived natural science. Thepaper, which starts off the book, criticizes the 'objectified' conception of nature held by phys-icists and philosophers alike and reminds us that the experience of modern natural science isstructured by instruments. Doing experiments is held to be more an activity to produce tech-nical effects than a search for true sentences, and theories are seen as norms for technical prac-tice rather than as representation of nature'. forward in that direction. Apartfrom Knorr's review, the only references to Janich's paper turned up in a search of JSTOR arein Brush, 'The Chimerical Cat', 446, note 148, where, after citing a series of papers on theanthropic principle in cosmology, Brush concluded 'Cf. ...', and in Jamison, 'Technology'sTheorists', 510, note 10: 'On the instrumental dependence of science, see ...'. Thus neithertakes Janich's point. 276[276] In Lorenzen's lengthy 'Theorie des technischen Wissens' (1976), no form of the word Technik appears in the text (and a fortiori no explanation is given of the concept 'technischen Wissens'). Similarly, Lorenzen, Grundbegriffe technischer...Kultur (1985), reprints 12 essays published in the previous seven years. Four are grouped in a section headed 'Technik'. Theword appears only in the first of those four, and there on only two pages (62, 74) and in twovery different senses, namely the 'Technik' of generating random sequences (with the drawingof lots as prehistoric realization) and 'der \"technische Nutzen\"' of research (which logicianLorenzen would define so widely, through the Machian concept of mental economyconstrued as paedagogical technology, as to justify everything that is commonly justified bythe virtue of being 'wertfrei'). 277[277] In Janich, Protophysics of Time (1985), 62-6, there are still some faint echos of his previous positions, both that in 1973 and that in 1978, but significantly Janich comes to the conclusionnot that physics is technology, or even that it is a technical science, but merely that 'It thusappears more suitable today to speak of an experimental science , instead of a science of nature, i.e. to characterize physics not by means of the subjects investigated, but rather by means of adomain of methods'. The science-as-technology thesis is then entirely absent from Janich,Konstruktivismus und Naturerkenntnis (1996), a collection of essays that he had published over the preceding eight years. 278[278] Janich, 'Die Struktur 18 vom 12. which the first essay, by J\u00fcrgen Mittelstra\u00df, is 'Wider den Dingler-Komplex'. A further disparaging Dingler is B\u00f6hme et al., Experimentelle Philosophie , not have been pleased by this use ofhis concept by his friend von Weizs\u00e4cker's men. 286[286] B\u00f6hme concluding paragraph of the 'Authors' Introduction'. The book concludes with Wolf Sch\u00e4fer, 'The Finalization Debate', an account and bibliography of the mediacampaign in spring 1976, directed against the Starnberg institute and specifically the finaliza-tion thesis, by a group of academics associated with and supported by the conservative FritzThyssen Stiftung. 289[289] of causa finalis , its connota- tions then are the goals or purposes of science not the end of science'.

Abteilung Habermas, not part of the original conception, came intoexistence two years later, in the autumn of 1971. However much respect Habermas had for vonWeizs\u00e4cker personally, Habermas had little respect for the way in which the fundamentallysocial-scientific and philosophical projects in Abteilung von Weizs\u00e4cker were pursued, or forthe wissenschaftlich character of von Weizs\u00e4cker's researchers. This lack of confidence was animportant factor in the debacle that brought the entire institute to an abrupt end shortly afterthe closing of Abteilung von Weizs\u00e4cker upon his retirement on 30 June 1980: Habermas,'Warum ich die Max-Planck-Gesellschaft verlasse'. Although Habermas here that controversy compiled by Sch\u00e4fer,'The Finalization Debate', intended to be complete, contains no publication by Habermas, noris any likely-looking title to be found in Douramanis's (Douramanis,Mapping ). On the other acknowledging thoughtHabermas incapable of understanding natural scientists, how they think and work. 295[295] Waters, Daniel Bell , 11-12, 16, 165. 296[296] Bell, The Coming of Post-Industrial , ciii, civ, 36.

Bell's American Academy Commission on the Year 2000 took 'it as a given that we are moving into a postindustrial society' (pp. 325-6). By thetime Bell, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society came out Bell had already succeeded in making 'post-industrial society' the single most widely employed conception of where theworld was going. Indicative of the primacy that Bell attributed to science is that into thiscollective effort at social forecasting, he recruited scads of scientists but only one technologist,J. R. Pierce.Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 Forman 298[298] Waters, Daniel Bell , 148-55. Waters (150) characterized Bell as a 'technology freek'. Mumford, 'Prologue to our time', 7, lumped Bell with McLuhan and Arthur Clarke\u2014'thosegiant minds whose private dreams all too quickly turned into public nightmares'\u2014as stillequating 'this limitless mechanical progress' with human progress. 299[299] Bell, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society , 14; and xciv. B\u00f6hme et al., Finalization in Science , 9, saw their conception of finalized science as that which would realize Bell's 'forecast that \"theoretical knowledge will be the stra-tegic resource of post-industrial society\"'. Daniel Bell , Bell's theses: 'The primacy of theoretical knowledge This is \"axial principle\" of the post- industrial society ... . Bell stresses that in a post-industrial society this knowledge is theoreti-cal, rather than traditional or practical, in character. It involves the codification of knowledgeinto abstract symbolic systems that can be applied in a wide variety of situations. The scientistdisplaces the inventor; the econometrician displaces the political economist'. Consequently,as Waters writes, p. 109, 'Given that the generation of information is the key problem and thatscience is the most important source of information, the organization of the institutions ofscience, the universities and research institutes is the central problem in the post-industrialsociety.' Regarding such expectations from where we stand today in the unfolding postmod-ern life world, we can only shake our heads in wonder at such preposterous conceits. 300[300] Bell, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society , 26. 301[301] A revealing indication of whom Bell was listening to is the last and most fulsome acknowl- edgement in his big book's 'inventory of influences': 'And finally, in this inventory of influ-ences, I would single out an essay by the physicist and historian of science, Gerald Holton(Holton, 'Scientific Research and Scholarship'), in illuminating for me the significance oftheoretical knowledge in its changing relation to technology, and the codification of theory asthe basis for innovation not only in science, which Holton demonstrated, but in technologyand economic policy as well'. 302[302] Gilman, Mandarins of the Future , 8, et passim, captured very well the feel and content of that modernist, technocratic ideology, except that he overlooked the central importance of theconcept and ideal of meritocracy. Forman, 'In the Era of the Earmark', points to the changingconnotations of the word 'meritocracy', and its fall from grace as ideal, as indicative of themodern-to-postmodern transition. 303[303] Bell, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society , 344-5. By 'the new intellectual technology' Bell did not mean material technology informed or directed by theory, but rather a sort of techno-cratic policy science; thus the 'engineers' referred to are not engineers as conventionallyunderstood, but rather social engineers: 'What is distinctive about the new intellectual tech-nology is its effort to define rational action and to identify the means of achieving it' ( ibid., 30). Similarly, Waters, Daniel Postmortem', 51, recognizing Bell's mandarinism, was offended that humanistic scholars were excluded from his ruling class;Brick, 'Optimism of the Mind', 353, simply denied that when Bell 'defined postindustrial soci-ety as \"one in which the intellectual is predominant\" ... he meant ... that intellectuals becamea new ruling class'. 304[304] '... the expansion of science and scientifically based technology is creating the framework for a new social order that will erode capitalism, as the activities of the merchants and the bour-geois outside the landed economy undermined feudalism, ... the significant fact is that mostof the activities of science are outside the business system and the organization of sciencepolicy is not, in the first instance, responsive to business demand. The necessary foundationfor any new class is to have an independent institutional base outside the old dominant order.For the scientist this base has been the university'. Bell, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society , 232. Even as Bell was writing this, and certainly as he reaffirmed it in 1976, the changes inculture, economy, and polity that would render this obviously sheer fantasy were under way.They would be pointed out, soon after, by Dickson and Noble, 'By Force of Reason'. Moregenerally, the thesis of Noble, America by Design (1977), is the antithesis of Bell's, and thus theDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 109 more prescient work, by far. Cf. however, note 15, above, re: Dickson and Noble and the primacy of science for technology\u2014on which they had no disagreement with Bell. 305[305] Similarly, Kenneth J. Arrow wrote in his blurb for this reissue, 'Daniel Bell introduced the concept of post-industrial technology in the first edition of this work, and it has now becomeuniversal'. However, Rose, The Post-Modern and the Post-Industrial , 29, was right that in 1973 Bell 'sets out to propose that the \"axial principle\" of the post-industrial society will not betechnology but theoretical scientific knowledge'. 306[306] Bell, The End of Ideology . In an 'Afterword' to the 1988 reissue of the book, Bell gave clear indication of the French postwar intellectual scene as a main point of reference for the work(410-11) as well evidence of the enormous controversy and literature that it generated(420)\u2014much of it, to be sure, resulting from reading only the title and not the book. 307[307] Bell, Vers The Post-Modern . Acknowledging intellectual debts was one of those modern conventions that Lyotard consistently flouted, but thisreport on knowledge was an exception, with many footnotes citing many works, includingBell's. It is possible to see how central Bell's post-industrial was to Lyotard's thinking aboutthis time in Lyotard's preparatory notes for the mammoth art-and-technology exhibition'Les Immat\u00e9riaux', as published in Centre de Cr\u00e9ation Industrielle, Immat\u00e9riaux . Interestingly, Crowther, ' Les Immat\u00e9riaux ', 196, found in Lyotard's rationale for the aesthetic of that exhibit 'a persistence of modernist attitudes'. Yet however much Lyotard's unifying conception for this exhibit reflected the continued primacy of the conceptual andthus of science, the exhibit as such reflected much rather the new alliance of art with tech-nology, in itself a distinctly postmodern phenomenon. 309[309] Although some of what Lyotard found in Bell, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society is inher- ently postmodern, specifically Bell's idea 'game betweenpersons' (116). 310[310] Lyotard's 'Introduction', ibid., xxiii-xxv, immediately makes clear that science, and more particularly the 'altered game rules for science', is the principle subject of present influence among French philosophers of Lyotard's generation see note 37, above. Lyotard does not, however, refer directly to Heidegger in The Postmodern Condition . for Segal, in his introduction to Ezrahi et al ., Technology, Pessimism , and Postmodernism (1995) 2-3, and Marx, 'The Idea of \"Technology\"', 252-7, his contribution to that volume, were misled by their own antipathy to technological optimism into linking post-modernism with technological pessimism. Segal found on looking around that, in contrastwith the situation in 1979, 'technological pessimism has become an integral part of the emerg-ing culture of postmodernism'\u2014where in fact just the opposite is the case. Reprinting 'TheIdea of \"Technology\"' in Smith and Marx, Does Technology Drive History? , Marx acknowledged no contradiction to his pessimism thesis but did acknowledge in his brief introduction with M.R. Smith, 'the growing credence given [in 'popular discourse'] to the idea of technologicaldeterminism', 'the increasingly strong hold of that claim on the public imagination'. Indeed,Marx and Smith went so far as to allow\u2014and I have not seen the like anywhere else in thewritings of historians of technology\u2014that 'if any particular form of human power now has anoutstanding claim to that distinction [viz. driving history], it probably technological ist'. I have writings andDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 110 P. Forman relations of historians of technology as would be required to write that intellectual history of the discipline and its (unilateral) divorce from science. Rather, my intent is to draw attentionto an interconnected set of orthodoxies prevailing in the discipline today, and to their conse-quences for the historiography of technology, but to do so from a 'genetic' perspective, so faras analytic reflection and my limited knowledge of those writings permit. My exposition andargument relate almost solely to the US division of the history of technology discipline. Aspointed out by R\u00fcrup, 'Historians and Modern Technology' (1974), 170-1, the efflorescenceof research and the formation of institutions was occurring from the mid 1950s onward notonly in the US, but also in East and West Germany, France and Britain. How far these othernational divisions of the history of technology discipline developed the same ideologies andorthodoxies, and in what tempi, I am even less well equipped to address. As indicated in thenext note, there has been some animosity between the British and the US divisions. R\u00fcrup'spaper ('Historians and Modern Technology', 171, 173, 186-7), originally published in Germanin 1972, gives evidence, and is itself evidence, of an ideological development of the history oftechnology in West Germany largely parallel to that in the US. In regard to the history ofscience, however, Mehrtens' observation that 'There are historians of science like historians oftechnology who say that history of science and history of technology are two essentially differ-ent things which one should keep separated' (p. 229), suggests some difference between the twocountries: by 1995 it was as hard to find American historians of science who accepted this axiomof separation as it was easy to find historians of technology who affirmed it. (I am indebted toOskar Blumtritt for drawing my attention to Mehrtens's paper.) 318[318] So also have the SHOT-allied European historians of technology. So, e.g. Jamison in Technology and Culture (1989), 518, has Technics and Civilization as Mumford's 'magnum opus ... which, more than any other single book, would serve to define the history of technol-ogy as a distinct historical specialty'; and again, in 'American Anxieties', 78, Jamison says thatMumford's work 'gave rise to' history of technology. See, likewise, note 226, above, and 323,below. There has been, however, a number of more discerning European historians of tech-nology for whom 'It is a melancholy thought that far from sinking under ridicule', Technics and Civilization , 'this hotch-potch of commonplaces, unchecked assertions (\"the mechanical arts advanced as the humane arts weakened and receded\") and historical errors has passed foran original work', so that the broad public has acquaintance only 'with a certain kind ofhistory of technology, that which seeks to overrule the facts'. Daumas, 'The History of Tech-nology' (1969), 95. Daumas' essay was translated by A.R. Hall and published in 1976 in thefirst volume of the British annual, History of Technology , as a shot at the SHOTites, who for 20 years had been belittling the 5-volume Oxford History of Technology . (Especially provoking, presumably, was Layton's attack on Hall in 1974 referred to in note 352, below.) Hallexpressed his indignation 'that the prosecution of the technical history of technology as envi-sioned by [the great French historian Lucien] Febvre, discussed by M. Daumas and practiced(to the best of their powers) by many writers who have considered themselves historians oftechnology, should now be largely abandoned in favor of a Mumfordian study of inter-rela-tions between technology and society' (87). 319[319] Kranzberg co-opted Mumford to his 'Advisory Committee for Technology and Society', created to create support for the creation of the Society for the History of Technology andTechnology and Culture . Kranzberg, 'At the Start', 10. Mumford then served on the Executive Council of the Society, and in 1969 Mumford was awarded the Society's highest honor, the'Leonardo da Vinci Medal', q.v. The seven previous recipients were all distinguished by theiroriginal research in the history of technology\u2014all, that is, except Kranzberg himself. 320[320] By Burlingame ('The Hardware of Culture', 17) and Allen ('Technology and Social Change', 50) in their texts, and by Multhauf ('The Scientist and the \"Improver\"', 46) in his 'Tools included'Authoritarian and Democratic Technics' and [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 111 selection of 21 articles from the first 10 years of Technology and Culture to form Kranzberg and Davenport, Technology and Culture , where he also included two articles each by Lynn White, Jr., and Peter F. Drucker. 322[322] Hughes and 107; 'The Seamless See, also, notes 228 and 252, above. 323[323] For comparison consider Lynn White, Jr. The third Leonardo da Vinci medalist, White was the scholarly historian of technology of greatest prominence in America in the postwardecades. Advancing sweeping theses on the basis of his own research on medieval technol-ogy, White is the only person ever to have served both as president of SHOT and aspresident of the American Historical Association. In the first 10 years of Technology and Culture , 1959-68, there were 23 articles and four book reviews referring to White, and 20 articles and five book reviews referring to Mumford. Thirty years on, during the decade1989-98, with the number of articles published by Technology and Culture remaining roughly constant, but with a great increase in the median number of works referenced inthem, and likewise a great increase in the number of book reviews published, only 16 arti-cles and 12 book reviews in Technology and Culture referred to White, while 22 articles and 28 book reviews referred to Mumford. The only scholars having today as many or morereferences as there are to Mumford (8) in the index to the Blackwell Companion to American Technology , edited by Pursell, are Thomas Hughes, Leo Marx and Purcell himself. (I have excluded the contributors self-citations.) Going a bit beyond the historians to'science and technology studies': Jamison, 'The Making of Lewis Mumford's Technics and Civilization ' (1995), rated the book 'as perhaps the single most valuable work ever written in the field of science and technology studies, ... . The book itself created a new field ofstudy: history of technology.' As a measure of the importance Mumford holds for the fieldof the philosophy of technology, Mitcham, certainly the most broadly learned among thoseengaged in this field, in his survey Thinking Through Technology discussed four writers under the rubric 'humanities philosophy of technology': Mumford, Ortega y Gasset,Heidegger and Ellul, in that order. 324[324] Mindell, Between Human and Machine , 1. 325[325] Williams, 'Lewis Mumford as a Historian of Technology in Technics and Civilization ' (1990), 63, is quoting Mumford, 'An Appraisal of Lewis Mumford's', 530-1: 'The main value of theseearly chapters [of Technics and Civilization ] was a shift in the whole point of view, which make technics an integral part of higher civilization'. Williams's characterization of Mumford'streatment of technology as 'untraditional' in its elevation of technics into the sphere of higherculture is also that of Burlingame in the first article in the first number of Technology and Culture : 'Whether or not one agrees with his epochal classification, there can be little question that the book [ Technics and Civilization ] is a pioneer\u2014perhaps the first in completeness of pattern\u2014in breaking the tradition about which Macaulay complained and which had held sofirm a grip on historians. To me it not only gave the inspiration that stretched my project intothree volumes, but it reformed my entire attitude toward cultural history'. Burlingame, 'TheHardware of Culture', 17; see also p. 15. This elevation of hardware into higher culture was,however, quite the opposite of Mumford's own conception and intention, as he laid outclearly in 1960 in a paper presented in opposition to Burlingame's at SHOT's first meeting inconjunction with the Burlingame, 'Technology: NeglectedClue'; Mumford, 'History: Neglected Clue'. It bears mentioning that Burlingame, not atrained or professional scholar, but rather a prolific writer of novels, biographies, institutionalhistories, and latterly history of American technology as history of invention, did not accountscience any less highly, nor any less fundamental to modern technology, than did Mumford: 'Ihave', he wrote, 'of course, had to meet the increased difficulties of the technics themselveswith an untechnical mind and so have presented the brief descriptions of the inventions as alayman must do in the common terms with which I am familiar.

Forman am more than ever humble before the great mystery which is called Science'. Burlingame, Engines of Democracy , viii. 326[326] Williams, 'Classics Revisited', 140. Williams there fashions for Mumford's achieve- ment by following Mumford's program\u2014 Technics and Civilization having begun as 'Form and Personality'\u2014rather than accepting Mumford's later claims, themselves already muchinfluenced by the acclaim of the historians of technology. Certainly, Williams's 2002 claimcorresponds more closely to Mumford's committed subordination of the material to themental than does her 1990 echo of Mumford's 1959 and 1970 claim of elevation of technics tohigh culture status. Still, Williams's 2002 claim corresponds poorly to what Mumford in factargued in Technics and Civilization , where, in typical romantic fashion, his concern was not at all to show the determination of technology by personality, but the (deplorable) determina-tion of personality by technology. This Williams in effect says herself (143-4) when she getsdown to specifics, observing that Mumford alleged that 'members of certain occupations(miners, monks, soldiers, financiers) were \"mechanized\" by their tools and other \"external\"conditions associated with their work'. Similarly, in those few places where Mumford doeshave personality determining technology, it is the deplorable personality of the engineerproducing deplorable results in society. 327[327] In 2002, Williams implicitly admited this (139): 'Writing this review has been an effort to recover a usable Mumford'. Williams is here, as she is explicitly in Williams, Retooling: A Historian , grappling with the fact 99. 329[329] See notes 251-7, above. I have in preparation a paper considering more closely the develop- ment of Mumford's only briefly positive valuation of technology and of engineers. 330[330] Quotations from Mumford, 'History: Neglected Clue to Technological Change' (1961), 232. 331[331] Fores, ' Technik : Reconsidered' (1981), 121-2, observed with uncharacteristic understatement, 'Mumford turns out not to have separated \"science\" from \"technics\" aseffectively as some of Usher...', Molella similarly made no mention of the fact that Usher too presupposed the primacy ofscience for technological advance throughout history. An entire chapter of Usher's A History of Mechanical Inventions (in both the 1929 and 1954 editions) is devoted to 'The Early History of the Pure and Applied Mechanical Sciences'. Although it might seem to us that the interestsand methods of the economic historian should have rendered Usher immune to the presup-position of the primacy of science, he, like Mumford and moderns generally, insisted that'The more important aspects of the history of science must be included in any serious analysisof the history of mechanical invention' (1954 edn: 57). 333[333] Although the words 'science' and 'scientific' appear nowhere, the word 'scientists' does appear once (147)\u2014not as an intentional recognition of scientists figuring importantly in Technics and Civilization , but as an inadvertent revelation of Williams' acceptance of the conventional view that our contemporary 'technological world' is created by 'scientists and engineers'. In'Review of Joel Mokyr, The Gifts of Athena ', Williams opened by acknowledging that 'A primary contribution of this important book is to reframe the problem of the relationshipbetween science and technology', adding that 'This is a well-worn\u2014some would say worn-out\u2014intellectual path, which Mokyr reworks to make it into a more promising route forfuture inquiry'. That uninformative concession is all the attention that that 'primary contri-bution of this important book' got in Williams's long review. In Retooling (2002), Williams began with a nostalgia trip to the farm on which her engineer grandfather grew up, and wenton to represent the culture and identity of the engineer as being disintegrated by the disap-pearance of the boundary between science and technology. She did not care to see that in theirideology the engineers had erased this boundary more than a century ago, and thus the morerecent de facto erasure is of far less significance for engineering than it is for science, which, byDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 113 contrast, had insisted throughout modernity on the fact, and the essentiality of the fact, of such a boundary. 334[334] Williams, 'Classics Revisited', 143-4. Cf. note 239, above. The reference to 'financiers'\u2014so oddly assorting with these lowly occupations\u2014should be understood as Williams'scommuted reference to scientists, for in Mumford's account the mechanistic mentalit\u00e9 offinanciers and scientists represented essentially the same apprehension of the world. So, inTechnics and Civilization , 25, where Mumford quoted Veblen for this thesis. 335[335] Williams, 'Lewis Mumford', 48. In a milder form one can see the same animus in the writings of Williams's mentor, Hughes. The one point in Hughes and Hughes, 'General Introduction'to their 1990 volume of essays where they show annoyance and impatience with Mumford,finding in him 'an unexpected na\u00efvet\u00e9', is when noting that Mumford 'had idealized nine-teenth-century physicists like Michael Faraday and biologists such as Louis Pasteur' (8). InAmerican Genesis , Hughes has almost nothing to say about science\u2014notwithstanding that 1870-1970 is almost precisely the period in which American enthusiasm for invention andtechnology was accompanied by a nearly universal attribution of primacy to science in rela-tion to technology. On the few pages where science appears (48-52) Hughes dwelt upon suchantagonistic and dismissive attitudes toward science as he was able to find among the inde-pendent inventors whom he there celebrates. See, likewise, note 360, below. This antagonismtoward science was not yet present, however, when Hughes was writing the 'Introduction' tohis compilation Changing Attitudes Toward American Technology (1975). 336[336] Staudenmaier, Technology's Storytellers , 1. The book is an extension of a dissertation completed under Hughes in 1979. Regarding inversion in disciplinary creation myths seeForman, 'The Storytellers (1985), 1. Staudenmaier presented the story as fact, but in the form of Kranzberg's recollection, as communicated in a letter to him. When repeatingthe story in 1990 in his own words Staudenmaier, 'Recent Trends in the History of Technology',715, implicitly cast the matter in quite a different light by presenting the group calling uponGuerlac as representing an already existing Society for the History of Technology. 338[338] Seely, 'SHOT, the History'. an indicative indif- ference to the fact of its being a myth and delight in repeating the alleged grievance: 'inSHOT's mythology, 1957 is a key date precisely because in that year Henry Guerlac categori-cally rejected the idea that Isis publish articles in the history of technology\u2014an action that directly led historians of technology to found a separate organization. Technology and Culture editor Bob Post believes that story may be a myth, which is to say, evocative though notentirely true. But, as myths are supposed to do, it worked on us.' Fitzgerald, 'Review', even asshe maintained that 'younger scholars are sometimes baffled by this apparent tension' andthat 'the disputes of an earlier generation are not their own', thought the myth worth repeat-ing in her review of the two volumes of proceedings from that 1991 conference in Madison,and for something like the same reason: 'some historians of technology claim that it was ...1957 when Isis banished from its pages articles on the history of technology, which act did in fact lead to the founding of SHOT. Apocryphal or not, this tale and its retelling signal thecontinuing tensions between the two fields.' 339[339] for Kranzberg in Isis, observed irenicly that 'Perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the confrontation of Mel and a group of historians of technology with thethen-president of the History of Science Society, Henry Guerlac. A separate society concernedwith technology had been in the cards for some time. Three years before the formation ofSHOT, Mel had helped bring together a critical mass of historians of technology and engineer-ing educators in the American Society for Engineering Education, where Mel was Secretary ofthe \"Humanistic-Social Division\" from 1955 until the founding of SHOT in 1958'. Regarding'careerism' as underlying this institutionalizing, David F. Noble's strong views expressed at'The Roanoke Conference: Critical Issues in the History of P. Forman Hath Wrought', 707, thought that 'little can be learned from our formal name except that the history of technology was the group's focus', Kranzberg, 'At the Start', had made clearthe intent to recruit constituencies with primarily presentist interests, what is reflected in theomission of history from the title of the society's journal, and is reflected more weakly in thesociety's name, which is contrived to commit its members only to advocacy 'for' the history oftechnology without affirming the member's identity as historian of technology. 340[340] Seely, 'SHOT, the History of Technology', 772. This was still the dominant approach among European historians of technology as late as the mid 1970s. See note 318, above. 341[341] Staudenmaier, Technology's Storytellers , 83. Or, as Staudenmaier put it more pointedly in his front matter (p. xxi): 'the science versus technology theme'. Appendix 3, Staudenmaier's clas-sification of the 272 articles in 21 years of Technology and Culture , has 109, 40%, dealing in one way or another with that theme. Cf. Staudenmaier, 'What SHOT Hath Wrought', 714. 342[342] Writing in Science in 1962, Kranzberg, 'The Newest History', 466, could say that 'To the degree that technology is concerned only with the making of physical objects, it lies in the realm of thephysical sciences'. In 1966/67 Kranzberg, 'The Unity of Science-Technology' was still lookingtoward a future in which science and technology are fused\u2014technoscience, as it were\u2014but ayear later, 'The Disunity of Science-Technology', 32, he was insisting on 'the persistence of thedichotomy between the two'. Hindle, Technology in Early America (1966), 4-6, which book represents his reorientation from history of science to history of technology, noted 'tensionssurrounding the relationship' but also insisted that the historian of technology 'must certainlybe cognizant of the state of science in the period whose technologies he studies'\u2014i.e. evidentlythe opposite was already being maintained by some historians of technology. 343[343] Not in Layton's writings only: Sinclair's early work similarly took science as the higher good guiding technology (and scientists as the more perfect embodiment of it). Thus Sinclair'spreface to Early Research at the Franklin Institute...1830-1837 (1966) opened: 'The Franklin Institute's boiler explosion investigation was clearly the most outstanding scientific accom-plishment in the organization's early history. It involved a brilliant group of young scientists.'Sinclair remained of that view in writing his fuller account of the organization's early historyin Philadelphia's Philosopher Mechanics: A History of the Franklin Institute, 1824-1865 (1974). Setting the theme of his exposition by quoting Dupree, 'The History of American Science',863\u2014'science is a thread woven into the very fabric of American civilization from the begin-ning'\u2014Sinclair himself added (2) that 'science also implied a technology inspired by scientificprinciples'. But by the time Sinclair had come to write the preface to that book, he no longerwished to emphasize science. It opens: 'Technology has been a central force in the Americanexperience ... closely tied to a democratic ideology ... America's technology would prove thevirtue of her political system'. In writing A Centennial History of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1880-1980 (1980), Sinclair knew from the outset that there was no place for science in his history of technology, and so it simply does not appear, notwithstand- ing that it held great importance for the engineers whose history he wrote. A bit of the same reorientation can be seen between two presentations by Pursell of the matter of mobilization and organization of American engineers in response to the First World War.In '\"What the Senate Is ...\": A National Academy of Engineers' (1986), Pursell was by nomeans pro-scientist, but the engineers' failures were of their own making. Twenty years on, in'Engineering Organization and the Scientist in World War I', Pursell is emphatically with theengineers in what he presents as a struggle over the 'commanding position' in contributing tothe war effort and hence in industrial research after the war: 'The result was an almostcomplete victory for the scientists, one that persists to this day' (258). (Evidently antagonismtoward science is no help to a historian of technology in recognizing the postmodern reversalof rank and role between science and technology.) 344[344] Layton, The Revolt of the Engineers , 1 345[345] Ibid. , 58. Layton's original sociological orientation remains evident there; it is clearer still in the concluding paragraph of his 'Veblen and the At: April 2007 History and Technology 115 underlying scientism and assailed it, both in ' Technik : or Mumford Reconsidered', 123, and in later, less well-considered, papers. McGee, 'Making Up Mind: The Early Sociology ofInvention', opens with an indirect but telling critique of Layton's response to Fores, pointingout that Layton's intellectual orientation derived from sociology. 346[346] Layton, 'Mirror-Image Twins'. The citation with the award of SHOT's Leonardo da Vinci Medal to Layton in 1990, published in Technology and Culture 32 (1991): 579, 581, points to Revolt of the Engineers and to 'The other celebrated area of Layton's work ... a series of articles on the nature of engineering knowledge and the relationship between science and technology,most famously his 1971 article \"Mirror-Image Twins: The Communities of Science andTechnology in 19th-Century America.\" His rejection of the notion that technology wasapplied science, and assertion of the essentially symmetrical nature of the relationshipbetween science and technology, are now widely accepted. Layton was not alone in this crucialreassessment of previous conventional wisdom, but when written, \"Mirror-Image Twins\" washeterodox enough almost to have been rejected by Technology and Culture '. (Heterodoxy? Recall how greatly the SHOTites pride themselves upon the fact that 'openness remains one ofSHOT's most attractive characteristics and greatest strengths ... there is no party line to whichall must conform', to quote Layton's response as medalist (585). Could perhaps the allegedsuggestion of rejection of the paper have simply reflected doubts that the paper was so impor-tant as to warrant dual publication\u2014for it was already committed to the proceedings of theconference at which it was presented: Daniels, Nineteenth Century American Science .) The intellectual importance that historians of technology ascribe to this essay is disproportionate,and the more so as the essential conceptual element in the 'mirror image' metaphor is nearlyalways overlooked\u2014as here\u2014so as to effect an ideological elevation of technology bothgreater and more simple-minded than that which Layton intended. Thus Laudan, 'NaturalAlliance' (1995), S19: 'One important step toward a more equitable treatment of the twoenterprises'\u2014i.e. technology and science\u2014'came in the early 1970s, with Edwin Layton'sproposal of a separate-but-equal, or mirror-image twins, model. According to this, technol-ogy was not merely applied science but its mirror image. Separate but equal, like science it hadits own institutions, its own values and methods, and its own kind of knowledge.' And in afootnote she added: 'To a quite significant extent, this is still the official posture of historiansof science and technology.' Indeed, 'the official posture of historians of technology', but surelynot of historians of science, if only because they have no 'official posture'. Cf. note 50, above. 347[347] Layton emphatically did not intend equivalence with his metaphor of 'mirror-image twins', what only Cowan, 'Technology Is to Science', 580, coming from the history of biology, seemsto have recognized. Mirror symmetry implies inverted parity, and therewith the introductionof something left-handed, something sinister. Layton chose this metaphor for that reason: 'Inthe case of mirror-image twins there is a subtle but irreconcilable difference that is expressedas a change in parity. Between the communities of science and technology there was a switchin values analogous to change in parity' (Layton, 'Mirror-Image Twins', 576). Moreover,Layton had no doubt that the values of science were right-handed, the more desirable values;those of engineering left-handed, less desirable. So, Layton explained, 'The reversal of \"parity\"between science and technology further reduced the engineers' ability to respond effectively tosocial problems' ( ibid., 579-80). See note 366, postmodernity, we are experi- encing the inverse: science is exchanging its distinctive values for those Layton regarded as theless desirable values of engineering. 348[348] Layton, Twins', 562, 567-8. Layton did not cite Price, 'Is Technology Historically Independent of Science?' (1965), but that essay in Technology and Culture , which was then rightly drawing much attention (e.g., Fores, 'Price, Technology, and the PaperModel'), contained the kernel of Layton's mirror image metaphor in a more Layton, 'Mirror-Image Twins', 562-3. 350[350] Ibid., p. 563. See text at note 179 for passage in Bush, Science, The Endless Frontier .Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 'Technology as Knowledge', 34. 352[352] Ibid. Ironically, it was historians of science , not historians of technology, who, beginning in the late 1950s, took the lead in expressing skepticism regarding the significance of science for tech-nological innovation prior to the 19th century\u2014even prior to the late 19th century. For example, Hindle, Technology in Early America (1966), 86, cited only historians of science for this new skepticism, about which he remained non-commital. Layton acknowledged, butonly implicitly, some pages later, in a footnote (note 29 on p. 39), that this argument stemmedfrom historians of science: 'The insufficiency of the established model of science-technologyrelations has been shown by a large number of studies, too many to cite here. Some of the onesthat have influenced me are ...'. Following which, Layton cited one work each by Robert P.Multhauf, Charles C. Gillispie, Thomas S. Kuhn, Derek J. de Solla Price and 'M. Gibbons andC. Johnson'. (Layton should have included A. R. Hall, who had been in the forefront of theendeavor to decouple technology from science in the early modern period\u2014see Mayer, 'SettingUp a Discipline'\u2014but Layton chose to make Hall the villain of the piece.) None of the scholarslisted was a historian of technology, apart from Multhauf, whose affiliation with the history ofscience was at least as close as with the history of technology. Mollela, although then still ahistorian of science, was not among those showing the way. On the contrary, as pointed outabove, note 69, he and Reingold, 'Theorists' (1973; 1991), 128, 139, dismissed this 'chorus' ofvoices denying the importance of science for technological advance in earlier centuries as beingraised with 'usually no evidence whatsoever'. 353[353] Layton, Science, The Endless Frontier , 13-14: 'In the nineteenth century, Yankee mechanical ingenuity building largely upon the basic discoveriesof European scientists, could greatly advance the technical arts. Now the situation is different.A nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in itsindustrial progress and weak in its competitive position in world trade, regardless of itsmechanical skill.' 354[354] Layton, 'American Ideologies'. Cf. Mumford's statement, 50 years earlier, quoted in note 237: 'The actual world of machinery is at present, it seems fair to say, a parasite uponthis body of knowledge', i.e. upon the physical sciences. Nor would it be unfair to say thatAmerican engineers themselves represented the relationship in that way, especially in adopt-ing Huxley's thesis re: 'applied science'. (See notes Consistent therewith, Staudenmaier, ibid., 717, ignored science in his analysis of 'the processes that produce new technologies'. This step to exclusionof science from the purview of the historian of technology was resisted by Kranzberg, 'Let'sNot Get Wrought Up', whose policy was never to exclude. It presented a real difficulty forLayton, whose endeavor was to redefine, not to ignore, the technology-science relation.Nonetheless, in his 1986 SHOT presidential address, Layton paraphrased Staudenmaier'sargument as 'Historians of technology had to demolish the myth that technology was no morethan applied science in order to establish the legitimacy and autonomy of their own discipline.But once they were successful in this, they found that it was not really the interaction withwhich they were primarily interested. Rather, the emphasis lay in the nature of technologicalknowledge'. Layton commented there: 'I agree Layton, 'Through the Looking Glass', 600. 359[359] A third course, emphasizing neither autonomy from nor ignoration of science, but seeking liberation from subordination to science through obliteration of the distinction between tech-nology and science\u2014and, more generally, denial of all distinctions, and thus of all hierarchies,among human activities\u2014was that proposed by Hughes, centering at this time on the 'seamlessDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History Technology 117 web' of history-society-reality. Thus where the autonomists sought to achieve the liberation of technology from science's primacy by a parochial program restricting the compass of thehistory of technology to technology's cognitive essence, Hughes's program, proceeding in theopposite direction, denying the existence of any borders and any hierarchies, meshed easily intothe postmodern reversal of primacy occurring among sociologists of scientific knowledge inthe mid 1980s for which Latour's thinking was exemplary. Hughes was party to the first majorforay by those sociologists into technology, a 1984 workshop and ensuing publication: Bijkeret al., The Social Construction . That book's radical denial of a distinction in principle between technology and science is to be found only in an unsigned 'Introduction' (11) obviously writtenby Hughes, where he foisted upon Bijker and Pinch a more radical view than any that theythemselves there expressed. 360[360] More than 10 years ago Laudan, 'Natural Alliance or Forced Marriage?', S19, had already drawn attention to the absence of science from then recent synthetic works in the history oftechnology, directing her readers to 'See, e.g., Alan Marcus and Howard Segal, Technology in America: A Brief History (New York, 1989); George Basalla, The Evolution of Technology (Cambridge, 1988); and Thomas P. Hughes, American Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm, 1870-1970 (New York, 1989). In none of these texts does science get more than a passing reference'. Siding as she did with the historians of technology, Laudanexcused them with a tu quoque , pointing out that 'David Lindberg's recent, and masterful, Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, andInstitutional Context (Chicago, 1992) leaves all technologies, except the medical, to one side'. As though failing to discuss technologies (except the medical) in connection with medievalscience were as little justifiable as failing to discuss sciences (any at all) in connection withmodern technology. 361[361] Claiming that 'Layton again played a pivotal role' through his papers in the 1970s on tech- nology as knowledge, Laudan, 'Natural Alliance', S22-3, judged that 'it is now generallyaccepted that there is something distinctive about technological knowledge and that it isneither irremediably tacit nor simply applied science'. The lack of any positive content inLaudan's characterization of technological knowledge rather underscores the unpromising-ness of that approach. To my knowledge, Vincenti, What Engineers Know (1990), is the last serious endeavor along that line. When, in his SHOT presidential address, Roland, 'WhatHath Kranzberg Wrought?', 709-12, stressed technology as knowledge, it was no longer inthe sense of the Layton-Vincenti quest for a form of knowledge definitional of technology,but in the implicitly postmodern sense that knowledge is a consequence of technology, as it is of every social-cultural activity.. 362[362] So, for instance, Pursell, A Companion to American Technology (2005), with 21 chapters on vari- ous technologies and aspects of technology, has none on technology and science, and no entryin its index for 'science'. Similarly, Misa et al., Modernity and Technology (2003), has no entry in its index under 'science', nor does 'science' appear among the 21 separate entries for 'tech-nology'. Nor does Misa, in his introductory chapter, 'The Compelling Tangle of Modernity andTechnology', mention science. Similarly, Misa, 'Theories of Technological Change' (1992),omitted entirely the matter of the relation between science and technology. In his most recentpublications\u2014'Beyond Linear Models', and 'Inventing Europe'\u2014Misa appears to be abandon-ing that blinkered approach to modern technology. However, Schatzberg, ' Technik ' (2006), is still advancing in his concluding sentence the divorce of technology from science as motive andgoal for his work. 363[363] See Laudan's handling of the matter, quoted in note 360, above. Animosity is frankly admitted, nay, flaunted, by Sinclair, 'The Road to Madison' (1995). Notable for its subtext consistentlydenying and denigrating science is the collection of readings put together by Smith andClancey, Major Problems in the History of American Technology (1998), with its chapters on the telephone as the product of spiritualism, and on radio as a product of hobbyists. The chapteron 'scientific management' serves as a vehicle for putting engineering) in question,Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 118 P. Forman as does its one chapter on science-based technology, devoted to insecticides. Happily science is absent from the chapter on 'the military-industrial-university 'For the sake of our institutional memory, the most important question is: Why did we go to Madison at all?', i.e. agree to a joint meeting with theHistory of Science Society on critical problems. 'Those of us on the SHOT side ... intended todistinguish our sessions from theirs. As I think of it, of course, that was our principal objec- tive. The crucial point for us was ownership of the history of technology and that meant defin-ing for ourselves the teaching and research agenda of our field, separate and distinct from thehistory of science'. 365[365] Postmodern is, of course, not necessarily postmodernist, but postmodernist is, at least to that extent, postmodern. I am aware of only one undeniably contributive historian of technologywho is avowedly postmodernist: Philip Scranton. It is therefore in Scranton's case uncertainwhether his anti-science attitudes stem mainly from his identity as historian of technology orhis persuasion of postmodernism. Those attitudes have been clearly expressed in Scranton,'Theory and Narrative' (1991), 386, 390; 'Determinism and Indeterminacy' (1995), S47.Indicatively, there (S35) where Scranton allowed that his analysis of the notion of technologi-cal determinism 'would be rejected by scores of historians in other fields for its insufficientattention to culture, markets, gender, the labor process, or the diversity of individual andinstitutional appropriations of technology, and/or for its elision of power relations', he didnot mention attention to science. 366[366] Wise, 'Science and Technology', 229, quoting Price, 'Of Sealing Wax and String' (1984), 49. (The pertinent paragraphs of this essay are included in the more gracefully worded abridge-ment by Merton in the posthumous collection of Price's essays, Little Science, Big Science , 239- 40.) Broad, 'Does Genius or Technology Rule Science', writing in 1984 for The New York Times, represented Price as being, until his death in 1983, the leader of a 'rebellion', of a 'new school' arguing that new technologies, far from following necessarily from scientific discover-ies, are themselves the cause of scientific discoveries. Broad pointed to Layton as his soleexample of those who 'have violently opposed Dr Price's relegating the heros of science to therole of mere handmaidens. [Note overboard,\" said EdwinT. Layton, president-elect of the Society for the History of Technology.' Given what historiansof technology have made out of Layton, his reported resistance is puzzling. It fits, however,with the fact, pointed out above, note 347, and below, note 395, that Layton, early and late,did indeed rank science above technology. 367[367] Wise, 'Science and Technology', 229. 368[368] Ibid., 244, the opening of his 'Conclusion'. (Wise meant, of course, to say that 'Not all knowl- edge is science'.) Setting up the opposition as between science-policy wonks and historiansallows Wise to evade the question when, why, how historians came to free themselves fromthis misconception; by his account, they never held it. Wise has it held only by 'a small elite ofleaders, mainly drawn from academic science departments or deans' offices' (231). 369[369] Ibid., 229-30. Behind the ellipses is an assertion that, like the assertion quoted immediately above, is formally incompatible with what follows\u2014an incoherence that seems to be the prod-uct of Wise's agitation over the injustice done technology by the ascription of primacy toscience. This sense of grievance is expressed almost hysterically in Wise's plaint that 'Bush'sdream of a National Research Foundation supporting the work of modern-day counterpartsof everyone from Einstein to the Wright brothers gave way to a National Science Foundationaimed at supporting Einsteins only' (231). 370[370] Ibid., 230. How Wise's passion over the wrongness of 'technology-comes-from-basic-research' arose, is entirely unclear to me. I have seen none such in Wise, 'A New Role for ProfessionalScientists in Industry' (1980), or in Wise, Willis R. Whitney... and the Origins of U.S. Industrial Research (1985). 371[371] MacKenzie, 'Marx and the Machine', 486-7, reprinted in MacKenzie, Knowing Machines \u2014it is the only 'older' paper MacKenzie included there\u2014and other collections andDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 119 translated into other languages, it was, early on, awarded SHOT's Usher Prize for 1986 for 'best scholarly work published during the preceding three years under the auspices of theSociety for History of Technology' (www.historyoftechnology.org/awards/usher.html).Directly engaging the question 'Marx and the Machine', 391-2, available at http://www. mlwerke.de/me/me23/me23_391.htm (accessed 1 December 2005). Marx, Capital, 1: 492-5. Marx's insistence there upon a conception of the machine as a mechanized hand tool reflectsnot his best thinking but rather the romantic view of the machine as mechanizing the worker.(Farther on in Kapital Marx showed a better appreciation of the abstract rather than replica- tive character of the machinery of 'grosse Industrie': see the passage quoted in note 74, above.)It has long been a commonplace that the conception of the machine as a mechanized handtool, which Marx adopted at the outset of his discussion of mechanization and MacKenziepresented as cogent, was 'the great obstacle that 19th-century to overcome':Daniels, 'The Big Questions', 20; likewise Mumford, cited in note 239, above. 373[373] MacKenzie, 'Marx and the Machine', 486. The passage from Kapital which MacKenzie quotes\u2014he seems to know it only in translation (Marx, Capital, 1: 492-3); he acknowledges that he has himself italicized ' because the historical element is missing from it' \u2014is: 'Mathematiker und Mechaniker\u2014und the unserviceable defi-nition of the 'Mathematiker und Mechaniker', it is evident that he respects it intellectually. 374[374] Far more relevant is that Marx said, but MacKenzie omitted to say, that the same definition, unserviceable for Marx's purposes because ahistorical, occurs 488-9. reference is 'Ure, The Philosophy of Manufactures (London, 1835), p. 370, as quoted in Capital 1: 564'. The words are Ure's, not a back-translation that Ure has 'in' not'into'. The quotation appears at the bottom of p. 368 in Philosophy of Manufactures (1835), and on p. 460 in Kapital, Band I (4th edn), http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me23/me23_441. htm#Z186 (accessed 5 376[376] MacKenzie, 'Marx and the Machine', 496: 'Marx's reliance on sources such as the writings of Ure meant that he had quite plausible evidence for what class-conscious capitalists hoped toachieve from the introduction of the machine. But what they hoped for was not necessarilywhat happened. Marx quoted Ure's judgment on the self-acting mule: \"A creation destined torestore order among the industrious classes.\" Lazonick's work shows that the mule had nosuch dramatic effect'. However, Sherwood, 'Engels, Marx, Malthus', 849, found somethingrather dramatic in Lazonick: 'Far from providing, as Marx believed, the classic example ofworkers eliminated by the introduction of automatic machinery, the male spinners formedafter 1850 \"the best organized and the best-financed he relied implicitly upon Engels here\u2014'about the consequences of the jenney and mule was typical ofanalysts of machine productivity at the time. Although their logic was clear, it was also false.' 378[378] To be quite complete and accurate, 'science' does appear in one other quotation of Marx given by MacKenzie, 'Marx and the Machine', 488: 'The machine ... embodies the ofthe capitalist: \"The special skill of beenDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 120 P. Forman deprived of all significance, vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity in the face of the science, the gigantic natural forces, and the mass of social labour embodied in the system of machinery,which, together with these three forces, constitutes the power of the 'master'.\"' (MacKenzie isquoting Marx, Capital , 1: 549 = Kapital, 1: 446, as made available at http://www.mlwerke.de/ me/me23/me23_441.htm#Kap_13_4; accessed 5 December 2006.) This is the only place andmanner in which the great importance that Marx attributed to science for the creation ofmachine technology is permitted to appear in MacKenzie's paper, while MacKenzie himselfremains silent about it. Once again, among all the references to science in Marx, MacKenziehas chosen to exhibit one of the very few where it appears as a malevolent force. [If the readerfinds difficulty in reducing Marx's rather obscure assertion\u2014that the power of the capitalist isconstituted by the system of machinery together with the three forces that are embodied in the system of machinery\u2014to MacKenzie's 'The machine ... embodies the power of the capitalist',that is in good part the fault of the translator, who, intending to clarify, has confused by inter-pellating the clause 'together with these three forces'.] 379[379] Dupree, 'The History of American Science\u2014A Field Finds Itself' (1966), is in large measure a polemic against John A. Kouwenhoven's pamphlet, American Studies: Words or Things? (1963). Skramstad, 'American Things: A Neglected Material Culture', continues the plaint ofneglect\u2014in an overview of American Studies: Topics and Sources that excludes science entirely\u2014which plaint would become canonical also for the history of technology. 380[380] Marx, The Machine in the Garden , repeatedly reprinted, most recently in 2000 with a new after- word. The book was an elaboration of Marx's Harvard PhD dissertation, 1950. The citations ofMarx by historians of technology are, overwhelmingly, to this book only. Marx has had far moreimportance for SHOT than SHOT has had for him. Over the years Marx has published onlytwice in Technology and Culture , both publications being only book reviews. The second of those was a review of the Festschrift for Melvin Kranzberg, which Marx used as an occasion to denythe sense and value of a separate discipline of the history of technology\u2014leading Kranzberg tosuggest that the author of The Machine in the Garden was a snake in the grass: Marx, 'Review of In Context ', and also Roland, 'What Hath Kranzberg Wrought?', 699-700. (Marx had been singled out in 1969 for election to SHOT's elite AdvisoryCouncil, along with such superpowers as the chairman of the Committee on Science and PublicPolicy of the National Academy of Sciences and the director of research at General Electric, butthe references to him in Technology and Culture became frequent only in the 1980s.) 381[381] Marx, The Machine in the Garden , 199-203, 399, note 40, puts in evidence only two published statements unequivocally elevating technology and technologists over scientists\u2014and poets.Both are from Scientific American in 1850. A third, likewise from Scientific American in 1850, Marx admits has 'a defensive tone'. This is so far from persuasive when one recalls that thisjournal, begun in 1845, initially weekly, carried many hundreds of items annually. The title ofthe journal itself makes clear that by that date a very different valuation of science relative totechnology had already superseded the Jacksonian populist revolt: Scientific American: The Advocate of Industry and Enterprise, and Journal of Mechanical and Other Improvements . The identification of technical improvement as derivative from science implied by this title isconfirmed by the editor's statements of his intentions with this 'scientific paper' conceived assuccessor to the American Mechanic and three other journals intended for working men. The advertisement at the top of the first page of the first issue, 28 August 1845 (Vol. 1, No. 1),specifies the coverage of the journal as ' New Inventions, Scientific Principles , and Curious Works ; and will contain, in addition to the most interesting news of passing events, general notices of the progress of Mechanical and other Scientific Improvements ', while the editor's letter 'To the American Public' at the top of the second page describes its intended readershipas 'the intelligent and liberal workingmen, and those who delight in the development of thosebeauties of Nature, which consist in the laws of Mechanics, Chemistry, and other branches ofNatural Philosophy'. (The text of the advertisement is available 6 December 2005].)Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] April 2007 History and Technology 121 382[382] For example, Marx, The Machine in the Garden , 198: 'In the period between 1830 and 1860 popular discussions of technological progress assume that inventors are uncovering the ulti-mate structural principles of the universe. In 1850 a writer inspired by a new telescopesays: \"How wonderful the process by which the human brain, in its casket of bone, canalone establish such remote and transcendental truths.\"' Kasson, Civilizing the Machine: Technology and Republican Values in America, 1776-1900 (1977), to whom is due most of the credit for showing that Marx got it wrong with Emerson's and Hawthorne's view oftechnology, also ignores science after dismissing the matter with the off-hand observationthat 'men made little or no distinction in this period between theoretical science andmechanical ingenuity' (8). On the other hand, Hugo A. Meier, although with one foot in theemerging American Studies tradition and the other in what would eventually become anequally anti-scientific history of American technology tradition, was perhaps simplytoo early to be anti-science. In his doctoral dissertation, 'The Technological Concept inAmerican Social History, 1750-1860' (1950), 150-1, 334-56, Meier took for granted thattechnology was applied science. Likewise in Meier, 'Technology and Democracy, 1800-1860'(1957), where 'science' appears more than forty times in the text. That orientation andemphasis is maintained in Meier, 'American Technology and the Nineteenth-CenturyWorld' (1958). Molella and Reingold, 'Theorists and Ingenious Mechanics' (1973), 140, intheir discussion of early 19th century popular attitudes toward science in America, made noreference to Marx, The Machine in the Garden , and thus also none to Marx's ignoration of science, but complained, so much the more unfairly, that 'When Hugo Meier writes aboutthe relationship of technology and democracy in antebellum America, there is a complete absence of theoretical science'. 383[383] Marx, The Machine in the Garden , 174ff, 181ff, 191. As Marx explained, Walker's essay was provoked by Carlyle, 'Signs of the Times' (1829), which deprecatory analysis of contemporarylife and thought fatefully introduced the concept of mechanization as characteristic ofmodern civilization. Walker himself was then a recent Harvard graduate, acolyte of historianGeorge Bancroft and jurist Joseph Story, and presumably their mouthpiece there in the North American Review , that organ of the northeast cultural elite. Higham, 'Divergent Unities' (1974), notes 34 and 36, credits Marx with making Walker's 'Defense of Mechanical Philoso-phy' a canonical text in American Studies and the history of American technology, but alsowith having 'contributed to the blurring of historical perspective'. 384[384] Mitcham, Thinking Through Technology , 20, has it more nearly right: 'Walker's \"Defense of Mechanical Philosophy\" makes the characteristic argument that mechanical philosophy is thetrue means for emancipating the human mind in both thought and practice, and that throughits correlate, technology, it makes democratically available ... freedom', but 'consequence',not 'correlate', is what Walker had in mind. 385[385] Marx, Machine in the Garden , 185. It has become typical for historians of technology in discussing their displayed quotations to ignore the references to science in those quotations.For example, Smith, 'Technological Determinism', 19, 27-8. 386[386] the Garden Indeed the erasure of science in Marx's representation of the technological enthusiasm of the ante-bellum era is reproduced in Meikle's statement ( ibid. , 152) that one of the 'mutually supportive points of a millennial ideology of technology' isolated and schematized by Marxwas that 'the intellectual progress of inventors and engineers indicated the highest point ofhuman achievement to date'. Is Meikle himself too much within the turn-the-back-on-sciencehistoriography of technology\u2014or in a like tradition in American studies\u2014to able to see inDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] 23 April 2007 122 P. Forman Marx's ignoration of science a basis for the appeal of The Machine in the Garden to historians of technology, or has Meikle simply taken this bias too as understood by his readers. 392[392] The work of Hounshell and that of S. W. Leslie offer genuine exceptions. Likewise, Carlson, Innovation as a Social Process , 4, 344-9. Definitely not an exception is K\u00f6nig, or Industry-Based Science?' (1996). K\u00f6nig noted (pp. 71-2) with apparent surprise inthis paper in Technology and Culture that although 'It is commonly agreed that in the late 19th century new industries (chemical, electrical, optical, and refrigeration) developed with closerconnections to science and to scientific institutions', and although 'It has become common-place use the term, and the contributors to Technology and Culture rarely do. Technology and Culture 's comprehensive index ... does not contain the term'. Nonetheless, K\u00f6nig's intent was entirely consistent with that of the Staudenmaier policy of ignoration, for his contention wasthat at least for 'the electrical industry in Germany prior to World War I, the term appears toget the science-technology relationship wrong by almost precisely 180 degrees. I will arguethat in the case of that industry, it would be more apt to refer to \"industry-based science.\"' Ofcourse K\u00f6nig's argument could succeed only by a sleight of hand, namely that the 'science'which concerned him is not a science at all, but that 'engineering science' which is electricalengineering. And even then, to argue his thesis that electrical engineering originates in indus-try, not in the academy, K\u00f6nig had to ignore the stated fact (p. 81) that in the crucial foundingdecade of the 1880s most of those appointed to chairs of electrical engineering were physicistsentirely without prior experience in industry. 393[393] Kline, 'Construing \"Technology\" as \"Applied Science\": Public Rhetoric of Scientists and Engineers in the United States, 1880-1945' (1995). It should be noted that there is no warrantfor Kline's characterization of the rhetoric that he displayed and discussed as being specifically'public', with its implication of some insincerity. Further, the rhetoric of scientists is not exhibited in this paper but merely imputed; the widely-employed rhetoric of pure science islabeled by Kline with the name of an organization, the National Research Council (NRC), inorder to conjure up an institutional power to which Kline has the engineers bow. 394[394] Ibid., 221. The quotation is from Kline's 'Conclusion', and what it asserts is there asserted not of 'engineers and industrial researchers' only, but of 'a large number of prominentphysicists, chemists, engineers, and industrial researchers'. However, as said above, theviews of chemists and physicists figure almost not at all in Kline's evidence, or in his severalprevious adductions of this status/image/politics explanation of the engineers' statementsrelating themselves to science: 'As shown by Edwin Layton, presidents of engineering societ-ies typically called engineering an applied science in their annual addresses from 1895 to1920 in order to maintain its professional status in an era of increasing corporate employ-ment' (203); 'leaders of industrial research at General Electric advocated the NRC's pure-science ideal more strongly than [Bell Labs head] Jewett, in order to improve the lab'spublic image and to attract and retain first-rate scientists (211; no evidence cited); 'As vicepresident of the engineering section of the AAAS 1938, he [William Wickenden] saidthat science was \"immensely enriched\" by a union with \"technology.\" But he then bowed tothe hierarchy of the association by saying that \"technology, however, can scarcely existwithout the fertilizing principle of science\"' (215; no evidence cited); 'During the congres-sional debates about the establishment of what became the NSF, engineering educatorsattempted to instruct Congress on the virtues of \"engineering science\" in order to gain aplace at the federal trough. But they did so in a way that deferred to an NRC ideal of purescience espoused by Compton, Langmuir, and others who testified before them, probably inan effort to present a united front with the scientists' (219; no evidence cited); 'Why didengineers and industrial researchers from the time of Thurston [1880s] to that of Bushconstrue their field as subordinate to \"pure science\"? The discourses examined here suggestthat a major reason 17:39 395[395] Kline, 'Construing \"Technology\"', 203, cites pages 56-8, 66-7, of Layton, Revolt of the Engineers: Social Responsibility and the American Engineering Profession (1971), as source for his 'As shown by Edwin Layton' attribution quoted in the previous note. No support is,however, to be found there. Nor should there be. For, as Layton's subtitle makes clear, hisargument in this book\u2014notably on the pages lying between those Kline cites, most especiallyp. 62\u2014was that the potential for improved social status lay not in appropriating the mantle ofscience but in the engineer's assumption of social responsibility. On the pages Kline cites,Layton was already striving to deemphasize the extent to which his engineers regarded them- selves as applied scientists, while on the intervening pages Layton emphasized the sincerity oftheir discourse: 'inaccurate as literal descriptions, the engineers' self-portrayals expresseddeeply felt aspirations for freedom and responsibility'. (61) Even five years later, Layton wasnot thinking along Kline's lines. Thus in 'American Ideologies of Science and Engineering'(1976), 690, Layton declared 'What is surprising, however, is to find American engineersendorsing what appears to be the scientific ideology', and for this he had neither Kline's norany other explanation to offer. More: the issue of Technology and Culture carrying Layton's paper also contains a transcript of the discussion following its oral presentation (701-2).There one finds Hughes pushing Layton toward social status as motive for the late 19thcentury engineers attaching their practice to science, but Layton was resisting that interpreta-tion\u2014in part, at least, because it disserved his representation of those engineers as constitut-ing an autonomous cognitive community. 396[396] Although not ordinarily so cited, Calvert, The Mechanical Engineer in America, 1830-1910 (1967), does provide some evidence in the form of an argument that the mechanical engineer-ing elite in America abandoned in the late 1880s their opposition to collegiate training of engi-neers when it became clear that by insisting on a rigorous science-based curriculum thoseinstitutions would be contributing to the maintenance of an engineering elite. Better evidencehas been brought for a 'social status' explanation of the Verwissenschaftlichung of engineering in Germany, where indeed one would expect it to have greater validity. Nevertheless, there toothe tendency among historians of technology is simply to assume this to be so, to take \"Kulturhebel\"', 39, 43. Gispen, New Profession, Old Order , is an extreme example, both in his insistance that academic engineering education provided only 'technologically useless erudi-tion' (66), and in his constant reiteration of the nothing-but-status claim without offeringargument or evidence. Such evidence as can be brought for the German case argues for theimplausibility of that same interpretation in the American: there are scarcely any Americanparallels to the agitation and literature generated in Germany at the end of the 19th andbeginning of the 20th century. 397[397] Hughes, in 'Machines, Megamachines, and Systems' (1989), a very open statement of his fundamentally ideological commitments in writing history of technology, associated himselfwith Perry Miller's 'marvellous image of nineteenth-century Americans', namely that in fling-ing themselves '\"into the technological torrent ... they shouted with glee ... as they wentheadlong down the chute\"'. Hughes included the essay containing this image, Miller, 'TheResponsibility of Mind in a Civilization of Machines' (1962), in his collection: Changing Attitudes Toward American Technology (1975). Multhauf, in charge of the history of technol- ogy and science at the Smithsonian and deeply immersed in the elucidation of early chemicaltechnologies, was a member, along with Mumford and Hughes, of Kranzberg's 'AdvisoryCommittee for Technology and Society' to create SHOT, and a contributor to the openingissue of Technology and Culture . Like Kranzberg and Hughes, Multhauf was an admirer of Mumford, and notwithstanding that he was greatly put off by Mumford's Pentagon of Power , in reviewing it in Technology and Culture Multhauf could not say that Mumford was wrong: 'Lewis Mumford remains one of the most knowledgeable authorities on the impact of tech-nology on society. He is probably correct in describing the danger it poses', for which dangerDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: Multhauf quoted Mumford's declaration: 'I have been driven, by the wholesale miscarriages of megatechnics, to deal with the collective obsessions and compulsions that have misdirectedour energies, and undermined our capacity to live full and spiritually satisfying lives'. Theentire spectrum of ambivalent attitudes coexisted in Kranzberg, who was always too busyplaying upon one or another to notice the contradictions among them. 398[398] Misa, 'Beyond Linear Models' (2004), 263, ridiculing the abjuration of every form of techno- logical determinism. In this regard, Misa has steadily stood outside the SHOTist orthodoxy.Schatzberg remains wholly within it: 'Like the definition of technology as applied science, noprominent historian of technology today would admit to belief in technological determinism':Schatzberg, 'Undermining Common Sense' and ' Technik Comes to America'. It is true that Technology and Culture published recently Ceruzzi's 'Moore's Law'. Ceruzzi argues there that 'Moore's law'\u2014the empirical fact of a fixed exponential rate of increase, over the past fortyyears, of data storage capacity, per unit area of semiconductor 'chips', in digital computers\u2014shows that 'raw technological determinism is at work', and thus is evidence of 'the reality oftechnological determinism' (590, 593). But, though that is his thesis, Ceruzzi opens his essayby reminding his readers of the faith of their fathers\u2014'Mel Kranzberg and his colleagues orga-nized the Society for the History of Technology in part to foster a view of technology runningcounter to the notion that technology is an impersonal force with its own internal logic and atrajectory that human beings must follow'\u2014and avowing his own adherence to that faith: 'Iagree with and support this approach to the history 399[399] as quoted in note 346, above. 400[400] In the mid and late 1980s, Hughes associated himself closely with the social construction of technology (SCOT) program\u2014see note 359, above, and note 408, below\u2014specifically asdirected against all and any technological determinism: Hughes, American Genesis , 5, 469-70. Elsewhere at the same time, 'Machines, Megamachines', 116-17, Hughes was pointing to Ellul,as well as to Mumford, as one of his 'mentors'\u2014Ellul, against whom Winner's Autonomous Technology (1977) was so largely directed, and Mumford, whose thesis in The Myth of the Machine was no less deterministic than Ellul's\u2014and insisting, as did they, that the determina- tive forces at 'the depths of the technological society' not 'politics and economics' but 'machines, megamachines, and systems'. Thus disasters such as Chernobyl are not the result of 'societal values'; rather, Hughes insisted, those values themselves 'are integral parts of thesetechnological systems'. In the mid 1990s Hughes publicly rejected social construction andreturned to the demi-determinism of his earliest work in the history of technology (Hughes,'Technological Momentum'). 401[401] In his concluding remarks at the 1978 'Roanoke Conference\u2014Critical Problems in the History of Technology', Sivin, 'The Conference II', 629, was pleased, but surprised, that 'noone took issue with Otto Mayr's denial that technology was autonomous', and Sivin urgedupon historians of technology the 'useful public service' of debunking the influential myth ofautonomous technology. (Winner's Autonomous Technology had appeared the previous year; he and Sivin were colleagues at MIT.) There were some objections to this ideology as ideologyin the 1980s: Rae, 'What Did We Expect', responding as one of the founders of SHOT toStaudenmaier, expressed concern that Staudenmaier's anti-progress 'theory of history' wasinterfering with evaluating work scholarly merit. Hindle, 'Historians ofTechnology', 236-8, adduced MacKenzie, 'Marx and the Machine', and Winner, Autonomous Technology, as such ideological history, but Hindle refused to see the ambivalence toward technology among the founders of the discipline and put all the onus for 'pessimistic', 'dark-side history' upon the younger generation formed in the rebellions of the 1960s. 402[402] Wise, 'Science and Technology', 244. Similarly, on p. 230, after listing the metaphors proposed to describe the relation between science and technology, and concluding that 'Thekey idea behind all the metaphors is autonomy', Wise continued: 'Science and technology areviewed as autonomous with regard to one another, though far from autonomous with regardDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 125 to economics, politics, and ideologies. But no new model for the way these two autonomous enterprises act on each other has yet emerged'. (Of course there is a distinction to be madebetween 'autonomous technology' and 'technological determinism'. As no historian of tech-nology that I have read has sought to make that distinction, I will not either.) 403[403] Responding to Daniels, 'The Big Questions in the History of American Technology' (1970), Layton, 'Comment: The Interaction of Technology and Society', took issue with Daniels'sextreme anti-technological-determinism stance, recognizing that it was at variance with hisautonomy of technology program. 404[404] Daniels, 'The Big Questions', 2. (For Daniels this was not so much ideology as a methodologi- cal postulate.) Nye, Technology Matters , teaches that technological development is not auton- omous, that social, economic, or political developments are not determined by technology,and that no technological innovation is socially determined. Also Nye, 'Shaping'. That is, an unavowedly postmodern ist anti-determinism. Scranton, although avowedly postmodern ist, is too seriously engaged with the nuts and bolts of technological change to adopt so wholly ideo-logical an indeterminism. He has admitted 'local determination': 'whereas technical advancesand the quest for innovation and efficiency are not universally regnant, there may well be sites,sectors, and periods in which a technology-oriented logic governs'. However, he drew the lineat allowing 'any notion that shifts in technology govern the restructuring of social formations(families, schools, firms, governments) or of Staudenmaier has been the longest, most consistent, and most explicit in this position, what has been with him an essentially anti-modernposition (see ', 488, 512, treating the history of the meanings of the word technology as 'the struggle between deterministic and nondetermin-istic interpretations of technology ', proceeds from the same premise as Staudenmaier, viz. only by wholly disconnecting technology from science is it possible to throttle the 'mystifying,deterministic discourse that portrays technological change as the inevitable fruit of scientificdiscovery'. See also Molella on Mumford at note 332, above. Scranton's ignoration of science,to which I drew attention in note 365, above, is pertinent in this connection as well. AsHeilbroner, 'Technological Determinism', 78, aptly remarked thing; disavowal another'. 406[406] http://www.historyoftechnology.org/pubs/booklet.html (accessed 27 July 2006). The state- ment appears in the 'Series Introduction', signed by Pamela O. Long and Robert C. Post aseditors, 'Historical Perspectives on Technology, Society, and Culture. A booklet seriesproduced by the Society for the History of Technology in cooperation with the AmericanHistorical Association'. 407[407] That, and almost all the rest of the ideological tenets explored here, are provided as essential information for the general reader in Dunlavy's article 'Technology' for The Oxford Companion to United States History (2001): 'As engineers strove to enhance their status, meanwhile, they embraced the term [\"technology\"] but defined it as \"applied science,\"closely allied with \"pure\" or \"basic\" science. ... Historians of technology, organized profes-sionally in the 1950s, disputed the \"applied science\" definition ... . Also rejecting technolog-ical determinism and autonomy, historians explored the role of social choice and humanagency in technological change.' 408[408] On average, at least one genuflexion to Bijker et al., The Social Construction was to be seen in every issue of Technology and Culture in the 1990s. In this connection Hounshell, 'Hughesian History' (1995), 211-13, reports some revealing information which Bijker provided in April1990 about the origins and motivations for that program 'which', as Hounshell thereobserved, 'has for the last seven to eight years become the leading fashion in the field': Bijker'and many of his colleagues in Europe had become alarmed by the growing apathy and senseof helplessness among the public' because it 'had come technology as autonomousDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 126 P. Forman and deterministic'. 'Bijker and his colleagues determined to counter such resignation. In social construction they found their method.' They 'literally taught social construction oftechnology in the streets'. 'Only later did Bijker develop his approach more formally and takeit into the academic markets of the world.' Hounshell (209-15) has an extended discussion ofhow and why the issue of technological determinism figured so prominently in the thenrecent history of the history of technology discipline, in which he gave Alfred Chandler's worksome importance: 'The problem of technological determinism drove much of the scholarshipin the history of technology in the years immediately after The Visible Hand appeared' in 1977. Hounshell did not, apart from what is implicit in his account of the origins of SCOT,find as problematic, or calling for explanation, the fact that the discipline lined up so solidlyagainst technological determinism. Nor did Laudan, 'Natural Alliance', S26-7, in explaining that, though possessing only weak evidence, 'many historians of technology have embracedsocial constructivism because it gives them a way of combating technological determinism\u2014the idea that social change is driven by technological change, that there is a technologicalimperative'. Pinch, 'The Social Construction', 20, while insisting that 'the radical version ofsocial constructivism ... is opposed to any conception of technological determinism',conceded, in effect, that very few (if any) of the historical case studies allegedly confirmingsocial construction of technology met the requirements of the radical version. 409[409] Sinclair, 'The Road to Madison', S10. History and literature offer no parallel: Novick, That Noble Dream ; Graff, Professing Literature . 410[410] Sinclair, 'An Agenda for 'The Road to Madison', S11: 'the friendly, open, and nature of our society'. Likewise Layton ('Leonardo da VinciMedal'), 598. The SHOT presidentialaddresses by Hughes, 'Convergent Themes' (1981), (1996)and Roland, Hath Kranzberg Wrought?' (1997), are indirect arguments against sonarrow a conception and exclusive a preoccupation. Yet the very fact that it seemed necessaryto make that point\u2014and not politic to make it explicitly\u2014is itself evidence of the ideologicalcharacter of the body being addressed. 412[412] What Scranton, 'Determinism and Indeterminacy', S35-6, pointed out forcefully, seemingly to 'Construing \"Technology\"', 194, quoting Mayr, 'The Science-Technology Relationship', 671. What Mayr saw as the most fundamental aspect of this question, namely the relative rank of technology and science 'on our scale of values', and how that has changed over time, was notbrought forward by Kline. 414[414] As 'notable exceptions' to this generalization that 'little attention has been paid to the history of this view and why it (and similar beliefs) has been so pervasive in American culture', Kline,'Construing \"Technology\"', 195, note 5, IngeniousMechanics', and Layton, 'American Ideologies'. As we have seen, neither is notably so, andneither even addresses the matter of pervasiveness. 415[415] That would remain true even if Kline had in fact provided the explanations he claimed to (196): 'Explanations for why historical actors took specific rhetorical positions will draw onchanging practices in science and technology and the complex process of creating socialboundaries around academic science, industrial research, and engineering.' For what suchexplanations take as a given\u2014the importance of the social boundaries that are to be main-tained\u2014itself requires explanation by reference to cultural values. 416[416] Googling 'The cultural turn' on 9 August 2006 turns up 77,000 web pages. For indications, quantitative and nonquantitative, of the decline of 'the social' see Forman, 'From the Social tothe Moral'. 417[417] Subordination of the social to the cultural is the finding, though not the historiographic presupposition, of Forman, 'Weimar Culture'. The toDownloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 History and Technology 127 explain ideological reorientation was, and I think remains, required by the great size and suddenness of the change in the values articulated by physicists and mathematicians\u2014insome cases by one and the same physicist or mathematician over the course of but a fewmonths. More generally, where change in cultural values is what requires to be explained, thehistorian must keep an open mind, but the ultimate explanans need not necessarily be 'thesocial'; it can very well be the socio-economic consequences of 'the cultural' reacting backupon 'the cultural'. Such, I take it, is Bell's argument in The Cultural Contradictions , and of Christopher Lasch in his several books on the same subject. 418[418] As J. G. A. Pocock wrote in the early 1960s, in the floodtide of 'the social', 'The slogan that ideas ought to be studied in their social and political context is, it seems to me, in danger ofbecoming a shibboleth; too many of those who pronounce it assume, often unconsciously,that they already know what the relations between ideas and social reality are'. Pocock,Politics, Language, and Time , 105. (The essay there republished was originally published in 1965. My attention was directed to Pocock's ageless admonition by Martin Collins.) 419[419] So, for example, Godin, 'Measuring Science', 79, poses the question how the so-very-1950s concept of basic (= fundamental) research (= science) 'centered on the [non-utilitarian]motivations of the researchers and the non-application of the research results', adopted earlyon in the OECD Frascatti manual for 'measuring' research funding, could have continued tothe present day notwithstanding the numerous well-founded criticisms of it over the pastthree decades. Godin's plausible explanation is the universities' political interest in maintain-ing the concept of fundamental research, and the bureaucrats interest in maintaining a consis-tent basis for statistical time series. Likewise, Harwood, Technology's Dilemma and 'On the Genesis of Technoscience', uses institutional factors to account for departures from culturallysanctioned science-technology relations. 420[420] Of course, the inverse does not hold: adhering to the conception of coherent historical eras does not of itself imply a disciplinary orientation, as is well exemplified by such eminent peri-odizers as Spengler, Mumford and Foucault. That Foucault's aim and method were essentiallySpengler's and Mumford's is perfectly clear from the description he gave of it in his 'Forewordto the English Edition' of Foucault, The Order of Things , ix-xiii. How much and how highly Foucault had Spengler in mind is indicated by his bracketing Spengler with Hegel and Marx.Ibid., 334. While I believe that no one convinced of the fact of postmodernity can hold any but the slimmest hope for the survival of disciplinarity, the alternative to pursuing scholarship 'asif' we remain fully committed to disciplinary objectives and constraints is a chaos of purposesand practices in which only unlovely characters can thrive. If postmodernity, such as it is,continues its advance\u2014and I can see nothing short of a catastrophic alteration of the lifeconditions on this planet as capable of altering the ever wider spread and deeper seating of thisradically self-regarding individualism\u2014then the consequent transformations of personality,culture and society will render the constructive endeavors of the past three centuries increas-ingly irrelevant and unintelligible. Among those endeavors, science is especially vulnerable.For if science is not regarded as separate and distinguishable from technology in some cultur-ally highly valued ways, and if the fact of scientific laws is not regarded as a greater miraclethan the fact that the machine works, then it is 'curtains' for the scientific enterprise. To besure, the foregoing analysis does not warrant so categorical a conclusion, but only that therewill be in the future far fewer sciences than we knew in modernity, viz. only such as, by theirobjects and procedures, cannot possibly be conflated with technology. The stronger conclu-sion follows, however, from other features of postmodernity, features cooperating to destroyall possibility of disciplinarity. Something of the anti-disciplinary effects of postmodern valuesis indicated in my brief papers, Forman, 'From the Social to the Moral', 'In the Era of theEarmark' and 'What the Us'. 'The Linear Model', in support of his denial that any thoughtful persons in those post-Second World War decades, other than self-justifying scientists,Downloaded By: [Forman, Paul] At: 17:39 23 April 2007 128 P. Forman believed in the linear model, cited Forman, 'Into Quantum Electronics' (1996) and, more especially, Forman, 'Behind Quantum Electronics' (1987), which papers explored how thegreatly expanded governmental support of basic physical research in academic settings afterthe Second World War was conditioned upon and integrated with a far vaster program ofachieving national security through superiority in military technology. The fact that only asmall percentage (5%) of the funds expended by the military for research and developmentwere set aside for basic research, and that small percentage was neither well rationalized norused solely for researches properly regarded as basic, was adduced by Edgerton as evidencethat the military agencies, their commanding officers and their civilian program officers, hadno such faith in basic research as the source of new military technologies. Here, however, itis necessary to distinguish again, as I have repeatedly through this paper, between the ideo-logical primacy of science, of which the linear model was an expression, and the actual prac-tice of those convinced of that ideology. It was not at all the aim of my papers cited byEdgerton to argue against the ideological primacy of science, but rather to expose thecontradictory reality that that ideology obscured from our view. At that level, the level ofactual practice of technological innovation and of the application of available resources tofurther their real interests, Edgerton is of course more right than wrong in insisting that'The Linear Model Did Not Exist', but at the level of belief, he is far more wrong than right.The fate of basic research in industry over the past two or three decades demonstrates that itis that large margin of difference at the level of belief that makes all the difference at the levelof practice. In view of that recent history, it seems beyond doubt that what is importantabout the small fraction of total 'innovation' funds applied to basic research is not its small-ness but its existence: absent that credence in the linear model, and, more generally, in thevalue of flying the banner of pure science, the level of support for basic research by profit-making organizations falls to zero. 423[423] See Mirowski, as referenced in note 60, and Mirowski and Sent, Science Bought and Sold , for the coincidence in date with a broad shift in conceptions of the relative 'goodness' of thepublic and the private. Collins, 'One World', for a manifestation of it in global communica-tions. For earlier efforts to define and date the modern-postmodern transition, see Harvey,The Condition of Postmodernity ; Rose, The Post-Modern . 424[424] To this circumstance Hollinger, 'The Defense of Democracy', drew our attention in the early 1980s. Yet, to my knowledge, attention has not been drawn to the particular unanimity ofscience and modernity in the primacy both assert of means over ends. A very clear statementof this axiom common to modern science and the modern polity is given by Jacob Bronowski,Science and Human Values , 71: 'the end for which we [scientists] work exists and is judged only by the means which we use to reach it. This is the human sum of the values of science. Itis the basis of a society which scrupulously seeks knowledge to match and govern its power.'My attention was drawn to Bronowski and to this quotation through the closing paragraph ofPyenson, 'What Is the Good'.
