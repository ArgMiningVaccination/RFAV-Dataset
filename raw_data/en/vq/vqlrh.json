The medicines and vaccines that potentially help protect and treat everyone need everyone involved. We invite you to learn about our clinical trial opportunities and how you may be able to make a difference. Stay connected and join the Moderna online community to advance clinical research. Only people can help save people. Clinical trials are scientific studies that evaluate investigational treatments or vaccines in people. Without clinical trials, there would be no new medications or vaccines. Clinical trials, and the volunteers who take part in them, are vital to developing new medications, vaccines, and treatments for diseases. Clinical trial participants provide important information that might help improve medical research. Diseases do not discriminate - and neither should our clinical trials. At Moderna we remain unwavering in our commitment to researching mRNA-based vaccines and therapies with a goal of bringing better health for all populations. We believe in supporting those working to meet the needs of underserved populations, proudly partnering with national and global nonprofit groups, patient advocates, and community health organizations to increase disease awareness and extend clinical trial opportunities to those at most risk or most impacted by diseases. Diseases and medical conditions may affect people differently, but they still can affect anyone. Since certain populations may respond differently to medical treatments, therapies and vaccines, it is vital that people from all races, ethnicities, and genders participate in clinical trials to evaluate if investigational medicines and vaccines are safe and effective for as many people as possible. Moderna is driven by our mission to deliver on the promise of mRNA science to create a new generation of transformative medicines for people. We are currently advancing mRNA clinical trials in an effort to address serious unmet needs across several therapeutic areas and multiple diseases. Clinical trials are now underway for several of our investigational mRNA vaccines and therapeutics that may have the potential to treat or prevent rare diseases, viruses, and cancers. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally occurring and plays a fundamental role in our bodies by teaching our bodies' cells how to make proteins that can trigger an immune response to help protect us from viruses, or treat or even potentially cure diseases. Moderna's vaccines and therapeutics are built on a mRNA platform. [Learn more about how mRNA technology is being used for the following areas](https://aboutmrna.com/) How Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) Dutifully Deliver mRNA How (LNPs) mRNA How Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) Dutifully Deliver mRNA Typical vaccines for viruses are made from a weakened or inactivated virus, but Moderna's mRNA-based investigational vaccines for infectious diseases are different. They are made from molecules called mRNA that tell the body's cells how to make specific proteins to mimic those encountered in a viral infection. These proteins help train immune cells to protect against the virus in the event of exposure. Moderna is also applying mRNA technology to the field of immuno-oncology. This therapeutic area involves harnessing the body's immune system to help identify and kill cancer cells in the same way the immune system identifies and targets infections. One approach is to develop personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) to deliver a custom mRNA-based medicine tailored to the uniqueness of that individual's cancer. Many rare genetic diseases are caused by missing enzymes (specialized proteins) in liver cells. Moderna's mRNA investigational therapeutics are designed to deliver instructions to restore enzyme activity in the liver in ways that cannot be achieved with other technologies. The end goal is to use mRNA to address a large number of metabolic diseases for which there is no treatment. "}
