Join wisdom keeper Erika Gagnon on a sacred journey within the macrocosm of this balanced union, as we gather together and learn about the importance of ancestral lineage, traditional ceremonies, sacred altars, medicinal plants, and the origins of dis-ease in our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies. We will allow the Equinox energy to heal and strengthen our inherent desire to go beyond the false duality of a divided self, and self versus nature, to a unified wholeness, living in harmony and balance within ourselves, and with the world around us. You will be invited to reconnect to your authentic wisdom and power with clarity, and through gratitude and forgiveness. When you honor and heal your ancestral lineage, and connect to the natural and spiritual elements of this planet, you will strengthen your connection to the sacred in everyday life. This is your opportunity to transform unhealthy patterns and trauma, and realign your body, mind, spirit, and soul. You will also have the opportunity to participate in a water prayer blessing, a sound healing and \"doctoring\" journey, and a traditional South American healing ceremony. We are all interconnected in this great web of life, and every day is a gift to live in the service of unconditional love: for yourself, your community, humanity, and our planet. If you feel the call to be a part of a new humanity that lives in harmony and balance together upon this Earth, then we invite you to join us in this celebration of life. Please bring any sacred items for our altar, including photographs of loved ones and ancestors, sacred objects that have meaning for you, and a journal to write in. Special Note on Gift Economy: For this workshop, Esalen will not be collecting the typical leader fees. Erika embraces the tradition of the gift economy and reciprocity. The leader's compensation will be self-determined by each attendee. At the end of the workshop, participants will offer a donation amount that reflects their feeling of gratitude, value, and desire to support Erika and her ongoing work. Erika Gagnon is a ceremonial leader, wisdom carrier, and healer who helps others heal themselves. She has walked a medicine path and Red Road for 28 years, working with Indigenous elders from North and South America and their ceremonies, altars, and medicinal plants. She is honored to receive her Indigenous elders' blessings to continue their traditions through healing ceremonies and personal healing sessions.
