REMBERT, BS, DOUGLAS BORYS, BSP HARM Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) data are compiled by the American Association of Poison ControlCenters (AAPCC) on behalf of US poison centers. Thesedata are used to identify hazards early, focus preventioneducation,guideclinicalresearch,directtraining,anddetectchem/bioterrorism incidents. TESS data have promptedproduct reformulations, repackaging, recalls, and bans; areused to support regulatory actions; and form the basis of postmarketing surveillance of newly released drugs andproducts. From its inception in 1983, TESS has grown dramati- cally, with increases in the number of participating poisoncenters, population served by those centers, and reportedhuman exposures (Table 1A). 1-20 The American Association of Poison Control Centers gratefully acknowledges the generous nancial contribution of McNeil Consumer and Specialty Pharmaceuticals in support of the compilation and production of this report. The compilation of these data was also supported, in part,by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cooperative Agreement U50/CCU323406-01. US poison centers make possible the compilation and reporting of this comprehensive description of human exposures to potentially toxic substances through their meticulous documentation of each case using standardized denitions and compatible computer systems.

Address requests to AAPCC, 3201 New Mexico Ave, Suite 330, Washington, DC 20016.doi: 10.1016/j.ajem.2004.06.001 335The cumulative AAPCC database now contains 36.2 mil2lion human poison exposure cases. This report includes2,395,582 human exposure cases reported by 64 participat-ing poison centers during 2003, an increase of 0.7% com-pared to 2002. CHARACTERIZATION OF PARTICIPATING CENTERS Of the 64 reporting centers, 62 submitted data for the entire year. Fifty-one of the 64 participating centers werecertied as regional poison centers by the AAPCC at theend of 2003. The annual human exposure case volume bycenter ranged from 11,458 to 110,459 (mean 38,388) forcenters participating for the entire year. Penetrance, calcu-lated for states that were served by centers participating inTESS for the entire year, ranged from 5.9 to 17.6 exposures per 1,000 population with a mean of 8.1 reported exposuresper1,000population.Penetranceisdenedasthenumberofhumanpoisonexposurecasesreportedper1,000individualsper year in the population served. The entire population of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (294.7 million) was served bythe participating centers. Cases from Puerto Rico were onlyreported for a 7-month period. Extrapolations from thenumber of reported poison exposures to the number ofactual poisonings occurring annually in the US cannot bemade from these data alone, as considerable variations inpoison center penetrance were noted. Indeed, assuming allcenters reached the penetrance level of 17.6 poison expo-sures/1,000 population reported for one state, 5.2 millionpoison exposures would have been reported to poison cen-ters in 2003. Although this report focuses on the humanexposure cases reported to TESS in 2003, the database alsocontains data (not presented here) on animal poison expo- sures(133,397cases,primarilycompanionanimals),humanconrmed nonexposures (7,071), animal conrmed nonex-posures (406), and information calls (1,167,776). An addi-tional 4,500 duplicate human exposure reports (reported tomore than one participating poison center) were excluded.This total of 3,708,732 cases and information calls reportedto TESS in 2003 does not reflect the full extent of poisoncenter effort. In addition, nearly 2.7 million follow-up callswere placed by poison centers during the year to providefurther patient guidance, conrm compliance with recom-mendations,andgathernaloutcomedata.Follow-upsweredone in 44% of human exposure cases. One follow-up callwas made in 22% of cases; and multiple follow-up calls(range 2 to 86) were placed in 22% of cases. The data do not directly identify a trend in the overall incidence of poisonings in the US because of changingcenter participation from year to year and changes in centeruse. Comparison of data from the 49 states (and the Districtof Columbia) that were covered by participating centers forthe entirety of both 2002 and 2003 shows an increase of0.4% in the number of reported human poison exposuresfrom 2002 to 2003. Information call subcategories were implemented in TESS in 2002. A total of 1,167,776 information calls werereported to TESS in 2003, including 139,043 calls coded inoptional reporting categories such as administrative, imme-diate referral, and prevention/safety/education (Table 1B).These latter call types were reported inconsistently as theywere not required to be reported by participating poisoncenters.Overall,thevolumeofinformationcallshandledbyUS poison centers increased 5.1% from 2002 to 2003. The most frequent information call was for drug identi- cation, comprising 617,414 calls to poison centers duringthe year. Of these, 103,020 (16.7%) could not be identiedover the telephone. Of the drug identication calls, 74.4%were received from the public, 12.7% from health profes-sionals,and11.8%fromlawenforcement.Forty-sixpercentof drug identication requests involved drugs sometimesinvolved in abuse, however these cases were categorizedbased on the abuse potential, generally without knowledgeof whether abuse was actually intended. Drug information calls (174,631 calls) comprised 15.0% of all information calls. Of these 19.6% were questionsabout drug-drug interactions, 14.4% were questions abouttherapeutic use and indications, and 10.7% were questionsabout adverse effects. Environmental inquiries comprised3.2% of all information calls. Of these, 26.0% related toclean-up of mercury thermometers and 12.8% involvedpesticides. Poison information comprised 9.3% of informa-tion calls, with 11.8% of these involving food poisoning orfood preparation practices and 10.8% involving plant tox-icity. REVIEW OF THE DATA No changes to the data collection format were imple- mented in 2003. Prior revisions occurred in 1984, 1985,1993, 2000, 2001, and 2002. Data reported after January 1,2000 allow an unlimited number of substances for eachcase, a factor that should be considered when comparingsubstance data with prior years.TABLE 1A.

Exposures oc-curredintheworkplacein2.0%ofcases,inschools(1.5%), healthcarefacilities(0.3%),andrestaurantsorfoodservices(0.4%). Poison center peak call volumes were from 4 to 10 PM, although call frequency remained consistently high be- tween 8 AMand midnight, with 90% of calls logged during this 16-hour period. The average number of human poisonexposure consultations handled per day by all participatingU.S. poison centers was 6,563. Higher volumes were ob-served in the warmer months, with a mean of 7,017 per dayin July compared to 6,123 consultations per day in January.On average, ignoring time of day and seasonal fluctuations, U.S. poison centers handled one poison exposure every 13seconds. Figure 1 shows the temporal consistency of TESShuman exposure data and seasonal variation over the fouryear period from January 2000 through December 2003.The seasonal variation in exposures to nonpharmaceuticalsparallels that of overall case volume. The age and gender distribution of human poison expo- sure victims is outlined in Table 3. Children younger than 3years of age were involved in 39.0% of cases, and 52.0%occurred in children younger than 6 years. A male predom-inance is found among poison exposure victims youngerthan 13 years of age, but the gender distribution is reversedin teenagers and adults. Of all poison exposures captured,7,949 occurred in pregnant women. Of those with knownpregnancy duration, 32% occurred in the rst trimester, 38% in the second trimester, and 30% in the third trimester.In 4.7% of cases (112,591 cases) multiple patients wereimplicated in the poison exposure episode (eg, siblings\"shared\"a household product, multiple patients inhaled vapors at a hazardous materials spill). Fatalities differed from the total exposure data set in several ways. Table 4 presents the age and gender distribu-tion for the 1,106 reported fatalities. Although responsiblefor the majority of poisoning reports, children younger than6 years of age comprised just 3.1% (34) of the fatalities.Fifty-eight percent of poisoning fatalities occurred in 20- to49-year-old individuals. A single substance was implicatedin 91.7% of reports, and 2.8% of patients were exposed tomore than two possibly poisonous drugs or products (Table5). In contrast, 49% of fatal cases involved two or moredrugs or products. The overwhelming majority of humanexposures were acute (91.7%) compared to 53.6% of poi-TABLE 1B.

Chronic exposures comprised 1.8% of all poison exposure reports, and acute-on-chronicexposures comprised 5.4%. (Chronic exposures were de- ned as continuous or repeated exposures occurring over a period exceeding 8 hours.) Reason for exposure was coded according to the follow- ing denitions:Unintentional general : All unintentional exposures not otherwise de ned below. Most unintentional exposures in children are reported here. Environmental : Any passive, nonoccupational exposure that results fromcontamination of air, water, or soil. Environmental expo-sures are usually caused by man-made contaminants. Occu- pational: An exposure that occurs as a direct result of the person being on the job or in the workplace. Therapeutic error: An unintentional deviation from a proper therapeutic regimen that results in the wrong dose, incorrect route ofadministration, administration to the wrong person, or ad-ministration of the wrong substance. Only exposures tomedications or products used as medications are included.Drug interactions resulting from unintentional administra-tion of drugs or foods which are known to interact are alsoincluded. Unintentional misuse : Unintentional improper or incorrect use of a nonpharmaceutical substance. Uninten-tional misuse differs from intentional misuse in that theexposure was unplanned or not foreseen by the patient. Bite/sting : All animal bites and stings, with or without envenomation, are included. Food poisoning : Suspected or conrmed food poisoning; ingestion of food contaminated with microorganisms is included. Unintentional unknown : An exposure determined to be unintentional but the exactreason is unknown. Suspected suicidal : An exposure result- ing from the inappropriate use of a substance for reasonsthat are suspected to be self-destructive or manipulative.Intentional misuse : An exposure resulting from the inten- tional improper or incorrect use of a substance for reasonsotherthan the pursuit of a psychotropic or euphoric effect. Intentional abuse : An exposure resulting from the inten- tional improper or incorrect use of a substance where thevictim was likely attempting to achieve a euphoric or psy-chotropic effect. All recreational use of substances for anyeffect is included. Intentional unknown : An exposure that is determined to be intentional but the speci c motive is unknown. Contaminant/tampering : The patient is an unin- tentional victim of a substance that has been adulterated(eithermaliciouslyorunintentionally)bytheintroductionofan undesirable substance. Malicious : This category is used to capture patients who are victims of another person 's intenttoharmthem. Withdrawal :Effectrelatedtodeclinein FIGURE 1.

Includedare cases with an unwanted effect due to an allergic, hyper-sensitive,oridiosyncraticresponsetotheactiveingredients,inactive ingredients, or excipients. Concomitant use of acontraindicated medication or food is excluded, and codedinstead as a therapeutic error.The vast majority (84.7%) of poison exposures was un- intentional; suicidal intent was present in 7.8% of cases(Table 6A). Therapeutic errors comprised 9.0% of expo-sures cases), unintentional nonpharmaceuti-cal product misuse comprising another 3.7% of exposures.Therapeutic errors increased 11.3% compared to 2002. Thetypes of therapeutic errors observed in each age group aredelineated in Table 6B. Thirty-three percent of therapeuticerrors involved double-dosing.

Unintentional poisonings outnumbered intentional poi- sonings in all age groups (Table 7). In contrast, of the 1,106human poisoning fatalities reported, 88% of adolescentdeaths and 81% of adult deaths (older than 19 years of age)were intentional (Table 8). Ingestion was the route of exposure in 76.9% of cases (Table 9), followed in frequency by dermal, inhalation, andocular routes. For the 1,106 fatalities, ingestion, inhalation,and parenteral were the predominant exposure routes. Clinical effects (signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnor- malities) were coded in 29.8% of cases (16.2% had oneeffect, 7.7% had two effects, 3.8% had three effects, 1.3%had four effects, 0.4% had ve effects, and 0.3% had more thanve effects). Of 1,575,818 clinical effects coded, 80.1% were deemed related, 8.9% were considered notrelated, and 11.0% were coded as \"unknown if related \". The majority of cases reported to poison centers were managed in a non-health care facility (76%), usually at thesite of exposure, the patient 's own residence (Table 10). This includes the 2% of cases that were referred to a healthcare facility but refused to go. Treatment in a health carefacility was rendered in 21.9% of cases. The percentage ofpatients treated in a health care facility varied considerablywith age. Only 10.1% of children under 6 years and only13.1% of children between 6 and 12 years were managed ina health care facility compared to 48.1% of teenagers (13 to19 years of age) and 36.4% of adults (over 19 years of age).Of cases managed in a health care facility, 52.9% weretreated and released without admission, 14.3% were admit-ted for critical care, and 7.7% were admitted for noncriticalcare.Wheretreatmentwasprovidedinahealthcarefacility,32.3% of the patients were referred in by the poison centerand 67.7% were already in or en route to the health carefacility when the poison center was contacted. Health carefacilities included acute care hospitals (83.3%), physicianofces or clinics (8.9%), and freestanding emergency cen- ters (3.2%). Table 11 displays the medical outcome of the human poison exposure cases distributed by age, showing a greaterrate of severe outcomes in the older age groups. Table 12compares medical outcome and reason for exposure, andshows a greater frequency of serious outcomes in inten-tional exposures. Table 13 demonstrates an increasing du- ration of the clinical effects observed with more severeoutcomes. Medical outcome categories were as follows: No effect: The patient developed no signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure. Minor effect : The patient developed somesignsorsymptomsasaresultoftheexposure,buttheywere minimally bothersome and generally resolved rapidlywith no residual disability or dis gurement. A minor effect is often limited to the skin or mucous membranes (eg,self-limited gastrointestinal symptoms, drowsiness, skin ir-ritation,rst degree dermal burn, sinus tachycardia without hypotension, and transient cough). Moderate effect : The patient exhibited signs or symptoms as a result of theexposure that were more pronounced, more prolonged, ormore systemic in nature than minor symptoms. Usuallysome form of treatment is indicated. Symptoms were notlife-threatening and the patient had no residual disability ordisgurement (eg, corneal abrasion, acid-base disturbance, high fever, disorientation, hypotension that is rapidly re-sponsive to treatment, and isolated brief seizures that re-spond readily to treatment). Major effect : The patient ex- hibited signs or symptoms as a result of the exposure thatwere life-threatening or resulted in signi cant residual dis- ability or dis gurement (eg, repeated seizures or status epilepticus, respiratory compromise requiring intubation,ventricular tachycardia with hypotension, cardiac or respi-ratory arrest, esophageal stricture, and disseminated intra-vascular coagulation). Death: The patient died as a result of the exposure or as a direct complication of the exposure.Onlythosedeathsthatwereprobablyorundoubtedlyrelatedto the exposure are coded here. Not followed, judged as TABLE 5. Number of Substances Involved in Human Exposure Cases No. of Substances No. of Cases % of Cases 1 2,196,152 91.7 2 133,184 5.63 100.0 TABLE 6A. Reason for Human Exposure Cases Reason MEDICINE Number 5 ISeptember 2004nontoxic exposure : No follow-up calls were made to deter- mine the outcome of the exposure because the substanceimplicated was nontoxic, the amount implicated was insig-nicant, or the route of exposure was unlikely to result in a clinical effect. Not followed, minimal clinical effects possi- ble: No follow-up calls were made to determine the pa- tient's outcome because the exposure was likely to result in only minimal toxicity of a trivial nature. (The patient wasexpected to experience no more than a minor effect.) Un- able to follow, judged as a potentially toxic exposure : The patient was lost to follow-up, refused follow-up, or was notfollowed but the exposure was signi cant and may have resulted in a moderate, major, or fatal outcome. Unrelated effect: The exposure was probably not responsible for the effect.Conrmed nonexposure : This outcome option was coded to designate cases where there was reliable andobjective evidence that an exposure initially believed tohave occurred actually never occurred (eg, all missing pillsare later located). All cases coded as con rmed non-expo- sure are excluded from this report. Tables 14 and 15 outline the use of decontamination procedures, speci c antidotes, and measures to enhance elimination in the treatment of patients reported in thisdatabase. These must be interpreted as minimum frequen-cies because of the limitations of telephone data gathering.Table 16 demonstrates the continuing decline in the use ofipecac-induced emesis in the treatment of poisoning. Ipecacwas administered in only 9,284 human poison exposures in 2003. A further decrease in ipecac syrup use in 2004 isexpected in the wake of ipecac use guidelines issued in late2003. A joint Guidelines Consensus Panel formed by theAmericanAssociationofPoisonControlCenters,AmericanCollege of Medical Toxicology and American Academy ofClinical Toxicology issued a guideline which concludedthat the circumstances in which ipecac syrup is the appro-priate or desired method of gastric decontamination arerare. 21The American Academy of Pediatrics went one step further, concluding not only that \"ipecac should no longer be used routinely as a home treatment strategy \", but also recommending disposal of ipecac currently in homes.22 Table 17A presents the most common substance cate- gories involved in human exposures, listed by frequencyof exposure. Tables 17B and 17C present similar data forchildren and adults, respectively, and show the consider-able differences between pediatric and adult poison ex-posures. Table 18 lists the substance categories with thelargest number of reported deaths; analgesics and seda- tive/hypnotics lead this list. While analgesics are themost frequently involved substance category for bothdeaths and non-lethal human exposures, there is other-wise little correlation between the frequency of expo-sures to a substance and the number of deaths. Table 19shows little variation over the past 20 years in the per-centage of cases reported to TESS that are fatal poison-TABLE 6B.

Twenty-three deaths in this age range werereported in 2002, and that number had been fairly constantfor the prior 5 years. There is no single factor apparentlyresponsible for the increase, although environmental expo-sures and therapeutic errors doubled. As a percentage oftotal reported fatalities, 3.1% involved children less than 6years of age, increased from the range of 2.0-2.7% reportedoverthelast veyears.Thepercentageofpediatricfatalities related to total pediatric calls was 0.003%; by comparison,0.13% of all adult exposures reported were deaths. Of the reported deaths in children less than 6 years of age, 9 were unintentional general, 7 were environmental(carbon monoxide), 8 were therapeutic errors and therewere2deathseachfrombites/stingsandmaliciousintent.There was one death from an adverse drug reaction andone death associated with maternal drug abuse. Lookingat the agents involved in these cases (with a focus on theprimary substance), 12 deaths were associated with over-the-counter medications and 6 deaths were associatedwith prescription medications. Three of the prescriptionmedications implicated contained opioids and 2 wereanticonvulsants. There were 5 fatalities primarily relatedto nonpharmaceutical products, including two from her-bicides. One death of note was related to the inappropri-ate use of salt as an emetic and one was attributed to theinappropriate use of a phosphate containing pediatric enema solution. Interestingly, there were no pediatricfatalities in which the primary substance was iron, anti-depressantsorcardiovascularagents.Theseareclassesoftherapeutic agents which have been problems in the past. In the 6- to 12-year age range there were seven reported fatalities, including three adverse drug reactions and nosuspected suicides. In the 13- to 19-year age range therewere 65 reported fatalities. This number has droppedslightly for the last two years. As in past years, a smallnumber of adolescent fatalities (7.7%) are unintentional. The most common classes of substances involved in fatalities were analgesics, stimulants and street drugs, anti-depressants, cardiovascular agents and sedative/hypnotics/antipsychotics. Of the 375 fatalities where an analgesic wasfelt to be the primary responsible agent, 62 were associatedwith acetaminophen as a single agent, 52 with acetamino-phen and at least one other substance, and 100 with acet-aminophen in a combination product, usually containing anopioid. There were 23 fatalities where aspirin alone wasconsidered responsible. More than half of these patients didnothavesalicylateconcentrationsthatexceeded100mg/dL.Most of these cases did not receive dialysis in a useful timeframe, suggesting that more aggressive and earlier use ofdialysismaybeindicatedinthetreatmentoflargesalicylateingestions. Decreases were observed in the numbers ofdeaths attributed primarily to either methadone (38 casesversus 57 in 2002) or oxycodone (22 cases versus 27 inTABLE 11.

There continued to be a large number of cases involving eithermethadone or long-acting opioid preparations. In three fatalcases, the contents of fentanyl patches were apparentlyinjected intravenously, and two fatalities involved fentanyltransmucosal lozenges, one of which was reported as unin-tentional in an 11-year-old. Stimulants and street drugs were the second most com- mon category implicated as the primary cause of death,accounting for 124 deaths, virtually the same as in 2002.This is the rst year that antidepressants have not been the second most common class causing death. The number ofcases with cocaine implicated as the primary cause of deathwasessentiallyunchangedfrom2002(53casesversus52in2002). The number of heroin related fatalities, however,declined after a signi cant increase last year (23 cases versus 40 in 2002). There was also a signi cant increase in methamphetamine-related deaths (23 cases versus 13 in2002), and no change in the number of MDMA relatedfatalities. The third most common class of drugs associated with fatalities was antidepressants, accounting for 112 deaths.Amitriptyline, either alone or in combination, is the singlemost commonly implicated agent, as in past years. Neweragents continue to result in numerous deaths, although noone drug appears disproportionately responsible. The vast majority (79%) of reported fatalities in 2003, as in past years, were the result of intentional actions. Thepercentage of fatalities attributable to other reasons re-mained little changed from previous years (Table 8). Adisturbing number of deaths continue to occur because oftherapeutic errors (48 cases versus 54 in 2002). Adversedrug reactions also accounted for 26 deaths. There were more deaths reported in 2003 related to occupational expo- sures (27 cases) than in recent years. As in 2002 there wereno reported fatalities from either food poisoning or tamper- ing.

Sixty-one of the 62 US poisoncenters (all except Puerto Rico) submit data to TESS innearreal-time,withmostcenterssubmittingevery4to10minutes. Monitoring incoming cases for events of poten- tial public health importance is undertaken by automatedqueries of the database at intervals as frequently ashourly. Query results are sent to clinical toxicologists forreview to determine whether the outliers identi ed are of potential public health importance. When appropriate,additional information is obtained from reporting poisoncenters, and public health issues are brought to the atten-tion of the National Center for Environmental Health/ Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Affectedstate or local health departments are also alerted. Continuous monitoring focuses on poison center call volume, counts for subsets of poison center calls, distribu-TABLE 18.

In addition, at 1 to 12 hourintervals, automated queries identify cases that meet sur-veillance case de nitions for nerve agents, cyanide, ar- senic, botulism, and puffer sh ingestions with neuro- logic effects. Most of these monitors are implemented inresponse to public health issues or concerns and discon-tinued when the threat lessens. Previous case de nitions included both early and late paraquat/diquat toxicity andanticoagulant rodenticides. Cases coded as speci c sub- stances, for example ricin, are also monitored.

AAPCC has efforts currently under- way to augment toxicosurveillance at the local level,enhance GIS capabilities, monitor product outliers andclinical effects ef cacy, explore dose-response curves to better de ne toxic doses, and enhance cluster analysis using spatial-temporal analyticalmethods. In closing, we gratefully acknowledge the extensive con- tributions of each participating poison center and the assis-tance of the many health care providers who providedcomprehensive data to the poison centers for inclusion inthis database. We especially acknowledge the dedicatedefforts of the Specialists in Poison Information who metic-ulously coded nearly 2.4 million poison exposures in 2003. TABLE 21.

Methodology modeled after MMWR Figure 1.393 WATSON ET AL I2003 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTAAPCC's 2003 fatality veri cation process involved the preparation and review of abstracts on 1,390 fatalities reported to poison centers, some of which were eventually determined to be unrelated to a poison exposure. The review process requiresthe dedication and commitment of hundreds of poison center staff member s...more than could possibly be listed here. The following fatality abstract authors were identi ed by their poison centers as having made a major contribution to this effort. These individuals are acknowledged for their commitment to toxicosurveillance through the careful veri cation and L.Wittler, Mary APPENDIX Drug and chemical concentrations provided in these abstracts were measured in blood, serum or plasma unless otherwise indicated. Case 5. An 87-year-old woman was in the radiology department to have a liver cyst treated by percutaneousinjection of ethanol as a sclerosing agent. Approximately100to150mLofabsolute ethanolwasinfusedintothecystthrough a catheter. She developed bradycardia and was given epinephrine and atropine. During the resuscitation,the absolute alcohol spilled into the peritoneal cavity. Thewoman died approximately two hours later. Cases 12-19. Consultation was made to a US poison center regarding the treatment of 50 patients in Africa withmethanol poisoning following consumption of a methanol - contaminated home-brew. Eight teenagers died and severalwere still in intensive care at the time of the consultation.394 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 22, Number 5 ISeptember 2004Case 44. A 3-month-old girl was found in full cardiopul- monary arrest. The child was covered with re ants with multiple stings and was profoundly acidotic. She was broughtto the hospital but resuscitation efforts were not successful. Case 45. A 2-year-old girl was stung an estimated 200 times byyellow jackets . She apparently had a severe aller- gic reaction and was taken to the ED where she receiveddiphenhydramine and methylprednisolone. She developeddisseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Approximately 3hours later, she was reportedly resting quietly and breathingwithout support. She had heart rate, 149 beats/min; andblood pressure, 120/53 mm Hg. The following day, she hada cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated and intu-bated. She developed renal failure, was dialyzed, and diedthat day. Case 46. A 40-year-old diabetic man was presumably bitten by a brown recluse spider (unconrmed). He was treated with antibiotics as an outpatient; then the infectedwound crater was incised and drained about 10 days afterthebite.Twodayslaterhewasfoundathomewithmottlingand a diffuse rash covering his entire body. He was lethar-gic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Pus was draining fromthe wound. He was hospitalized and required intubation before receiving antibiotics. An initial arterial blood gas pHwas 7.0. Volume replacement therapy, dopamine, and ag-gressive supportive care were instituted. He died within therst 24 hours of hospitalization. Case48. A31-year-oldmanwastransferredtoaregional burn center with a severe inhalation injury and seconddegree burns to the groin area. His injuries resulted from aspill ofanhydrous ammonia that was reportedly being divertedforillicituse.Hehadacomplicatedhospitalcourseand required ventilator support on day 3. He developed amethicillin-resistant S.aureus infectionanddiedonthe17th hospital day. Cases 50-51. Three men were exposed to anhydrous ammonia when the valve of a tank in the back of a truck malfunctioned, releasing the gas into the cab. It was be-lieved that the ammonia was intended for an illicit druglaboratory.Twoofthemenweredeclareddeadatthescene. Case 53. A 17-year-old boy collapsed. When EMS ar- rived they found him comatose and apneic. The patient wasintubated and became hypotensive en route to the hospital.In the ED he was treated with vasopressors, glucagon andsodium bicarbonate but showed little improvement. gas showed: pH, 7.43; pCO 2,1 9m mH g ; pO2, 622 mm Hg. He suffered a cardiac arrest, was resus - citated, and had persistent xed and dilated pupils. He was transferred to a tertiary care center where lactic acidemia(20mEq/L)andarterializationofacentralvenousbloodgaswere noted. At this time the diagnosis of acute cyanidepoisoning was made, and it was determined that he hadingested approximately 1.0 to 1.5 grams of potassium cya- nidewhich had maliciously been put in a beverage he was drinking. Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate were givenwith minimal response. He remained profoundly hypoten-sive and comatose after re-administration of the cyanideantidote kit. He died 5 days later. Blood cyanide concen-trations were measured at 9.2 /H9262g/mL, 5 hours post presen- tation; 0.47 /H9262g/mL, 15 hours post presentation; and zero at 27 hours post presentation.Case 76. A 27-year-old man ingested 50 to 100 mL of methylethylketone peroxide and an unknown amount of ethanol, presumably in a suicide attempt. He was intubated enroutetothehospitalandhadamethemoglobinemiaintheED of 8.6%. He was treated with methylene blue. Hedeveloped a metabolic acidosis (pH 7.09), an increasinganion gap, and hypotension requiring vasopressor support.Hemodialysis was initiated to correct the acidosis and heunderwent endoscopy that revealed rst and second degree burns. The patient was hemodynamically unstable andcouldnotundergoanexploratorylaparotomy.Hedevelopedprogressive rhabdomyolysis, vasopressors, and the decision wasmade to withdraw support. He became asystolic and died ofmulti-organ system failure. Case 77. A 43-year-old man and a coworker wearing personalprotectiveequipmentwereworkinginanareawithphosphoruspentasulde .Thecoworkerbecameillandleft the area. The deceased was later found down in the workarea with his face mask off. He suffered a cardiorespiratoryarrest at the scene and was unable to be resuscitated in theeld or at a medical facility. The cause of death was described by the coroner as exposure to phosphorus penta-sulde and/or its decompositional elements; underlying heart disease was also present. Case 79. A 31-year-old man presented to the ED com- plaining of shortness of breath. The only recent medicalhistory was the injection of siliconeinto his bilateral pec- toralis regions one month prior to presentation. He had noknown signi cant past medical history. A chest x-ray on admission appeared consistent with lipoid pneumonia. ACT scan of his chest reportedly showed an eosinophilic-likepneumonia. During hospitalization, the patient became fe-brile and developed increasing shortness of breath thatrequired intubation. A bronchoalveolar lavage showed lip-id-laden macrophages. An HIV test was negative. The pa-tient'spulmonarystatusdeteriorated,andhediedthreedays after hospital admission. Case 92. A 37-year old man reportedly consumed 480 mL ofdrain opener (sulfuric acid 10 - 15%) in a suicide attempt. He was intubated in the eld. The ED physician described a \"melting away \"of the back of the throat, tongue, uvula and oropharynx. The patient was transferredto a regional trauma center where he was restless andagitated and had diaphoresis, tachycardia, and acidosis witha pH of 7.02. Intravenous fluids with sodium bicarbonate were administered, and he was treated with morphine andsedation.Thenextdayitwasdeterminedduringsurgerythatthepatienthadagastrointestinalperforationwithabdominalfree air. A total gastrectomy, splenectomy, total colectomyand esophagectomy were performed. Signi cant blood loss occurred, and he remained acidotic throughout the proce-dures. On the third hospital day, the acidosis was corrected,his vital signs became stable, the bleeding stopped, andurine output increased. He remained sedated and ventilated.On the fourth day, the patient was taken back to surgery foran ileostomy and jejunostomy in anticipation of enteralnutrition. The surgical team examined the mouth and dis-covered the entire palate was sloughing. The sixth day ajejunostomy tube was placed. The patient died on the sev-enth hospital day after support was withdrawn.395 WATSON ET AL I2003 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTCase 97. A 40-year-old man ingested up to 180 mLofarustremover(8%hydro fluoricacid) .Thepatient called EMS 30 minutes later because of severe oral andthroat pain. On arrival at the ED he was alert and experi-encing stridor, chest and abdominal pain. Oropharyngealedema and erythema were noted along with dif culty swal- lowing. An initial blood pressure was rapid sequence intubation and intravenous crys-talloid infusions, calcium gluconate and magnesium sulfatewere begun. Within the next hour he had a progressivedecrease in blood pressure, despite the administration offluids and blood products. He suffered a cardiac arrest prior to being transferred to the operating room and could not beresuscitated. Autopsy revealed burns and edema of thepharynx, glottis, and esophagus. The proximal esophagushad perforated. The stomach was distended with a largequantity of coagulated blood and evidence of perforations.The duodenum and small bowel were normal. Case 105. A 12-month-old boy was brought to the ED with the history that he had ingested an unknown amount ofahair moisturizing lotion . The child had a blood pressure of 70/50 mm Hg; heart rate, 160 to 180 beats/min; arterialblood gas pH, 7.25; and negative toxicology screen. Abnor-mallaboratoryvaluesincludedPT,22.4s;bicarbonate,16.8mEq/L; AST, 103 U/L; calcium, 7.6 mg/dL; anion gap, 15mmol/L.Theinitialchestx-raywasnormal.Fivehoursafteradmission the child was in signi cant respiratory and car- diac distress. He was intubated and begun on vasopressors.A repeat chest x-ray showed acute respiratory distress syn-drome. The child developed a fever and antibiotics wereinitiated. Despite aggressive care he died 2 days after ad-mission. Case108. An11-year-oldgirlwasfoundincardiacarrest with an empty can of an aerosol air freshener . The patient was pronounced dead after a prolonged attempt at resusci-tation. The coroner ruled the death secondary to complica-tions from huf ng. Case110. A29-year-oldmanwasbroughttotheEDafter inserting a baggie of drugs into his rectum while beingapprehended by the police. In the ED the patient was notedto be alert, with stable vital signs. Thirty minutes afterpresentation, the patient became asystolic minutes afterpolice witnessed the ingestion of a packet of drugs thepatient retrieved from his rectum. Physicians found a bag- gieofsuspectedcocaine inhistracheaduringintubation.In spite of successful resuscitation, the patient remained unre-sponsive with xed and dilated pupils. Polyethylene glycol was administered via his NG tube for whole bowel irriga-tion of suspected remaining packets. Sigmoidoscopy foundno residual packets in the rectum. The patient remainedhemodynamically unstable. An EEG was diagnostic ofbrain death and he was pronounced dead 24 hours later.Pre-mortem blood concentrations of free morphine were480 ng/mL and cocaine 0.3 /H9262g/mL. Signi cant tracheal trauma was noted at autopsy. Case 116, 118, and 122. Four adult men spent the week- end working on an un nished house. The house was heated with a kerosene space heater and a gasoline-powered gen-erator, both of which were indoors. When one workerawakenedbrie flyonSaturdaymorning,hereceivednoreply from his co-workers and fell asleep again. Other workersreturned to the house on Monday morning and found himcomatose; the three co-workers were dead. High carbon monoxide concentrations were found in the building and autopsies were consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning. Case 137. A 39-year-old man apparently overdosed on a number of his own medications (including citalopram , diazepam , and diphenhydramine) with vodka. He was ex- posed to carbon monoxide when he closed himself in a closet and lit lighter fluid soaked charcoal briquettes. He was found sometime within the next 24 hours, unrespon-sive, with burns on his feet. In the ED he was intubated andventilated with 100% oxygen. Activated charcoal was notadministered because there were no audible bowel sounds.Onadmissionhisvitalsignswere:heartrate,130beats/min;blood pressure, 103/71 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 30-50breaths/min while on the ventilator; temperature, 38.5 \u00b0C. His urine output was poor, and he continued to be acidotic.His carboxyhemoglobin at this time was 3%. Acetamino-phen, salicylate, methanol and ethylene glycol concentra-tionswereallnegative.By6hoursafteradmission,hisheartrate and blood pressure were labile. A chest x-ray showedARDS and he went into renal failure. He remained unre-sponsive and developed EKG changes consistent with anacute myocardial infarction. An EEG and MRI of the brainshowed a large area of anoxic injury consistent with carbonmonoxide. Support was withdrawn and he died on the 10thhospital day. Case 156. A 39-year old man complained of respiratory distress to a coworker and died before EMS arrived. At thetime he was working in an enclosed space that was next toachlorinestorageareawheretherewasa chlorinegas leak. Postmortem autopsy showed pulmonary congestion andedema. Cases159and160. Twomen,ages35-and36-years-old, were exposed to hydrogen sul dein a workplace accident. One patient was pronounced dead at the scene. The otherhad a respiratory arrest and was intubated by paramedicsand taken to the ED. An initial arterial blood gas revealed apH of 6.1. He received sodium bicarbonate, sodium nitriteand intensive care. He developed bilateral pulmonary in l- trates,becameunstableanddiedonthesecondhospitalday. Cases 161 and 162. Three men were found unconscious at the workplace in a hole thought to contain methane. One man, age 35, received CPR and could not be resuscitated. Asecond man, age 33, was declared dead at the scene. Thethird man survived. Case 163. A 42-year-old man was found dead in his hog lot. Death was thought to be due to either methane or hydrogen sul de. Autopsy did not nd any other cause for his death. Case 165. A 25-year-old man was found unresponsive, with emesis on his shirt, in a vat of powdered sodium bisuldeat a pork processing plant. He was transported to anearbyEDincardiacarrestanddeclareddeadshortlyafterarrival. Autopsy was consistent with hyperemia of the air-way mucosa and severe pulmonary congestion. Sul de con- centrations obtained on postmortem aortic blood were lessthan 0.5 mg/L. Case 170. A 38-year-old homeless man returned to the EDwithworseningshortnessofbreathseveraldaysafteranevaluation at the same ED for the same complaint. Whileworking in a tent, he scavenged metals ( silver) then added boraxand heat to make jewelry. The patient had hypoxia396 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 22, Number 5 ISeptember 2004and tachypnea, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema was visible on chest x-ray. His condition worsened, and he diedwithin 48 hours of admission. Case 171. A 13-year-old boy intentionally inhaled bu- tane. He became short of breath, then sustained a cardiac arrest. EMTs performed CPR, but the patient could not beresuscitated. Case 172. A 16-year-old boy was found unconscious at work after lling a cooler with a chlorofluorocarbon . The patient was brought to the ED via ambulance in asystolewith CPR in progress. He had apparently vomited duringtransport. The patient was intubated and given epinephrine.A pulse returned after cardioversion. He remained unre-sponsive. The patient was admitted to the ICU where hedied less than 11 hours post exposure. Case 173. A 24-year-old man was found in cardiopul- monary arrest in the bathroom. EMS reported a strongchemicalodorintheroom.Thepatienthadbeenhuf ngthe contents of a computer keyboard duster (chloro fluoro- carbon). Resuscitation efforts by EMS and ED staff were unsuccessful. Postmortem toxicology results showed1,1,1,2-tetra fluoroethane in a sample of tracheal chlorpheniramine huf ng. Case 175. An 18-year-old woman with a history of vol- atile substance abuse was found unresponsive and apneicwith an open gasoline container inside a car. She had last been seen 5 hours previously. The patient had 2nd and 3rddegree burns on her face and upper torso, which werebelieved to be due to smoking a cigarette while huf ng the gasoline. She was resuscitated in the ED and was reportedto have'minimal'carboxyhemoglobin concentrations. She did not regain consciousness and developed signs of cere-bral herniation. Life support measures were discontinued. Case 177. A 43-year-old man was unintentionally splashed in the face with approximately 10 gallons of gas- olinewhileatwork.Hewentintoarestroomtowashupand wasfoundtheretwohourslaterobtundedandslumpedover.On arrival at the ED the patient was speaking incoherentlywithamarkedrightsidedhemiparesis.Hewashypertensivewith blood pressure of 200/130 mm Hg and an oxygensaturation of 100%. A CT scan of the head showed no acutepathology. Over the next two days the patient continued toexperience worsening of the right-sided symptoms. He diedtwo days after the event. Case 179. An 11-month-old boy was found unresponsive in a barn after ingesting lamp oil. He was intubated upon arrival at the ED. A chest x-ray showed changes felt to beconsistent with hydrocarbon aspiration pneumonitis. Hewas transferred to a pediatric tertiary care hospital andadmittedtothePICU,wherehissystolicbloodpressurewas60-80 mm Hg; heart rate, 130-140 beats/min; and temper-ature, 38.3 blood 7.13; Oxygen saturation 100% oxygen bilateralpleural effusions and a possible pneumomediastinum. Hisstatusgraduallydeterioratedinspiteofmultiplechesttubes,high positive end-expiratory pressure, vasopressors, and trials on an oscillating ventilator. He died 8 days afterpresentation. Case 180. A 47-year-old man with a history of alcohol- ism was reportedly drinking lamp oil over a 2-day period. Hehadvomitinganddiarrhea,butnopulmonarysymptoms,and declined advice to be seen in an ED. Thirty-three hourslater the man was brought to the ED after having suffered acardiac arrest. Family members stated that the patient hadbeenlling his ice cube trays with lamp oil. The patient had bilateral aspiration pneumonia. He never awakened anddied on hospital day 3 with progressive respiratory failure. Case 182. A 22-year-old autistic man drank an unknown amount of paint thinner from an open container. He vom- ited shortly after the ingestion and became lethargic, withdusky skin. EMS transported the patient to the ED. In theED the patient had tachypnea and tachycardia and vomitedmaterial with a hydrocarbon odor. The patient was sedated,paralyzed, intubated and mechanically ventilated. Activatedcharcoal and 250 mL of whole bowel irrigation fluids were given by nasogastric tube. Chest x-ray revealed bilateralinltrates in all lobes. He was admitted to an ICU where he extubatedhimself.Tachycardiaandtachypneapersisted.Hewas not re-intubated and his nasogastric tube was removed.Shortly thereafter the patient vomited again with activatedcharcoal and food noted in the emesis. It was believed thathe aspirated again at this time. The patient was re-intubatedand sedated. He was febrile at 39.5 \u00b0C and antibiotics were given. The patient 's condition remained unchanged for about 9 days and he died. Case189. A28-year-oldmanwasbroughttotheEDafter intentionally ingesting aluminum phosphide pellets. He had been given milk to drink prior to his arrival. He waspale and obtunded with shallow breathing. His initial vitalsigns were: blood pressure, 154/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 77beats/min; and respiratory rate, 30 breaths/min. The patientdeveloped hypotension and pulmonary edema and diedwithin an hour of arrival at the ED. Case 190. A 42-year-old man suffering from depression ingested3tabletsofapesticidecontaining aluminumphos- phide. He presented to the ED 90 minutes later, profusely diaphoretic, vomiting and hypotensive (78/25 mm Hg) witha heart rate of 82 beats/min. The patient was intubated,ventilated and given dopamine, dobutamine, and aggressivefluid resuscitation. Gastric lavage was performed with care to capture gastric fluid into a closed system. An EKG was consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. Pulmonaryedema developed, and death occurred approximately 6hours after ingestion. Case 191. A 4-month-old boy was fed 60 to 120 mL of formula reconstituted with spring water stored in a clearplastic jug provided by the cookout host. Within 10 minuteshe experienced vomiting and diarrhea and was taken to ahealthcare facility 45 minutes away. The bottle in which thewater had been stored was retrieved. A paper label aroundthe jug handle identi ed anarsenical herbicide (23.1% arsenic).Thepatientwastransferredtoatertiarycarecenterwhere resuscitated. British Anti-Lewisite chelation was ad- ministered 7 hours after ingestion and every 4 hours there-after. By 10 hours after ingestion the patient had a pro-longed QTc interval which degenerated into torsades de397 WATSON ventricular tachydysrhyth- underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitationand was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO). He had been anuric since the ingestion and hadxedanddilatedpupilsuntilonehourafterECMOwhenhe produced107mLofurineanddisplayedsluggishlyreactivepupils and some spontaneous nonpurposeful movement.Three hours after being placed on ECMO he was againanuric, with xed and dilated pupils. Dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) was intravenously and hemodialyzed andstarted on ventricular tachydys-rhythmias refractive to medical therapy and cardioversion.At 36 hours following the ingestion supportive measureswere withdrawn and the patient died. Laboratory testingconrmed the spring water contained arsenic at 7.6% by weight. Case 193. A 3-year-old girl mixed unknown amounts of chlorophenoxy andglyphosate herbicides andcarbaryl and pyrethroid insecticides found outdoors to make a \"po- tion\"and drank it. She became diaphoretic, agitated and short of breath at home and was transported to the hospitalbyprivatevehicle.Enrouteshehadarespiratoryarrest.Shewas resuscitated from a cardiac arrest in the ED with epi-nephrine and was intubated. In the ICU she had miosis,diaphoresis, fasciculations, myoclonic phe-nobarbital. Pulmonary edema was noted on chest radio-graph. Plasma and red blood cell cholinesterases were nor-mal. She developed progressive cerebral edema and braindeath. Organs were harvested for donation. Case 194. A 29-year-old man deliberately ingested 240 mL of a 37.3% solution of diquat. The patient worked for a landscape business from which he had purloined thediquat. On presentation at the ED 3 hours later, he was alertand moaning in pain, largely from his abdomen. Within 12hours, he was comatose and having constant seizures. Hedied 25 hours after ingestion in multi-system organ failure.A premorbid concentration was 7,997 and plasma, 19 /H9262g/mL. Case 196. A 45-year-old woman was brought to the ED after drinking approximately 240 mL of glyphosate con- centrate (18% glyphosate isopropylamine). On arrival shewas confused, lethargic and vomiting. Her vital signs were:blood pressure, 90/palp mm Hg; heart rate, 80 beats/min;temperature, 36.7 Dopamine and norepinephrine main- tained the patient 's systolic blood pressure between 70 and 90 mm Hg. Over the next 24 hours she developed pulmo-nary edema, could not be adequately ventilated, and died. Case 199. A 49-year-old man in his barn reached for his coffee cup and took a sip. He had forgotten that he had justpoured a paraquat herbicide into his cup because the her- bicide bottle was deteriorating. He arrived at an ED 30minutes later vomiting, cold and diaphoretic. Initial vitalsigns, laboratory work and oxygen saturations in the EDwere normal. The patient was given 100 grams of activatedcharcoal;gastriclavagewasperformedandwasfollowedbya second 100 gram dose of activated charcoal. The follow-ing morning the patient was awake and alert. He had somenauseathatwasresponsivetoantiemetictherapy.Hismouth showed some erythema but no obvious burns. He had nopulmonary symptoms and a urine output of 1,800 mL over22 hours. BUN and creatinine were 19 mg/dL and 3.0mg/dL, respectively. AST was 100 U/L. Later that day hereceived a dose of morphine for esophageal pain but wastolerating oral fluids. Between 24 and 48 hours after inges- tion,aplasmaparaquatconcentrationwas0.915 /H9262g/mLand urine paraquat was 13.16 /H9262g/mL. On the morning of the thirddaythepatientwasawakeandalert.Hecomplainedofa headache, but no abdominal or chest pain. BUN andcreatininewere40mg/dLand6.5mg/dL,respectively.ASTand ALT were 378 U/L and 308 U/L, respectively. Bynightfall hemodialysis was initiated. Oxygen saturationswere in the mid 90 's on room air. On the morning of the fourth day he was placed on oxygen, 2 liters by nasalcannula, secondary to oxygen saturations in the 80 's. That eveninghewasintubated.Diffuseinterstitialin ltrateswere now seen on chest x-ray. Aggressive supportive care wascontinued. The patient died on the 10 thhospital day. Case 214. A 7-year-old girl had been well, except for some cold symptoms for which she was taking non-pre-scriptionmedications.Shewasfoundunresponsiveandfacedown in her bed at home with vomitus and blood on herface. EMS was called and on arrival the child was in fullarrest. Intubation was attempted twice without success; thechild's airway and oropharnyx were edematous and full of blood. A water bottle found under her pillow contained amilky white liquid which contained 42.5% permethrin and 45%xylene. Postmortem examination was consistent with pulmonary aspiration and hemorrhage. The ratio of per-methrintoxylenewassimilarbetweenherstomachcontentsand the liquid in the water bottle. Traces of permethrin,xylene and ethylbenzene were detected in heart blood andlivertissue.Theurinehaddetectableamountsofxyleneandethylbenzene metabolites. Case 216. A 46-year-old man with a history of kidney stones presented to the ED with hematuria and complaintsof nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and headache. Initiallythe symptoms were attributed to a kidney stone. A PT wasreported as greater than 100 s. Fresh frozen plasma wasadministeredandthePTreturnedtonormal.Thepatientwasadmitted for observation and the next day the PT rose againand the patient suffered a global intracranial bleed. Thepatient died the following day. There was no known historyofingestionatthetime.Blooddrawnonthesecondhospitalday was assayed for brodifacoum . A concentration of 180 ng/mL was reported 2 weeks after the patient 's death. Case 218. A 34-year-old man was at his own birthday party and drank a bottle of absinthand some ethanol.H e arrived in the ED tachypneic and rapidly developed comaand respiratory failure. He was intubated and started on IVfluids and a vasopressor. He vomited and aspirated acti- vated charcoal before being intubated. Serum glucose was 300 mg/dL; AST and ALT, normal; and creatine kinase, 3,000U/L. hours after the exposure, he had a severeaspiration pneumonia and was febrile and restless with aweak cough re flex. He was hypertensive and was getting sodium bicarbonate for acidosis. Liver function tests were:AST, 510 U/L; ALT, 352 U/L; total bilirubin, 0.4 mg/dL.Ontheseconddayafteradmission,themanwasmorestable398 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 22, Number 5 ISeptember 2004with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg and no further acidosis. Liver functions improved and he remained febrilewith positive blood cultures. He was extubated on the thirddayafteradmissionandimprovedslowlyoverthefollowing4 days. On the eighth day after admission, he became shortof breath and his oxygen saturation dropped to 80%. A V-Qscan indicated a high probability of a pulmonary embolism.He had increasing shortness of breath and decreasing oxy-gen saturation and died that evening. Case 219. A 61-year-old chemist reportedly injected a solution of crushed castor beans ( Ricinus communis )and acetoneinto an antecubital vein. This unwitnessed event occurred one day before he presented to the ED. Uponpresentation he was asymptomatic except for an apparentinfection at the injection site. Several hours later he devel-oped vomiting, bloody diarrhea, acidosis, hypoglycemia,renal failure, hypotension and a decreasing level of con-sciousness. The patient was treated symptomatically, grad-ually worsened and died about 12 hours after presentation. Case 221. A 24-year-old man with a previous history of psychiatric disease was found hallucinating by his parents.He was counseled by their pastor and remained at home.The following morning the mother entered the patient 's bedroom and smelled a garlic-like odor. A 60 mL bottle ofgun bluing (selenium) was found in the room with approx- imately 5 mL remaining. The patient vomited several times.EMS was called. Upon arrival in the ED the patient wasagitated and hallucinating. His vitals signs were: bloodpressure, 113/64 mm Hg; and heart rate, 114 beats/min.Over the next 3 hours the patient continued to vomit. Hismental status alternated between \"talking out of his head \" and quiet behavior. Approximately 4 hours post ingestionthe patient suddenly became combative. During an attemptto restrain the patient, he became dusky and then went intocardiac arrest. Resuscitation, including a pacemaker, wasunsuccessful.BlooddrawnatthetimeofEDarrivalshowedaseleniumconcentrationof30 /H9262g/mL.Apostmortemblood sample measured 13 /H9262g/mL.

Autopsy revealed erosionoftheesophagusandgastrichemorrhagewithtintedgastric contents. Case 225. A 22-month-old, 12 kg boy was reportedly given 1.5 teaspoonfuls of an infant liquid acetaminophen product every 4 hours for 26 hours for a viral illness. Thechild then became lethargic and began vomiting. The childwas reevaluated on day 3 with the following laboratoryvalues: AST, 30,000 U/L; ALT, 14,000 U/L; INR, 14.4;ammonia elevated. An abdominal ultrasound showed anenlarged liver. The child was admitted to the PICU andbegun on intravenous N-acetylcysteine. The following daythe child was transferred to a liver transplantation centerwhereplasmapheresiswasperformed.Thechilddiedonday6 before transplantation could be done. Case 226. A 4-year-old boy presented to the ED with emesis. He had elevated liver function tests and an acet- aminophen concentration of 29 /H9262g/mL. The exposure was believed to have occurred more than 24 hours prior topresentation when the child was found playing in the med-icine cabinet. N-acetylcysteine was started soon after pre-sentation, however the child 's condition steadily worsened.He was taken for liver transplantation on the third hospital day, but died before transplantation was completed.

Autopsy revealed pulmonaryedema, thick secretions occluding the trachea and bronchi,and cerebral edema. heart blood had an oxy-codone concentration of 200 ng/mL. The medical examinerattributed death to respiratory arrest from opiate intoxica-tion. Case 443. A 37-year-old morbidly obese woman, with a known psychiatric and drug abuse history, called the rescuesquad because of shortness of breath. She had been seen inan ED 5 days prior with the same complaint and had a urinedrug screen positive for cocaine. On the day of admissionshe was found to be hypotensive at her home and was givenafluidbolusenroutetotheED.Shedeniedchestpain,fever and chills, but admitted to cocaine use. Her medicationswere glyburide, metformin and risperidone. In the ED shewas hyperventilating. Her initial laboratory studies showeda creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. While she was in the ED hersalicylate concentration was reported as 98 mg/dL, and activated charcoal was started and IV hydration ordered. Arepeat serum salicylate concentration was 85 mg/dL salicylate concentration was 6248 mg/L, so intrave-nous hydration was continued.

A 38-year-old woman injected the contents of onefentanylpatch .Cardiopulmonaryarrestoccurredwhile en route to the ED. She initially revived with CPR andnaloxone. Aggressive supportive care with naloxone con-tinuous infusion and adrenergic agents was instituted. Herpupils became xed and dilated on hospital day two and the patient was pronounced dead on hospital day three. Bloodfrom the day of admission showed fentanyl, 3 ng/mL; andnorfentanyl, 6 ng/mL. Case 489. A 39-year-old woman was found by family members at home apneic and unresponsive. EMS personnelintubated the patient and transported her to the nearest ED.She was noted to have 2 mm pupils; blood pressure, 150/90mm Hg; and heart rate, 90 to 100 beats/min. She wasposturing upon presentation in the ED. Six milligrams ofnaloxone were given with no response. A toxicology for tricyclic antidepressants ( amitriptyline ) and benzodiazepines. Blood alcohol, salicylate, and acet-aminophen were negative. The next day family memberstold the ED staff that the patient had probably injected thegel from a fentanyl patch . Despite aggressive supportive care, the patient 's condition continued to deteriorate, and she expired 6 days after the exposure. Case 500. A 50-year-old man, with a history of intrave- nous drug usage, was seen for a headache and received aninjection of intramuscular ketorolac in the left buttock. The following day the patient noticed some swelling and pain atthe injection site. Two days after the injection a physiciannoted possible cellulitis. The patient declined hospital ad-mission and was treated at home with antibiotics and pred-nisone. The symptoms continued to worsen, and by dayfour, the patient sought treatment at an ED. A diagnosis ofnecrotizing fasciitis was entertained and a CT scan wasobtained. The CT revealed extensive edema involving thesubcutaneous fat of the left buttock, extending anteriorlyand down the proximal left thigh. There was no air presentwithin the soft tissue and no evidence of gangrene. Thepatient was afebrile and complained of increasing nauseaand vomiting over the prior 48 hours. The area was aspi-rated with no pus. A Gram stain of the fluid revealed no organisms, and some white cells. Diphenhydramine andsteroids were initiated for a possible allergic reaction. Theswelling did not improve and pain increased. The patientwastransportedtoatraumacenterfordebridement;enroutehe became hypotensive, requiring vasopressors and intuba-tion. He developed bradycardia, hypoxia and had a cardiacarrest. He was resuscitated, arrested again, and could not berevived. At autopsy, a section of soft tissue from the leftbuttock showed hemorrhage, necrosis and acute in flamma- tion within subcutaneous adipose tissue. The fasciitis due to an intramuscular druginjection followed by cellulitis. Case 541.

She unintentionally received a 450 mg bolusinjection of morphine intrathecally. The dose intended forthepumpreservoirwasinsteadinjectedintotheaccessport.She developed tachycardia and complained of leg pain, butremained awake and appeared to be breathing normally.Acidosis (pH 7.1) and hypotension followed. Myoclonicjerking was treated initially with benzodiazepines followedby neuromuscular blockade. Her hypotension initially re-sponded to fluids and vasopressor support, but subsequently recurred, and about 12 hours post injection she developedventricular brillation and could not be resuscitated. Case 569. A 2-year-old boy was brought to the ED unresponsive.Thechildhadreportedlybeensleepywhenhereturnedfromhisgrandmother 'shousethenightbefore.The patient had cutaneous burn injuries to the head and extrem-ities. A drug ingestion was suspected, and a urine drugscreen was positive for opiates. An acetaminophen concen-tration was 9 /H9262g/mL. Quantitative analysis of the urine revealed an oxycodone concentration of 3.66 /H9262g/mL. The patient was intubated, transferred to a children 's hospital, and declared brain dead two days later. Case 601. A 2-year-old girl was prescribed viscous lido- cainefor oral ulcers 2 days prior to presentation. The child ingested a total of 100 mL over a two day period, with atleast 50 mL on the evening of presentation. The patientarrested at home and was taken to a local ED where CPRrestored a perfusing rhythm. The child was transferred to achildren's hospital where she had xed and dilated pupils, intermittent seizure-like activity and absent brainstem re-flexes. The patient became hypotensive, bradycardia devel- oped, and she died one day later. Case 602. An 87-year-old man with a history of MI, CVA, and subarachnoid hemorrhage inadvertently received50 mL of lidocaine 4% topical solution orally, instead of a smaller dose by nebulizer prior to a scheduled bronchos-copy. The error was unrecognized until the patient becameobtunded and had a respiratory arrest during the procedure.The patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator, butdied shortly thereafter. Case 609. A 5-year-old, developmentally-delayed girl ingested an unknown amount of her carbamazepine , pre- scribed for a seizure disorder related to congenital hydro-cephalus. She presented unresponsive at the ED, where shewas intubated and admitted to the ICU. The initial carbam-azepine concentration was 52 /H9262g/mL. She appeared to be improving 24 hours later, and her carbamazepine concen-trationhaddecreasedto14.5 /H9262g/mL.However,thenextday she suffered an undisclosed severe neurological event andcoded. Cardiac output was severely compromised and shedeveloped refractory hypotension. Pupils were non-reactiveand gag re flex was absent. A perfusion scan indicated brain death on the fourth day and ventilator support was stopped. Case 750. A 3-month-old boy was found unresponsive afterhisafternoonnapatadaycarefacilityandcouldnotberesuscitated. Postmortem diphenhydramine concentrations were: blood, 6 /H9262g/mL; and 3 /H9262g/mL. Case767. A60-year-oldwomanpresentedtothehospital with a wide complex dysrhythmia and profound hypoten-sion following a cardiac arrest. She reportedly had ingestedhydroxychloroquine andmethotrexate .Shewasintubated and epinephrine was administered for blood pressure sup-port. Treatment for the methotrexate overdose included urine alkalinization and leucovorin. Despite management ofthe hypotension with multiple vasopressors the patient diedthe following morning. Case 768. A 38-year-old man presented to the ED after a reportedly unintentional injection of 10 to 15 mL of tilmi- cosin, a veterinary macrolide antibiotic. The patient pre- sented with cyanosis and was screaming about chest andbackpain.Hewassedated,thensufferedacardiopulmonaryarrest. Case 769. A man in his 50 's was found dead in the driver's seat of a pick-up truck. A suicide note, a syringe and needle, and an empty 300 mL bottle of tilmicosin ,a veterinary antibiotic, were found next to him. He had lastbeen seen alive about an hour prior to being found. Case 772. A 75-year-old man was mistakenly adminis- tered 2 mL of subcutaneous epinephrine instead of 0.2 mL at his doctor 'so fce after being stung by approximately 25 bees. Within 30 minutes he began complaining of dif culty breathing and chest tightness, and soon afterward suffered acardiac arrest. No hypotension or shortness of breath oc-curredpriortotheadministrationofepinephrine.Accordingto the treating doctor, epinephrine was given prophylacti-cally, along with diphenhydramine and dexamethasone, be-cause of the number of stings. The patient was resuscitated,but remained unresponsive. He was intubated and venti-lated, started on amiodarone, lidocaine, norepinephrine andnormal admitted to the ICU. An EEG on thefourth hospital day showed minimal brain activity and hewas removed from the ventilator. He died the next day. Case 815. A 45-year-old man was found unresponsive at home. EMS was summoned and empty bottles of diltiazem andamitriptyline were found near the patient. His initial pulse was 50 beats/min and his blood pressure was 50/palpablemmHgwithawideQRSintervalonECG.Hewastreated with intubation, sodium bicarbonate, calcium glu-conate, glucagon, IV fluids, dopamine and norepinephrine. By the next day he was extubated and off all vasoactivemedications. The morning after extubation (two days post-overdose) the patient was sitting in a chair in the ICU, saidhe had to belch, then had a catastrophic event leading topulseless electrical activity and death, despite resuscitativeefforts. Although the sequence of these events was unclear,the patient had a seizure and vomited a large quantity ofgastric contents. He was dif cult to move, given his large size. Once in bed, a large amount of vomitus, includingactivated charcoal , poured from his mouth. Autopsy, lim- ited to the stomach, found dried blood and activated char-coal. Aspiration was believed to be a major contributor tohis death. Case 866. A 3-year-old, 11.4 kg boy was found dead in bed after receiving 4 doses of a cough and cold productcontaining chlorpheniramine/hydrocodone . He had re- ceived 5 mL of the product every 12 hours. Autopsy dem-onstrated cerebral edema and no evidence of pulmonaryaspiration. Postmortem blood analysis showed a hydro-codoneconcentrationof150ng/mLandachlorpheniramineconcentration of 0.4 /H9262g/mL. Case 867. A 3-year-old girl was found at home playing with bottles of a children 's cough and cold medicine con- tainingchlorpheniramine/hydrocodone and children 's ibuprofen .Onehourlatershefellasleep.Approximately11402 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 22, Number 5 ISeptember 2004hours later she was found cyanotic and unarousable by her family and brought to the ED. She was given intravenousnaloxone without response and intubated. Her initial bloodpressure was 120/70 mm Hg, and heart rate, 140 beats/min.An arterial blood gas revealed the pH was 7.2. Her pCO 2 was reported as normal, and serum bicarbonate was 10mEq/L.HeadCTshowedcerebralandbrainsteminfarctionsand uncal herniation. She remained unresponsive and wasdeclared brain dead. Case 873. A 2-year-old girl was found in the evening lying dead in her vomitus. Earlier in the day, she had beenat her grandmother 's house and was well. The child was sleepy after dinner at her parents 'house and went to sleep. She awoke a few hours later screaming, agitated and hallu-cinating. She went back to sleep but later awoke again withthe same behaviors. A few hours after that, she was foundunresponsive. EMS was summoned, and resuscitation at-tempts had very high concentrations of both diphen-hydramine and phenylpropanolamine. The presumed sourceof the medication was different products that had beenremoved from their original packaging and placed in anon-child-resistant bottle. Case 877. A 30-year-old man died in a health club. At autopsy he was found to have an 85% lesion of his leftanterior descending coronary artery and a length of isch-emic bowel. Toxicology screening was positive for ephe- dra alkaloids . The gym where he died reportedly sold shakes containing ephedra. Case 878. A 19-year-old man was brought to the ED in asystolic cardiac arrest. The patient 's friends admitted that he had been taking a body-building drug containing ma huang,guarana,L-carnitine , and other ingredients. The patient was treated with epinephrine, sodium bicarbonate,atropine and cardioversion, but could not be resuscitated. Case 884. A 52-year-old man experienced multiple sei- zures after a suspected ingestion of baking soda ( sodium bicarbonate ) for unknown reasons. He was reported to have a metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia. Before hecouldbetransportedbyhelicoptertoatertiarycarehospital,he died. EMTs found 2 empty boxes of baking soda at thescene. Blood toxicology was positive only for acetone,1,300 mg/L (normal, 0-1,000 mg/L); and mEq/L); and acetone, 1,340 mg/L. Case 885. A 4-year-old boy was found with an open bottle of valdecoxib 10 mg tablets that belonged to his grandmother. When his father asked him how many he hadeaten, the child replied that he had eaten three. The fatherthen administered a mixture of saltand milk to the child in order to induce emesis. The child did vomit with \"white clumps\"noted in the emesis. It is unknown how much time elapsed between the administration of the salt and the onsetof vomiting. About 3.5 hours post ingestion, the child wasfound to be less responsive than normal with perioral cya-nosis. He was transported to an ED by EMS. By 5 hoursafter ingestion the child was acidotic (pH 6.9) and in statusepilepticus. Diazepam 10 mg and phenobarbital 250 mgsuccessfully treated the seizure activity and the child wasintubated. A urine drug screen was negative, as were acet-aminophen and salicylate assays. The serum sodium was 197 mEq/L. The child continued to exhibit seizure activitycontrolled with additional diazepam, phenobarbital and mi-dazolam. A CT scan done approximately 12 hours after theinitial ingestion showed evidence of brainstem herniation.The child remained comatose. Support was withdrawn onthe third hospital day, and he died. Case 887. A 20-month-old, 7.3 kg boy with a history of renal disease (one dystrophic kidney and one kidney withobstructive nephropathy) associated with prune belly syn-drome was scheduled for corrective surgery for an unde-scended testis. He was inadvertently administered 60 mL ofamonobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate solution as a bowel evacuant. The child rapidly developed severe hy-perphosphatemia and hypocalcemia resulting in cardiacdysrhythmias requiring resuscitation twice within the rst hour.Laboratoryresultswere:ionizedcalcium,0.39mg/dL;phosphate, 101 mg/dL; pH, 6.93; anion gap, 17 mEq/L.Attempts to salts, oralaluminum hydroxide, and hemodialysis. Despite aggressivemanagement and supportive care, the child died within 4hours of the exposure. Case 893. A 58-year-old man arrived at the ED 2 to 3 hours after ingesting 100 tablets of metformin . The patient appeared ill and had a blood pressure of 82/46 mm airway protection, given a single dose ofactivated charcoal, started on intravenous fluids with so- dium bicarbonate added and admitted to the ICU. Thepatient's clinical condition continued to decline, and the decision was made to begin hemodialysis. Multiple vaso-pressors failed to maintain a blood pressure adequate forhemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemo ltration. The patient had multiple cardiac arrests over the next fewhours and ultimately could not be resuscitated. Case 897. A 66-year-old woman receiving chronic red blood cell transfusions injected herself intravenously with2,000 mg of deferoxamine in a suspected suicide attempt. Within minutes she became unresponsive. EMS reportedsevere hypotension and apnea. ED resuscitation includedintubation, intravenous fluids, and triple vasopressors. The patient had a temporary improvement in her blood pressure,which enabled helicopter transfer to a tertiary care facility.However, recurrent and overwhelming hypotension, despitenumerous interventions, did not permit the initiation ofdialysis or hemo ltration. The patient died 12 hours after the injection. Case 898. A 39-year-old man presented in fulminant liverfailurewithencephalopathy,jaundiceandrenalfailure.He had begun taking court-ordered disulram3 weeks prior to Laboratory values INR, 6.43. Treatment with intravenousN-acetylcysteine was begun based on the presence of acet-aminophen. The patient developed worsening coagulopathyandwastreatedwithcryoprecipitate,vitaminK1,andfactorVII. Continuous veno-venous hemo ltration was started and liver transplant was considered. Intracranial bolt mon-itoring revealed elevated intracranial pressures. A liver bi-403 WATSON ET AL I2003 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORTopsy was consistent with fulminant hepatitis. The patient did not respond to aggressive supportive care and died. Case 958. A 12-year-old, 30 kg girl was admitted to the PICU with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. She had a pastmedical history of developmental delay and a dilated car-diomyopathy treated with atenolol. On the rst hospital day she had an altered mental status and an emergency intracra-nial pressure monitor was placed in a bedside procedure.The patient received propofol at 15 mL/hour (150 mg/hour)and sedation and both through angiographic evaluation and surgical clippingof an aneurysm. After an uncomplicated intracranial proce-dure the patient was maintained on a propofol infusion for sedation and developed an acute metabolic acidosis. blood gas showed: pH of 7.39; g the propofol was discontinued.The patient was then placed on broad-spectrum antibioticsto cover possible sepsis in the presence of a lactic acidosisand transient elevation in temperature noted in the recoveryroom. Upon arrival in the PICU the patient had a persistentlacticacidosis.Forthenext24hours,thepatient 'sacid-base status and cardiovascular status worsened and requiredtreatment with dopamine and norepi-nephrine. A transthoracic with an ejection fraction of lessthan 23%. The patient died 24 hours after the last propofoldose. Her cultures were negative, and an autopsy was re-fused. Case 975. A 20-year-old man with a history of previous suicide attempts was found in cardiac arrest. Syringes andfeline leukemia vaccine vials were found with the patient. Heworkedataveterinaryclinic.Othermedicationsmissingfrom the clinic were ketamine and barbiturates. CPR in the eld returned a pulse. Upon arrival at the ED he was intubated, lavaged (no pill fragments visible) and givenactivated charcoal and sodium bicarbonate. Initial clinicallaboratory values included a glucose of 232 mg/dl and anegativeurinedrugscreen.Vitalsignswere:bloodpressure,141/69mmHg;heartrate122beats/min.ACTscanshowedno cerebral edema. The patient remained comatose. Hisclinical status deteriorated, and he died. Case 1087 and 1093. Two 18- and 23-year-old comatose men were brought to the ED from a New Year 's Eve rave party. They had core temperatures of 44.4 and 42.4 \u00b0C, respectively, and were hyperkalemic. Three other patientswere brought to the ED from the same rave, one of themwith severe hyperthermia. Methylenedioxymethamphet- amine (MDMA) use was suspected. Both patients were paralyzed, intubated and treated with lorazepam. Both pa-tients had a urine drug screen positive for amphetaminesand THC; the second patient was also positive for cocaine.Both patients died within 24 hours. Case 1100. A 73-year-old man ingested 30 to 60 mL of tincture of iodinein a suicide attempt. In the ICU he was comatose but did not require respiratory support. His bloodpressure was 139/90 mm Hg. An arterial blood gas showedapHof7.08,andasodiumbicarbonateinfusionwasstarted.Salicylates, acetaminophen and ethanol were not detected.Six hours later he remained unresponsive to pain. He main-tained his respirations o n 2 L oxygen by nasal cannula with O 2saturations in the high 90 's. Endoscopy was recom - mended but not performed. Vital signs were: blood pres-sure,139/71mmHg;heartrate,119beats/min;temperature,36.8\u00b0C; respiratory rate, 13 breaths/min. Seven hours later there was no change in his clinical picture. He died within9 hours of presentation.404 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE IVolume 22, Number 5 ISeptember 2004 "}
