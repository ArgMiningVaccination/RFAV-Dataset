SCOTT TILLETT1 I. INTRODUCTION In 2004, the FDA conducted a study investigating suicidal behavior in pediatric patients who were given Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors2 (SSRIs).3 The study consisted of a thorough review of published and u n- published controlled clinical trials of antidepressants, and involved nearly 4,400 children and adolescents .4 The results of th e study suggested that su i- cidal behavior and ideation was twice as likely in children with Major D e- pressive Disorder (MDD) who were prescribed off -label SSRIs.5 Though the results were statistically insignificant, and thus could have occurred by chance alone, the increase \u2014from 2% in children who received placebos, to 4% in children taking SSRIs \u2014was a 100% increase, proportionally.6 Following the study, the FDA directed the manufacturers of all ant i- depressant medications to add a black box' warning th at describes the i n- creased risk of suicidality in children and adolescents given antidepressant medications and notes what uses the drug has been approved for in these 1 The author obtained a Bachelor of Science in Psychobiology from Chapman University in 2006 and a Juris Doctor from University of Southern California Law School in 2010 .

The FDA's black box warning is the most serious warning placed in the labeling of a prescription medication.7 Prescription medic a- tions with black box warnings also have advertising restrictions.8 Despite these warnings, medical doctors continue to prescribe SSRIs and other drugs to treat symptoms and populations not spe cifically listed on the manufacturers' labels \u2014i.e., to treat symptoms and populations for which the drug has not received FDA approval.9 Such off -label prescri b- ing is common among physicians; in fact, the American Academy of Pedi a- trics explicitly approve s off-label prescribing: [I]f based on reasonable medical evidence, if done in good faith in the best interests of the patient, and if done without fraudulent intent, an un- approved use of a drug requires only that the same judgment and pr u- dence be exercis ed in its use as are exercised in medical practice in ge n- eral for it to conform to accepted professional standards.10 In other words, in order to maintain a consistent standard of care, off -label prescribing has to have some scientific basis.11 The FDA regulates drug companies to ensure that drugs are safe and effective for use by the patient groups to which the drug company intends to market the drugs; however, the FDA does not regulate \u2014or monitor \u2014 doctors.12 Once a drug is approved for use by one popul ation, or as therapy for a particular ailment, doctors can vary the conditions of use from those approved in the package insert . . . .13 This practice sidesteps the FDA's safety and efficacy goals and can present risks for patient groups for whom 7 Id. 8 Press Release, U.S. Food & Drug Admin., FDA Launches a Multi -Pronged Strategy to Stren g- then Safeguards for Children Treated with Antidepressant Medications (Oct. 15, 2004), available at http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/ Newsroom/Press Announcements/2004/ucm108363.htm [hereina fter Press Release, FDA] (Advertisements that serve to remind health care professionals of a product's availability (so -called reminder ads') are not allowed for products with black box' warnings.) 9 Id. 10 Am.

Nonetheless, off -label prescribing is both widespread and seemingly the only effective means of treating children who require treatment by drugs that have been tested only on adult populations. It would be idea l if we could give children smaller doses of adult drugs based on weight differences and thereby eliminate the necessity for separate clinical trials, but children cannot be treated as if they are merely smaller versions of adult human beings.14 Children and adults differ physiologically: children do not metabolize drugs in the same way as adults and can experience unpredictable effects when treated with adult medic a- tions.15 In order to avoid dangerously high or inadequately low doses for children, doctor s must account for the individual's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, both of which are affected by developmental changes in the human body.16 Improper dosages could create long -term or even permanent developmental effects that are not experienced by adults using the same medications.17 This creates something of a double bind in the context of MDD and other conditions treated by SSRIs: existing prescri p- tion practices are uncertain and may cause significant harm, but the cond i- tion may cause significant harm without pharmacological treatment.18 Requiring drug companies to conduct clinical studies on children and obtain FDA approval for pediatric use before their drugs are prescribed to children could mitigate many of these potential problems. Drug compani es would likely resist this added expense, however, and such clinical studies on children would raise a number of complicated ethical issues. Another alternative is to continue to allow off -label practices, while also requiring doctors to collect data that will enable the FDA to decide which drugs are safe and which drugs merit further pediatric clinical trials. Using SSRIs as archetypal drugs that have been tested only on adults but are often used to treat children, this Note advocates, first and foremos t, 14 Carrie Fisher & Thomas G.

When pediatric clinical trials are financially infeasible, however, data collected from pr e- scribing SSRIs off -label to children and adolescents should be compiled, analyzed, and made available as a resource for practitioners, patients, and the FDA. Compelling drug manufacturers or doctors to cooperate in the process may be difficult. Reforming off -label prescribing p ractices as they apply to children involves constitutional, statutory, and public policy implications19 that may conflict with one another. Additionally, a remedial plan, if any is imposed, must consider the interests and perspectives of the parties i m- pacted by the new legal framework: children and parents want the best care available20 but do not want to shoulder the costs of clinical research ; doc- tors want access to the information necessary to make sound judgments and want the freedom to exercise discreti on in treating their patients; FDA - regulated drug companies want to earn profits and want an unobstructed path from their production laboratories to the prescription market; and the government wants to balance the interests of the parties affected by its l eg- islation, but also wants to promote its own interest in protecting social we l- fare by garnering information on new and existing prescription drugs. This Note proceeds as follows: Part II provides a basic explanation of the uses and potential side effect s of SSRIs as a point of reference to i n- form the discussion of the legal and policy issues discussed throughout the Note. Part III addresses Congress' constitutional authority to regulate do c- tors' practices, and attempts to preempt possible constitutional challenges to legislative efforts to issue regulations in this area. Part IV introduces the FDA's existing regulatory framework regarding approval and labeling of new and already -marketed drugs. This Part also addresses the perspectives of proponents and o pponents of the existing framework in order to give a clear picture of the competing interests these regulations concern. Part V addresses complications that arise in the application of the FDA's policies to pediatric studies and drug manufacturers. Part V I proposes several p o- tential improvements to the existing laws. This Part emphasizes the value 19 These perspectives necessarily overlap.

Part VII concludes. II. SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIS) SSRIs are a class of antidepressant drugs that block the reuptake of serotonin,21 a neurotransmitter associated with mood and behavior.22 SSRIs are used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), non - OCD -related anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and oth er be- havioral and cognitive disorders.23 This class of antidepressants includes drugs with recognizable names, such as Prozac, Paxil, Celexa, Zoloft, and Lexapro.24 Because most SSRIs are not approved for use by minors, use of SSRIs by this class of patients is, by definition, off -label.25 SSRIs have serious potential side effects in child populations. This class of drug can cause increased suicide ideation and suicide itself; this side effect is not limited to those children with MDD.26 SSRIs can also cause neurological changes; cognitive effects, such as increased agitation; and physical effects, such as tremors.27 Also, because the juvenile brain has greater plasticity than an adult brain, these harmful side effects may b e- come locked -in, rather than dissi pating as the child grows older.28 Absent a strong potential to substantially benefit children and a lack of safe and effective alternatives, even a small chance of permanent drug - induced symptoms or a minor increase in suicidal behavior and ideation in children is unacceptable. Thus, it is important to note the severity of the symptoms that SSRIs are being used to treat. For example, as the 2004 21 See Antidepressant Medications , supra note 3 . 22 See id. 23 Jeffrey A. Bridge et al., Clinical Res ponse and Risk for Reported Suicidal Ideation and Suicide Attempts in Pediatric Antidepressant Treatment: A Antidepressant Medications , supra note 3 . 25 See id. However, Prozac has been approved for treating children: Prozac is the only medic a- tion approved by the FDA for use in treating depression in children ages 8 and older.

Plasticity is the brain's capacity t o change. This concept is what enables young chi ldren to bounce back from injury. Id. 452 REVIEW OF LAW AND SOCIAL JUSTICE [Vol. 19:3 FDA study indicated, 2% of children with MDD experienced suicidal b e- havior and ide ation without taking SSRIs of f-label.29 In addition to suicide risks, individ uals with MDD often have difficulty functioning in school, at jobs, and in most basic activities necessary for subsistence.30 Some e x- tremely depressed patients are almost immobile.31 In a sense, these p a- tients ' lives as functioning persons are nearly gone; they are not dead, but they cannot e xperience normal lives as productive members of society.32 Accordingly, the goal when treating MDD is to restore normal functio n- ing.33 SSRIs have the potential to help se verely afflicted children to achieve this goal, but because hypotheses do not provide enough information about the risks and efficacy of SSRIs on pediatric patients, the estimated benefits of the medicine should be discounted by the likelihood that they co uld fail to achieve this goal of life -as-functionality. III. CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUM ENTS FOR AND AGAINST GOVERNMENTAL REGULAT ION OF OFF -LABEL PRESCRIBING PRACTICES Congress has authority, under the Commerce Clause, to prevent drugs it considers dangerous to the public from entering interstate commerce.34 Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution states that Congress shall have power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.35 Pursuant to this power, Congress enacted the Fede ral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to regulate the flow of drugs into interstate co m- merce. Section 505 of the FDCA provides that no person shall introduce a drug into interstate commerce without FDA approval based on clinical tr i- 29 See Antidepressant Medications , supra note 3 . 30 See, e.g., Boadie W.

With SSRI's, this could prevent children from experiencing any harmful, unexplored side effects of the drug, while still allowing adults to enjoy its proven therapeutic benefits. Today, regulation of the practice of medicine has been left to the e x- clusive realm of the individual states.48 However, this is not to say that Congress could not regulate some aspects of the practice of medicine if it wanted to. The United States District Court for the D istrict of Columbia noted that Congress's authority in this area is unsettled: It appears to be an open question as to whether the FDA could currently regulate this aspect of the practice of medicine [(off -label prescribing)] if it wished to do so.49 But more recently, in Gonzales v. Oregon , the Supreme Court stated that Congress has the power to regulate the practice of medicine if it chooses to do so .50 In that case, the State of Oregon, physicians, and a group of ill p a- 46 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 396. 47 See United Stat es v.

Id. at 333. Addressing the applicable timeline, the Supreme Court stat ed that a medication is held for sale in inte r- state commerce as long as it is available to consumers: [T]he language used by Congress broadly and unqualifiedly prohibits misbranding articles held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce, without regard to how long after the shipment the misbranding occurred, how many intrastate sales had inte r- vened, or who had received the articles at the end of the interstate shipm ent.

A. CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF CHILD PATIENTS Even if Congress has the authority to regulate off -label prescribing practices,56 it is possible that constitutional provisions might give children or their parents the right to o btain off -label drugs even in the face of a t- tempts by Congress to limit that right. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is one potential source of these children's rights. The Equal Protection Clause provides that [n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.57 The S u- preme Court has interpreted this clause as a limit on unfairly discriminatory government regulation.58 commerce, and may in some cases have been confused with that authority, the two are distinct. The regulation of an intrastate activity may be essential to a comprehensive regulation of interst ate co m- merce even though the intrastate activity does not itself substantially affect' interstate commerce. Moreover, as . . . [ United States v. Lopez ] suggests, Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce.) 51 Oregon , 546 U.S. at 252. 52 Id. at 254. 53 Id. 54 Id. at 271 (quoting Hillsborough County v.

In Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Mu r- gia,61 the Supreme Court specifically declined to extend heightened r eview to differential treatment based on old age: While the treatment of the aged in this Nation has not been wholly free of discrimination, such persons, unlike, say, those who hav e been di s- criminated against on the basis of race or national origin, have not exp e- rienced a history of purposeful unequal treatment or been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly i n- dicative of their abilit ies.62 Likewise, unless youth is seen as a significantly different issue, chi ldren will not be considered part of a suspect classification entitling them to the benefits of heightened judicial scrutiny. Children may still receive strict scrutiny if the gov ernment regulation burdens a fundamental right, but according to a 2007 case decided by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, access to prescri p- tion drugs probably does not qualify as such a right.

Although the S upreme Court has not yet addressed this particular issue,68 Abigail Alliance supports the n o- tion that the United States Constitution does not give cit izens\u2014terminally ill or otherwise \u2014a fundamental ri ght to access drugs that have not been proven safe and effective.69 It seems, then, that because age is not a suspect classification and there is no fundamental right to unfettered access to potentially unsafe and ineffective drugs, a child's access to SSRIs would likely be subject to r a- tional basis review.70 Following the D.C. Circuit's analysis, the gover nment has a legitimate interest in protecting children from toxicity, suicidal beh a- vior and ideation, and other potentially serious but uncertain side effects of SSRIs, and barring children from accessing these drugs until they are pro v- en safe and effective for children is rationally related to that goal. Thus, l i- miting off -label prescribing of SSRIs and requiring pediatric clin ical trials to test the sa fety and efficacy of these drugs on children would most likely pass rational basis review. The second possible constitutional challenge to federal regulation of off-label prescribing to children pertains to the children's parents: if the FDA were to bar children's off -label access to drugs tested only in adult popul ations, then it might violate the fundamental right of the parents of the affected children to raise their children in the manner they see fit, subject to 65 See id. at 698 (explaining that there are three phases of clinical trials a drug must pass for safety and efficacy in order to be approved by the FDA for introduction into the market; Phase I trials consist of a small pilot study of 20 to 80 persons; successful completion of Phase I trials means the drug is su f- ficiently safe for expanded human trials). 66 See Abigail Alliance , 495 F.3d at 712. 67 See id . at 713.

Whether FDA regulations infringe upon a parent's Fifth Amendment rights would depend on how broadly courts define a parent's right to make decisions concerning his or her child's upbringing. If interpreted broadly, the FDA regulations may be subject to strict scrutiny, and the government (FDA) would have to demonstrate that the regulations were narrowly ta i- lored to serve its compelling interest.73 Those interests, which would be the same as those enumerated under the equal protection analysis, would have more difficulty overcoming strict scrutiny's high bar. Prohibiting pediatric populations from having off -label access to SSRIs might pose serious health risks to patients who have not responded to other available treatments.74 As a result of the FDA regulations, those patients would not have access to these drugs during the lengthy clinical trials and approval process.75 Additionally, there are less -restrictive mea s- ures, such as government -funded pediatric research concurrent with off - label pre scribing, that could potentially address the government's interest in reducing adverse side effects while also minimizing any harm that could 71 See Washington v.

On balance, however, a court confronted with this line of constitutio n- al reasoning is unlikely to reach this conclusion. The FDA is in a better position than parents \u2014and courts \u2014to make decisions about what would benefit children as a group. The FDA regulations on drug manufacturers protect all consumers from the potential harmful effects of experimental drugs by ensuring the safety and efficacy of the drugs introduced into commerce. If this regulatory body concludes that prescribing drugs off - label to children runs too high a risk because of unknown and potentially harmful side e ffects, the FDA's judgment should trump an y parental r ight or preference. A parent's control over his or her children is subject to the child's best interest77; therefore, while parents should have the ultimate d e- cision -making power when it comes to treatment for their children, that power should be limited by what the FDA deems safe and appropriate for all children. IV. STATUTORY AND AD MINISTRATIVE INCENTI VES FOR GENERATING PEDIATRIC STUDIES The FDA has taken a carrot -and-stick approach to encourage pedi a- tric studies78: the carrot is a six month exclusivit y provision that allows manufacturers of already -approved drugs to receive a patent extension for voluntarily performing FDA -requested pediatric research under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA)79; the stick is an FDA -imposed requirement that manufacturers of new drugs perform clinical trials for safety and efficacy in child populations in order for certain drugs to receive FDA approval.80 76 A flat ban would not address issues such as increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors in MDD patients who do not respond to other medications and who could possibly be denied effective treatment under a flat ban regime. 77 See Washington v.

STATUTORY HISTORY In 1994, the FDA published its final rule (the 1994 Rule), which allow[ed] pediatr ic labeling based on adult studies, when appropriate, but cautioned that, in many cases, additional pharmacokinetic and safety data may be needed to support pediatric use statements .81 The 1994 Rule r e- quired manufacturers that did not provide adequate pe diatric research fin d- ings to include disclaimers on their labels stating that the drugs had not been tested for safety and efficacy in pediatric populations.82 Although the FDA did not require pediatric testing, it explicitly expressed its authority to enforce such a requirement in hope of inspiring manufacturers to change a then-current trend of using label disclaimers to avoid pediatric -specific labeling.83 The FDA's voluntary approach in 1994 largely failed84: In 1996, only thirty -seven percent of the new molecular entities likely to be used in children had pediatric labels pending approval,85 compared to fi f- ty-six percent in 1991.86 In reaction to the failure of the 1994 Rule, the FDA took a more insi s- tent approach with its so -called Pediatric Rule a few years later. The new rule sought to allow the FDA to require pediatric testing on already - marketed drugs,87 and pediatric testing and labeling on new drugs.88 In certain situ ations, the Pediatric Rule would have withheld approval of new 81 Specific Requirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drugs; R e- vision of Pediatric Use Subsection in the Labeling, 59 Fed.

THE FDAMA, THE BPCA, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF EXTENDED - EXCLUSIVITY INCENTIVE FRAMEWORKS Under the FDAMA, pediatric research was once again voluntary,91 but the FDAMA included a pediatric exclusivity provision that gave manufa c- turers a six -month patent extens ion or exclusivity period in exchange for performing pediatric research.92 Although Congress hoped that the pedi a- tric research would be accompanied by changes to drug labels to reflect their r esearch findings, the FDAMA allowed manufacturers to benefit from the six -month extension \u2014without making any label changes93\u2014as long as they completed the requested testing.94 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) of 200295 ex- tended the sunset clause of the FDAMA's exclusivity provision96 and made at least two significant changes to the incentive structure underlying pedi a- tric research.

In other words, the manufacturer could opt out of the process, but it could not pr e- vent the drug from being tested. The second major revision was to labeling practice s. The BCPA gave the FDA explicit authority to request that man u- facturers effect specific labeling changes to their drugs. If the manufacturer denied the r equest, the issue would go before a committee for review,97 and if the co mmittee agreed with the label ing change and the manufacturer still failed to comply, the FDA could deem the drug . . . misbranded.98 A year after Congress passed the BPCA, Congress passed the Pedi a- tric Research Equity Act99 (PREA), which codified the 1998 Pediatric Rule100 and provi ded the FDA with additional authority to require pedi a- tric studies of pharmaceutical products when they are needed to ensure their safe and effective use in children.101 The PREA requires manufactu r- ers of new drugs to provide data for the FDA to assess th e safety and e f- fectiveness of the drug . . . for the claimed indications in all relevant pedi a- tric subpopul ations.102 New drugs that are approved as safe and effective must also provide dosage instructions for each pediatric subpopulation.103 Because not a ll drugs are intended to be used in children, however, a man u- facturer can obtain a waiver and forego the pediatric research if it can show that tests on children are impracticable or that the drug would not benefit or be used by children.104 Drugs that obtai n waivers are required to have labels stating that the drug is not safe for children.105 Similar to the BCPA, the PREA provided that failure to comply with its procedures could result in the drug being deemed misbranded.

REACTIONS TO THE EXTENDED -EXCLUSIVITY INCENTIVE FRAMEWORK The FDAMA, BPCA, and PREA built upon one another to form a c o- hesive framework for regulating new and existing drugs marketed to chil d- ren. Proponents of the framework claim that the incentive structure helps manufacturers overcome the economic hurdles that ofte n stand in the way of pediatric testing.112 When the FDAMA first introduced the exclusivity incentive, it measurably bolstered pediatric studies: in the four -year period following the enactment of the FDAMA, in 1997, the FDA granted excl u- sivity to twenty -eight new products, eighteen of which resulted in label changes to include dosage and safety information.113 The success these numbers represent stands out in comparison to the lackluster results of the 1994 Rule's entirely voluntary program, under which only e leven studies were completed in seven years.114 The accomplishments that the fram e- work's incentive structure has inspired in this area are widely recognized: Indeed, the FDA itself reported that the pediatric exclusivity provision has done more to generate clinical studies and useful prescribing info r- mation for the pediatric population than any other regulatory or legisl a- 107 See AM.

Even pharmaceutical groups commended the legi s- lation for inspiring them to undertake the complicated task of pediat ric clinical research, admitting that prior federal regulations had done little to accomplish this end.115 Additionally, manufacturers highlight the successes of the current p ediatric exclusivity provision,116 and point out the FDA's recent success r eports: As of Feb. 20, 2009, labeling changes have been made to more than 260 products that were studied in children under BPCA or PREA. Of the more than 170 drugs studied just under the exclusivity incentive program within the BPCA, 159 have new pediatric labeling information inclu d- ing: 45 drugs with new or enhanced pediatric safety data that [had not] been known before[;] 27 drugs with new dosing or dosing changes[; and] 50 drugs with information stating that they were not found to be effective in children. 117 Still, despite its significant headway and general support from pharmaceu t- ical companies, opponents of the framework's incentive stru cture feel that an incentives -only approach does not go far enough; they claim that the FDA should affirmatively require pediatr ic research in appropriate ca s- es,118 such as when an existing drug is part of a smaller, less compet itive market in which extended exclusivity is an inadequate incentive.119 Addi- tionally, some argue that the incentive structure under the framework is a l- so inadequate because it permits manufacturers to benefit from the six - month extended -exclusivity provision whether or not the drug is safe for children and whether or not the manufacturer changes its labels; the 115 Id.

Critics allege that, even after realizing excessive pr ofits from their research efforts, ma n- ufacturers will likely raise drug prices in order to pass on some of the i n- creased costs of pediatric research to customers.123 The exclusivity prov i- sion makes this relatively easy to do because it delays the introductio n of lower -priced generic drugs into the market.124 In 2001, the FDA estimated that the exclusivity periods could cost consumers an extra $13.9 billion over a twenty -year period.125 Proponents are quick to rebut criticisms of the framework's incentive struct ure.126 To those who focus on the legislation's effectiveness in pr o- ducing important medical information, the profits to drug companies do not rival the benefits to children's health, which does not have a price tag.127 As explained by Dr. Robert Ward, a pract icing pediatrician and member of the American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP), the primary beneficiaries are doctors and patients: the greatest windfall has been in the area of pediatric research and information now available for pediatricians . . . .

Dr. R i- chard Gorman, a practicing ped iatrician for twenty -nine years and chair of the AAP section on Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,130 stated that the returns from the exclusivity provision enjoyed by companies respon d- ing to FDA research requests have not been excessive.131 In support o f his view, Dr. Gorman cited a 2007 study from the Journal of the American Medical Association that concluded that [t]he median annual sales of a drug recei ving pediatric exclusivity were $180 million[,] with a return on investment of 1.5 times the cost o f the study.132 By increasing the amount of information available about prescription drugs, and by easing consumer access to that information, the framework also address es other concerns about the incentive structure. The FDA is r e- quired to publicize the results of pediatric studies performed pursuant to the framework.133 So, although drug companies may benefit from the extended - exclusivity provision even if their research shows that their drugs are not safe for pediatric use, the results of the studies beco me public information that is likely to prevent doctors from prescribing the drugs to children, and manufacturers from marketing their drugs to pediatric use.134 It is also 128Id. 129 See PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PROVISION , supra note 89 , at 24. 130 Ensuring Safe Medicines and Medical Devices for Children: Hearings Before Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Com m., 110th Cong.

Such a framework would encourage manufacturers to falsify positive results for dangerous drugs; or, alternatively, it could completely quell the financial incentives as manufacturers discount their potential gains by the possibility of their r e- search going uncompensated. Additionally, regardless of the size and competitiveness of a particular drug market, drugs that the FDA deems to require more testing will likely be tested even if the exclusivity provisions pro vide an inadequate financial incentive.135 If manufacturers choose to forego the research, the FDA will contract it to third parties.136 Thus, as long as there are tax dollars available to fund third -party research, manufacturers cannot escape harmful researc h findings, and drugs that are unsafe or ineffective for use by pediatric pop u- lations will be labeled as such no matter who performs the study.137 V. PUBLIC POLICY AND AD DITIONAL PRACTICAL COMPLICATIONS Beginning with the FDAMA in 1998, healthcare legislati on has made great strides toward garnering information on new and already -marketed drugs that are prescribed to, but not intended for, pediatric patients. Even with these laws firmly in place, however, a number of problems arise when the framework is appli ed. The ethical issues of using children as research subjects presents one of these problems; another problem emerges when the FDA attempts to cajole drug companies into cooperating with its ma n- dates. A. CHILDREN : THE RISK-BENEFIT PROFILE OF CLINICAL RESEARCH Some child research is considered too dangerous to perform. In some cases this is not because of the danger of the drug itself, but because trea t- ment must be denied to the control group.138 Randomized clinical trials are generally considered the b est method for determining whether an exper i- mental measure should enter the realm of accepted therapy.139 Rand o- 135 See supra , Part IV(B), discussing the FDA's ability to require testing. 136 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 284m(b) (2006). 137 See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7355a (j)-(k). 138 See e.g., Prozac Is Risky for Children Too , BBC NEWS, Dec. 10, 2004, http://news.bbc.co.uk /2/hi/health/408354 5.stm (stating that although using anti -depressant medications can increase suicidal behavior in children, untreated MDD is more likely to r esult in actual suicide). 139 MICHAEL H.

While clinical trials are crucial in identifyi ng which drugs are safe and effective for use by children, those children not involved in a given study will not have access to the drug throughout the duration of the study unless some level of off -label prescribing is allowed. This is important given th at many off -label SSRIs, and other drugs commonly used by pediatric popul a- tions, would no longer be available to those not involved in the study. Other clinical studies on children may be too dangerous because of the drug involved. In these cases, child r esearch does not happen either because an Institutional Review Board finds the benefits to children to be too i n- substantial in light of the potential harms and refuses to let the studies go forward,145 or because manufacturers refuse to perform the research for fear 140 See id . 141 See id. at 259. 142 See id. 143 See id.

However, b e- cause the drugs in question have not been tested for safety and efficacy in pediatric populations, it is difficult \u2014if not impossible \u2014to know in a d- vance which drugs pose a danger to children. Alternative ly, some may argue that if a drug is safe for clinical trials, then it should also be considered safe for off -label prescribing. This arg u- ment, as with the converse for drugs deemed too dangerous, does not hold up. Not only does this completely obviate t he need for clinical trials, it also overlooks that a risk that may be justified by the information it can generate in a methodologically sound clinical trial but may not be justified without a methodical information -gathering objective. That is, general off-label use imposes risks without the direct benefits of sound clinical trials. 1. SSRI Research on Children To illustrate the complicated nature of clinical trials involving child patients, consider how such trials would be conducted for SSRIs. In ad di- tion to the general risk -benefit challenges discussed above, d rug research involving children and adolescents also raises numerous challenges on a c- count of the age of the clinical subject. For example, a child's brain is more malleable than an adult's br ain, and this exposes children to the risk that any damage done to them as a result of a study could affect them for years to come .147 Similar to the way stepping on a young tree would alter its only if the IRB finds that: (a) The risk is justified by the anticipated benefit to the subjects; (b) The rel a- tion of the anticipated benefit to the ri sk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that presented by available alternative approaches; and (c) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children and permission of their parents or guardians, as set forth in \u00a746.408.); see also, Shapiro et al., supra note 139, at 208 -12 (Institutional Review Boards approve research studies based on several fa c- tors such as a determination that risks to subjects are minimized and that such [r]isks to subjects are reasonable in relation to ant icipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may r easonably be expected to result); 45 C.F.R. 46.405 (2009). 146 See Breslow, supra note 84, at 140 -41. 147 See Christopher C.

As with all clinical studies, control groups are a necessary part of experimental design for SSRI studies b ecause they serve as a baseline against which researchers can measure the effects of a therapeutic test treatment.149 In these studies, placebo groups are control groups that are given sugar pills or other inert pills in place of the drug b e- ing tested.150 For studies involving pediatric MDD patients and SSRIs, u s- ing control groups may pose ethical problems.151 Because these studies necessarily require that the variable being tested (the SSRI) be the only thing varied between the two groups,152 the control group i s often denied not only SSRIs, but also psychotherapy and other known forms of trea t- ment.153 This puts the control group at risk. As discussed in greater detail above,154 a small percentage of children with MDD experienced suicidal behavior and ideation when the condition goes untreated.155 Children with untreated MDD also have difficulty functioning in their every -day lives. Thus, clinical trials of SSRIs on children with MDD run the serious risk of leaving child patients in the control group exposed to the d angers of u n- treated MDD.156 148 See generally Leonard H.

DRUG COMPANIES COMPROMISE INFORMED CONSENT BY WITHHOLDING INFORMATION ON SAFETY AND EFFICACY Lack of informed consent is a potential problem area in the off -label use of drugs. Often, patients know only what their doctors tel l them about the medications they are prescribed off -label. Doctors, in turn, are i n- formed by the available literature regarding a particular drug and by their hands -on investigations of that drug. Thus, if a doctor's knowledge is to some extent constrai ned by the amount of literature available, and that do c- tor's knowledge also represents the upper limit of what a patient could know, then the amount of literature generated regarding a particular drug could have a significant bearing on the doctor -patient relationship. In ot h- er words, if the doctor does not know of all of a drug's potential side e f- fects, then the p atient will not either. Some consumer advocacy groups have accused drug companies of withholding safety and efficacy information concerning SS RIs.157 Certain drug companies158 have refused to disclose the details of several clinical trials involving depression in pediatric populations.159 Drug companies claim that the findings of these studies are trade secrets paid for with pr i- vate company funds, and thus are private property.160 Whether this practice is legal or not,161 drug manufacturers that withhold data distort the co m- pleteness of the available information, which in turn disables fully i n- formed consent on the part of the patients using these drugs.162 A report by the United States Senate Committee on Finance charged that, in addition to blatantly withholding harmful clinical -study results, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) manipulated its research with respect to Paxil, one of its anti -depressants.163 This was acc omplished by placing research pa r- ticipants who had previously attempted suicide into the placebo group in 157 See Shankar Vedantam, Antidepressant Makers Withhold Data on Children , WASH.

The law r e- quires mandatory registration and results reporting for certain clini cal trials of drugs, biologics, and devices.166 Title VIII of the FDAAA requires all clinical trials of drugs, biologics, and devices, except for Phase I clinical trials, to be registered in the clinical trial registry databank. . . . This r e- quirement is a significant change from prior law, which only required re g- istration of trials for serious or life -threatening diseases.167 The FDAAA requires the FDA to publish results of clinical trials that boast efficacy claims or those conducted after a drug is appr oved, along with patient sa m- ple demographics and secondary outcomes.168 The FDAAA provides for civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day for failure to comply with registration requirements, and allows for additional penalties for failure to correct such v iolations within thirty days.169 Addi- tionally, the bill provides for up to $1,000,000 in civil penalties for kn o- wingly making false statements; misrepresen ting a material fact; or failing to disclose a material fact relating to any drug subject to an abbrevi ated drug application.170 Even more importantly, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley is seeking legislation that would call for criminal penalties for drug comp a- 164 See Letter from Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, Ranking Member, Senate Comm. on Finance, to Christopher Viehbacher, President, U.S. Pharmaceuticals GlaxoSmithKline 4 (Feb. 6, 2008), avail a- ble at http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2008/prg061208.pdf.

Drug manufacturers have to contend with tort liability from lawsuits brought on behalf of patients harmed in both clinical and patient setti ngs. In deciding whether to test a drug on pediatric populations, manufacturers also have to consider ethical dilemmas in child research as well as a risk that the r esearch could result in lower profits if the drugs prove to be unsafe or ine ffective for p ediatric populations. VI. POSSIBLE SOLUTIO NS It may not be possible to legislate -away all of the potential problems with the existing FDA framework. Withholding treatment from children in control groups will always pose ethical concerns, as will using children as test subjects for potentially unsafe drugs. Similarly, drug companies, like all successful companies, will always oppose federally enacted requir e- ments that are adverse to their business interests. Thus, improvements to the existing framework s hould not try to change those things that are beyond the legi slature's control; rather, they should focus on ways to work around potential problem areas. In the areas of research funding and data colle ction, such solutions are possible \u2014and compatible \u2014with the existing framework. A. BPCA INCENTIVE STRUCTURES DESIGNED TO DRIVE RESEARCH Although some have criticized the incentive structure of the FDAMA, BCPA, and PREA framework for granting exclusivity extensions even when a drug proves not to be safe and eff ective for children, as prev iously discussed, the structure would hardly be effective if the exclusivity period 171 Grassley, supra note 164. Recently, Eli Lilly ple d guilty to a charge of illegally promoting off-label uses of its drug Zyprexa. Eli Lilly agreed to pay $1.415 billi on to resolve the allegations, i n- cluding a $515 million criminal fine, the largest the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a United States criminal prosecution of any kind.

Such a conti n- gency could quash manufacturer participation altogether, or it could lead to falsified results. Still, the existing framework could be improved in a nu m- ber of ways: one possible improvement is to alter the incentive stru cture to reimburse manufacturers when their drugs prove not to be safe and effe c- tive in child populations, a nd extend exclusivity only to those manufactu r- ers that produce safe and effective drugs. Advocates of this so -called Waxman/Brown Substitute claim that it would replace the six -month e x- clusivity incentive with direct reimbursement of the costs of the stud ies, plus a 100 percent profit. 173 Though this provides less of a research ince n- tive than a guaranteed exclusivity extension, it may also provide a work a- ble middle ground that prevents drug manufacturers from reaping profit windfalls. Under the exclusivi ty provisions of the current framework, permissive standards for off -label prescribing often result in taxpayer -funded research. Drug manufacturers may refuse to run pediatric clinical trials on approved drugs that will not generate sufficient profits duri ng the exclusivity - extension period. Such clinical studies would be paid for with tax dollars. The State will have to find a way to generate that revenue, and a way to justify the increased costs to taxpayers \u2014costs many feel should fall squar e- ly on the sh oulders of manufacturers, particularly those that have e njoyed billions in profits from government -granted exclusivity periods.174 This, too, could be improved. Because many drug manufacturers market several drugs,175 one way to generate the money needed for clinical trials that manufacturers refuse to run is to retain some of percentage of the drug manufacturer's profits earned during the six -month exclusivity extension in a trust for future r e- search by that drug company. For example, Schering -Plough reported ly earned $975 million in profits during its six -month exclusivity period for the prescription allergy drug Claritin; holding as little as one percent of the company's profits during this period in a trust for future research into the 173 H.R. Rep. No. 107 -277, supra note 118 , at 56. 174 The additional revenue generated by manufacturers as a result of the six -month exclusivity has been as much as 36,000% of the cos ts of research. See Breslow, supra note 84, at 168 -69. 175 See, e.g. , Pharmaceutical Products , ABBOT LABS, Http://www.abbott.com/content/en_ US/20.20.10:10/product/product_category/Product_Category_Profile_0001.htm (last visited Nov. 28, 2010) (listing seve ral dozen drugs manufactured by Abbott Laborat ories); Products , BRISTOL -MYERS SQUIBB , http://www.bms.com/products/Pages/home.aspx (last visited Nov. 28, 2010) (listing fourteen products currently marketed by Bristol -Myers Squibb); Products , LILLY, http://w ww.lilly.com /products/ (listing twenty -three products currently marketed by Eli Lilly and Co mpany). 2010] OFF -LABEL PRESCRIBING OF SSRI s TO CHILDREN 475 company's other drugs would ensure that funds would be available for new research, even if the company chooses not to do the research itself. This is not a perfect solution: six -month exclusivity periods still i m- pose a cost on the consumers of the drug in question, who must p ay for the name -brand product while the manufacturer has exclusivity.176 Given that there are far fewer pediatric off -label drug users than there are taxpayers, it is perhaps more equitable to spread the financial burden across the tax base. Thus, while the trust account solution has the socially desirable result of taking the financial burden off of the taxpayer and shifting it onto the entity that should arguably be funding the research in the first place, the cost to children who are prescribed drugs off -label may be too great. B. DOCTORS ' ROLE IN ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL DATA Some doctors are doing their part to increase the scientific benefits of off-label prescribing by systematically acquiring anecdotal data. Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) is a practice -based research network supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that was established by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1986.177 The mission of PROS is to improve the health of children and enhance primary care practice by conducting national collaborative practice -based r e- search.178 PROS is organized so that practitioners and researchers work together to generate research questions, design study materials and prot o- cols, obtain research funding, collect study data, analyze collected data, and publish results.179 The PROS organization has studied a diverse sample of child health topics and has generated the information underlying the clin i- cal guidelines of the AAP and other organizations.180 176 See Recent Developments Which May Impact Consumer Access to, and Demand for, Pharm a- ceuticals , FDA. GOV, http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Testimony/ucm115212. htm (providing transcript of statement by Janet Woodcock, M.D., director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and R esearch before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, on June 13, 2001). Doctor Woodcock noted that the drug reform has required balancing drug development with expediting the approval of lower -cost g e- neric drugs. Id. 177 See Am.

The network has experienced steady growth sin ce its inception.). 178 Id. 179 Id. 180 See id. 476 REVIEW OF LAW AND SOCIAL JUSTICE [Vol. 19:3 PROS practitioners and researchers could help generate invaluable i n- formation by compiling off -label prescription data in a national database. This could make information on the safety and efficacy of drugs available to doctors and patients: information that, up until now, has been available only through clinical studies. Critics may argue that the information gained through this system would not compare to the information gained through clinical trials because off-label prescriptions are not screened for confounding var iables that may be responsible for observed trends. Also, the results would be difficult to standardize if different doctors prescribe different dosages to patients in different groups. The PROS system would, however, produce many more data points181 than c linical trials. Additionally, the PROS system would a l- leviate some of the typical concerns associated with child research, such as the financial conflicts of interest associated with recruiting research partic i- pants and the dangers of not treating those c hildren in the control group. VII. CONCLUSION: STRIKING THE APPROPRIATE BALA NCE Until recently, children seemed to have been systematically excluded from the protections of the FDCA's safe and effective requirements.182 In amending the 1994 Rule, the FD AMA, BPCA, and PREA have taken steps to address this issue. The incentive structure underlying this fram e- work has achieved considerable success relative to previous efforts; ho w- ever, the i ncentive structure is also costly to drug users and taxpayers. With this in mind, cost effective programs need to be developed to r e- duce costs and effectively identify drugs that require pediatric tes ting.183 One way to do this would be to expand the reach of the PROS practiced - based research network. Pediatricians could collaborate to document ot h- erwise hard -to-find records of off -label use and create a national database of pra ctice-based research that would inform pediatric off -label prescribing practices and assist the FDA in determining which drugs warrant clinical trials. The PROS approach could be implemented concurrently with the e x- isting carrot -and-stick regime of the incentive -structure framework. Reg u- lations should also ensure that manufacturers report all post-approval clin i- 181 The PROS system could generate one data point for each child taking an off -label medication, assuming that enrollment in the program became the norm. 182 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a) -(d)(3) (2006). 183 These programs shoul d be developed collaboratively by Congress, physician organizations and drug manufacturers to ensure access to the broadest range of information and funding from both the government as well as those who stand to profit from drug sales. 2010] OFF -LABEL PRESCRIBING OF SSRI s TO CHILDREN 477 cal tr ials, and additional forward -looking measures, such as withholding some of a drug manufacturer's exclusivity -period profits for future r e- search, should also be considered. President Obama's new healthcare legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), has attempte d to address this i ssue by initiating studies regarding pediatric research.184 The new legislation calls for review and assessment of (1) the importance of testing biological products on children; (2) labeling changes that have resulted from such tests; (3 ) prioritization of drugs not being tested for pediatric use; and (4) recommendations and incentives for ensuring pediatric testing.185 Currently, officials from over twenty states are challenging the PPACA.186 The most hotly contested provision of the Act i s the requir e- ment that Americans obtain insurance.187 Children deserve to know that the medic ations prescribed to them are both safe and effective, whether or not the law is ultimately repealed. In the case that it is repealed, the po rtions of the PPACA call ing for pediatric studies of drugs and biological products should be passed as a separate bill. It may be the gold standard to require pediatric clinical trials for all drugs used by children and adolescents, but manufacturers and the costs of pediatric r esearch have stood in the way of this ideal. Recent improv e- ments, including the PPACA's provisions regarding pediatric research, represent steps in the right direction, but the best scenario would include a collaborative effort by doctors to collect inform ation on drugs not being clinically tested on children. Combining clinical studies and a central do c- tor-created database of the safety and efficacy of drugs and biological products in children strikes the appropriate balance of ensuring that chil d- ren are p rotected from unsafe prescription drugs without hindering the progress of medicine. 184 H.R. 3590 -702 (2) -(4). 185 Id. 186 Kevin Sack , Challenging Health Care Law, Suit Advances, Oct. 14, 2010, N.Y.
