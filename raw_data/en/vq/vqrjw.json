A comprehensive integrated formulary that includes Medicare and Medicaid outpatient prescription drugs and pharmacy products provided under the CICO . A combined Provider and Pharmacy Directory that i ncludes all providers of Medicare, Medicaid, and flexible benefits.

These cases will generally occur when an opt-in Enrollment request is received late in a month with an effective date as described in Section 2.3.2.3. In these cases, SCDHHS still must provide the Enrollee all materials described in \u00a730.4.1 of the Medicare-Medicaid Plan Enrollment and Disenrollment Guidance no later than ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the completed Enrollment request. A dditionally, the CICO is also strongly encouraged to call these new Enroll ees as soon as possible (within one (1) to three (3) calendar days of receiving the E nrollment transaction ) to inform the Enrollee of the effective date, provide information necessary to access benefits , and to explain the CICO rules. The Enrollee 's coverage will be active on the effective date regardless of whether or not the Enrollee has rec eived all the information by the effective date.

The CICO may not interfere with the Enrollee's right to disenroll through threat, intimidation, pressure, or otherwise. D iscretionary Involuntary Disenrollment : 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.74 and Sections 40.3 and 40.4 of the Medicare-Medicaid Plan Enrollment and Disenrollment Guidance provide instructions to the CICO on discretionary involuntary disenrollment. This Contract and other guidance provide procedural and substant ive requirements the C ICO, SCDHHS , and CMS must follow prior to involuntarily disenrolling an Enrollee. If all of the procedural requirements are met, SCDHHS and CMS will decide whether to approve or deny each request for involuntary disenrollment based on an assessment of whether the particular facts associated with each request satisfy the substantive evidentiary requirements. Basis for Discretionary Involuntary Disenrollment: Disruptive conduct: When the Enrollee engages in c onduct or behavior that ser iously impairs the C ICO's ability to furnish Covered Items and Services to either this Enrollee or other Enrollees and provided the C ICO made and documented reasonable efforts to resolve the problems presented by the Enrollee. Procedural requirements: The CICO' s request must be in writing and include all of the supporting documentation outlined in the evidentiary requirements. The process requires three (3) written notices. The C ICO must include in the request submitted to SCDHHS and CMS evidence that t he first two (2) notices 40 have already been sent to the Enrollee. The notices are: Advance notice to inform the Enrollee that the consequences of continued disruptive behavior will be disenrollment. The advance notice must include a clear and thorough explanation of the disruptive conduct and its impact on the C ICO's ability to provide services, examples of the types of reasonable accommodations the C ICO has already offered , the Grievance procedures, and an explanation of the availability of other accommo dations. If the disruptive behavior ceases after the Enrollee receives notice and then later resumes, the CICO must begin the process again reinstate the process . This includes sending another advance notice. Notice of intent to request the Department an d CMS' permission to disenroll the Enrollee; and A planned action notice advi sing that CMS and SCDHHS have approved the CICO 's request. This notice is not a procedural prerequisite for approval and should not be sent under any circumstances prior to the r eceipt of express written approval and a disenrollment transaction from CMS and SCDHHS . The C ICO must provide information about the Enrollee, including age, diagnosis, mental status, functional status, a description of his or her social support systems, and any other relevant information. The submission must include statements from providers des cribing their experiences with the Enrollee (or refusal in writing, to provide such statements); and Any information provided by the Enrollee. The Enrollee can provi de any information he/she wishes. 41 If the CICO is requesting the ability to decline future Enrollments for this individual, the C ICO must include this request explicitly in the submission. P rior to approval, the complete request must be reviewed by SCDHHS and CMS including representatives from the Center for Medicare and must include staff with appropriate clinical or medical expertise. Evidentiary standards; At a minimum, the supporting doc umentation must demonstrate the following to the satisfaction of both SCDHHS and CMS staff with appropriate clinical or medical expertise: The Enrollee is presently engaging in a pattern of disruptive c onduct that is seriously impairing the C ICO's ability to furnish Covered Items and Services to the Enrollee and/or other Enrollees. The CICO t ook reasonable efforts to address the disruptive conduct including at a minimum: Documentation of no fewer than t hree (3) separate and distinct attempts to understand and address the Enrollee's underlying interests and needs reflected in his/her disruptive conduct and provide reasonable accommodations as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act including those for individuals with mental and/or cognitive conditions. An accommodation is reasonable if it is efficacious in providing equal access to services and proportional to costs. SCDHHS and CMS will determine whether the reasonable accommodations offered are sufficient; A documented provision of information to t he individual of his or her right to use the CICO's Grievance procedures; and The C IC O provided the Enrollee with a reasonable opportunity to cease his/her disruptive conduct. 42 T he C ICO must provide evidence that the Enrollee's behavior is not related to the use, or lack of use, of medical services. The C ICO may also provide evidence of other extenuating circumstances that demonstrate the Enrollee's disruptive conduct. L imitations: Th e CICO shall not seek to terminate Enrollment because of any of the following: T he Enrollee's uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from such Enrollee's special needs unless treating providers expressly document their belief that there are no reasonable accommodations the C ICO could provide that would address the disruptive conduct. T he Enrollee exercises the option to make treatment decisions with which the C ICO or any health care professionals associated with the C ICO disagree, including the option of declining treatment and/or diagnostic testing. A n adverse change in an Enrollee's health status or because of the Enrollee's utilization of Covered Items and Services. The Enrollee's mental capacity is, has, or may become diminished. Fraud or abuse: When the Enrollee provides fraudulent information on an Enrollment form or the Enrollee willfully misuses or permits another person to misuse the Enrollee's ID card. The C IC O may submit a request that an Enrollee be involuntarily disenrolled if an Enrollee knowingly provides on the election form fraudulent information that materially affects the individual's eligibility to enroll in the C ICO; or if the Enrollee intentionally permits others to use his or her Enrollment card to obtain services under the C ICO. 43 Prior to submission, the C ICO must provide to CMS/ SCDHHS credible evidence substantiating the allegation that the Enrollee knowingly provided fraudulent information or intentionally permitted others to use his or her card. T he C ICO must immediate ly notify the CMT so that the Enrollment broker and the HHS Office of the Inspector General may initiate an investigation of the alleged fraud and/or abuse. The C IC O must provide notice to the individual prior to submission of the request outlining the intent to request disenrollment with an explanation of the basis of the C ICO's decision and information on the Enrollee's access to Grievance procedures and a fair hearing. Necessary consent or release: When the Enrollee knowingly fails to complete and subm it any necessary consent or release allowing the C ICO and/or Providers to access necessary health care and service information for the purpose of compliance with the care delivery system requirements in Section 2.5 of this Contract. The C IC O may request that an Enrollee be involuntarily disenrolled if the Enrollee knowingly fails to complete and submit any necessary consent or release allowing the C ICO and/or Providers to access necessary health care and service information for the purpose of compliance wi th the care delivery system requirements in Section 2.5 of this Contract. The C ICO must provide notice to the Beneficiary prior to submission of the request outlining the intent to request disenrollment with an explanation of the basis of the C ICO's decisi on and information on the Enrollee's access to Grievance procedures and a fair hearing.

This may include when an Enrollee does 50 not meet the nursing facility level of care and is therefore ineli gible for home and community based services ( HCBS ): the first includes the temporary use of home care services to facilitate a transition from an acute care setting back to the communit y; the other allows the use of HCBS to delay the need for nursing facil ity placement. T he CICO must provide the full range of Covered Services. If either Medicare or South Carolina Medicaid provides more expansive services than the other program does for a particular condition, type of illness, or diagnosis, the CICO must provide the most expansive set of services required by either program. The CICO may not limit or deny services to Enrollees based on Medicare or South Carolina Medicaid providing a more limited range of services than the other program. 2.4.2. Excluded Services T he following services will be carved out from this C ontract and will be provided in fee- for-service as described below. Medicare Hospice benefits ; I ntermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID); T he Enroll ee must meet the State's level of care for ICF - IIDs as certified by the SCDDSN. Medicaid non- emergent transportation services. T he SCDHHS covers non- emergent transportation services for all Medicaid Enrollees throug h a contracted broker/coordinator. Dental services not otherwise listed below. The CICO will be responsible for M edically N ecessary procedures covered by Medicare and/or Medicaid including, but not limited to, the following: Emergency medical (CPT) procedures performed by oral surgeons. C overed dental procedures (CDT Codes) delivered in preparation for, or during the course of treatment for one or more of the following medical reasons will b e considered for payment: organ transplants; oncology; radiation of the 51 head and/or neck for cancer treatment; chemotherapy for cancer treatment; total joint r eplacement; heart valve replacement; t rauma t reatment performed in a hospital or ambulatory s urgical c enter (ASC). The CICO must cover anesthesia and hospitalization for M edically N ecessary dental services. At its opt ion, the CICO may cover certain additional dental services for Enrollees . Services that are carved out must be: Both coordinated and incorporated in the ICP, as well as i ncluded in the MT discussions; Inclusive of P ro viders of the three carved -out services to participate in the MT sessions. Enrollees can elect to remain in the Demonstration and receive one or m ore of these carved out services. A CICO may not disenroll someone from the D emonstration if s/he elects to receive one or more of these services. 2.5. C are Delivery Model 2.5.1. General The CICO shall offer Care Management services to all Enrollees to ensure effective integration and coordination between the M edical H ome and other P roviders and services and to coordinate the full range of medical , behavioral health, and LTSS , as needed. 2.5.2. H ome and Community Based Service Transition Responsibility for H C BS will be transitioned from SCDHHS to the CICO , as specified in more detail in Appendix C . The t ransition will consist of three (3) phases over which the CICO will assume greater responsibility for the oversight and provision of HCBS. The CICO will be required to pass a Benchmark Review prior to assuming the responsibilities specified for each of the phases. 52 SCDHHS will transition and phase in HCBS authority and accountability over the course of the Demonstration. During Phase I of the HCBS Transition SCDHHS will maintain contractual relationships with HCBS Providers. The CICO , however, will receive payment for these services and process Provider payments through Care Call . For Phase II of the HCBS Transition , the C ICO that has successfully completed the first HCBS B enchmark R eview will assume contractual authority for C ase Management services and most HCBS, in addition to the full continuum of Medicare and Medicaid Covered S ervices it is already providing. For Phase III of the HCBS Transition , the C ICO that ha s successfully completed the final HCBS Benchmark R eview will provide all Ca se Management and HCBS and assume all contractual authority for the continuum of care under the Demonstration. Additional details regarding the phase-in, including the roles and responsibilities of CMS , SCDHHS and the C ICO, is contained in Appendix C . 2.5.3.

The CICO shall ensure that Providers have the preventive care, diseas e- specific and plan services information necessary to support Enrollee education in an effort to promote compliance w ith treatment directives and to encourage self- directed care. 2.6. Enrollee Stratification, Assessments, and Care 2.6.1. Enrollee Stratification T he CICO can supplement the initial health screening with predictive modeling and surveillance data to stratify Enrollees as low, moderate, or high risk and must consider, specifically, any Special Health Care Needs of the Enrollees . E nrollees in one of the Demonstration's three (3) HCBS waivers are automatically stratified as high risk. T he CICO will determine the parameters and definitions for other Enrollees defined as high risk as well as definitions for low or moderate risk Enrollees . 64 T hese levels of stratification should be based on an Enrollees risk for long -term care institutionalization and/or avoidable hospitalization. U tilizing Enrollee demographics, medical conditions, functional status, care patterns, and resource utilization data along with hierarchical condition c ategories (HCC) risk scores , and must consider, specifically, any Special Health Care Needs of the Enrollees . 2.6.2. Initial Health Screen The Initial H ealth S creen will collect information about the Enrollee 's medical, psychosocial, LTSS, functional, and cognitive needs, and medical and behavioral health (including substance abuse) history. Initial H e alth S creens must be administered to all new Enro llees within thirty (30) calendar days of Enrollment. The CICO m ay forego an Enrollee's Initial H ealth S creen if completing the Comprehensive A ssessment within sixty (60) calendar days of Enrollment. SCDHHS will collaborate with the CICO s to develop a universal Initial Health Screen tool. The Initial H ealth Screen will contain domain elements to identify potential LTSS needs and to determine the necessity of a LTC A ssessment. This tool may be administered either in - person or telephonically. 2.6.3. C omprehensive Assessments Each Enrollee shall receive, and be an active participant in, a timely C omprehensive A ssessment of medical, behavioral heal th, community- based or facility -based LTSS, and social needs completed by the C are Management team. The CICO m ust use Phoenix, SCDHHS 's autom ated Case Management system, to record the Comprehensive Assessment s and to trac k the Long Term Care Assessments (as described in Section 2.6.4 Lo ng Term Care Assessments ). The Comprehensive A ss essment will be performed using the s tate's uniform assessment tools. Assessment domains will include, but not be limited to, social, functional, medical, behavioral, wellness and prevention domains, caregiver status and capabilities, as well as the Enrollee's preferences, strengths, and goals. 65 The CICO will complete the Comprehensive A ssessment using information from the initial health screen (described in Section 2.6.2 Initial Health Screen ), comprehensive data sources, and input from the Enrollee, Providers, and family/caregivers. A ssessments will be completed by qualified , trained health professionals who possess a professional scope of practice, licensure, and/or credentials appropriate for responding to or managing the Enrollee 's needs. Examples of health professionals who may complete portions or all of the assessment include , but are not limited to : Registered nurses, L icensed practical nurses (under the supervision of registered nurses), So cial workers, Medicaid case managers, C ertified geriatric care manager s, Certified community health workers T he CICO will use the r esults of the Comprehensive A ssessment to confirm the appropriate acuity or risk stratification level for the Enrollee and as the basis for developing the integrated ICP. T he Enrollee will continue to receive any community -based or facility - based LTSS (i.e., respite care) in any existing waiver service plan (s) prior to the Comprehensive Assessment or r eassessment. The CICO will adhere to all transition requirements for services, as outlined in Section 2.6.9. Ti m ing of Comprehensive Assessments: A ll Enrollees will receive a Comprehensive A ssessme nt to be completed within the following timeframes: Enrollees stratified as high r isk: within sixty ( 60) days of Enrollment; Enrollees s tratified as moderate risk: within sixty ( 60) days of Enrollment ; and Enrollees s tratified as low risk: within ninety (90) days of Enrollment. 66 T he CICO must ensure that a r eassessment and a n ICP update are performed: A s warranted by the Enrollee 's condition but at least every twelve (12) months after the initial assessment completion date; W hen there is a change in the Enrollee 's health status or needs; As requested by the Enrollee , his/her caregiver, or his/her provider; and U pon any of the following trigger events: A hospital admission; Transition between care settings; C hange in functional status; Loss of a primary caregiver or an informal caregiver who contributes substantially to the Enrollee's care ; C hange in , or addition of, a diagnosis; and A s requested by a member of the M T who observes a change that requires further investigation. C omponents of the assessment may be updated by the MT as warranted by minor changes on the Enrollee conditions. The CICO will analyze surveillance data of all Enrollees monthly, including Care Call rep orts for persons receiving HCBS, to identify acuity and risk level changes. As acuity and risk levels change, reassessments will be completed as clinically necessary and the I CP interventions updated. T he CICO shall identify Enrollees through r eferrals, transition information, service authorizations, alerts, memos, assessment results, and from families, caregivers, Providers, community organizations, and CICO personnel as well as other mechanisms deemed appropriate by the CICO . 67 T he CICO shall notify PCPs of Enrollment of any new Enrollee who has not completed a Comprehensive Assessment within the time period set forth above and whom the CICO has been unable to contact. The CICO shall encourage P CPs to conduct outreach to these Enrollees and to schedule visits. 2.6.4. Long Term Care Assessmen ts S CDHHS will conduct all Long Term Care Assessments and level of care determinations for both HCBS waiver and nursing facility services ; final results will be recorded in Phoenix. C ICO must coordinate with SCDHHS Community Long Term Care (CLTC) staff who perform the L TC Assessments. CICO must e nsure that all Enrollees who need a LTC Assessment are referred to CLTC within twenty -four (24) hours of the completion of the Comprehensive Assessment , in which the need was identified. LTC Assessments are conducted for all Enrollees who are identified as high risk (as described in Section 2.6.1) or whose Comprehensive Assessments indicate a potential need for long term care services. C ICO must ensure that the Comprehensive Assessment and L TC Assessment are conducted concurrently , when possible. T he CICO will submit a referral for LTC A ssessment via Phoenix, which will be received by the SCDHHS C LTC staff. T he CICO must use Phoenix, , to track LTC Assessments. T he CICO will receive a notification via Phoenix when an Enrollee is scheduled to receive an L TC Assessment. T he CICO will receive a second notification via Phoenix when the L TC Assessment and the level of care determination are complete. S CDHHS will provide the CICO , via Phoenix , with the most recent L TC Assessments and HCBS service plans for Enrollees who are also participants in one of the three designated State HCBS waiver programs. 68 T he C ICO will have immediate, real time access to this information through the Phoenix system. Enrollees with a current and up- to-date LTC Assessment are not required to undergo a second assessment until such time as an annual reassessment is due. CICOs will gain the ability to perform reassessments after passing a Benchmark Review prior to implementation of the second transition phase of HCBS 2.6.5. Long -Term Care Reassessments T he CICO will conduct a face -to-face LTC Reassessments for Enrollees A s warranted by the Enrollee 's condition but at least every twelve (12 ) months after the initial LTC Assessment completion date; W hen there is a change in the Enrollee 's healt h status or needs; A s requested by the Enrollee , his/her caregiver, or his/her Provider; and Upon any of the following trigger events: A hospital admission; Transition between care settings; Change in functional status; Loss of a primary caregiver or an informal caregiver who contributes substantially to the Enrollee's care; C hange in or addition of a diagnosis; and A s requested by a member of the M T who observes a change that requires further investigation. 2.6.6. Individualized Care Plans (ICPs) 69 Following the Comprehensive Assessment (as described in Section 2.6.3 Comprehensive Assessment ), the CICO shall assign a Care Coordinator who works with the Enrollee , his/her family supports, Providers, and other MT members to develop a comprehensive, person -centered, written ICP for each Enrollee. CICOs must allow Enrollees to request and be assigned a new Care Coordinator. Every Enrollee must have an ICP, unless the Enrollee refuses and such refusal is documented by the Care Coordinator in Phoenix. T he CICO must complete each Enrollee 's initial ICP within ninety (90) calendar days of E nrollment. T he CICO must provide the Enrollee with a copy of his or her ICP. I CP Monitoring T he CICO must review ICPs of high- risk Enrollees at least every thirty (30) calendar days. T he CICO must review ICPs of moderate- risk Enrollees at least every ninety (90) calendar days. T he CICO must review ICPs of low- risk Enrollees at least every one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days. The CICO must update an Enrollee's ICP every three-hundred and sixty- five (365) calendar days (at minimum), or more frequently if the Enrollee's condition warrants or if the Enrollee requests a change. T he ICP must: I nclude current and unique psychosocial and medical needs and history of the Enrollee , as well as the Enrollee's functional level, behavioral health needs, language, culture, and support systems; Include identifiable and measurable short - and long- term treatment and service goals and interventions to address the Enrollee 's needs and preferences and to facilitate monitoring of the Enrollee's progress and evolving service needs ; Include expected outcomes with completion timeframes; I nclude opportunities for input from the Enrollee , his/her designee, and the MT during the development, implementation, and ongoing assessment of ICP; 70 I nclude a risk assessment that identifies and evaluates risks associated with the Enrollee 's care.

Waiver Service Plans D uring Phase I of the transition of HCBS authority (further described in Section 2.5.2 and Appendix C ), SCDHHS maintains responsibility for developing the W aiver Service P lan. The W aiver Case M anager will complete the W aiver Service P lan and make recommendations for service authorizations as is currently done in Phoenix. T he CICO will have a formal process by which they can provide input or ask questions about the W aiver Service Plan. A three- way conference will be conducted among the W aiver C ase Manager, SCDHHS staff reviewer , and CICO designee to discuss elements in the W aiver 73 Service P lan and the recommended service levels. T his conference may be conducted through telephonic, face- to-face, or electronic interactions (e.g., video conferencing) depending on the complexity of the case. I f there is disagreement about the W aiver Service Plan or the level of authorized services , the CICO may request a review from the Demonstration's independent Ombudsman who has the authority to make a final decision that best meets the needs of the Enrollee . T he W aiver C ase M anager must collaborate with the Enrollee 's Care C oordinator to ensure HCBS and the Waiver Service P lan is fully integrated into the I CP. D uring Phases II and III of the HCBS transition (further described in Section 2.5.2 and Appendix C ), the CICO is responsib le for developing the W aiver Service P lan with concurrence from SCDHHS long-t erm care staff . The CICO will complete the W aiver Service P lan and make recommendations for service authorizations in Phoenix. 2.6.8. Self-directed Care Th e CICO will provide, through subcontract, client directed personal care assistance. Attendant care services are provided by qualified individuals, including specifi ed family members, to help Enrollees by offering support for activities of daily living and monitoring the medical condition of Enrollees . The kinds of activities that an atten dant Provider performs include the following: Assistance with personal hygiene, feeding, bathing, toileting, ambulation, transfer ring, and meal preparation ; E ncouraging clients to adhere to specially prescribed diets ; G eneral housekeeping duties; S hopping assistance; A ssistance with communication ; and M onitoring medication . 74 T he CICO will support Enrollees in directing their own care and ICP development. N otification of Self -Direction Options Enrollees must be informed of the option to self- direct their own services at each Comprehensive Assessment and review of Comprehensive A ssessment. T he M T must inform Enrollees of the option to self- direct their services when their ICPs are updated. Explanations of the s el f-direction option must: Make clear th at self -direction of services is voluntary and that Enrollees can choose the extent to which they would like to self - direct their services ; Provide the options to select self- di rected supports or services ; and Provide an overview of the supports and resources available to assist Enrollees to participate to the extent desired in self - direction. The CICO 's policies regarding self-direction must conform to SCDHHS requirements , including: Reimbursement for personal care, attendant care, and companion services may be made via SCDHHS's financial management Fiscal Employer Agent, Public Partnership Limited (PPL) , to certain family members who meet the South Carolina Medicai d Provider qualifications. The spouse of the Enrollee , or a ny other legally responsible guardian of an Enrollee, cannot be reimbursed. In addition, family members who are pr imary caregivers will not be reimbursed for respite and/or companion services. Providers of self- di rected services must meet the qualification of providers of personal assistance as outlined under 42 CFR 441.478. 75 Th e prospective Provider must undergo a tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) test. If the Provider has had a past positive result, documentation of the past positive and chest x-ray results is required. A Signs and Symptoms Questionnaire for Providers is required for those who have tested positive previously. The prospective Provider must undergo a South Carolina criminal history background check conducted by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). This includes retaining the required photocopy of a state identification or driver's l icense and photocopy of the Social Security card is required. Both documents must be in the same name. A ll criminal background checks must include all data for the individual with no limit o n the timeframe being searched. Criminal background checks that cover a specific time period such as seven (7) or ten (10) year searches are not acceptable. The criminal background check must include statewide (South Carolina) data. Potential employees with felony convictions within the last ten (10) ye ars cannot provide services to Enrollees or work in an administrative/office position. Potential employees with non -violent felonies dating back ten (10) or more years can provide services to Enrollees under the following circumstances: Enrollee / responsible party must be notified of the aide's criminal background, i.e. felony conviction, and year of conviction; P rovider must obtain a written statement, signed by the Enrollee /responsible party acknowledging awareness of the aide's criminal backgrou nd and agreement to have the aide provide care; this statement must be placed in the participant record. 76 Potential administrative/office employees with non-violent felony convictions dating back ten (10) or more years can work in the agency at the Enrollees 's discretion. H iring of employees with misdemeanor convictions will be at the Enrollees's discretion. Employees hired prior to July 1, 2007, and continuously employed since then will not be required to have a criminal background check. SCDHHS's contrac tor, the Center for Disability Resources ( CDR ), University of South Carolina, is required to ensure that the requirements of a South Carolina Certified Nurse Aide Registry check and Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/ Entities (LEIE) Exclusions Program check are met . T he CICO must comply with the provision regarding the supervision of care for attendant. A supervisor is designated and approved a s the Employer of Record (EOR). If the Enrollee is unable or unwilling to serve as the EOR, another person knowledgeable and involved with the Enrollee 's day -to-day care may be designated. The EOR is responsible for interviewing prospective attendants, meet ing CDR in the home for all match visits and follow up visits. The EOR is responsible for meeting with the Waiver Case Manager in the home for the initial visit and re - evaluation visit. The EOR should live within fifty (50) miles of Enrollee's home. The EOR mus t 77 provide weekly supervision. The EOR cannot be the primary contact and cannot be paid for the performing the duties of the Employer of Record. Self-D irection for HCBS Waiver Enrollees During Phase III of the transition of HCBS authority (as d escribed in Section 2.5.2 and Appendix C ) , the CICO will work with CDR, to ensure waiver Enrollees receive services from qualified attendants and are capabl e of supervising the care or have someone who can supervise the care on their behalf. Once CDR receives an electronic referral from the CICO or Waiver Case Manager and determines that self - direction is appropriate, CDR will send an e nrollment packet to the prospective attendant who is then enrolled as a Medicaid Provider. After the prospective attendant meets SCDHHS Provider e nrollment requirements, a CDR nurse will schedule the \"match visit\" in the Enrollee 's home. During the \"match visit\", the nurse will observe the personal care provided by the individual attendant. Based on this observation, the nurse will provide individualized instruction and training specific to the Enrollee 's diagnoses and home environment. CDR staff will also assist with the fiscal agent e nrollment paperwork necessary to establish the employer/employee relationship. To facilitate payment, the CICO w ill utilize SCDHHS 's financial management Fiscal Employer Agent , Public Partnership Limited (PPL). SCDHHS will assume all administrative costs for both CDR and PPL. 2.6.9. C ontinuity of Care Service Transitions The CICO shall allow Enrollees receiving any services at the time of E nrollment to maintain their current Providers, including with Providers who are not part of the CICO 's network and service levels, including prescription drugs for at least one hundred eighty (180) days after the Enrollee 's Enrollment effective date. 78 A ny reduction, suspension, denial or termination of previously authorized services shall trigger the required notice under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.404 which clearly articulates the Enrollee 's right to file an Appeal (either Expedited, if warranted, or standard), the right to have authorized service continue pending the Appeal, and the right to a fair hearing if the CICO renders an adverse determination (either in whole or in part) on the A ppeal . T he CICO is required to maintain current service authorization levels for all direct care waiver services (including personal care, waiver nursing, home care, respite care, community living, adult day health, social work , counseling, independent living assistance , and home delivered meals) during the one hundred eighty day (180) day transition period, unless a significant change has occurred and is documented during the L TC Assessment and/or r eassessment. Except as provided in Appendix A, all prior approvals for non-P art D drugs, therapies, or other services existing in Medicare or Medicaid at the time of E nrollment will be honored for one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after Enrollment and will not be terminated at the end of one hundred eighty (180) days without advance notice to the Enrollee and transition to other services, if needed. Drug Transitions During the first one hundred eighty (180) days of c overage, the CICO will provide: A temporary supply of drugs when the E nrollee requests a refill of a non - formulary drug that otherwise meets the definition of a Part D drug; and A ni nety ( 90) day supply of drugs when an Enrollee requests a refill of a non -Part D drug that is covered by Medicaid. All other Part D transition rules and rights not explicitly a mended by the provisions in this section will co ntinue as provided for in current law and regulation. The CICO m ust provide an appropriate transition process for Enrollees who are prescribed Part D drugs that are not on its formulary (including drugs that are on the CICO 's 79 formulary but require prior authorization or step therapy under the CICO 's UM rules). This transition process must be consistent with the requirements at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.120(b)(3). P rovider Transitions D uring the one hundred eighty (180) calendar day transition period, t he CICO will allow Enrollees to access to any Provider seen by the Enrollee within the previous one-hundred and eighty (180) calendar days prior to transition, even if the Provider is not in the CICO 's network. During the transition period, the CICO will advise Enrollees and Providers if and when they have received care that would not otherwise be covered in -network. O n an ongoing basis, and as appropriate, the CICO must contact P roviders who provide services to Enrollees but who are not Network Providers and provide them information on becom ing in-Network Providers. Ou t -of-network PCPs and specialists providing an ongoing course of treatment must be offered single case agreements to continue to care for the Enrollee beyond the one hundred e ighty ( 180) day transition period if the Provider chooses not to participate in the CICO 's network. Th e CICO must also offer single -case agreements to Providers to treat the Enrollee until a qualified Network Provider is available . The CICO must offer s ingle c ase agreements to providers who are: Not willing to enroll in the CICO 's Provider Network, and C urrently serving Enrollees, under the following circumstances: The CICO 's network does not have an otherwise qualified Network Provider to provide the services within its Provider Network, or transitioning the care in-house would require the Enrollee to receive services from multiple Providers/facilities in an uncoordinated 80 manner which would significantly impa ct the Enrollee 's condition; Transitioning the Enrollee t o another Provider could endanger life, cause suffering or pain, cause undue hardship, physical deformity or malfunction, or significantly disrupt the current course of treatment; or Transitioning the Enrollee to another Provider would require the Enrollee to undertake a substantial change in recommended treatment for Medically Necessary Covered Services. If an Enrollee does not identify a curr en t PCP or select a PCP within ninety ( 90) days of Enrollment, and the CICO has made reasonable, unsuccessful attempts to engage the Enrollee (by phone or by mail) in identifying or selecting a PCP, the CICO shall assign a PCP to the Enrollee and notify the PCP and Enrollee of the assignment. This PCP assignment shall not adversely impact any transition rights that an Enrollee may have. The CICO m ust consider the following factors in its assignment of a PCP: Enrollee's IC P; Enrollee Provider's competency to meet the Enrollee's needs; and Provider' s ability to accept new patients. The Care Coordinator must also make reasonable efforts to not only schedule an appointment for the Enrollee , but also ensure the Enrollee keeps the appointment including by assisting with transportation/escort arrangements if necessary and/or attending the appointment 81 with Enrollee . The CICO may utilize Enrollee i ncentives to facilitate this occurrence. (see Section 2.12.9.3) The CICO shall submit a quarterly PCP assignment report that provides the following information: Provider name, NPI Number, number of Enrollees assigned, and practice s pecialty (e.g ., geriatrician, family practitioner with geriatric c ertification, etc.) and any other specifications determined by SCDHHS. Out-of-Network Reimbursement Rules For reimbursement of out-of-network em ergen t or U rgent Care services , as defined by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 424.101 and 405.400 respectively, the Health Care Professional is required to accept as payment in full by the CICO the amounts the Health Care Professional could collect for that service if the beneficiary were enrolled in original Medicare or Medicaid FFS . However, the CICO is not required to reimburse the Health Care Professional more than the Health Care Professional's charge for that service. The original Medicare reimbursement amounts for providers of services (as defined by section 1861(u) of the Act) do not include payments under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 412.105(g) and 413.76. A section 1861(u) provi der of services may be paid an amount that is less than the amount it could receive if the beneficiary were enrolled in original Medicare or Medicaid FFS if the provider expressly notifies the Contractor in writing that it is billing an amount less than such amount. Enrollees maintain improper / inappropriate billing (sometimes previously referred to as balance billing ) protections. If an Enrollee is receiving any item or service that would not otherwise be covered by the CICO at an in -network level after the continuity of care period, the CICO must notify the Enrollee prior to the end of the continuity of care period, according to the requirements at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.404 and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.568.

The W aiver S ervice Plan when appropriate will be available to the transferring CICO via Phoenix. If an Enrollee is receiving medical care or treatment as an in patient in an acute care hospital at the time coverage under this Contract is terminated, the CICO shall arrange for the conti nuity of care or treatment for the current episode of illness until such medical care or treatment has been fully transferred to a treating Provider who has agreed to assume responsibility for such medical care or treatment for the remainder of that hospital episode and subsequent follow- up care. The CICO must maintain documentation of such transfer of responsibility of medical care or treatment. For hospital stays that would otherwise be reimbursed under Medicare or the South Carolina State Medicaid Program on a per diem basis, the CICO shall be liable for payment for any medical care or treatment provided to an Enrollee until the effective date of disenrollment. For hospital stays that would otherwise be reimbursed under Medicare or the South Carolina State Medicaid Program on a diagnosis- related group ( DRG) basis, the CICO shall be liable for payment for any inpatient medical care or treatment provided to an Enrollee where the discharge date is after the effective date of disenrollment.

These withhold measures are det ailed in Section 4.4.4. In or d er to rec eive any w ithhold payments, the CICO shall com ply w ith al l SCDHHS and CMS w ithhold measur e requirements whi le maintaining satis factory perform ance on al l other Contract r equirements. Enrollee Inc en tives The entives, as appropr iate, to promote engagement in specif ic behaviors There must be a reasonable connection between the i ncentivized behaviors and Enrollees' care goals or the medical and support services provided to Enrollees. For example, incentivized behaviors may include, but are not limited to, receiving recommended clinical screenings and preventive services, visiting a PCP regularly, participation in CICO wellness initiatives, adherence to a treatment regime, adherence to a drug regime, adherence to a care plan, or management of a chronic disease or condition. 163 There must also be a reasonable connection between t he incentives offered and the Enrollees' care goals or the medical and support services provided to Enrollees. For example, incentives may include, but not limited to, first aid supplies, utilities, public transportation, therm ometers, environmental modifications and home repairs, personal care services, including respite, and home goods that support independence, such as microwaves . CICOs may not offer incentives that are unrelated to Enrollee care or support, such as theater tickets or beauty products. The CICO must mo nitor the ef fectiveness of such Enrollee in centives in promoting the incentivized behaviors. The CICO can use this monitoring to revise the incentive program during the a nnual Plan Benefit Package submission. Revisions to incentive programs must take into co nsideration Enrollee feed back on the existing program and/or proposed changes to the program; The CICO must mo n itor its incentive programs for fraud, waste, and abuse committed by, but not limited to, providers and Enrollees. The nominal v alue of each in-kind Enrollee in centive cannot exceed twenty -five dollars ( $25). Enrollees may not receive incentives valued in excess o f one thousand dollars ($1000) per calendar year. This limit applies to beneficiaries who disenroll (or are disenrolled from) the CICO and re- enroll with the same CICO within the same calendar year. Enrollee i nc entive programs must be offered to all current enrollees, and if used in marketing materials , must be marketed to all eligible beneficiaries, without discrimination based on race, national origin, gender, disability, chronic disease, whether a person res ides or receives services in an institutional setting, or other prohibited basis. Further, when marketing Enrollee incentive programs to potential enrollees, plans must do so in conjunction with Plan benefits. CICOs may include some incentives for Enrollee s to receive services that are only available to males or females, 164 such as prostate exams or mammograms. At the dir ecti on of SCDHHS , SCDHHS ad hoc r eport inform ation relating to planned and i mpleme nted Enrollee in centives and ensure that all such Enrollee incentives com ply w ith all applicabl e Medicare-Medic aid marketing guidanc e, as well as state and federal laws . SCDHHS may also request the CICO to provide reports on enrollee incentive programs at regular intervals if SCDHHS deems doing so necessary to monitor the effectiveness or the integrity of such pograms. CMS and/or SCDHHS may require changes to the C ICO's enroll ee incentive program(s) if the programs are found to be grossly inconsistent with the parameters outlined this section, in violation of any applicable guidance, or a source of fraud, waste, or abuse. Enrollee Accounts CICO s may, at their discretion, establish accounts to be used and be directed by the Enrollee or designee to purchase non- covered services. Accounts are considered Enrollee incentive programs and are therefore subject to all the program limitations outlined in Sections 2.12.9.3.1 through 2.12.9.3.10 with the exception of the nominal per-incentive and annual incentive limits in Sections 2.12.9.3.6 and 2.12.9.3.7. CICOs mayat their discretion, set pa rameters regarding reward amounts, and frequency limitations . Such accounts should be designed to p rovide Enrollees with the flexibility to supplement their covered care with services and/or supports that will help them to maintain or improve their conditions. Accounts should also 165 promote Enrollee engagement and self- determination. Accounts must allow Enro ll ees to purchase only non-covered services or supports that contribute to an Enrollee's overall health. Non-covered services and supports include medical or LTSS benefits that are not covered by the plan, services in excess of the covered amounts, and other supportive non-medical services. For example, CICOs could allow enrollees to apply the account funds toward services and items such as, but not limited to, dentures, nursing facility personal needs allowances, personal assistance with activities of daily living, or home modifications to make the Enrollee's personal residence safer or more accessible. Accounts cannot be used to pay for cove red services, nor may CICOs allow Enrollees to apply the account funds toward items or activities solely intended for entertainment, home improvements unrelated to or unnecessary for the Enrollee's condition, or items or services intended primarily for anyone other than Enrollee. For example, an Enrollee could not use the account funds to contribute upgrades to an institutional setting that would typically be the responsibility of the facility or for home modifications intended to accommodate a co -resident's mobility needs. Accounts should not be used for the purchase of entertainment items such as books, televisions, or gaming systems. This section is not an exhaustive list of prohibited services or items. The CICO is responsible for designing and ove rseeing the accounts such the 166 accounts are not subject to fraud, waste, or abuse by any party while ensuring that Enrollees have the independence to control their own accounts. CICOs, through their care coordinators or member services department, must provide Enrollees with information or assistance with which to find reputable service providers when the Enrollee seeks to use the account to purchase services from providers outside the CICO's network of clinical or LTSS providers. For example, if the CICO permits Enrollees to use the accounts for home modifications, then the CICO must help Enrollees to find professi onal service providers who meet industry qualifications. CICOs may provide Enrollees with lists of pre-screened service providers and may prohibit Enrollees from using providers known for fraud, waste, abuse, lack of professional credentials, or other qua lity-related concerns. Accounts must be overseen by a fin ancial intermediary that provides counseling and guidance to Enrollees to support both independence and program integrity. Beha vioral He alth Se rvices Outcom es The CICO shall require behavior al heal th Providers to measure and collect clinical outcomes data, and t o incorporate that data in treatment data av ailable to the CICO , upon request ; The C ICO 's behavio ral health Provider Contra cts shal l require the Provider to make avai lable behavi oral health clinical assessme nt and out comes data for quality management and network management purposes; 167 The CICO shal l use outcome meas ures based on behavior al heal th care best pra ctices. As directed by SCDHHS , the CICO shall collaborate w ith behavior al health Providers to deve lop out come m easures that ar e specif ic to each behavior al heal th service ty pe. Such outcome me asures may include: occurr ences; Treatmen t drop -out; Rate of utilization of community based services compared to inpatient services; Leng t h of time bet ween admissions; and Treatment goals achieved. External Audit/Accredita tion Results The CICO shal l inform SCDHHS if it is national ly accredited or if it has sought and been denied such accredita tion, and su bmit to SCDHHS , at SCDHHS ' direction, a summary of it s accredita tion stat us and the results , if any, in add ition to the results of oth er quality-related exter nal au dits, if any. Health Info r mation Syst em The CICO shall maintain a health i nform ation syst em or syst ems consistent with the r equirements e stablished in the Contract and that support s all a spects of t he QI Progr am. 2.12.10. E valuation Activities SCDHHS , C MS, and its designated agent(s) will conduct periodic evaluations of the Demonstration over time from multiple perspectives using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The evaluations will be used for program improvement purposes and to assess the Demonstration's overall impact on various outcomes including,but not limited to , Enrollment/disenrollment patterns, Enrollee access and quality of care experiences, utilization and costs by service type (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, home health, prescription 168 drugs, nursing facility, and home and community based waiver), and progra m staff and P rovider experiences. As such, the evaluations will include surveys, site visits, analysis of claims and Encounter Data, focus groups, key informant interviews, and document reviews. The CICO shall participate in evaluation activities as directed by CMS and/or SCDHHS and provide information or data upon request. 2.13.

Capitated Rate Structur e 4.2.1. Medicaid Component of the Capitation Payment SCDHHS s hall pay the CICO a monthly capitation amount ( the Medicaid Component) based on the rate cell of the Enrollee, a sum equal to the product of the approved Capitation Rate and the number of Enrollees enrolled in that category as of the first day of that month. Exce pt as provided in Section 4.5.1, an Enrollee's rate c ell will be determined by his or her residential status as of the first day of the month and as outlined in Exhibit 1 Medicaid Rate Cell Categories . SCDHHS will use its eligibility system to determine an Enrollee's rate cell. When there are delays in changes to an Enrollee's residential status in SCDHHS eligibility system, SCDHHS will adjust past Capitation P ayments as needed . The baseline spending data for Medicaid services used for cal culating the C apitation R ates is the most recent two -year historical fee -for-service data from the total population that would have been eligible for Enrollment in the Demonstration during the historical baseline period. Completion factors are calculated and applied to the baseline data, in order to include expenditures for services that were incurred but not reported in the available data. The data are then adjusted for known policy and program changes that will be in effect during the contract period. The completed and adjusted data are trended forward to the midpoint of the contract period and used to develop C apitation R ates. All steps in this process are subject to CMS review. The C a pitation P ayments are based on the rate cell structure and are generated by SCDHHS at the rates established in this Contract. Any and all costs incurred by the CICO in excess of the C apitation Payment will be borne in full by the CIC O. 195 Exhibit 1 Medicaid Rate Cell Categories Rate Cell Description NF1: Nursing Facility - based Care Includes individuals identified as having a nursing facility stay of more than three ( 3) months and meet ing Medicare skilled nursing criteria or Medicaid Nursing facility Level of Care.

The Medicare Advantage baseline spending will include costs that would have occurred absent the Demonstration, such as quality bonus payments for applicable Medicare Advantage plans. The FFS county rates will generally reflect amounts published with the April Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement, adjusted to fully incorporate more current hospital wage index and physician geographic practice cost index information; in this Demonstration, this adjustment will be fully applied to the FFS county rates in 2017, but the adjustment will otherwise use the same methodologies and timelines used to make the analogous adjustments in Medicare Advantage. CMS may also further adjust the Medicar e FFS standardized county rates as necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for t he Demonstration. To the extent that the published FFS county rates do not conform with current law in effect for Medicare during an applicable payment month, and to the extent that such nonconformance would have a significant fiscal impact on the Demonstr ation, CMS will update the baseline (and therefore the corresponding payment rate) to calculate and apply an accurate payment rate for such month. Such update may take place retroactively, as needed. Separate baselines will exist for Enrollees meeting the Medicare ESRD criteria. For Enrollees with ESRD in the dialysis or transplant status phases, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the ESRD dialysis state rate. For Enrollees in the functioning graft status phase, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the Medicare Advantage 3.5 % bonus county rate (benchmark) for the applicable county. Both baseline spending and payment rates under the Demonstration for Medicare Parts A/B services will be calculated as per member per month (PMPM) standardized amounts for each county participating in the Demonstration for each year. Enrollee risk scores will be applied to the standardized rates at the time of payment. 197 The Medicare A/B Component will be updated annually c onsistent with annual FFS estimates and Medicare Advantage rates released each year with the annual rate announcement. Medicare Part D The Medicare Part D baseline for the Part D Direct Subsidy will be set at the Part D national average monthly bid amount (NAMBA) for the calendar year. CMS will estimate an average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost-sharing subsidy and f ederal reinsurance amounts; these payments will be reconciled after the end of each payment year in the same manner as for all Part D sponsors. The CY 2017 Part D NAMBA is $61.08. The monthly Medicare Part D Component for an Enrollee can be calculated by multiplying the Part D NAMBA by the RxHCC risk score assigned to the individual, and then adding to this estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost-sharing subsidy and f ederal reinsurance amounts. 4.2.3. A ggregate Savings Percentages Aggregate savings percentages will be applied equally, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare Parts A/B Component and the Medicaid Component of the capitated rate, provided that such savings percentages may be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2.3.2. Demonstration Year 1: 1% Demonstration Year 2: 2% Demonstration Year 3: 4% Rate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year, how ever savings percentages will be calculated and applied based on Demonstration Years. Savings percentages will not be applied to the Part D component of t he rate. CMS will monitor Part D costs closely on an ongoing basis. Any material change in Part D costs relative to the baseline may be factored into future year savings percentages. 4.2.4. R isk Adjustment Methodology 198 Medicare Parts A/B: The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted based on the risk profile of each Enrollee . Except as specified below, the existing Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC and CMS -HCC ESRD risk adjustment methodology will be used for the Demonstration. In calendar year 2015, CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees . This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in 2015 with Medicare Advantage experience in 2014, prior to the Demonstration. In calendar year 2016, CM S will apply an appropriate coding intensity adjustment r eflective of all Demonstration Enrollees ; this will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in CY 2015 with prior Medicare Advantage experience and/or Demonstration experience based on the Demonstration's Enrollment phase- in as of September 30, 2015. After calendar year 201 6, CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment to all Demonstration Enrollees . The coding intensity adjustment factor will not be applied duri ng the Demonstration to risk scores for Enrollees with an ESRD status of dialysis or transplant, consistent with Medicare Advantage policy. Medicare Part D: The Medicare Part D NAMBA will be risk adjusted in accordance with existing Part D RxHCC methodology. The estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost- sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will not be risk adjusted. Medicaid: The Medicaid component will employ rating categories des cribed in Section 4.2.1. 4.3. M edical Loss Ratio (MLR) 4.3.1. Medical loss r atio G uarantee The CICO has a target medical loss r atio of eighty- five (85) percent . 199 If the medical loss r ati o calculated as set forth below is less than the target medical loss r atio, the CICO shall refund to SCDHHS and CMS an amount equal to the difference between the calculated MLR and the targe t MLR (expressed as a percentage) multiplied by the coverage year r evenue. SCDHHS and CMS shall calculate a MLR for Enrollees under this Contract for each cove rage year, beginning with Demonstration Year 1 , and shall provide to the CICO the amount to be refunded, if any, to SCDHHS and CMS respectively. Any refunded amounts will be distributed back to the Medicaid and Medicare programs, with the amount to each payor based on the proportion between the Medicare and Medicaid Components. At the option of CMS and SCDHHS , separately, any amount to be refunded may be recovered either by requiring the CICO to make a payment or by an offset to future Capitation Payment. The MLR c alculation shall be determined as set forth below; however, SCDHHS and CMS may adopt NAIC reporting standards and protocols after giving written notice to the CICO . MLR will be ba sed on 438.8 except that the numerator in the MLR calculation will include: All Covered Services required in the Demonstration under Section 2.4 and A ppendix A ; Any services purchased in lieu of more costly Covered Services an d consistent with the objectives of the Demonstration ; and Care Coordination Expense. That portion of the personnel cos ts for Care Coordinators whose primary duty is direct Enrollee contact that is attributable to this Contract shall be inc luded as a benefit e xpense. The portion of the personnel costs for CICO 's medical d irector that is attributable to this Contr act shall be included as a benefit expense. The revenue used in the MLR calculation will consist of the Capitation payments, as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.2.4, due from SC DHHS and CMS for services provided during the coverage year . Revenue will include amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.4.4, regardless of whether the CICO actually receives the amount in Section 4.4.4. Data Submission. The CICO s hall submit to SCDHHS and CMS, in the form and manner prescribed by SCDHHS and CMS, the 200 necessary data to calculate and verify the MLR within eleven (11) months after the end of the coverage year. Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. Within ninety (90) days following t he eleven (11) month data submission, SCDHHS and CMS shall calculate the MLR by dividing the benefit expense by the r evenue. The MLR shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to the second decimal point. The CICO shall have sixty (60) days to review the MLR c alculatio n. Each p arty shall have the right to review all data and methodologies used to calculate the MLR . Coverage Year. The coverage year s hall be the demonstration year. The MLR c alculation shall be prepared usi ng all data available from the coverage year, including IBNP and six (6) months of run-out for benefit expense (excluding sub-capitation paid during the run-out months). 4.4. P ayment Terms 4.4.1. Timing of Capitation Payments CMS and SCDHHS will each m ake monthly Capitation P ayments to the CICO . If an individual is enrolled with the CICO on the first day of a month, the CICO has the responsibility of providing Covered Services to that Enrollee for that month, even if the Enrollee moves to another locality. If the Enrollee moves to a locality outside of the CICO 's Service A rea, the Enrollee will be disenrolled from the CICO at the end of the month of change. Any and all costs incurred by the CICO in excess of the C apitation Payment will be borne in full by the CICO . The CICO shall accept SCDHHS 's electronic transfer of funds to receive C apitation P ayments. The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be the product of the Enrollee 's CMS -HCC risk score multiplied by the relevant standard county payment rate (or the ESRD dialysis state rate by the HCC ESRD risk score, as applicable). The Medicare Part D Component will be the product of the Enrollee 's RxHCC risk score multiplied by the Part D N AMBA , with the addition of the estimated average monthly prospective payment for the low- income cost -sharing subsidy and federal reinsurance amounts. The Medicaid component for each rate cell will be product of the num ber of Enrollees in each ca tegory multiplied by the payment rate for that rate cell. Enrollee contributions will not be deducted during the initial three ( 3) months when an Enrollee enters into a nursing facility. 201 Enrollments CMS will make monthly PM PM Capitation Payment to the CICO . The PMPM C apitation P ayment for a particular month will reflect payment for the Enrollees with effective E nrollment into the CICO 's Demonstration plan a s of the first day of that month as outlined in 2.3.2. Capitation rates are calculated net of an estimated average patient pay amount. The net amount is calculated by applying estimated reimbursement rate changes to the gross facility rate and subtracting trended average pay amounts. SCDHHS w ill make monthly PMPM Capitation Payments to the CICO for the current month's Enrollment (e.g., payment for June Enrollm ent will occur in early June, July payment will be made in early July ). The PMPM C apitation Payment for a particular month will reflect payment for the Enrollees with an active Enrollment into the CICO 's Demonstration plan as of the first day of the current month. Disenrollments The final PMPM Ca pitation P ayment made by CMS and SCDHHS to the CICO for each Enrollee will be for the month: a) in which the disenrollment was submitted, b) the Enrollee loses eligibility, or c) the Enrollee dies (see Section 2.3.5). 4.4.2. E nrollee Contribution to Care Amounts Patient Liability is the payment amount required for individuals who are residing in nursing facilities . This amount is calculated using an individual's monthly recurring income minus a standard personal needs allowance. Patient Liability is required to be calculated for every Enrollee receiving nursing facility services, although not every Eligible Beneficiary will be required to pay each month. SCDHHS w ill provide information to the CICO that identifies Enrollees who are required to pay a Patient Liability amount and the amount of the obligation as part of the monthly transition report. SCDHHS Capitation P ayments to CICO s for Enrollees who are required to pay a Patient Liability amount will be net of the actual monthly Patient Liability amount. 202 It is the responsibility of the nursing facility P rovider(s) to collect the Patient Liability amount from Enrollees , and the CICO may reduce reimbursements to nursing facility Providers equal to the Patient Liability amount each month. Patient Liability amounts are to be collected at the beginning of the first full calendar month either upon completion of a traditional Medicare skilled/rehab stay or upon admission as a traditional Medicaid custodial resident. 4.4.3. M odifications to Capitation Rates CMS and SCDHHS may propose modifications, additions, or deletions to the rate cell structure over the course of the Demonstration. Any modifications to the rate cell structure will be subject to agreement by the other governmental party. CMS and SCDHHS will confer with the CICO on any such changes in adva nce as appropriate and possible . CMS and SCDHHS will inform the CICO of any decisions regardi ng changes in rate cell structures in writing, and the CICO shall accept such changes as payment in full as described in Section 4.7. Any mid -ye ar rate changes would be articulated in a rate report. Rates will be updated using a similar process for each calendar year. Subject to Section 4.4.3.3 below , chan ges to the Medicare and Medicaid baselines (and therefore to the corresp onding payment rate) outside of the annual Medicare Advantage rate announcement and annual Medicaid rate update will be made only if and when CMS and SCDHHS jointly determine the change is necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. Such changes may be based on the following factors: shifts in E nrollment assumptions; major changes or discrepancies in federal law and/or state policy used in the development of baseline estimates; and changes to coding intensity. For changes solely affecting the Medicare program baseline. CMS wi ll update baselines by amounts identified by the independent CMS Office of the Actuary necessary to best effectuate accurate payment rates for each mont h. Subject to Section 4.4.3.3 above , if other statutory changes enacted after the annual baseline determination and rate development process are jointly determined by CMS and the SCDHHS to have a material change in baseline estimates for any given payment year, baseline estimates and corresponding standardized payment rates shall be updated outside of the annual rate development process. CMS and/or SCDHHS will make changes to baseline estimates within thirty ( 30) days of identification of the need for such changes, 203 and changes will be applied, if necessary on a retrospective basis, to effectuate accurate payment rates for each month. Changes to the savings percentages will be made if and when CMS and SCDHHS jointly determine that changes in Part D spending have resulted in materially higher or lower savings that need to be recoup ed through higher or lower savings percentages applied to the Medicare A/B baselines. Any material changes in the Medicaid State P lan and 1915(c) waivers , including pertaining to Covered Services, payment schedules and related methodologies, shall be refle cted in corresponding capitation payment adjustments. The CICO will not be required to implement such changes without advance notice and corresponding adjustment in the C apitation Payment. In addition, to the extent other Medicaid costs are incurred absent the Demonstration, such costs shall be reflected in corresponding Capitation P ayment adjustments. 4.4.4. Quality Withhold Policy Under the Demonstration, both CMS and SCDHHS will withhold a percentage of their respective components of the Capitation R ate, with the exception of Part D component amounts . The withheld amounts will be repaid subject to the CICO 's performance consistent with established quality thresholds. CMS and SCDHHS will evaluate the CICO 's performance according to the specified metrics required in order to earn back the quality withhold for a given year. Whether or not the CICO has met the quality requirements in a given year will be made public . Additional details regarding the quality withholds, including more detailed specifications, required thresholds and other information regarding the methodology will be made available in separate technical guidance. Determination of whether the CICO has met required quality withhold requirements will be based solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on actual enrollment volume during the demonstration year. Withhold Measures in Demonstration Year 1 Exhibit 2 b elow identifies the withhold measures for Demonstr ati on Year 1. Together, these will be utilized as 204 the basis for a one (1) percent withhold. Because Demonstration Year 1 crosses calendar and Contract years, the C ICO will be evaluated to determine whether it has met required quality withhold requirements at the end of both CY 2015 and CY 2016. The determination in CY 2015 will be based solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on the actual Enrollment volume during CY 2015. Consistent with such evaluations, the withheld amounts will be repaid separately for each calendar year. Additional details, including technical specifications, withhold methodology and required benchmarks, will be provided in separate guidance.

Transitions between Rating Categories and Risk Score Changes 4.5.1. Rating Category Changes The Medicaid Component of the Capitation Rates will be updated following a change in an Enrollee 's status relative to the rate cells in Section 4.2.1. On a monthly basis, as part of Capitation P a yment processing, the rating category of each Enrollee will be determined. The Medicaid Component payment implications for Enrollee movement among rate cells are described below. SCDHHS will pay the HCBS Waiver Plus rate for the first three (3) months following the month of an nursing facility discharge for an Enrollee who had been in a nursing facility for at least ninety (90) calendar days and moves to a HCBS Waiver. SCDHHS will pay the HCBS Waiver Plus rate for the first three (3) months that an Enrollee, first eligible for nursing facility services or HCBS Waiver services, is served in a HCBS Waiver without being admitted to a nursing facility . 208 For nursing facility admissions, for the first three (3) months an Enrollee is a Resident of a nursing facility following the month of admission to a nursing facility , the SCDHHS will pay the Capitation Rate being paid during the month of admission, and not the Capitation R ate for the nursing f acility rate cell. 4.5.2. M edicare Risk Score Changes Medicare CMS -HC C, HCC -ESRD, and RxHCC risk scores will be updated consistent with prevailing Medicare Advantage regulations and processes. 4.6. R econciliation 4.6.1. General CMS and SCDHHS will implement a process to reconcile Enrollment and C apitation P ayments for the CICO that will take into consideration the following circumstances: Transitions between rate cells ; Retroactive changes in eligibility, rat e cel ls, or Enrollee contribution amounts; Changes in CMS-HCC and RxHCC risk scores; and, Changes through new Enrollment, disenrollment, or death. The reconciliation may identify underpayments or overpayments to the C ICO. 4.6.2. Medicaid Capitation Reconciliation Retroactive adjustments to Enrollment and payment shall be forwarded to the CICO within thirty ( 30) business days upon receipt of updated/corrected information. The CICO shall cover retroactive adjustments to E nrollment without regard to timelines of the adjustment. The CICO shall assure correct payment to Providers as a result of Enrollment updates/corrections. SCDHHS shall assure correct payment to the CICO for any retroactive E nrollment adjustments. Adjustments shall be retroactive no more than eighteen (18) months, unless otherwise agreed to by the CICO and the SCDDHS . Payments to the CICO will be adjusted for retroactive disenrollment of Enrollees, changes to Enrollee information that affect the Capitation R ates (e.g., eligibility classification), monetary sanctions and penalties imposed in accordance with Section 5.3.14, 209 rate changes in accordance with Sectio n 4.5.1, or other miscellaneous adjustments provided for herein. 4.6.3. Medicare Capitation Reconciliation Medicare capitation reconciliation will comply with prevailing M edicare Advantage and Part D regulations and processes. Final Medicare Reconciliation and Settlement In the event the CICO terminates or non- r enews this Contract, CMS' final settlement phase for terminating contracts applies. This final settlement phase lasts for a minimum of eighteen ( 18) months after the end of the calendar year in which the termination date occurs. This final settlement will include reconciliation of any demonstration-specific payments or recoupments, including those related to quality withholds, medical loss ratios , as applicable, that are outstanding at the time of termination 4.6.4. A udits/Monitoring CMS and SCDHHS will conduct periodic audits to validate rate cell assignments or other coding. Audits may be conducted by a peer review organization or other entity assigned this responsibility by CMS and SCDHHS . 4.7. P ayment in Full 4.7.1. General The CICO m ust accept as payment in full for all Covered Services the C apitation Rate(s) and the terms and conditions of payment set forth herein , except as provided in Appendix A Section A.1.

The CICO shall pay ninety-nine (99) percent of all clean claims from Providers, including Indian H ealth C are Providers , within ninety (90) days of the date of receipt. The date of receipt is the date as indicated by its dat e stamp on the claim. The date of payment is the date of the check or other form of payment. The CICO and its Providers may, by mutual agreement, establish an alternative payment schedule. 213 The SCDHHS m ay conduct audits of the CICO by using the date of service and date of payment to identify and audit the CICO to ensure the CICO is adhering to the requirement. In c onjunction with Provider LTSS workgroups, the CICO will develop uniform claims submission standards. Uniform standards include but are not limited to the utilization of a web -based portal for initial claims submission and to reduce claim denial. The CICO shall develop and implement protocols, prior approved by SCDHHS, that specify the CICO's criteria for providing one-on- one assistance to a Provider and the type of assistance the CICO will provide. At a minimum, the CICO shall contact a Provider if, during the first year after implementation of the Demon stration , the CICO has or will deny ten (10) percent or more of the total value of the Provider's claims for a rolling thirty (30) day period, and shall, in addition to issuing a remittance advice, contact the Provider to review each of the error(s)/reason (s) for denial and advise how the Provider can correct the error for resubmission (as applicable) and avoid the error/reason for denial in the future.

Transition of Home and Community Based Services C.1 SCDHHS 's service delivery model includes a transition of HCBS responsibilities to the CICO during the Demonstration period. This section describes the plan for transition of HCBS authority to CICO s and details the activities, responsibilities and benchmarks for each transition phase. C.1.1 Phase I of the transition (began February 1, 2015) closely resembles the operations of SCDHHS 's current HCBS system and is considered a time to transfer knowledge of this system to the CICO s. C.1.2 Phase II ( to begin no earlier than September 1 , 2016) begins the transition of the system's functions that were previously performd by SCDHHS to the CICO s. This phase is designed to support the activities necessary to positively influence the continued integration of HCBS. C.1.3 Phase III ( to begin no earlier than April 1, 2017 concludes the total transformation of SCDHHS 's HCBS system . At this point, the CICO s assume all the responsibilities, including self -direction, needed to continue to adequately coordinate these services. C.2 Benchmark Review C.2.1 The CICO must pass an HCBS benchmark review prior to assuming the responsibilities of Phase II or Phase III. Benchmark reviews will be conducted by SCDHHS staff and its a gent. Failure to adequately address the benchmark standards could preclude the CICO from moving forward to the next phase of the HCBS transition and may impact a CICO 's eligibility for future passive enrollment. C.2.2 Review Timing C.2.2.1 Benchmark Review in Preparation for Phase II C.2.2.1.1 A Desk Review will occur no sooner than June 2015. C.2.2.1.2 SCDHHS will make a decision as to the CICO 's readiness no sooner than June 2016. C.2.2.1.3 The state may deem a CICO ready and allow the CICO to move into Phase II despite minor deficiencies. SCDHHS will re- review CICOs to ensure full resolution of any such minor issues no later than the second month of Phase II. 268 C.2.2.2 The Benchmark Review Period in Prep aration for Phase III C.2.2.2.1 A mixed Desk Review will begin no sooner than October 2016. C.2.2.2.2 SCDHHS will make a decision as to the CICO 's readiness no sooner than November 2016. C.2.2.3 If the CICO fails to adequately meet the benchmark standards, a corrective action plan, including specific dates, must be submitted to the review team within the time specified in the deficiency notice. C.3 A summary of the respective SCDHHS and CI CO roles and responsibilities over the course of the transition can be found in the Exhibit below.

For instance, more personal care providers are necessary to cover an area than adult day care providers or home delivered meals providers. C.6.2.3.2 Provider contracts : CICO s will use a standard HCBS contract language (i.e., SCDHHS approved scope of services) provided by SCDHHS during Phase II of the transition period to ensure consistent continuity of care standards are put into place. C.6.2.3.3 Provider rates : CICO s will be able to set HCBS provider rates using pre- established guidelines from SCDHHS. CICO s must comply with rate floors adjusted annually for each service that will set a minimum reimbursement level. These floors will also allow CICO s to create incentives for performance and quality. Rates that fall below 10 0 percent of the current FFS level should have a corresponding performance and/or quality incentive that should be reflective of 100 percent of the FFS rate (at a minimum). C.6.2.4 Authority for HCBS service plan development and service authorizations with SCDHHS concurrence. The CICO will exercise its authority by approving or disapproving the recommended service plan and service authorization submitted by the Waiver Case Manager.
