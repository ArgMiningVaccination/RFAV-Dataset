Dean is a [chiropractor](https://www.palmernaturalhealth.com/meet-the-staff) and an ardent conspiracy theorist. He has [claimed](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1443741687092846592) on his Twitter account that \"all vaccines are literal bullshit\" and that they are [part of](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1518908385525219330) a genocidal depopulation plan by the New World Order. His preposterous beliefs don't stop at vaccines or health care; Dean has also [said](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1519035527059673096) that \"9/11 was an inside job,\" has seemingly entertained flat Earth conspiracy theories, and has [proclaimed](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1434188665840885762) that the \"#Reptilian agenda is going to be exposed in my lifetime.\" (British author David Icke's The Reptilian Agenda [posits](https://www.amazon.com/DAVID-ICKE-REPTILIAN-David-Icke/dp/B0001GOH52) \"that a reptilian extraterrestrial race has controlled the world for thousands of years.\") Real America's Dan Ball, who hosted Dean for the interview, prefaced his appearance with a [nine-minute monologue](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/3990864) about -- among many other things -- President Joe Biden's \"regime\" extending a public health emergency to \"boost pandemic response funding,\" which he claimed will actually be used to \"pay off municipalities, government agencies,\" and \"people who helped him cheat.\" He also called COVID-19 a \"vaccine that isn't a vaccine.\" During the interview, Dean claimed to have \"saved countless lives doing natural means for this whole, you know, virus,\" adding, \"And it is not a vaccine, it's a bioweapon. Let's just call it what it is.\" Dean also complained about people still wearing masks, claiming, \"I've never put a mask on, and I'm a doctor, and I work with patients. Where's the disconnect here? They're programming the minds of Americans, and we need to change it.\" Ball shared Dean's website with the audience, saying, \"Check him out. Great information. He's out there spreading truth over the lies that's being pushed by Big Pharma and this Biden regime.\" The chiropractor's [website](https://bravetv.com) hosts a plethora of nonsense, including a front page [story](https://bravetv.com/looking-for-balance-3rd-eye-for-the-win/) by \"Lizzy from Boston\" about discovering her \"3rd eye for the win\" during her \"Saturn Return.\" It also features aggregated right-wing grievances like \" [LGBT Mob Targets Pizza and Cookies in Grooming Crusade](https://bravetv.com/lgbt-mob-targets-pizza-and-cookies-in-grooming-crusade/)\" and \" [The War Against The Unvaxxed Won't Be Forgotten](https://bravetv.com/the-war-against-the-unvaxxed-wont-be-forgotten/).\" On the site, Dean also falsely [argues](https://bravetv.com/psoriasis-causes-by-parasites/) that the [autoimmune disease](https://www.cdc.gov/psoriasis/index.htm) psoriasis is actually caused by parasites. Like other grifters in right-wing media, Dean also sells several homeopathic supplements. On a second website, he offers a \" [Children's Parasite Protocol](https://www.fullmoonprotocol.com/kids-protocol53352296)\" that claims to treat \"Allergies, Darkness under Eyes, Food Sensitivities, Ear Aches, Anal Itching, Digestive Issues and More,\" for only $137. And on a third website, he sells an \" [Autism Protocol](https://www.autismprotocol.com/heal54601844)\" to \"Start Your Child's Journey on the Road to Health\" for just $99. Both serum collections come with an offer to purchase a one-on-one consultation for an additional $59. Dean also piles his Twitter account high with absurdly false foolishness, such as: eat neurotransmitters.\" [Saying](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1526283607383461889) that vaccines cause sterilization, peanut allergies, ear infections, seizures, eczema, asthma, and death, all to create a \"cycle of profit.\" [Claiming](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1524190986246803458) that \"the more parasites you have, the more spiritual entities attach to you and vice versa.\" [Alleging](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1518908385525219330) that vaccines, \"especially the #COVID19 one,\" are a genocidal operation for depopulation by the New World Order. [Suggesting](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1491948967621451800) that COVID-19 vaccines will infect people with HIV because Biden's chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci \"wanted depopulation for his Cabal puppet masters.\" [Sharing](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1493063633240268802) an image that claimed watching the Super Bowl means \"directly supporting racism, cults and human trafficking.\" [Alleging](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1525860104943304705) a link between World Wrestling Entertainment, Scooby-Doo, the military, Freemasonry, and Donald Trump, whom he called \"The Chosen One, by the Military.\" [Suggesting](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1440520862218665984) that the Earth is flat: \"Why are people so offended by the Flat Earth conversation? Are you harmed if it's flat?\" [Proclaiming](https://twitter.com/BraveTVDoc/status/1434188665840885762) that \"the #Reptilian agenda is going "}
