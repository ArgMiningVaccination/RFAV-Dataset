You don't want to skimp on either of these. What is a Cacao Ceremony? Humans have considered cacao a sacred plant for thousands of years. Now you can join the modern rediscovery of this plant and experience the benefits for yourself. Cacao is a Doorway to Transformation When consumed in sufficient quantity and in the right setting, cacao is a powerful catalyst for all types of inner work. In a cacao ceremony, we work with this plant medicine to support our healing & growth. When approached this way, cacao will offer opportunities to cultivate greater self-love, awareness and expansion of our consciousness. Cacao pairs beautifully with many other practices, including meditation, yoga, dance, community circle's and shamanic journeying, among others. Start With The Good Stuff If you want to experience the magic, you need to use the right ingredients Start with Pure, Ceremonial Grade Cacao Unlike chocolate, ceremonial grade cacao does not contain sugar, milk, preservatives, or anything else that might interfere with or negate the benefits of pure cacao.

Tips for a Successful Cacao Ceremony Whether you want to facilitate a cacao ceremony for yourself or for others, you'll want to be sure to do it right. If you've ever done cacao ceremony with weak or no noticeable benefits, be sure to follow these simple guidelines for a successful cacao ceremony. Tip # 1 - The Cacao Make sure you are using high quality ceremonial cacao such as our embue Ceremonial Grade Cacao. High quality ceremonial cacao is a totally different thing from processed chocolate. In fact, most chocolate has been processed in ways that make it far less potent. You must be sure to use ceremonial grade cacao. Tip # 2: The Dose Be certain to use enough cacao per serving in order to be feel the effects. We recommend between one and two ounces of pure cacao per person. Too little and the benefits will be too weak to notice. Too much, on the other hand, can be unpleasant. For most people between one and two ounces is appropriate. Tip # 3 - Set & Setting Consume the cacao in a setting that is supportive for your goal. For example, if you want to use [cacao ceremony to facilitate meditation](/pages/ceremonial-cacao-practices-exercises), set that intention beforehand and make sure everyone who is participating is aware of the intention. Or if you are [performing cacao ceremony](/pages/ceremonial-cacao) in order to facilitate heart-centered sharing and connection, make sure everyone knows the intention and create the environment to support that with lighting, music, and so forth. Working With The Cacao Other than the tips above, there are not a lot of fixed rules. A modern cacao ceremony doesn't have a set format, ritual or belief. Cacao is an extremely versatile medicine that will support where you need to go. It flows from the magic of the cacao itself, paired with your intention. Just get some ceremonial grade cacao, brew the drink (you can find our recipe on our [ceremonial drink page](https://www.embuecacao.com/pages/ceremonial-drink)), set the intention, and let the beauty unfold. Feel free to experiment with dance, meditation, prayer, chanting, talking circles, massage, art, yoga, or anything else. Cacao will facilitate the best experience possible.

Too little cacao and you won't experience the benefits. Too much cacao can leave you feeling slightly unwell. We recommend that you consume between one and two ounces per ceremony per person. If you are new to cacao or if you are experimenting with increasing the amount you consume, start by drinking about half to two thirds of the total serving. Wait half an hour, and if you desire more, finish the serving at that time. #3 Mistake: Not Staying Hydrated And the third biggest mistake people make is not drinking enough water during and after the ceremony.
