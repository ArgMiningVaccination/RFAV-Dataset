Widespread administration of a safe and effective vaccine has the potential to substantially reduce the health and societal impacts of the pandemic when combined with improved diagnostics, therapies, and non-medical interventions. However, i mmediately after COVID- 19 vaccine(s) are authorized or approved by the FDA, the supply will be insufficient to immunize all persons who are willing to accept the vaccine . Therefore, a fair, equitable, evidence -based, and transparent policy is needed to pri oritize those who should be offered the vaccine initially until the capacity to manufacture and administer the vaccine increases. To maximize the benefits of immunization d uring the initial phase of distribution , the limited supply of COVID- 19 vacci ne will require a focused strategy . Vaccine administration will ramp up as the volume of vaccine doses available per month continues to increase , and the distribution strategy expands on a phased basis from a focused approach to broader populations . The overarc hing aim of these guidelines is to r educe severe disease, deaths, and negative societal impact s due to the transmission of SARS-CoV- 2. During Phase 1a, initial goals include prevent ing California's health system from being overwhelm ed by maintaining essential health and emergency services and preventing s evere illness those at highest risk . These r ecommendations reflect that, at the time of initial availability, evidence will indicate that COVID- 19 vaccine protects against COVID -19 disea se. Evidence of the vaccine's impact on COVID - 19 mortality will likely follow. However, current evidence is too limited as of December 2020 to determine whether or not the vaccine will protect against the spread of SARS- CoV2 infection to others . Ethical P rinciples and Criteria for Vaccine Allocation These guidelines are intended to support the initial phase (1a) of vaccine distribution in a way that can be ethically and effectively adapted to a range of plausible scenarios. Equity is a primary priority for the Drafting Guidelines Workgroup and the CDPH . Health equity \"... is defined as the absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among population groups defined socially, economically, demographically or ge ographically \" [1]. Promoting equity is urged in all aspects of COVID -19 vaccination in California. 2 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) In developing these guidelines , the Work group drew upon e thical frameworks developed by national recommending bodies , including the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) [2], CDC's ommittee 4] , and others [5-7]. Each of these groups established a n ethical framework to support their recommendations , which converge on five core principles: benefiting people and limiting harm ; prioritizing equity ; ensuring equal concern; promoting transparency; and prioritizing based on evidence. Foundational Principles Benefiting people and limiting harm is the responsibility to protect and promote the public's health and well -being by reducing ris k of infection, severe disease, and death from COVID- 19 among people who are at highest ris k and those who are essential to critical societal functions. Prioritizing equity ensures that allocation plans address disproportionate burdens experienced by the certain groups \u2014which are strongly associated with race, ethnicity, occupation, and socioeconomic status \u2014by mitigating inequities and giving priority to the worst off . Ensuring equal concern requires that every person be considered and treated equally. Unless related to the first two ethical principles, d ifferences between individuals or groups should not factor into allocation decisions . Procedural Principles Promoting transparency involves communicat ing openly and clearly with the public about how allocation strategies are developed and deployed, as well as updating the plan as new information becomes available. Prioritizing based on evidence requires decisions about allocation to be based on the best available scientific evidence about the risks of disease, transmission, and societal impact . Risk-based Allocation Criteria These five ethical principles were used to develop risk -based al location criteria for prioritizing groups , according to the members' risks of : Negative societal impact : If members become ill with COVID- 19 disease, to what extent would it directly compromise societal functions or risk the lives or well- being of other individuals? Severe sickness and death due to COVID -19 disease : What is the likelihood that members will develop severe disease or die if they acquire SARS -CoV- 2 infection? 3 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) Spreading disease : What is the likelihood that members will spread COVID -19 disease t o others? Acquiring SARS -CoV-2 infection: What is the likelihood that members will live or work in settings where they have a higher probability of being exposed to SARS-CoV- 2? As described above, the ability of current and future data to measure each these criteria was also considered in the prioritization. The recommendations are summarized in the Figure below and described in detail thereafter. F igure : Summary of recommendations A. Populations Prioritized for Vaccination During Phase 1a Based on this ethical framework and the most up -to-date information about the COVID -19 pandemic and forthcoming vaccines, the Workgroup has identified t wo populations prioritized for vaccination during Phase 1a in California: (1) individuals who risk direct exposure to SARS - CoV- 2 by work ing in health care or long -term care settings and (2) residents of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and similar settings for individuals who are older or medically vulnerable . These include groups also identified by NASEM [2] and (ACIP) [3, 4, 8] . 4 Allocation for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) Individuals who risk direct exposure by working in health care or long- term care settings Up to 2 million Californians risk exposure to SARS -CoV-2 through their work in health care or long -term care settings. As of December 1, 2020, approximately 245,000 COVID -19 cases and 858 COVID -19-assoc iated deaths had been reported among U.S. health care personnel [8]. This group includes individuals who work in inpatient, outpatient, home -based, and community - based settings provid ing clinical care as well as non -clinical services (e.g., environmental services, patient transport, interpreters, laboratory worker s, etc. ). Allocation priority is based on the members' exposure risks during work, not outside of work. This group is prioritized during Phase 1a because its members play critical roles in maintaining capacity of California's health system and sustaining health services during the COVID -19 pandemic , both for those with COVID -19 and for those who need care due to other cause s. According to the risk -based allocation criteria, m embers of this group tend to have high risks of : (1) negative societal impact, if they are unable to work due to SARS- CoV-2 exposure or infection ; (2) spreading disease to others, particularly if they work in congregate residential or home -based care settings ; and (3) acquiring infection , through contact with patients or residents who have COVID -19. By staying healthy, members of this group can protect the health of others and help to reduce societal disruption. Prioritizing this target group in the initial phase may also help to expand access to vaccines across a range of different jobs and settings. It may also contribute to mitigating inequities, in that racial/ethnic minority groups are disproportionately represented among low -wage workers in this group. Residents of long- term care facilities Residents of skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities comprise less than 1% of the population of California (a bout 300,000- 400,000 people), yet they represent 6% of the state's COVID -19 cases and 34% of COVID -19 deaths [9]. This group is also prioritized for vaccination in Phase 1a , because they have high risk of severe sickness and death , as older age and underlying medical conditions are associated with greater risk s of hospitalization, ICU care, intubation, mechanical ventilation, or death due to COVID -19 [10-12]. They also have high risk of acquiring infection \u2014and moderate risk of spreading disease \u2014because they live in congregate settings , with limited ability to isolate and maintain social distance. 5 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) Recommendation A: Populations for Phase 1a During Phase 1a of allocation, COVID -19 vaccine should be offered to the following persons in California: Persons at risk of exposure to SARS -CoV- 2 through their work in any role in direct health care or long -term care settings. o This population includes persons at direct risk of exposure in their non- clinical roles, such as, but not limited to, environmental services, patient transport, or interpretation. Residents of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and similar long -term care settings for older or medically vulnerable individuals . B. Subprioritization During Phase 1a During the initial phases of vaccine distribution, supplies will likely be insufficient to administer the COVID -19 vaccine to all individuals within the Phase 1 a target groups who wish to receive it. To e nsure equitable allocation of the vaccine while supplies are scarce , health departments should subprioritize doses as needed to match the level of available supplies using three sequential ranked categories of persons exposed though work in health care or long -term care settings: (1) type of facility or role, (2) location of facility, and (3) attributes of individuals. Recommendation B: Subprioritization During Phase 1a During Phase 1a, if there are not enough doses of COVID -19 vaccine for all who choose to receive them, then health departments should subprioritize doses as needed to match the level of available supplies in a sequential fashion using the following ranked categories: o Persons exposed though work in health care or long -term care settings, by: 1. Type of facility or role 2. Location of facility 3. Attributes of individuals Health departments may reprioritize temporarily under limited circumstances described in Recomme ndation C. B1. Type of facility or role To maintain critical functions of the health care system , the first category for subprioritization during Phase 1a is the type of facility or occupational role , which the Workgroup has segmented into three tiers by applying the risk -based allocation criteria. 6 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) Recommendation B1: Subprioritization by type of facility or role If supplies are limited during Phase 1a, COVID -19 vaccines should be directed to as many tiers, and categories in each tier (e.g., hospitals) as possible to reach the prioritized populations. The tiers and categories in each tier are presented in ranked o rder. Persons immunizing the prioritized populations in a tier should be offered immunization during or before the same tier. Tier 1 Acute care, psychiatric and correctional facility hospitals Skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and similar settings for older or medically vulnerable individuals Also, in concordance with ACIP, residents in these settings Paramedics, EMTs and others providing emergency medical services Dialysis centers Tier 2 Intermediate care facilities for persons who need non- continuous nursing supervision and supportive care Home health care and in- home supportive services Community health workers, including promotoras Public health field staff Primary Care clinics, including Federally Qua lified Health Centers, Rural Health Centers, correctional facility clinics, and urgent care clinics Tier 3 Other settings and health care workers, including Specialty clinics Laboratory workers Dental and other oral health clinics Pharmacy staff not wo rking in settings at higher tiers B2. Location of f acility The second category for subprioritization during Phase 1a is the location of facility . Counties that have the highest levels of certain social vulnerabilities , especially in less urban areas , have greater risk of becoming COVID- 19 hotspots (i.e., locations with rapidly increasing COVID -19 incidence) 7 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) than counties with the lowest levels [13, 14] . Inequities and disparities in social determinants of health faced by vulnerable communities can increase the risk of being exposed to SARS -CoV- 2 and developing severe COVID- 19 disease [2, 13, 15] . To promote equitable access, information regarding vulnerability of local populations \u2014and the health systems that serve them \u2014can be used to prioritize certain geographic areas for vaccine distribution. California health departments s hould prioritize scarce doses of vaccine using the California Healthy Places Index (HPI) or comparable health department knowledge of local vulnerability and health systems . Vulnerability should be evaluated based on the location of residence of employees and clients ( i.e., the catchment area) if different than the location of the facility . The HPI may have limited utility in less populous settings with fewer facilities , in which case health department knowledge of catchment area s may be applied. Recommendation B2: Subprioritization by location of facility When there are inadequate doses to reach all workers in a tier or facility category (e.g., acute care hospitals) , doses should be prioritized to facilities serving the greatest propo rtion of vulnerable persons in their catchment area, as measured by the HPI or comparable health department knowledge, followed by facilities serving fewer vulnerable persons. B3. Attributes of individual health care workers Attributes of individual health care workers should be used as the third ranked category for subprioritization . An individual's risk of occupational exposure to SARS -CoV-2 is the primary criteri on, because exposure risk is linked to higher risks of acquiring infection, spreading disease, and negative impact s on the health system and society if those individuals are unable to work. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration provides criteria than can be used to stratify workers' relative risks of occupational exposure to SARS -CoV-2 [16]. After occupational exposure risk, other individual attributes that can be used for subprioritization include age, underlying medical conditions, and race or ethnicity. Older adults ( 65 and over) are at much greater risk of severe disease and death due to COVID -19 than younger people [11]. They are also more likely to have underlying health conditions and live in congregate settings, such as long -term care facilities [2, 17] . Adults of any age have a greater risk of severe disease and death due to COVID -19 if they ha ve certain underlying medical conditions , (e.g., cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart conditions, i mmunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, obesity, pregnancy, sickle cell disease, smoking, type 2 diabetes 8 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) mellitus) [18, 19] . Certain racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. \u2014including Black, Hispanic or Latinx, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities \u2014are being disproportionately affected by COVID -19 incidence, risk of sever e disease, and death [2, 13, 15, 20- 26]. In accordance with current ACIP recommendations [8], subject to change, workers with documented acute SARS-CoV- 2 infection in the preceding 90 days may choose to delay vaccination until near the end of the 90 day period in order to facilitate vaccination of worke rs who remain susceptible to infection. C urrent evidence suggests that reinfe ction is uncommon during this period after initial infection. Of note, previous SARS-CoV- 2 infection, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, is not considered a contraindication to vaccination, and serologic testing for SARS -CoV- 2 antibodies is not recommended prior to vaccination. Recommendation B 3: Subprioritization by attributes of individual health care workers If there are not enough doses to reach all workers at risk in a facility , then Health departments may allocate dose s for facilities \u2014if information is available \u2014to protect workers at higher risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 before those at lower risk. Local facilities should consider offer ing doses of v accine to workers using the following risk factors, in sequence: o Occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 o Descending age, in the following age groups: 65 years and older 55-64 years Younge r than 55 years o Other attributes supported by evidence, including but not limited to underlying medical conditions , race , and ethnicity To support immunization of these workers, facilities should provide extensive information and counseling. C. Additional Factors Affecting Prioritization In their prioritization of vaccine allocation, health departments may use additional factors related to (C1) evolving information about COVID- 19 vaccine characteristics and (C2) minimizing disuse of scarce vaccine. 9 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) C1. Evolving information about COVID -19 vaccine characteristics Vaccine characteristics that may limit the use or distribution of COVID -19 vaccine includ e, but are not limited to : Storage and handling requirem ents Vaccine safety and efficacy, in subgroups and general population ACIP Recommendations for use Vaccine characteristics related to storage and handling that could affect prioritization include vaccine shipping and storage temperatures, minimum volume thresholds for shipment, and capacity to store large volumes of vaccine. For example, if the initial supplies of COVID -19 vaccine are a limited amount of a product that requires long -term storage at ultra -low temperatures and limited redistribution, these s upplies may be directed preferentially to settings with appropriate storage capacity, such as hospitals or health departments . Evidence about the vaccine's safety and efficacy in specific groups of people and the general population is critical for making allocation decisions [27]. However, much information will remain unknown when supplies are first available during Phase 1a \u2014e.g., evidence about the vaccine's impact on the risk of acquiring or spreading the disease \u2014so prioritization strategies may need to be adjusted in light of new and evolving information about the vaccine's safety and efficacy. Further, ACIP recommendations for use or indications for use from FDA could impose age limits or other restrictions that could prevent administration of the vaccin e to certain health care workers who otherwise would be targeted for initial doses. Recommendation C1. Evolving information about COVID -19 vaccine characteristics Health Departments may adjust prioritization to reflect or comply with available vaccine characteristics. However, prompt measures should be taken to revert to the original prioritization criteria and immunize persons delayed by these restrictions as soon as circumstances permit, such as : Additional formulations become available Changes in authorized indications from FDA or in recommendations from ACIP or CDPH C2. Minimizing disuse of scarce COVID -19 vaccine All efforts should be taken to maximize demand for and avoid disuse of COVID -19 vaccine, especially when supplies are scarce. However, the actual acceptance rate of COVID -19 vaccine will not be known until a vaccine is available and offered , and surveys suggest that a substantial 10 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) proportion of p eople who are offered the vaccine may not accept it [28, 29] . Given the current uncertainty of demand for vaccine, health departments may allocat e doses on the assumption that immunization will be accepted by some but not all who are offered the vaccine , and then adjust later allocations based on the number of doses that are accepted. Resources other than the supply of vaccine also affect the pace of immunization. There may be instances where vaccine is available for the next categories of facilities without delaying immunization in the higher category. For example, in the weeks it might take mobile immunization teams to visit hundreds of assisted living facilities in a populous county, current and ongoing supplies could be managed to accommodate immunization in other categories at the same time without delay in supplies to the mobile teams. Recommendation C2. Minimiz ing disuse of scarce COVID -19 vaccine To avoid wastage or disuse of scarce supplies and maximize their benefit to Californians: Health departments may allocat e doses on the assumption that immunization will be accepted by some but not all who are offered the vaccine , and then adjust later allocations based on the number of doses that are accepted. After intensive and appropriate efforts to reach the groups prior itized at that moment, health departments and facilities may offer vaccine promptly to persons in lower priority groups when: o Demand subsides in the current groups, or o Doses are about to expire according to labeling instructions. Health Departments may temporarily adjust prioritization based on other resource constraints while continuing efforts to immunize higher priority groups as soon as feasible. D. Closing Concerns , Distinct from P rioritization D1. Promoting equity through outreac h, access and support Promoting equity should inform strategies for prioritizing allocation, broadening access to immunization, and providing communication, outreach, and counseling. Many persons from communities at high risk for COVID -19 may mistrus t medi cal and government institutions \u2014 because of structural injustices or other cause s\u2014and therefore may be reluctant to receive the vaccine. California's Community Vaccine Advisory Committee (CVAC) can suggest how to engage these communities, address their concerns, provide convenient access to the vaccine, and assist with messaging. As experience with the vaccine is gained, the CVAC can help inform CDPH of best practices for helping the vaccine reac h members of communities at greatest risk for COVID -19. 11 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) To promote the equitable provision of Covid -19 vaccine, health departments are encouraged to track : uptake of vaccine efforts and approaches to reach and support high -risk group s accessibility to the vaccine Health departments are encouraged, but not required, to also track declination of the vaccin e. D2. Addressing vaccine hesitancy The mistrust of institutions, discussed in D1, is but one aspect of vaccine hesitancy , the delay or refusal of available vaccine services that is common and increasing [2]. Other causes of hesitancy include misinformation, disinformation , or uncertainty regarding vaccines in general or rapidly develop ed COVID- 19 vaccines in particular. Vaccine hesitancy can be reduced by building public trust and the provision of reliable information by trusted parties, including medical providers and c ommunity organization s [30]. CVAC's diverse member organizations and other trusted voices in California's medica l and public health systems can a ddress hesitancy through their communication and outreach. D3. Anticipating potential reactions Health departments and facilities are directed to ACIP guidance on potential symptoms after immunization [8]. COVID- 19 vaccination is expected to elicit fever, headache, or myalgias in some recipients , wh ich could contribute to personnel shortages after immunization . Mitigations might include staggering the delivery of vaccine so that personnel from a single department or unit are not all vaccinated at the same time . Staggering considerations may be more i mportant following the second dose of vaccines that are more reactogenic after the second dose . Facilities are encouraged to plan for personnel to have time away from work if they develop systemic symptoms following COVID -19 vaccination. 12 Allocation Guidelines for COVID -19 Vaccine During Phase 1A (Draft v6) References 1.
