Image: Jared Leibowtiz Cover: Dianne Appleby, Yawuru Cultural Leader, and her grandson Zeke 11 September 2018 The Hon Paul Fletcher MP Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 Dear Minister The Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is pleased to present its Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2019. The report was prepared for section 46 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, in accordance with the requirements of that Act and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. It was approved by the Board on 11 September 2019 and provides a comprehensive review of the ABC's performance and delivery in line with its Charter remit. The ABC continues to be the home and source of Australian stories, told across the nation and to the world. The Corporation's commitment to innovation in both storytelling and broadcast delivery is stronger than ever, as the needs of its audiences rapidly evolve in line with technological change. Australians expect an independent, accessible public broadcasting service which produces quality drama, comedy and specialist content, entertaining and educational children's programming, stories of local lives and issues, and news and current affairs coverage that holds power to account and contributes to a healthy democratic process. The ABC is proud to provide such a service. The ABC is truly Yours. Sincerely, Ita Buttrose AC OBE Chair Letter to the Minister iii ABC Radio Melbourne Drive presenter Raf Epstein. iv AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Contents 1 Contents Letter to the Minister 1 Foreword from the Chair 2 The Board 4 Purpose and Vision 8 The Executive Leadership Team 9 Where We Are 10 What We Do 12 Snapshot of the ABC in 2018-19 13 Message from the Managing Director 14 Quality, distinctive content in 2018-19 16 Yours in the Community 51 ABC Audiences 65 Annual Performance Statements 87 Working at the ABC 100 Responsibility 127 Accountability 141 Financial Statements 150 Appendices 208 Reference 263 The ABC is an essential part of the Australian social fabric. Even as an avid user of its programming and through my deep family ties to the organisation, I remain in awe of its significance and value to the community. More than two-thirds of the population connect with the ABC at some point each week. How many other Australian institutions can boast that level of constant engagement? Or the solid levels of trust and support? In my short time as Chair of the ABC, I have sought to maintain those benchmarks. It has not been easy. The period covered by this Annual Report included some disruptive leadership issues culminating with the departure of both the former Managing Director and Chair in September 2018. As a result, the Board and management spent too much time in the latter half of 2018 being the news rather than producing it. That is now behind us. Deputy Chair, Dr Kirstin Ferguson, assumed the role of Acting Chair following the resignation of Chair Justin Milne. On behalf of the Board our thanks to her for a job well done including successfully navigating the ABC through the Senate Inquiry and Departmental investigations. It was a challenging time for everyone on the Board. It is important to acknowledge the key finding of the Senate Inquiry that the Board's decision to terminate Michelle Guthrie was made without reference to real or perceived political interference. Staff morale was badly shaken, and my priority has been to reinvigorate it by restoring order and enhancing good governance with the help of Managing Director, David Anderson, and his management team. Our employees, in content areas and vital support functions, need a strong sense of direction and a feeling that management has their backs. I feel we are now providing it. We continue to be recognised here and internationally for the quality of our programming, for our commitment to localism and our unique democratic role in fostering the national debate and informing the public. We are proud of the success of our homemade kids' series, Bluey, the compelling narrative and scenery that comprised Mystery Road, the strong public engagement nurtured by our local and national radio networks, and the breadth and depth of our federal election coverage. We are continuing to set the pace in areas like podcasting and app development and in uniting the community behind big events like Anzac Day, New Year's Eve and the Invictus Games. At a time of declining institutional trust across the globe, our value and trust scores remain high. The important role of the ABC has also been underscored in the Competitive Neutrality Report, commissioned by the Government and released in late 2018. The Report found that the ABC had not strayed beyond its charter and could not be blamed for the problems being encountered by the commercial sector. It endorsed the principle of a well-funded ABC taking full advantage of technological breakthroughs to serve new and existing audiences. The Report highlighted how the media sector is arguably the one most disrupted by digital change. I sense many ongoing opportunities for the ABC in this landscape as we focus on our strengths: excellence, innovation, public service, and rewarding both niche and broad audiences with distinctive fare. There is no sense of complacency. We must always adapt, responding to audience trends and to the need to balance efficiency and effectiveness. On that last point, our task has been made harder by the imposition of the three-year indexation freeze, which comes on top of a $50 million-a-year cut now embedded in our base. We will operate within our funding envelope. But the funding reduction, at a time of rising costs for production and acquired content, ever-increasing competition for audiences, and the need to replace obsolete equipment, will force tough choices and long-lasting decisions. We will continue to lobby the Government for financial security and the flexibility we need to invest in our future. We will continue to seek the support of our other stakeholders for that mission. Foreword from the Chair 2 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 The legislative environment in which we operate is another challenge. The AFP raid on our Ultimo headquarters, in pursuit of evidence relating to the 2017 publication of the so-called Afghan Files, has been a rude wake-up call for us and other media organisations. The legal framework and the mindset of our regulators and lawmakers is tilted too much towards secrecy and intimidation of journalists and whistleblowers. As I pointed out to Prime Minister Morrison, no journalist should face imprisonment for doing his or her job - informing the public. The ABC will fight the legality of the raid and seek the return of the seized information. We will continue to campaign with our media colleagues for a shift in balance toward media freedom and the public's right to know. Again, I come back to trust. The public trust us to speak truth to power. A hobbled ABC is denied the ability, and indeed the fulfilment of its legislative duty, to inform the community. That is intolerable. I have found the ABC to be remarkably resilient, powered by the energy and creativity of its staff and the admiration and respect of the community. It is an honour to oversee such a great combination. Whatever the challenges, we face the future with confidence.

Image: Georgia MoloneySnapshot of the ABC in 2018-19 13 Message from the Managing Director For much of the period covered by this report, I had the privilege to serve as the Corporation's Acting Managing Director. This was, to a significant extent, a caretaker period, during which my primary responsibilities were to stabilise the organisation and ensure that it continued to provide the people of Australia with the programs and services they expect of it. During the year, I travelled to ABC offices around the country talking with and, most importantly, listening to the staff who are the creative engine of the Corporation. Since my formal appointment in May 2019, I have engaged the ABC Leadership Team in detailed work on developing a Five-Year Plan to best position the organisation for the future. I anticipate announcing the new Plan in March 2020. As part of this process, the Leadership Team is also developing an Annual Content Plan that publicly articulates the Corporation's creative remit and ambitions in line with its Charter responsibilities. I will bring this Plan forward before the end of 2019. I am strongly committed to the Corporation looking and sounding like contemporary Australia across its programming and its workforce. In 2019, the ABC will launch a new three-year Diversity Strategy to drive and measure this transformation. The new ABC Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan 2019-2022, which will come into effect on 1 July 2019, sets out concrete and measurable ways in which the Corporation will contribute to reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous Australians. Central to this fourth ABC RAP is the ambition to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and names in ABC programming so that they may might in turn become embedded in the vocabulary of the nation. The Elevate RAP also strengthens the Corporation's on-going commitment to telling Indigenous stories and creating employment and business opportunities for Indigenous individuals and organisations. In the final quarter of 2019, the ABC will launch Australia Talks, an ambitious project to understand and promote a national conversation about the key issues affecting life in modern Australia, including Australians' concerns, health and happiness, and perceptions of their nation. The project will encourage people to participate in an anonymous survey that provides personalised insights about their lives. The trends emerging from the aggregated results will be presented through content initiatives across ABC platforms, including a factual entertainment program on ABC Television. In December we will celebrate 80 years of ABC international media services. From their beginnings in international radio, these services have expanded to include broadcast television, digital and mobile channels that reach millions of people through social media, video on demand and streaming. A range of programs and events are being planned to mark this milestone, including a special edition of Q&A broadcast from the Pacific and a documentary on the history of the ABC's international services. While I believe we made a strong case to government for a reversal of a foreshadowed pause in the indexation of its triennial funding, that pause was confirmed in the May 2019 Budget. Accordingly, the ABC's budget will need to identify additional savings. By the final year of the current triennium, these savings will need to be more than $40 million per annum on an ongoing basis. The media environment in which the ABC operates has not stood still. For more than a decade, audiences have continued to embrace a widening array of digital media services that allow them to access content how, when and where it suits them. Feeding this fragmentation is the growth of global-scale technology companies that are either directly competing with traditional media organisations for the attention of audiences or operating platforms whose algorithms directly shape audiences' access to content. In responding to these changes, the ABC is adapting its offerings and the ways in which it distributes them, including shifting activity to cloud services and increasing the use of 14 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 data to deliver more personalised experiences to audiences. However, the Corporation's ability to invest in refreshing its capabilities is constrained by the matching need to maintain scheduled broadcast media services, which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and to replace end-of-life technology assets that have been 'sweated' in the pursuit of past efficiencies. At the same time, the cost of creating and acquiring quality content continues to rise, particularly due to greater competition in the Australian media landscape, especially from global distributors. The average cost per hour of Australian TV drama in the local production industry has increased by approximately 3.3% per annum over five years and 6.5% per annum over the last three years. In response to greater competition from global technology companies, public service media organisations around the world are increasingly exploring collaboration and content sharing as a means of reducing costs and increasing overall program budgets. The ABC has already begun to pursue such collaboration opportunities and in June 2019 signed a memorandum of understanding with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to co-develop a range of English-language programming. The raid of the Corporation's Ultimo office by the Australian Federal Police in June 2019 cast into sharp relief the legislative regime under which journalists at the ABC and other media organisations operate. The ABC is adamant that it cannot fulfil its obligation to deliver accurate, impartial and objective journalism if its staff are intimidated or treated like criminals for simply doing their jobs. Accordingly, in 2019-20, we will seek legislative changes to ensure the public's right to know is protected. I believe the ABC enters 2019-20 confident of its ability to respond to the significant challenges that it, like all media organisations, faces in the next few years.

Quality, distinctive content in 2018-19 Contents News, Analysis & Investigations 18 Federal Election 2019 22 Entertainment & Specialist 24 Regional & Local 38 Content Ideas Lab 43 ABC Commercial 48 From early 2018, the reorganisation of the ABC into broad genre content-making areas saw the creation of new Content Teams to produce and deliver innovative, distinctive and engaging content. The enhanced efficiency and flexibility provided by the restructure has assisted content-makers to meet their audiences' expectations for high-quality content, on all platforms and devices available to them. Quality, Distinctive Content in 2018-19 17 News, Analysis & Investigations In 2018-19, News, Analysis & Investigations (NA&I) pursued issues and told stories that spoke directly to the concerns of all Australians, through high-quality, in-depth journalism and comprehensive coverage of major events. ABC news and current affairs programs continued to play a pivotal role in raising and investigating issues in the national interest. Internally, teams continued to transform production and output, and move towards a high-value integrated broadcast and digital offering for audiences. Major domestic audience highlights for the year included the May federal election coverage, which delivered a new record audience for the ABC (see page 22), as well as coverage of the federal leadership challenge, a royal visit, the Invictus Games, the New South Wales and Victorian state elections, the Banking and Aged Care Royal Commissions, the Townsville floods, and the prosecution of George Pell. Internationally, the ABC's teams covered significant events including the Thai caves rescue, the Christchurch mosque attacks and the Indonesian earthquakes, and closely followed political developments in the US, Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific. The Specialist Reporting team, ABC Investigations and the Digital Story Innovation team delivered Australia's most consequential, original journalism across a range of programs and channels. Flagship television programs maintained strong traditional broadcast viewing numbers as well as attracting new audiences with online treatments. Audiences continued to benefit from Audio Current Affairs' regular radio and NewsRadio broadcasts, and the team increased their production of podcasts to meet demand for content on the popular ABC listen platform. Behind the News (BtN), the ABC's long-running, unique news and current affairs program for schoolchildren, had high engagement on broadcast and online platforms, and maintained its reputation for content innovation. For NA&I audience data by platform, please see ABC Audiences pp 65-86. Equal Digital Life From 2016 to 2019 NA&I pursued a three-year strategy known as 'Equal Digital Life' (EDL), with the aim of ensuring the best stories and coverage were made accessible and provided value to all Australians on any platform they chose to use. News teams significantly changed their ways of working, and transformed the output and distribution of stories to reach larger audiences while increasing the scope and quality of digital production. As the EDL strategy nears its close this calendar year, News is on track to meet the core targets set in 2016. Those targets were: \u00e2\u00a2 to lift the activity all of News teams to devoting 30% of their effort to digital output \u00e2\u00a2 to grow digital audience reach to 40% per month (as measured by Nielsen) \u00e2\u00a2 to lift audience engagement on ABC news sites to industry-leading rates \u00e2\u00a2 to reach a greater number of younger audiences \u00e2\u00a2 to be Australia's leading news organisation on third-party platforms. The ABC is the market leader on third party news platforms, reaching audiences via outlets such as Apple News, YouTube, msn and Facebook, and it has cemented its No. 2 ranking among Australian online news brands. Average time per user for ABC News is the highest among the leading local news providers, while commercial syndication to a range of domestic and international news providers extends the ABC's reach. The best stories from NA&I's broadcast teams now reach larger digital audiences than ever and the team leads industry measures for digital engagement. 18 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Network Newsgathering The Network News team includes the Business & Finance, International, and Sport desks, as well as the Specialist Reporting Team and Parliament House, Canberra, each of which produce output for television, radio and digital. In 2018-19, the business team was expanded to add greater digital capacity, which enhanced online reporting on issues such as property prices, superannuation, the Banking Royal Commission and the impact of digital disruption on retailers. The International desk covered key stories such as the US mid-term elections and the change in government in Papua New Guinea. Major stories from the Specialist Reporting Team included coverage of the 2019 flu epidemic and the exposure of telecommunication services selling unaffordable contracts to vulnerable people. ABC Sport continued to cover the major sporting codes and also appealed to a broad audience with stories on unusual events and people in the sporting arena. State coverage The Local Journalism Initiative, launched in April 2018, successfully introduced structural reforms in all eight state and territory newsrooms, driving innovation, responsiveness and digital capability, as well as improving the quality of local journalism. The reforms led to the effective attraction and retention of audiences for digital content. Innovation in local newsrooms improved the distribution of breaking and in-depth news on social media and digital news channels. One popular example was the 'property blacklist', a data-driven interactive map for every major city which enabled users to identify the riskiest suburbs for home loan lending. ABC News employs 1270 journalists and content makers and more than 90% of its funding is directly invested in journalism and content creation. Local newsrooms collaborated more closely with capital city and regional content makers to improve usage of regional storytelling. The Townsville floods in February challenged News and Regional & Local teams to deliver fast, accurate and comprehensive reporting of a major natural disaster, which continued long after the floodwaters receded. During the coverage, digital engagement and Queensland television audiences were exceptionally high. Oliver Gordon, Walkley Young Australian Journalist of the Year. Image: Hamish Harty Quality, Distinctive Content in 2018-19 19 Investigative & In-depth Journalism The ABC's current affairs teams continue to provide the nation's highest quality in-depth journalism through broadcast programming and aligned bespoke digital content. In 2018-19, Four Corners highlights included: 'A Form of Madness', a rapid turnaround report on the Liberal leadership spill; 'Proud Country', a portrait of regional Australia in the grip of drought; 'Crime and Panic', an investigation to find the truth surrounding 'African' crime in Melbourne; 'Meet the Scammers', which unmasked cyber scammers stealing hearts and money; an hour-long special on the dramatic Thai cave rescue; and an analysis of the disruptive business model of Uber. 7.30 underwent a successful overhaul of production, style and content, to give audiences an improved experience delivered in high definition. An increased focus on storytelling was rewarded with stable television audiences in an otherwise declining market for nightly current affairs. Weekly current affairs programs Australian Story and Foreign Correspondent are now running shorter seasons and are focusing on quality of storytelling, and engaging digital as well as broadcast audiences. Australian Story - frequently the ABC's highest rating current affairs program on television - grew its iview audience over 2018-19, while a change in broadcast timeslot resulted in a larger audience for Foreign Correspondent. Discussion and debate programs Insiders, The Drum and Q&A succeeded in engaging audiences around issues of public interest, particularly during the federal election campaign where a series of 'on the road' programs proved a successful foray into cost-effective live broadcasting from all parts of Australia (for more on federal election coverage, see page 22). A crowdsourced investigation into aged care received more than 4,000 submissions from members of the public, demonstrating the magnitude of concern over the quality of aged care. Four Corners dedicated two episodes to the issue and prompted the Federal Government to call a Royal Commission.

News Digital Based in Brisbane, News Digital curates and publishes content across national news, mobile, social, and video, as well as acting as an innovation hub and source of expertise for news teams. Under the Local Journalism Initiative, digital editors were recruited for each capital city newsroom, digital editing responsibility was devolved to local newsrooms and the Brisbane newsroom was relieved of some subbing and publication duties, enabling it to focus on innovation. A strategy to reduce the quantity of online stories in order to improve the quality and depth of articles was highly successful, driving user engagement metrics to industry-leading levels. Across the year, ABC News had a unique monthly digital audience of 8.6 million, representing 35% of Australians.3 Sitting within News Digital, the Digital Story Lab explored new ways of presenting information. These included the 'Chart of the Day', which covered data representations of topics as diverse as the cost of Australian natural disasters and the best superhero (do Australian kids prefer Batman or Wonder Woman), as well as special reports such as 'Private health insurance: Should you have it, and what are the benefits?', 'Hey stranger, what's on your phone?' and 'Where do migrants to Australia come from?'. 1 ABC Corporate Tracking Program. 2 ABC Quality and Distinctiveness Study, March 2019 (n=6,541). 3 Nielsen DCR, Text, Australia, People aged 2+ years.

Quality, Distinctive Content in 2018-19 35 Distribution E&S Distribution facilitates the scheduling, curation and publishing of content on television, radio, online, on ABC digital platforms and apps and on third party platforms in order to showcase the ABC's broad mix of quality programming. As with the ABC's traditional channels on television and radio, the team carefully curate on-demand digital services. In 2018-19, Distribution continued to develop the ABC's technological capabilities through initiatives such as personalisation and discovery, to improve efficiency and value and allow audiences to watch what they want, when they want it, on their platform of choice. As traditional broadcast reach declines across the Australian industry, the team is seeking new ways of engaging audiences to build the overall reach and relevance of ABC content. Measures such as 'stacking' - where episodes of television programs that are broadcast via the ABC's traditional channels are simultaneously released on iview - formed part of their responsive strategic approach in 2018-19. Distribution also met audience expectations by selectively offering 'box sets', where all episodes of a program were made available on iview at the same time as the first episode was broadcast on television. Operations The Operations team provides the resources and facilities necessary for the creation and management of original Australian high-quality content, for delivery in a timely and cost-effective manner. ABC Operations is the backbone of support for the Corporation's distinctive Australian content, including radio and television production and outside broadcasts. The 2018 integration of Audio/Radio Operations into the existing Operations Team led to more efficient and cost-effective workflows. The move also resulted in greater collaboration within the team, including the standardisation of equipment across areas. The television studio and production team in Melbourne provided resourcing in the Southbank studios for programs such as Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell, The Weekly with Charlie Pickering and Hard Quiz. In Sydney, the Ultimo Studios produced Play School, Giggle and Hoot, Q&A and Gruen, and the Lanceley Place studio was highly utilised throughout 2018-19 by internal productions and external production companies that leased the studio's spaces. Operations' television and radio OB vans support more than 550 events each year including Anzac Day services, New Year's Eve celebrations, National Press Club addresses and the Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures, plus sporting and cultural events such as music and writers' festivals. The radio team provides operational support for music, spoken-word broadcasts and ABC podcasts, and also provides training to regional staff to ensure Australians across the country are provided with high-quality audio in their local area. The post-production services team provides audio post and colour grading for internal and external clients while the Presentation, Systems and Assets team provides captioning and related assets. In April 2019, the latter collaborated with ABC News to showcase live automatic captioning at the National Association of Broadcasters Show. Industry engagement E&S is a leading supporter of Australia's independent production sector helping to deliver outstanding local content to audiences. The team partners with Screen Australia and state screen agencies, as well as liaising with the Screen Producer's Association and other craft guilds. The Drama, Comedy, Indigenous, Factual and Children's teams were active participants at major industry events throughout 2018-19, including Series Mania Melbourne, Screen Forever and the Australian International Documentary Conference (AIDC), and had multiple engagements with regional and metropolitan organisations including the Vivid Sydney Festival, the Melbourne International 36 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Comedy Festival, and the Sydney Opera House. Industry engagement in 2018-19 included screenings of You Can't Ask That at AACTA events in Sydney and Melbourne, with the producers of that program also presenting on panels at the AIDC and Vivid Sydney. ABC Entertainment was a key partner of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and the Comedy team collaborated with Parramatta's Information and Cultural Centre and Create NSW to develop, fund, and produce digital series from emerging Western Sydney program-makers. ABC Classic partnered with major musical organisations, orchestras and festivals to record and broadcast live performances, while triple j, Double J and triple j Unearthed partnered with major music festivals and music industry events to support emerging Australian talent. RN's Society & Culture team partnered with the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne on regular talks, while team members also spoke at the Vivid Festival's 2019 Audiocraft Podcast Festival. The ABC's Ozpod conference brought together the audio industry's finest content creators, platforms and production houses. The Science team co-hosted the World Congress of Science and Factual Producers in Brisbane, and ABC Children's expanded its engagement with the Australian Early Childhood Sector including attending the Aboriginal Early Childhood Conference and Australian Council for Education Leaders. ABC TV Education and ABC Children's Distribution, in conjunction with the ABC's regional teams, developed partnerships with The Bureau of Meteorology, Narragunnawali (part of Reconciliation Australia), and First Languages Australia. These partnerships saw high-quality content created and enhanced specifically for young audiences. Business Affairs Business Affairs negotiates the rights and deal terms required by the ABC for content produced, commissioned and acquired by the ABC's content teams, as well as associated rights required by ABC Commercial. Business Affairs plays an important governance role in ensuring the ABC's investment in content delivers value for audiences, and is responsible for ensuring the ABC's rights closely align to the ABC content strategy. In 2018-19, Business Affairs continued to secure the rights to extend the ABC's digital offering, to ensure the ABC remains relevant and accessible. Digital expansion included binge viewing, live events on social media, and an experimental vertical format for viewing on mobile phones. The team negotiated deal terms for content co-produced with international partners, such as ABC Studios International US, Netflix, Sky Comedy and BBC Studios. Business Affairs also contributed to the successful live music program The Set, forging new deals with artists and record labels to reach audiences on digital platforms. Business Affairs facilitated joint initiatives with state and federal screen agencies to foster emerging and diverse talent including the ABC/ Screen Australia initiatives International Day of the Girl, Art Bites and DisRupted; Indigenous initiatives Short Blacks with Screen Australia, Deadly Portraits with the South Australian Film Corporation and Originate with Screenwest; and a digital-first comedy initiative with Create NSW and the Information and Cultural Exchange. Business Affairs continued to provide support and guidance to new producers through these initiatives, developing business skills in the industry. Business Affairs continued to work closely with Screen Producers Australia (SPA) and attended industry feedback sessions on ABC terms of trade at SPA producer events in December 2018 and May 2019. The team also provided networking sessions for producers at the annual SPA Screen Forever conference. Business Affairs has been working with all ABC teams on a whole-of-business analysis of how the Corporation sources and distributes content, with a view to implementing an ABC-wide rights management system from 2019-20. To maximise the effectiveness of this project, the team has exchanged information with rights teams at the BBC (UK), BBC Studios (UK) and PBS (US). Quality, Distinctive Content in 2018-19 37 No matter where they are, all Australians have access to the ABC network and the opportunity to tell their story. The ABC's Regional & Local (R&L) team span the country, making content that connects people and places. The team's 800 staff share a common purpose - to engage, strengthen and celebrate communities, by bringing audiences the local content and the wide range of community perspectives they are looking for across all platforms. R&L's business planning in 2018 focused on establishing shared objectives. ABC Emergency's strategy was updated, and included increasing the number of dedicated emergency broadcasting roles. Other focus areas included increased skills training for staff, creating closer working relationships with ABC News teams in capital cities to bring metropolitan audiences more investigative reporting and coverage of local and state news, and working to provide a better local content experience for digital audiences with greater discoverability. Finally, R&L committed to developing more screen content by producing increased national celebration coverage and stories of common interest and shared experience. The close working relationship between the different parts of the team has had positive outcomes for content as it has enabled R&L to deliver genuinely comprehensive coverage tailored to different programs, platforms and audiences. For R&L audience data by platform, please see ABC Audiences pp 65-86. Rural & Regional bureaux In 2018-19, the ABC's rural and regional bureaux consolidated gains made under the Connecting Communities project, with a focus on training and quality to ensure that the additional resources and funding provided by the project resulted in a strong increase in audience reach. Regional & Local 23 Regional Video Log. 24 Khoros. Taylor Pfeiffer performs at the ABC Gardener's Market. Image: Malcolm Sutton 38 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Key training initiatives concentrated on video production and features writing, complemented by a commitment to improving the quality of local radio programming, which saw ABC's 48 regional bureaux transformed from local radio stations to multiplatform production hubs producing content for local and national audiences. Dedicated regional current affairs radio show Australia Wide drew positive audience reaction and R&L's video strategy saw distinctive stories supplied to ABC news programs including ABC flagships News Breakfast, the 7pm News bulletins and 7.30, and the ABC NEWS channel. All bureaux can now send live video, and this capacity is being used daily by ABC News. The R&L team is currently producing on average 500 video stories and segments per month.23 Increased audio training for all reporters improved traditional field recording, audio editing and studio skills. Continued collaboration with news and capital city radio stations saw regional stories attain greater platform coverage, resulting in larger audiences for locally-focused content. In 2018-19, the ABC Rural teams extended their reach beyond the traditional Country Hour and Rural Reports programs, with rural reporters producing stories for the major News platforms that are written to appeal to both regional and metropolitan audiences. The Rural & Regional social media strategy saw the total number of Facebook followers for regional accounts grow 37% to 1.4 million overall, and engagement rise 43% to 197 million engagements.24 While the number of digital articles produced by the team dropped slightly, an improved focus on quality and better commissioning saw the average views per article rise from 17,800 in 2017-18 to 35,300 in 2018-19. R&L's four Regional newsletters and two national Rural newsletters continue to perform at or above the ABC's newsletter performance benchmarks, with a combined subscriber base of close to 19,000.25 Subscribers to the Regional newsletters grew 120% in the past 12 months to 5,700.26 Regional & Local screen After 30 years, Gardening Australia continues to resonate with Australian audiences. In 2019, the program received industry recognition, winning two Logies for Most Popular Presenter and Most Popular Lifestyle Program, and gaining a Gold Logie nomination for host Costa Georgiadis. Gardening Australia is also successfully reaching audiences on digital platforms, with more than 700,000 monthly page views27, making it one of the top ABC TV program websites. The program's Facebook page has a following of 350,000+ and its YouTube channel, launched in October 2018, had more than 10,000 subscribers at the close of 2018-19. Almost half the YouTube channel's viewers are aged between 25 and 44 years old.28 Landline continues to gain high scores for quality and distinctiveness, achieving scores of 95% and 91% respectively in the most recent ABC Quality & Distinctiveness study.29 The show regularly mentors regional and rural reporters and broadcasts stories with a strong local identity. In 2018-19, the show started producing specials, with the first, a special on veganism, increasing broadcast audience and Facebook engagement. Tapping into regional and rural life, Landline's Facebook account is one of the most active social media accounts across the ABC network. Landline digital news articles averaged 46,000 views per story, with eight of the articles published each achieving more than 100,000 views, demonstrating the significant interest online audiences have for quality Australian regional content.30 25 Salesforce. 26 Salesforce. 27 Google Analytics. 28 YouTube studio analytics. 29 ABC Quality & Distinctiveness Study, March 2019. 30 ABC News Story Stats.

Back Roads continued its tradition of featuring strong local regional characters, and this year had a focus on Dreaming stories. Capital City Radio Network In 2018-19, the eight metropolitan stations in the Capital City Radio Network continued to connect local audiences to the stories and events that shape their communities. Close collaboration with content teams across the ABC resulted in comprehensive coverage of significant events such as the Australia Day celebrations and Australian of the Year nominations, International Women's Day, Anzac Day, NAIDOC Week, the Victoria and New South Wales state elections, and the federal election (see page 22). Trends in the key measures of share, reach and time spent listening have shown that while there were minor falls in engagement with the capital city stations due to uncertainty over the schedule changes made in 2018, audience numbers steadied during the first half of 2019. Overall, there has been modest growth in reach and share for metropolitan Breakfast programs while Drive audiences have remained steady or seen minor falls. The team has continued to focus on community engagement and better representation of audience diversity. Capital City radio content achieved strong digital and social media growth during 2018-19.

During the year ABC Sport broadcast the Australian Women's Open golf and introduced the Vic Open to its television offering. Radio continued as the backbone of ABC Sport as the team retained broadcast rights for all major sports, including the AFL and NRL. The first season of the NRL Women's Premiership was broadcast in full and the AFLW continued to engage audiences through live broadcasts. Under a new radio rights agreement with Cricket Australia, ABC Grandstand broadcast the full season of the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL), commentating on all 43 matches. Jim Maxwell and Alison Mitchell led the commentary team. In 2018-19, ABC Sport highlighted and supported Grandstand's broad content with increased related social media output, and Offsiders on ABC television went from strength to strength, generating strong ratings throughout the year. Partnerships In 2018-19, the Regional & Local Content Partnerships team managed external partnerships with organisations in their focus areas of youth, weather, rural Australia, Indigenous languages, and disability, while also contributing support and advice to key ABC program and platform initiatives. The 2019 UN Year of Indigenous Languages was one such focus area, with R&L leading the ABC's content offering. Working closely with ABC Indigenous, Partnerships assisted ABC teams to create content around Indigenous languages. The Heywire Regional Youth Summit, delivered in partnership with the federal government, continued to provide an important opportunity for young people in rural and regional Australia to tell their stories (for more, see page 57). The Trailblazers project, an offshoot of Heywire, once again promoted the leadership of young, regional change-makers (18-28 years old) by allowing them to tell their stories on the ABC. The project is run in partnership with the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development. The Regional Storyteller Scholarship initiative develops regional writers and content makers in the disability community. The inaugural winner of the scholarship, Eliza Hull, produced a successful eight-part RN radio and six-part ABC Life online series about parenting with disabilities, and went on to work with RN, ABC Life, ABC ME and ABC Bendigo. A partnership with Department of Social Services has enabled two scholarships to be offered in 2019-20. Distribution R&L has structured its Distribution team around digital production and content innovation, audience engagement and social media, digital product engagement, and content quality management. The R&L Distribution team works closely with content makers to ensure that content is commissioned and optimised for the range of platforms audiences are using, with a particular focus on more compelling video content and audio being made available to audiences 'on demand'. The team focuses on engaging through social media, and its priority is to reach new and existing audiences with relevant local content. To achieve this, the team form collaborations across the ABC, working closely with the NA&I and E&S teams to provide R&L content to national audiences. In 2019, R&L Distribution focused on localisation of digital content strategies across metropolitan and regional bureaux; better online discoverability of local content; improved audio and podcasting strategies; updating social and User Generated Content strategies to support local distribution; building on sport digital output and distribution; delivering digital strategies for new screen programming; improving the quality of Rural digital output; and continuing the development of content innovation. 42 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Working collaboratively with other ABC content areas, the Content Ideas Lab team concentrates on content innovation, by identifying and incubating new and distinctive ideas specifically aimed at the 30% of Australians who don't consume ABC content on a weekly basis. In 2018-19, the team finalised the development of the successful Great Ideas Grant (GIG) pitches from the 2017 round, transitioning three of the four active GIG projects out of Content Ideas Lab into the ABC's ongoing business. Content Ideas Lab also played a pivotal role in coordinating pan-ABC content strategy, supporting the development of prospective major pan-ABC content initiatives, and developing models for continuous innovation through collaboration. Throughout 2018-19, Content Ideas Lab's two primary responsibilities were ABC International Strategy, and the lifestyle and wellbeing content portal known as ABC Life. Additional priorities were informed by two new pan-ABC groups, the Content Collaborations Working Group, and the Emerging Content Steering Group. Great Ideas Grant (GIG) ABC KIDS listen ABC KIDS listen is a radio station and accompanying app for 2-5-year-old children. Originally a GIG project, KIDS listen completed a smooth transition into the ABC Children's team in January 2019. The change opened up the station and app to a larger cross-disciplinary team of children's content makers. ABC KIDS listen's highlights for the year included a collaboration between ABC Classic FM, Ensemble Offspring and composer Brenda Gifford, which resulted in Music for The Dreaming, a live show for young children performed at the Sydney Opera House in August 2018. A recording of the show was later distributed as a podcast for a broader audience to enjoy.

The seven-part comedy is designed to be viewed on a smartphone, with the world of BFFs Lucy and Daisy revealed through texts, calls, and app interactions. A co-production with Ludo Studios and the ABC, Content is an experimental program targeting younger audiences. Completed and due for release in September 2019, the series will be distributed across ABC social platforms. ABC Life ABC Life emerged from a GIG initiative, its primary aims being to reach new Australian audiences, and to trial innovative ways of working and presenting content in order to achieve that goal. Working with ABC Product & Content Technology, the team launched the ABC Life online service in August 2018. Content on the site covers a broad range of lifestyle and wellbeing topics, with key editorial themes in 2018-19 including mental health and wellbeing, issues with alcohol, personal finance literacy, rights at work, cyber safety and social isolation. ABC Life's goal to reach one million monthly users onsite in 12 months was exceeded in February 2019 - a mere six months after its launch. The service approached its one year milestone reaching 1.2 million monthly users onsite in June 2019, with 63% of the audience being female and 54% aged 44 and younger.41 User survey information collected by ABC Audience Data & Insights in February 2019 indicated that ABC Life has been resonating with Australians across both metropolitan and regional areas as well as those with Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and non-CALD backgrounds. The platform is successfully reaching and engaging the new audiences it set out to attract and hold. These strong audience outcomes were made possible by forging new ways of working that built on the existing talents of ABC staff. ABC Life provided professional development opportunities through the secondment of more than 20 members of staff from different ABC departments and locations around Australia. One such secondment resulted in a Background Briefing investigation by Osman Faruqi into online abuse, which became a finalist in the 2019 mid-year Walkley Awards. Reporter Grace Jennings-Edquist also achieved industry recognition through the Michael Gordon Social Justice Fellowship, which led to an ABC Life series exploring the lives of refugees in regional Australia. In June 2019, ABC Life material was used by the Australian Human Rights Commission in its guide on how to conduct conversations about racism. For the broader ABC digital ecosystem, ABC Life has served as a hub, enhancing discovery of content created across the organisation by driving well over 6 million onward journeys to other ABC content destinations since its launch. 41 Google Analytics.

While measurement of international broadcast audiences remains difficult, according to the Ipsos Affluent Asia Report 2018 there were 406,000 'affluent' viewers of ABC Australia television each month in 2018, across nine markets. This represents a growth of 38% from the previous year. ABC Radio Australia ABC Radio Australia is broadcast as an FM service across the Pacific and in Timor-Leste, streamed online, and is available as audio-on-demand via the web and the ABC listen app. The station provides Pacific audiences with the bespoke program Pacific Mornings and the half-hour news and current affairs shows Pacific Beat and Pacific Review . Audiences across PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are also served by the long-running daily Tok Pisin news and current affairs program Wantok.

The remainder of the ABC Radio Australia schedule is built around specialist RN and relevant Local Radio content. Chinese audiences While international broadcasters, including the ABC, do not have television landing rights within the People's Republic of China (PRC), the ABC has designed a range of initiatives that enable it to achieve our Charter objectives in this market, and to serve content to the Chinese diaspora both across the region and domestically. In 2018-19 these activities included: \u00e2\u00a2 reciprocal arrangements with a number of Chinese broadcasters to schedule a 'Window Week' - approximately five hours of ABC content is provided for partners to broadcast over a week, during prime time hours, to their mainland television audiences \u00e2\u00a2 the distribution of the Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks highlights to 32 international broadcasters, which reached more than 200 million people in the PRC through playback on national television and social media channels43 \u00e2\u00a2 the provision of programs of high relevance and interest to the Chinese diaspora in Australia - such as the Four Corners episode 'Tremble and Obey' and China's Artful Dissident - subtitled in Simplified Chinese and made available on domestic iview shortly after initial broadcast \u00e2\u00a2 the launch of a media campaign on Chinese social media channels Weibo and WeChat, and curated special collections with commemorative branding, to celebrate Lunar New Year \u00e2\u00a2 the publishing of selected audio, video and text content produced by ABC KIDS listen, ABC Education, and Regional & Local on prominent Chinese social and distribution channels like Youku, iQiyi, QQ, Miaopai, Weibo and WeChat, to meet demand for English-language learning. 43 Data supplied by Chinese media partner networks.

ABC Retail ABC Retail continued to be affected throughout 2018-19 by the general disruption being experienced in the Australian retail sector, as well as the accelerating decline of CD and DVD distribution. Some costs were reduced through increased efficiencies, but ABC Retail continued to operate at a loss, as was forecast. After exploring a number of options to reduce costs and improve profitability for ABC Retail, the decision was made to close the ABC Shop Online business and the ABC Centre franchise network. This was announced to the public in August 2018. All retail operations ceased in December 2018, and the ABC Centre franchise network closed in February 2019. Licensed ABC products remain available through a wide array of approved ABC retailers. 50 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Yours in the Community 51 Gardening Australia presenter Sophie Thomson speaks to the crowd at the ABC Gardeners Market in Adelaide.

Overview of the Council's activities 2018-19 The Advisory Council met in Sydney three times during the year: October 2018, February 2019, and June 2019. Either the ABC Board's Chair (or Acting Chair) or the Managing Director (or Acting Managing Director), or both, met with the Advisory Council at each meeting. Members of the Executive Leadership Team also met with the Council to discuss programming-related matters. Over the year, the Council participated in 'immersion' workshops related to the ABC's iview, ABC listen and ABC Life platforms. Council members were asked to 'immerse' themselves in each platform's content over a two to three week period, and to canvass sentiment in their communities towards that content in order to provide feedback directly to ABC project managers at Council meetings. The Advisory Council also participated in discussions regarding programming initiatives - for example ABC content projects related to Australia Talks and the UN Year of Indigenous Languages - and strategies to improve audience reach. The Council members played a key role in representing the ABC by facilitating discussions between the ABC and the community at events including the Heywire Regional Youth Summit and the ABC Education Forum. Recommendations In 2018-19, the Advisory Council made two recommendations to the Board in connection with its immersive workshops into ABC News and ABC iview. A recommendation regarding the ABC listen workshop, held in February and June, will be made to the Board later in 2019. Recommendation regarding News The aim of the workshop was to explore the relevancy and community impact of ABC News coverage and reporting. The Advisory Council endorsed the work undertaken by the ABC News, Analysis & Investigations team to strengthen local coverage. The Council also endorsed a renewed focus on rural, regional and Indigenous reporting. The Council recommended that ABC News improve local news coverage on weekends, coverage of state and local government reporting, the discoverability of local, regional and Indigenous news, and personalisation options on digital apps and portals. These recommendations have been taken into account in a number of initiatives put in place since the Advisory Council workshop to: \u00e2\u00a2 ensure more regional and rural stories are commissioned for ABC digital and broadcast news platforms \u00e2\u00a2 strengthen local reporting on weekends \u00e2\u00a2 sharpen the focus on state and local policy debates \u00e2\u00a2 ensure the ABC delivers an outstanding audience experience across platforms. Yours in the Community 55 Some of the initiatives were: \u00e2\u00a2 ABC NEWS app: more local and regional stories featuring prominently in the main app story list and distribution of state-based alerts to app users highlighting strong local content \u00e2\u00a2 Apple News: more local story alerts being sent to the 2 million+ Apple News alert subscribers \u00e2\u00a2 Email newsletters: launch of the first curated ABC email newsletter, Weekend Reads with Virginia Trioli - other newsletters followed, including Australia Votes with Annabel Crabb and regional area newsletters providing local news and information relevant to the community \u00e2\u00a2 Election/policy: in addition to extensive state and federal election coverage, launch of the Australia Talks initiative to understand the thoughts and feelings of Australians from all walks of life and create a national conversation around those insights (see page 60 for more on Australia Talks) \u00e2\u00a2 Smart devices: local news audio flash briefings for smart speakers and devices - work is underway on video flash briefings \u00e2\u00a2 YouTube series: launch of an ABC co-production series with YouTube, A Dog Act, which explored the disappearance of Paddy Moriarty - the series has been shortlisted for numerous awards. Recommendation regarding iview The aim of the workshop was to explore to what degree iview is relevant, meaningful and useful to the Advisory Council members and their communities. The Advisory Council recommended that the ABC continue its work to increase awareness of the platform, improve consistency of experience across different devices, work toward greater personalisation of the platform, and improve accessibility by developing capability to allow programs to be downloaded for offline viewing. These recommendations have been taken into account in further development of the iview platform. In 2018-19, the iview Product Team delivered a range of improvements as part of the iview roadmap. With recommendations from the Advisory Council taken into consideration, an overview of the key developments included: \u00e2\u00a2 Consistency of Experience Across Different Devices: In May 2019, iview launched an Android TV application and refreshed the Apple TV app. Both reflect the improved 'show page' experience, bringing iview's big screen experience in line with viewer expectations. Rebuild on the iview Smart TV (i.e. internet connected TV) app began, with delivery planned within the next 6-12 months. \u00e2\u00a2 Personalisation continued to be a key priority, with work to add login to iview across mobile, Android TV and Apple TV progressed for delivery in late 2019. This will allow viewers to synchronise their iview experience across devices. \u00e2\u00a2 Increasing Awareness of the Platform: Product Marketing ran summer and winter campaigns to increase iview awareness, with a strong focus on iview content 'binges'. 56 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ABC Community Engagement programs are aimed at bringing the ABC to life in Australian communities by creating relationships with new and existing audiences and connecting them with the ABC in a way that is both meaningful and beneficial. In 2018-19, the Community Engagement team's focus was to reach younger Australians, their families, and the wider communities to which they belong. To achieve this vision, the team utilised the diverse resources of the ABC - its dedicated and passionate employees, vast network of studios across the country and outstanding content. Key engagement initiatives included the Regional Schools Program and the Open House Program. The Community Engagement Regional Schools Project (RSP) The RSP was launched in July 2018. The program aimed to create and build on partnerships between the ABC and regional primary and secondary schools, to make the ABC and its content relevant and valuable to school-aged children and educators, as well as to their wider regional communities. The RSP network now comprises 463 schools around Australia. The 2019 program focused on Media Literacy, and to date there have been media literacy workshops run by local journalists in each of the 48 regional communities in which the ABC is located. The Open House Program From July to November 2018 the Community Engagement team worked with regional and metropolitan staff around the country to open the doors of the ABC to their local communities. The Open House Program saw staff in locations from Broome to Hobart and Mackay to Perth welcome locals in to tour the facilities, meet ABC personalities and view key sets and props from some of the ABC's most popular programs, for example Play School and You Can't Ask That. Heywire In February 2019, Heywire winners took over Canberra for the week-long Heywire Regional Youth Summit. Heywire brings together young people aged between 16 and 22 from all over rural and regional Australia for a week of storytelling, ideas, friendship and leadership. At the summit, 34 Heywire winners and 15 Trailblazers (aged 18-28 years old) shared their stories of regional life. They were given the opportunity to pitch their ideas for tackling community issues - such as youth mental health, celebrating diversity, and supporting farmers - to members of parliament, government departments and community leaders. Their ideas have been supported to become reality through $100,000 in philanthropic grants provided by Heywire partners. Mentors from across the ABC supported and gave guidance to the young people throughout the summit. Their stories were featured on local radio, ABC TV's News Breakfast, RN's Life Matters, ABC Education website, and triple j's Hack. In attendance were Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Michael McCormack MP, who applauded the young people's boldness in sharing their stories and ideas, and the ABC's Managing Director David Anderson. Community Engagement Heywire and Trailblazers winners' stories and ideas can be found at https://www.abc.net.au/heywire/ Yours in the Community 57 ABC content is made with the assistance of, and is produced for, all Australians. ABC staff work closely with local communities and organisations to be a part of their world, and to reflect and share their stories. In 2018-19, Regional & Local (R&L) teams attended and broadcast from a large and diverse range of events across the country. Examples included the Port Fairy Folk Festival, the Tamworth Country Music Festival and the Golden Guitar Awards, Perth's Sculpture by the Sea at Cottesloe Beach, the World Science Festival, and the Brisbane Comedy Festival. Teams also attended ABC-initiated events that have become part of local communities such as the ABC Gardener's Market. ABC Adelaide has hosted the biannual market for more than 25 years. The April 2019 event attracted approximately 8,000 people and raised more than $20,000 for the Friends of the Botanic Gardens Adelaide. R&L teams respond to issues affecting their communities by initiating activities and partnering with local organisations to help bring people together when needed. In 2018-19 ABC Brisbane supported strawberry farmers (see feature box page 60), while New South Wales and ACT teams worked with ABC News to launch a drought appeal on 10 August 2018, which raised $1.2 million for affected farmers. In November 2018 ABC Sydney and Regional NSW teams also supported the Band Together Farmers concert in Parkes. More than 3,000 people attended the concert with Australian musicians such as the Hoodoo Gurus and ARC Supergroup performing to raise money for rural mental health and suicide prevention. In response to the bushfires in Tasmania at the beginning of 2019, ABC Hobart and ABC Northern Tasmania partnered with the Tasmanian government to put on a series of events in fire-affected communities such as Geeveston, Zeehan and Miena. ABC presenters hosted each event, with communities gathering to share stories of recovery and resilience. Australia All Over's Ian McNamara joined the event in Geeveston and the program then broadcast live from Grove in the Huon Valley the following morning. Entertainment & Specialist (E&S) teams also sought to provide support for fire-affected communities. The Factual team held screenings of the Black Saturday documentary Aftermath for those who experienced the disaster firsthand, giving them a safe space to watch and support each other. The 10-year anniversary of Black Saturday was also acknowledged with a whole day of outside broadcasts conducted by ABC Radio Melbourne from the communities affected in 2009. An episode of E&S's The Recording Studio saw a volunteer rural firefighter from Tathra recording a song to support his community as they continued to recover from the devastation of the March 2018 fires. The E&S team creates and contributes to myriad events, initiatives and celebrations involving local metropolitan and regional communities. The Don't Stop the Music Family Fun Day in Centennial Park Sydney in November 2018 featured performances from public primary schools and workshops for children. For younger listeners, Play School live concerts toured throughout regional areas, delighting children across the country. During the second series of War on Waste, educational resources and a Community Action Toolkit created with Good For The Hood were provided to empower community groups and individuals to take action on waste reduction. For more on the community impact of War on Waste, see page 137. The Operations team completed three outside broadcasts over five days, with ABC Adelaide staff travelling around 1,000 kilometres throughout the Murray Darling Basin for Dancing on the Darling, which brought together drought-affected communities from across the region. For more information on the social impact of ABC content in the community, see pages 136-7.

The concert also raised $25,000 for local charities. Each year the One Night Stand event gives regional communities the chance to enjoy a free, all-ages concert featuring some of Australia's biggest music acts, and encourages Australians - in particular young people - to travel to, explore and support some of the country's more remote regional areas. Tkay Maidza performs at the triple j One Night Stand in St Helens, Tasmania. Image: Damien Peck Yours in the Community 59 Australia Talks In late 2019 the ABC will launch Australia Talks, an unprecedented project across multiple content areas that aims to understand what it's like to live in modern Australia. The centrepiece of Australia Talks is an innovative digital survey of Australians from all walks of life that will provide insights on: \u00e2\u00a2 Perspectives - what they care about, their thoughts on Australia's biggest social issues, and what divides and unites Australians as a country \u00e2\u00a2 Wellbeing - how happy and healthy Australians are and whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about the future \u00e2\u00a2 National identity - how they see themselves as Australians and as part of the world. These insights will be used to create content on the thoughts and feelings of communities across the country, where the findings of the survey will be reflected in a wide range of content across all ABC platforms - including a live factual and entertainment program on ABC TV. They will also inform future commissioning of ABC programs. Announced by the ABC in March 2017, the Connecting Communities initiative increased investment in rural and regional Australia. The initiative provided an additional $15 million per annum for 80 new jobs to support audience and content initiatives and a one-off investment of $4 million for tools and production equipment. To date, 80% of the project has been delivered, including the recruitment of the new positions. New equipment has enhanced coverage of regional news and all regional bureaux now have the capacity to broadcast live breaking news. In 2018-19, a strong focus on training to improve the capacity of teams to use this equipment delivered positive results. The volume and quality of regional content continues to increase with national audiences engaging positively with regional content. In the 18 months to March 2019, average total monthly page views for regional digital articles on national platforms increased from 3.6 million to 13.4 million.1 The remote communities initiative continues, enabling journalists to spend time in rural communities that are rarely represented in the media to bring their stories to local and national attention. Destinations in 2018-19 included Parnngurr and Kalumburu in Western Australia, Ivanhoe in New South Wales, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island.

ABC Radio Sydney broadcast live on election night, with a panel providing comprehensive analysis of the count. State election coverage Yours in the Community 61 Management of broadcasting services The ABC remains committed to working with lead emergency authorities to inform and prepare the public before, during and after emergency events. ABC emergency broadcasting is usually undertaken by staff working in the 55 ABC Local Radio stations around the country. The ABC partners with lead agencies in each Australian jurisdiction in order to provide the best possible information to the public. These partnerships can include legal memorandums of understanding with state governments or their emergency delegates to provide timely and accurate information regarding significant threats to life and property. The ABC is a member of the Australian Fire and Emergencies Council Public Information and Warnings Group. This allows the organisation to work directly with the emergency sector at a national level. In so doing, the ABC has contributed to the writing of the Emergency Warnings Handbook. In several states, ABC managers are also members of their local or regional emergency management committees, allowing the ABC to have strong partnerships in place before disasters hit a community. In four state jurisdictions (WA, NT, ACT and NSW) the ABC has negotiated to have a manager work in a liaison role with the emergency agencies' state operation centres during major emergency events. This has streamlined information sharing, enabling key emergency messages and advice to be delivered faster to affected communities. These roles were active during Cyclone Veronica (WA, March 2019), Cyclone Trevor (NT, March 2019) and bushfires around the NSW communities of Tingha and Tabulam (March 2019). Emergency broadcasting in 2018-19 The 2018-19 year was a particularly challenging one for communities with a sharp escalation in the number and nature of emergency events affecting communities. Overall, the ABC handled 371 emergency broadcast events throughout 2018-19, an increase of around 120 events compared to 2017-18. The longest period in 2018-19 in which no emergency broadcasting was required was seven weeks.

Four states experienced emergency-level bushfires during winter with the increased activity continuing through spring. This posed challenges as fires occurred outside the period in which the ABC has traditionally rostered emergency broadcast coordinator roles or weekend staff dedicated to broadcasting emergency updates as they occur. To address this escalation in events, the R&L team increased their emergency broadcasting resources year-round. Fires were by far the most common hazard requiring emergency broadcasting in 2018-19, followed by storms and floods. Every jurisdiction was involved in emergency broadcasting, although ABC bureaux in Queensland handled far more than those in the other states and territories. Work in Queensland included coverage of the state's first ever catastrophic bushfire conditions in November-December 2018 and the floods which affected Townsville and western Queensland in February 2019. Other major events during the year included fires in Tasmania in January and Victoria in March and cyclones that affected WA and the NT simultaneously over one weekend in March. WHS, training and support During 2018-19, R&L conducted training in emergency broadcasting for all Local Radio bureaux and stations. In most cases, training was implemented face to face and involved radio and social media content-makers and their managers, and reporters likely to work in the field during emergencies. Training reinforced key messages about the help available through the ABC's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and the ABC's Peer Support program. Emergency team and senior managers in the R&L team received trauma and resilience training. All bureaux and stations have kits of Personal Protective Equipment designed to protect content-makers working in flood, fire and cyclone zones. Risk assessments have been specifically designed by the ABC WHS team to establish that all measures are taken to ensure staff safety in those zones. In 2018-19, R&L also worked with the WHS team and designed and implemented emergency coverage training for News, Investigations & Analysis staff based in capital cities.

It focuses on improving skills and abilities in content production and research to enable partner organisations to pursue quality journalism, develop engaging storytelling and build strong connections with their communities. The ABCID team provides expertise, training, technical and program support to partner organisations. It works with local media organisations, regional bodies, development assistance bodies and international development donors. As the international media development branch of the ABC, it sits within the Public Affairs team and supports the Corporation's regional presence and international engagement. ABCID projects in 2018-19 Media Development Initiative (MDI) The MDI supports Papua New Guinea media to generate content that promotes a greater range of citizen voices and increased accountability among decision-makers. Support included training in multiplatform content-making, Women in Media research and the development of storytelling formats for social media. MDI works at both the national level (such as supporting National Press Club events to promote national discussion) and provincial level (working with local communities to use their voice on local issues and encourage the responsiveness of local officials). Pacific Media Assistance Scheme (PACMAS) PACMAS works across the Pacific region with media organisations, media associations, regional bodies and civil society groups. It supports the facilitation of independent and balanced discourse across Pacific government, business and civil society. PACMAS capacity development activities include training of trainers for economic and business reporting, broadcast technicians training, journalism education and social media training. In 2018-19, a major PACMAS project saw the replacement of Samoa's Radio 2AP AM transmitter. The station provides critical information to communities during natural disasters. Women in News and Sports (WINS) The WINS program champions women journalists to join the traditionally male-dominated world of sports media and aims to increase coverage of women in sport. The ABC's expertise in sports broadcasting helps train and mentor women journalists in the Indo-Pacific so they are given opportunities to cover major regional sporting events. Coverage in 2018-19 included the 2018 Commonwealth Games, 2019 Arafura Games and a podcast on female participation in the 2019 Pacific Games in Samoa. Cambodia Communications Assistance Project (CCAP) In 2018-19, CCAP supported provincial radio stations to produce robust talkback discussions inspired by ABC regional and local programs, creating a platform for citizens' voices and participation, and promoting greater accountability and transparency among local authorities. While funding for the long-running CCAP ended in March 2019, talkback remains prominent on the participating radio stations.

ABC Audiences 73 Television Shifts in the media landscape over the past few years continued to affect television audiences in 2018-19, with Australians now able to access an unprecedented range of content on a multitude of screens and devices. In 2019, each Australian home has an average of 17 devices, up 25% since 2017, with the majority being internet capable.19 Despite year-on-year declines, broadcast television remains a popular choice for viewing, with a reach of 19.4 million Australians each week in 2018-19.20 However, over the past year, there has been increased competition in the viewing landscape with the rise in popularity of Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) services. Australians have embraced the flexibility and choice that the SVOD services provide, to the detriment of traditional broadcast viewing. Video on Demand (VOD) viewing as a whole was recorded at its highest ever in June 2018,21 with total VPM minutes for 2018-19 up 50% year-on-year.22 Television methodology As viewing patterns change, the lifespan of content is now being extended well beyond the initial television broadcast schedule. The way in which content is measured has also evolved. 'Long Tail' viewing measurement is now captured by 28-day time-shift TV ratings and Video Player Measurement (VPM) captures on-demand viewing. OzTAM VPM Data captures minute-by-minute viewing of online video across the five free-to-air broadcasters and Foxtel's online video players. This methodology provides an 'average audience' figure for each program or episode, which can then be added to the TV broadcast figure, in order to reflect a more complete audience measure. Total ABC TV Total TV reach was slightly down in 2018-19 compared to 2017-18, with free-to-air and subscription television viewing also showing declines in overall reach.23 The popularity of VOD services continued to contribute to the fragmentation of viewing, as emerging platforms and technologies alter consumer behaviour and offer alternatives to traditional scheduled viewing. Metropolitan Total ABC metropolitan average weekly reach in 2018-19 was 8.1 million people or 47.0% of the five-city metropolitan population. This is down compared to 2017-18 (8.5 million, or 49.7%).24 Total ABC metropolitan Total TV share during daytime increased slightly in 2018-19.

This was down 27% on 2017-18, which was in part due to some health stories being published in ABC Life. The most popular stories concerned processed foods, blood pressure and what happens if you don't remove a splinter.98 ABC Life The ABC Life website launched in August 2018 as a destination for lifestyle content covering topics including wellbeing, food, money, travel, family and work (for more, see page 45).

This measure shows the aggregate weighted delivery of content to audiences across all radio and television services where the final transmission is via terrestrial transmission facilities including analogue and digital radio, and digital television. This measure quantifies where service was provided to the audience (no total loss of service, i.e. not off-air) but service quality is not assessed in this measure. The 2018-19 performance remained consistent with the previous year and met the target.

The ABC sets performance targets for these contracted services. Targets include measures assessing performance by: transmission type (radio or television); technology (analogue or digital); regions (aggregated states); and class of service (a measure of the site redundancy or complexity). In 2018-19 Broadcast Australia met its contracted service obligations under these agreements. In 2018-19 the overarching operational transmission target was met.

No. of Transmitters: The number of transmitters includes Analogue Radio, Digital Television and Digital Radio operated by Broadcast Australia on behalf of the ABC. If a transmitter was operational during the period for one or more days, it is included in the report. Transmitter numbers for Digital Television do not include the six standby transmitters operated in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, and Sydney, which operate as a backup to the main transmitter in those areas. 2. Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The transmission network performance data is reported by Broadcast Australia in the period 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018. This is a contracted deliverable and is measured against the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each service, network, or sub national network. The data is regularly reviewed and authenticated by ABC Transmission Network Services. There are 12 Class E digital radio services that are provided by Broadcast Australia for the ABC where contract performance is not measured as a target of overall uptime. These services are provided to equalise audience experience across both national and commercial and community broadcasters. 3. Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages on the overall network: This reflects all faults across the transmission networks regardless of severity or cause or whether subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) or not. The vast majority of these faults are services not meeting full specification such as lower transmission power as agreed by the ABC on a case by case basis. 4. Total 'On-Air' Availability: The figures show 'off-air' occurrences where no service was provided due to faults and/or maintenance activity. It is important to note that the majority of maintenance activity is undertaken after midnight to reduce audience impact. 98 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Pillar 4: Building a great place to work Culture The progress towards building a great place to work and ensuring a creative environment can be gauged by the engagement of the people working within the public broadcaster.

The team's Communications, Community Engagement and International Development (ABCID) units were moved to the Public Affairs team to facilitate a more cohesive communications and external stakeholder strategy. This allowed the People & Culture team to focus on the ABC's workforce and internal culture. ABC People & Culture seek to make the ABC a rewarding place to work, where: \u00e2\u00a2 professional development and career opportunities are planned and encouraged \u00e2\u00a2 strong performance and great ideas are recognised and celebrated \u00e2\u00a2 managers know how to lead their teams supportively and talk honestly with them about both the good news and the bad \u00e2\u00a2 craft skills are nurtured and kept up to date \u00e2\u00a2 ABC values are evident in the way staff interact with each other \u00e2\u00a2 bureaucracy is kept to a minimum \u00e2\u00a2 everyone understands the ABC strategy and their role in its delivery. ABC values and workplace behaviour The ABC Principles were launched in 2018 to help the ABC create and support a positive culture. Following the launch, ABC Principles Workshops were held across all capital cities for frontline managers to enhance their awareness and understanding of the initiative. 'ABC Principles toolkits' were made available to all managers to share with their teams and assist in adopting the principles throughout the Corporation. The ABC Principles are: \u00e2\u00a2 We are ABC \u00e2\u00a2 Straight Talking \u00e2\u00a2 People Focused \u00e2\u00a2 Accountable \u00e2\u00a2 Open and Transparent. The Principles set clear expectations about working at the ABC as individuals, as leaders and together across teams. They set out the behaviours and attitudes employees commit to in delivering the Investing in Audiences strategy and are used to help build and manage teams as well as recognise and reward outstanding performance. ABC People ABC Classic's Christopher Lawrence. Image: Toby Chadd Working at the ABC 103 Employee engagement ABC People & Culture worked on many initiatives throughout the year to gauge, support and increase employee engagement. The recruitment and new-starter process was simplified with the introduction of a new, more automated system and a reduction in the number of forms required on commencing employment with the ABC. The Change it Up program created opportunities for current staff to volunteer for Stargazing and other events, to find a mentor or become a mentor. To drive employee engagement and motivate high performance, the inaugural ABC Peer-Based Recognition Program was launched in September 2018. The program further embedded the ABC Principles by calling for nominations of outstanding workplace behaviour measured against its values. Staff could recognise team members or employees in other areas of the ABC. Enhancements were made to Leadership Development programs, with more comprehensive programs designed to equip ABC managers to lead their teams throughout the content team transformation and into the future. Evaluation of the technical/craft skills needed in content teams was also completed, and the rollout of tailored priority training to address those needs commenced. In order to create a working environment with less bureaucracy and red tape, Bureaucracy Stop, launched in early 2018, resulted in more than 70 initiatives that streamlined work and removed duplication. More regular employee and leader communication and the sharing of information within and across teams was encouraged, and regular Leadership Team metropolitan and regional visits were undertaken to improve leadership visibility. One year after the former platform teams were restructured along content lines, ABC People & Culture led a review into the operation of the new structure to better understand how employees were experiencing the changes. A cross-divisional working group was established to oversee the process. Part of the review included a voluntary all staff survey which had high response rate. Employment agreements The ABC Enterprise Agreement 2016-19 came into operation in December 2016, and reached its nominal expiry date in June 2019. In March 2017, the ABC Senior Employment Agreement 2016 reached its nominal expiry date. Both agreements are continuing to operate until new agreements are made or the current agreements are terminated.

This was a period of significant change for the ABC, with the bedding down of the restructure of content divisions and the development and introduction of new technologies. Learning and development activities focused on supporting both leaders and employees through these changes and ensuring they were able to continue building the skills required in the modern media environment. To help meet demand for learning opportunities, employees were provided with training across a wide range of topics and skill areas, particularly those relating to technology and craft skills. Training in more than 150 different topics across 56 skill areas was delivered during the period, using a range of learning platforms and methodologies. Increasingly, learning opportunities are being offered using a blended approach of short, focused sessions and masterclasses along with online learning and webinars, which provide more options for staff who are geographically dispersed. Over 2018-19, around 14,075 staff attendances were recorded at 1,265 learning events delivered internally, externally, online and via webinar, amounting to 40,052 participant hours. These figures represent an increase in the total number of participants compared to the previous year, demonstrating a growing interest in professional development. The data does not capture the entirety of the ABC's investment in learning and development as figures reflect only the information provided to the Learning & Development Team. Work continues to ensure that reporting of training is improved, to better reflect overall ABC investment. Growth in participation was supported by an expanding range of quality learning and development opportunities made available through flexible learning approaches. This included ' just-in-time' online learning, which was made available to increase access to training regardless of location. 'Just-in-time' courses and resources cover a growing number of topics from understanding audience analytics and editorial policies to legal guidance, craft skills, and work health and safety. They have been designed to work on any platform including mobile phone, tablet or PC, and are easily accessible in or out of a work environment at any time. During 2018-19, the eLearning team continued to build an internal catalogue of content by partnering with ABC areas to make training tailored to their needs. Investment in craft skills continued to be a priority. One example saw the design and roll-out of Production Skills Workshops for Regional & Local (R&L). These courses aimed to raise the technical and craft skills of radio producers, including casual producers, across all metropolitan and regional radio stations. The training provided a broader understanding of their roles and responsibilities and resulted in a more consistent approach to radio production across the entire R&L network. R&L's 35 chiefs-of-staff are also given regular leadership training. The ABC continued to access external expertise to deliver customised leadership programs. A two-day program developed for News, Analysis & Investigations (NA&I) in partnership with an external consultant used experiential learning principles to explore the skills and knowledge required by leaders in a modern, diverse, fast paced newsroom. The course was attended by 134 people across seven states - 75 from State Coverage (part of the NA&I team) and 59 from other teams including Regional & Local. The strategy of offering places to other teams assisted with the breaking down of silos and the improvement of communication across the organisation. The ABC also uses its own skilled broadcasters and subject matter experts to develop other employees. Successful examples of this in 2018-19 were the Margaret Throsby masterclasses, with approximately 100 people in attendance and a similar number taking part via webinar. Participants heard Margaret and her guests discuss the keys to their success while providing professional insight and sharing their individual experiences. Capability, development and training Working at the ABC 105 Team-led training (Content Teams) In 2018, Regional & Local (R&L) undertook a comprehensive training needs analysis that identified priority areas for training in 2018-19. Training delivered to address these areas included: a Features Reporter course developed to enhance multiplatform output and attended by more than 100 reporters, audio recording training, video training delivered to more than 150 reporters with feedback sessions provided, and training to enable regional bureaux to broadcast live, breaking news on new equipment as it rolled out over the year. R&L's Quality team worked with every regional bureau and capital city station in 2018-19. More than 200 airchecks were conducted to ensure the continued high quality of regional output. In News, Analysis & Investigations (NA&I), the introduction of the Integrated Media System (IMS - see page 122) across operations required a major training program involving around 1,200 staff, to build skills in the new work practices afforded by the technology. Over 2018-19, more than 3,000 other training sessions were delivered to the NA&I team in subjects ranging from Digital Forensics to Four Wheel Driving. Steps taken during the year to strengthen quality control processes and digital sub-editing regimes also improved the robustness of processes around news output (for more on editorial training, see page 115). In Entertainment & Specialist (E&S), Music team managers participated in performance management workshops, ABC Audio Studios trained content makers in best practice podcast principles, and formal leadership training was provided to senior leaders in the Children's team. Operations had training in technical production including regional audio production skills. E&S also continued its proud tradition of improving the skills of new and emerging Australian creatives through programs such as the Fresh Blood initiative in ABC Comedy and DisRupted in Children's.

It seeks to encompass the rich and varied nature of Australian society in both its workforce and its content, and increase awareness of the country's broad range of communities and cultures. The ABC takes these responsibilities seriously and considers diversity one of its key strategic priorities. The Corporation has a strong track record of engaging with, and telling the stories of, diverse communities. The ABC is required by the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987 (the EEO Act) to develop a program designed to eliminate discrimination and promote equal opportunity for women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from a non-English speaking background (NESB), and people with disabilities. As an employer, the ABC is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace, to demonstrating values-based leadership, and to fostering attitudes and behaviours that contribute to a safe, creative and vibrant working environment. Equity and Diversity Plan Central to the ABC's workforce strategy is the ABC Equity and Diversity Plan 2016-18 (the Plan). This sets out clear approaches and targets to encourage a culture of diversity, engagement and flexibility, embrace diversity in the workplace, and represent, engage and connect with Australian communities. As a guide, the following employment Corporate targets were identified in the Plan to guide the approach of ABC teams: \u00e2\u00a2 50% women executives \u00e2\u00a2 20% women technologists \u00e2\u00a2 non-English speaking background (NESB) \u00e2\u00a2 Up to 12% NESB content makers \u00e2\u00a2 5% employees with disability. Actions, goals and targets which specifically relate to the employment, experiences and coverage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People are included in the ABC's Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan 2016-18 (see page 109). Overall, the measures that were launched under the 2016-18 Plan have been successful and while they remain important and ongoing, there is more work to do to achieve the Plan's goals and targets, particularly in relation to the representation of cultural diversity in the ABC's workforce. At the end of June 2019, the ABC had a gender-balanced workforce and leadership, had met its disability target, and had made considerable progress in increasing the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People in its workforce. However, the Corporation fell short of its targets for the representation of NESB employees. In light of this outcome, the Equity & Diversity Plan 2016-18 has been extended to allow the ABC to reassess its approach. As part of this reassessment, and with a new Managing Director and Chair having been appointed, the Corporation is in the process of developing a new Diversity and Inclusion Plan for 2019-22. The plan will be launched in September 2019, and will provide a three-year strategic roadmap to guide the ABC in further developing its diverse, inclusive culture, with a workforce profile, content offering and services that reflect the diversity of the Australian community. The ABC is required by section 9(2) of the EEO Act to report its performance annually for the period 1 September to 31 August. More information on outcomes and next steps against the plan will become available when the ABC Equity and Diversity Annual Report 2019 is published. Current and historical Equity and Diversity Annual Reports are available on the ABC's website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-theabc-is-run/reports-and-publications/ Diversity Working at the ABC 107 Diversity & Inclusion Standing Committee (DISC) The Diversity & Inclusion Standing Committee (DISC) supports ABC diversity measures and makes recommendations on diversity and inclusion matters to the Executive Leadership Team. The DISC is co-chaired by two members of the Leadership team and is composed of senior representatives from ABC teams, the chairs of the Employee Network Groups and a representative from the Bonner Committee (see page 109). The composition of the committee demonstrates the importance of diversity and inclusion as a strategic priority for the ABC, and helps retain influence at the highest level of the Corporation. The DISC ensure a coordinated pan-ABC approach to improving diversity and inclusion outcomes. In 2019, the DISC oversaw the development of the new Diversity & Inclusion Plan 2019-22. They also met every quarter to review progress against the commitments of the current Equity & Diversity Plan, share best practice, and identify solutions to current issues. Critical pieces of work identified and scoped by the DISC throughout the year included: \u00e2\u00a2 the creation of new entry level programs for diverse content makers \u00e2\u00a2 the development of new tools to measure and track levels of diversity on air and behind the scenes \u00e2\u00a2 the improvement of recruitment processes and talent management in relation to Indigenous and culturally diverse on air employees \u00e2\u00a2 ways of supporting employees from under-represented groups into leadership positions. Media cadetships The 2018 ABC Media Cadetship program was launched to unearth and develop new talent with new approaches to content making. The program was specifically aimed at groups traditionally under-represented in the media industry and was designed to help them overcome traditional barriers to entering media organisations. The approach had the reciprocal benefit of allowing the ABC to connect with under-represented audience groups and add energy, ideas and innovation to the workforce of the future. The positive outcomes of the inaugural Media Cadet Program 2018-19 were realised almost immediately. Within four weeks of commencing with the ABC, the Media Cadet cohort had contributed to content making through a range of activities, including writing articles, recording interviews and assisting on television recordings. At the conclusion of the program, most of the cadets from the 2018-19 intake went on to secure further employment within the ABC. Indigenous employment Leadership commitment, increased resources and targeted Indigenous employment and retention strategies begun in 2014 have meant considerable progress has been made towards the ABC's 3% Indigenous employment target. At the end of the reporting period, Indigenous employees made up 2.7% of the ABC workforce. Indigenous employees have access to career development opportunities, mentorships, scholarships and internships across the ABC. Additional leave is also offered to enable Indigenous employees to participate in NAIDOC Week activities. The ABC Indigenous Mentoring Program supports staff with skills development, career advice, practical assistance and help in understanding organisational culture. A key measure taken up by the ABC to increase the representation of Indigenous employees was the advertising of vacancies only open to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, under the affirmative measure provisions of the Australian Public Service Commissioner's Directions 2016. Hiring managers at the ABC are encouraged to consider targeting advertising to Indigenous candidates and are provided with specialist recruitment support. During the reporting period, 11 roles were filled under the provisions. 108 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Indigenous ABC employees by Team Team Headcount FTE ABC Commercial 3 3.0 Audiences 8 6.5 Content Ideas Lab - - Corporate Management & Public Affairs* - - Editorial Policies - - Entertainment & Specialist 21 19.0 Finance 4 2.7 News, Analysis, Investigations 38 35.4 People & Culture 4 4.0 Product & Content Technology 11 10.7 Regional & Local 21 20.4 Grand Total 110 101.6 Notes: 1.

It focuses on four key areas: \u00e2\u00a2 Respect \u00e2\u00a2 Opportunities\u2014Employment and Supplier Diversity \u00e2\u00a2 Opportunities\u2014Content. All actions outlined in the Plan are monitored for progress by the ABC's Bonner Committee. Named for the late Neville Bonner AO, who was an ABC Board Director from 1983 to 1991 and Australia's first Indigenous Senator, the Bonner Committee is the ABC's advisory and representative body on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees, content, and communities. Comprising a mix of Indigenous and non-Indigenous employees, the Committee of 12 members meets at least six times a year, and the Chair provides feedback and advice on discussions and decisions directly to the Managing Director. Reports on progress against RAP targets are also provided to the Executive Leadership Team biannually, with external reports on progress published annually in the ABC's Equity and Diversity Annual Report (see page 107). RAP impact measurement information is provided in response to Reconciliation Australia's Impact questionnaire. The Bonner Committee has developed a new Elevate RAP with input from across the ABC and with endorsement by Reconciliation Australia. The new RAP will be launched in 2019. An Elevate RAP is for organisations with a proven track record of embedding effective RAP initiatives, and who are ready to take on a leadership position to advance national reconciliation. Elevate RAP organisations have a strong strategic relationship with Reconciliation Australia and actively champion initiatives to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and create societal change. There are unique requirements, expectations and processes to consider prior to commencement of an Elevate RAP. To ensure these requirements were appropriately considered and incorporated, the Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan 2016-18 was extended until 30 June 2019.

Gender profile The ABC has made significant efforts to achieve a gender-balanced workforce and has experienced considerable success: \u00e2\u00a2 Women now make up six of the ABC's nine Board members. \u00e2\u00a2 The ABC reached gender parity in its executive leadership group in 2017. \u00e2\u00a2 The overall number of women employees in the ABC workforce slightly exceeds the number of male employees, which is reflective of the gender profile of the Australian population where women slightly outnumber men. \u00e2\u00a2 There is gender parity in the content makers group, significant as content making is the core business of the ABC. On 8 March 2019, the ABC celebrated International Women's Day across the country with internal events and specialised programming across all platforms. The ABC's Sydney office hosted a panel discussion moderated by Ellen Fanning with guests Kumi Taguchi, Manda Hatter, Nakkiah Lui and Judith Whelan, which was available for viewing live in ABC offices across all locations. Melbourne enjoyed a morning tea and featured a preview of their one-hour show, Long Story Short, which was the brainchild of ABC Radio Melbourne and featured four prominent Australians exploring the roles all people have in achieving gender equality. Darwin, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth all hosted special guests and held morning teas or lunches to celebrate the event with employees. The Back Roads extended crew take a break at Woolgoolga, NSW.

A range of new internships and cadetships programs were launched including: \u00e2\u00a2 the ABC Regional Storyteller Scholarship, aimed at content makers with disability from regional Australia \u00e2\u00a2 the Victorian Multicultural Commission-ABC Internship Program, which supports young journalists and storytellers from culturally diverse backgrounds \u00e2\u00a2 the ABC and AFTRS Selwyn Speight Diversity Scholarship aimed at students from diverse cultural, ethnic or socio-economic backgrounds, or from otherwise underrepresented minority groups \u00e2\u00a2 the Victorian Screen Development Internship which provides career pathways for creative talent from Indigenous and diverse backgrounds. In 2019, the ABC embarked on a new partnership with the Asian Leadership Project, a group dedicated to advance Asian and culturally diverse talent into leadership positions. As part of its membership, ABC employees have access to professional development events designed and facilitated with Asian cultural sensitivities in mind. Like many other workplaces in Australia, the ABC has an ageing workforce, many of whom are carers for an older relative. This year, the ABC partnered with Managing Work Life Balance to help employees manage both care and work responsibilities while practising self-care and wellbeing, and to provide them with information on financial assistance through the Eldercare Kits - an extensive resource directory of agencies and associations across Australia. The Speak Up initiative continues to provide an opportunity for employees to talk to their peers about gender, sexism, racism and other cultural safety issues. Support was provided by colleagues trained in the legal framework and ABC policies on discrimination, bullying and harassment, responding to disclosures, dealing with trauma and providing guidance. ABC Pride ABC Pride is an employee-led initiative committed to creating an inclusive work environment that supports and embraces difference, while respecting and valuing everyone's contribution. In June 2019, ABC Pride held its inaugural Gayla event. Comedian Zoe Coombs Marr welcomed over 200 ABC employees as ABC Pride launched its strategy to increase LGBTQI+ diversity on and off screen at the ABC. ABC Pride Chair Manda Hatter outlined the key initiatives to be undertaken, including: \u00e2\u00a2 LGBTQI+ inclusion within the ABC's 2019 Mentoring Program \u00e2\u00a2 annual LGBTQI+ Awards \u00e2\u00a2 the proposed inclusion of Gender Transition Leave within the ABC's Enterprise Agreement. For many employees, the Gayla was a moment to reflect on how far the ABC had come in supporting its LGBTQI+ employees.

Image: Hayley Legg Working at the ABC 111 Management of WHS A range of initiatives were implemented to improve the ABC's management of WHS in 2018-19. WHS Team intranet pages were launched for each team, to facilitate easy access to team-specific WHS information, including risk assessments, WHS guidelines and WHS Committee information. WHS Risk Assessment workshops were delivered to a range of stakeholders to improve their assessment capability, and fact sheets were developed to provide safety information about managing a range of high-risk scenarios including driving, natural disasters, gender-based hazards (such as sexual violence) and civil unrest/riots. A successful submission was made to the ABC's Technology Project Office to fund the purchase of 25 lightweight cameras to reduce the incidence of body stressing injuries for camera operators, and People & Culture partnered with the Emergency Broadcast Team to raise the profile of WHS in EB guidance material, training and procedures. An external audit of ABC's Rehabilitation Management System to benchmark compliance with Comcare standards achieved a score of 96%. Health and safety committees Twelve WHS committees operate across the ABC, with a total of 183 members. 92% of the workforce has committee representation, and the remainder is represented by other agreed WHS consultative arrangements. WHS across the ABC News, Analysis & Investigations (NA&I)'s WHS plan is built on three key values: Safe Places, Safe Systems and Safe People. Key performance indicators are specified for each value and requirements include mandatory workplace inspections across all operations, including International bureaux. In 2018-19 News had a 100% inspection completion rate. Risk assessment training was also delivered to key program areas. To reduce the risk of manual handling of equipment by field camera operators, News began work with the Product & Content Technology (P&CT) team to introduce lightweight equipment across video production teams. ABC Production & Content Technology (P&CT) initiated an electrical safety competency training and assessment program in 2018-19, to ensure technologists engaged in equipment repairs have undergone risk identification and hazard mitigation training. P&CT also implemented improvements in the management of WHS inspections and risk assessment processes including improved reporting of completion rates. Entertainment & Specialist (E&S)'s Operations team began updating its risk assessments and standard operating procedures, particularly in relation to outside broadcasts. The Presentation Systems & Assets team established an employee wellbeing program that encourages flexible work/life balance arrangements, including work-from-home days and remote-enabled laptops to improve work flexibility. In 2018, all areas of the ABC Children's team working on internal productions and with external producers, reviewed and implemented improvements to their Working with Children policies and practices in line with the new ABC Child Protection Policy Response. Regional & Local (R&L) collaborated with the WHS team to produce specific pre-filled Risk Assessments, particularly relating to emergency broadcasting and shared broadcasting events such as election coverage. This ensured managers working in challenging situations had the correct advice to share with their teams. Driving guidance was created for R&L staff required to travel long distances for work purposes and R&L used the experience of its Emergency team to develop and undertake emergency coverage training in capital city newsrooms, to assist reporting teams working with NA&I. Work health and safety 112 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Work-related WHS incidents In 2018-19, a total of 181 work-related incidents were reported (252 in 2017-18). Of those incidents, five were notified to Comcare by the ABC. An incident is notifiable to Comcare if it results in death, medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital, immediate treatment for a serious injury, infection with a prescribed illness, or if it involves a dangerous occurrence. The ABC must ensure notification is made to Comcare, and the ABC Board, immediately after becoming aware that a notifiable incident has occurred. Notices and investigations Comcare has the power to conduct an investigation into an ABC workplace at any time to ascertain whether the requirements of WHS legislation are being complied with, regarding a breach or suspected breach, or concerning an accident or dangerous occurrence. During 2018-19, there were no investigations conducted by Comcare as a result of any Comcare-notified incidents. Workers compensation claims Of the 179 work-related incidents reported in 2018-19, 15 resulted in workers compensation claims being accepted by Comcare (compared with eight in 2017-18). Analysis of the accepted claims in 2018-19 showed injuries were primarily due to falls, trips and slips in the workplace or in the course of work, followed by mental health illnesses and body stressing, which includes all musculoskeletal disorders such as occupational overuse and manual task injuries. Workers compensation premiums The ABC Premium rate decreased from 0.66% in 2018-19 to 0.53% in the 2019-20 review. The reduction reflects the claims experience of the Comcare scheme as a whole, with reduced ABC claims numbers in 2017-18 and better than expected lifetime cost estimates in the 2015-16 year. The overall premium rate for all Commonwealth agencies decreased from 1.06% in 2018-19 to 0.85% in 2019-20, consistent with previous years responses, where fewer overall claims are being accepted by the Comcare scheme per year. The ABC's workers compensation premium for 2019-20 is $2,376,564 (ex GST), compared to $2,144,712 in 2018-19.

They are a day-to-day reference point for content makers and are critical to the ABC's ability to meet its statutory obligations and the expectations of audiences. They provide the basis for the ABC Code of Practice, which the ABC provides to the industry regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). In addition, the Editorial Policies give practical shape to statutory obligations in the ABC Act, in particular the obligations to provide services of a high standard; maintain independence and integrity; and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Editorial management and guidance In 2018-19, the Editorial Policies team expanded to add a full-time Language Research Specialist, to strengthen language and pronunciation support across ABC output. An internal restructure in September 2018 saw the remit of the Audience and Consumer Affairs team change to focus only on editorial complaints. Previously, the unit comprised two teams, with one team handling editorial complaints and the other feedback such as requests, suggestions and appreciations, as well as complaints about matters of personal preference which did not raise issues of compliance with the ABC's editorial standards. Contacts and complaints in this latter group are now handled by Audience Planning and are reported on separately (see page 105). Editorial complaints management, handled by Audience and Consumer Affairs, is reported in the Accountability chapter (see page 141). In January 2019, the Editorial Policies and Code of Practice were updated with the addition of a new Preamble setting out the aims and principles behind the Editorial Policies. The Scope section of the Code was revised to set out more clearly the factors considered by the ABC in determining whether or not a complaint falls within the Code. Other changes removed any suggestion that ACMA is itself bound by the ABC's deliberations in relation to scope. New wording was added to Standard 5.8 of the Code which deals with 'Secret Recording and Other Types of Deception', to reinforce the need to consider the potential for harm when undertaking secret recording, even where consent or the obscuring of identities are involved. The Editorial Director notified all staff of the changes to the Editorial Policies and Code of Practice, and all related Editorial training materials were updated and amended to reflect. In February 2019, the Editorial Policy Group, chaired by the Editorial Director, issued new guidance on Advertising and Sponsorship ABC Magazines, to assist publishing staff in upholding the editorial standards. Editorial training There was a high level of engagement with editorial standards training during 2018-19, with more face-to-face training leading to increased participation rates when compared to the last reporting period. Almost 2000 participants undertook the Online Editorial Course and the Editorial Policies training resource continued to assist staff to make quick, accurate editorial decisions. The training resource is a good example of a ' just-in-time' learning platform (see page 105), being accessible anywhere, anytime.

Sources training, developed in conjunction with ABC Legal, covered issues such as the obligation to protect confidentiality, when to offer confidentiality, the legal risks associated with recent legislative changes, procedures for upward referral, duty of care for vulnerable sources, and practical measures to ensure confidentiality and to mitigate potential harm to sources. Impartiality and fairness training covered both the requirements for fairness and impartiality when producing investigative journalism and other stories involving allegations of wrongdoing, and how to ensure impartiality in political and other issues-driven journalism. Editorial reviews The ABC consistently reviews its own performance against the editorial standards. Content makers and program teams regularly review their own work, and the ABC also commissions reviews that are independent of content makers and carried out by a range of internal and external reviewers. An overview of Editorial Reviews in 2018-19 can be found in the Annual Performance Statements on page 87. The Editorial Reviews and ABC responses to those reviews are published on the ABC's corporate website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/abc-editorial-standards/editorial-reviews/. Corrections and clarifications The ABC publishes a Corrections and Clarifications page on its corporate website which brings together in one place the corrections and clarifications made to ABC content across radio, television and digital platforms, whether as a result of complaints or for any other reason. Where possible, links to the original content are provided. In 2018-19, 46 corrections or clarifications were published on the Corrections and Clarifications page on the ABC's website. Where online transcripts existed, editor's notes and corrections to copy were also published. Duncan Bellows and Alison Bell in The Letdown. Image: Tony Mott 116 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Election Coverage Review The Election Coverage Review Committee (ECRC) is convened during each federal, state or territory election campaign to monitor ABC coverage and ensure ABC editorial standards are met. The Committee is chaired by the Editorial Director or a senior editorial policy advisor and comprises representatives from all relevant ABC divisions. It is principally a committee of review and does not supplant the usual lines of editorial authority in each division during an election campaign. For federal elections, the ECRC reviews externally commissioned share of voice data to ensure appropriate editorial balance is maintained and no single political party is disproportionately represented. This is done while recognising that there are a range of factors which can and will affect the amount of time or share of voice of each party. For state and territory elections, the ECRC monitors content, internal records and feedback to ensure editorial balance. Audience complaints related to election coverage are also reviewed by the Committee. The Chair of the ECRC is also responsible for administering the free broadcast time allocated to eligible political parties. Broadcast slots are provided on television and radio for policy announcements by political parties who meet the eligibility criteria. During 2018-19, the ECRC convened on three occasions, to cover the state elections in Victoria and New South Wales, and the Federal Election. Federal Election 2019 - ECRC review The Election Coverage Review Committee for the federal election was chaired by the Editorial Director. In addition to the major parties, the Greens, One Nation, Australian Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, United Australia Party and Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party all met the eligibility criteria for free broadcast time. One Nation did not use its allocation. Editorial balance was broadly achieved, with external share of voice data showing time apportioned in percentage terms at 41.0% Coalition and 35.7% Labor across ABC outlets. The Greens share of voice was 7.5% with the remaining 15.8% shared by minor parties and independents. The data also showed a 13.7% share of voice for the Prime Minister and 11.1% for the Opposition Leader. ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs received 322 complaints alleging a breach of the ABC's Editorial Policies or Code of Practice in relation to the ABC's 2019 federal election coverage. Of these, 61% alleged bias in favour of the Opposition, 28% alleged bias in favour of the Government and 11% alleged other bias. At the time of writing, no complaints about election coverage had been upheld by Audience and Consumer Affairs. For more on the ABC's federal election coverage, see page 22. Working at the ABC 117 Product & Content Technology In early 2018-19, ABC Technology was restructured to strengthen the division's ability to effectively deliver on the Investing in Audiences strategy and reshape the way the ABC invests in audience-facing digital products, content production and management, and technology infrastructure. The newly-named Product & Content Technology (P&CT) Team brought together employees from across the ABC with expertise in digital products and design, and delivered efficiencies through flatter management structures, vendor contract negotiations, and the opportunities presented by evolving technology solutions. The P&CT Team is focussed on delivering against five strategic priorities: 1 Meeting audiences on their terms Through investment in core digital products such as iview and the ABC NEWS app, the team aims to deliver digital growth and engagement while maintaining broadcast transmission to service loyal audiences. This reflects the ABC's challenge of operating on a 'dual track' basis. 2 Tools and resources for content makers Providing the tools to enable content teams to improve creative output, quality and audience engagement is crucial. P&CT delivers processes and infrastructure that support end-to-end content management solutions across digital and broadcast production and distribution. 3 Managing technology risk P&CT works to manage risk through a prioritised replacement/retirement plan for the ABC's technology assets, to ensure the uninterrupted operation of ABC wide systems, broadcast and digital services. 4 Protecting and managing ABC data and content This priority has the aim of safeguarding the ABC's content and information through policies and investment which protect audience data and can support personalised audience experiences. It will provide data to drive insights and inform quality decision making, and be utilised to automate processes. 5 Technology efficiency and effectiveness P&CT supports simplicity, sustainability and savings through innovative technology and solutions. The strategic priorities are underpinned by the product & technology investment plan which aims to address critical technology replacement or upgrade across the content value chain and IT infrastructure and digital product suite. The ABC has a complex and ageing technology asset base which presents risks to our broadcast capability and audience service delivery. It covers a broad range of assets including traditional production equipment, such as cameras and studio lighting, and information technology, business systems and infrastructure. The ABC has maximised the return on investment by extending the lives of these assets wherever possible, which increases the risk profile over time in a constrained capital funding environment. Delivering on P&CT's strategic priorities and investment plan will enable the ABC to be better positioned in a globally competitive media market, and strengthen the ABC's commitment to delivering outstanding content and media experiences while continuing to meet audiences on their terms - guaranteeing that the ABC remains relevant today and into the future. Infrastructure and Operations 118 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Product highlights 2018-19 In 2018-19, P&CT delivered a range of initiatives that will transform the way the ABC uses technology to deliver outstanding audience experiences, produce and manage content, and underpin broadcast/IT infrastructure. The Content Digital Archive (CoDA) was established in 2018-19 and is a central content repository that provides faster access to, and the preservation of, ABC archive footage in a single self-service interface for content makers. CoDA is the new home for the ABC's digital archival content and is constantly growing with digital content being added daily. Investment initiatives included starting migration to High Definition production in studios, investment in core infrastructure and workflows between state and regional offices, and network enhancements to support faster movement of content. Throughout the period the ABC continued to develop its digital products to improve and deliver audience experiences online and mobile. The ABC invested in a redesigned iview user interface for specific devices and to make content more discoverable. This update also involved improved streaming quality. The development of new web framework technology enabled the delivery of ABC Life (see page 45) and other web experiences. Also in 2018-19, the triple j app was launched to incorporate Double J and Unearthed and deliver a modern digital experience with interactive audience participation. The ABC News app provided a tailored experience that showcased ABC News video content and the ABC listen app delivered enhanced curation and discovery capability and ABC local radio live streams. Information and cyber security management Effective risk management and cyber security practices are critical to the ABC's delivery of services to audiences and our business operations. During 2018-19, the Corporation continued to implement the cyber security roadmap, which incorporates operational activities and significant investment to strengthen our cyber resilience in an environment of ever-changing cyber security threats. The investment program aligns with industry best practice and government standards and has included measures to enhance firewalls, malware filtering and access controls. Further investment was made in 2018-19 to ensure all ABC websites were brought up to the latest security capability, providing audiences with secure and trustworthy access to information on ABC websites. Transmission and distribution of ABC services Transmission and distribution performance was within contracted service level agreements for all radio and television networks for 2018-19. During the year: \u00e2\u00a2 overall transmission performance in regional areas was impacted by the continued NBN and 4G rollout, with tower works for these telecommunications services causing some disruption to radio and television operation \u00e2\u00a2 Broadcast Australia completed its television transmitter replacement program, upgrading eight television transmitters across the country \u00e2\u00a2 Broadcast Australia commenced a program to replace high-power FM transmitters throughout the network. In 2018-19, 45 FM transmitters were replaced at 15 sites. Working at the ABC 119 AM radio During 2018-19, the ABC's supplier of transmission services, Broadcast Australia, installed two replacement AM transmitters at its Liverpool site - for ABC Radio and RN - which improved the power efficiency and reliability of these services. During the transmitter upgrades, Broadcast Australia also upgraded the program input equipment, providing the ABC with improved program delivery redundancy options as well as enhanced monitoring of content delivery to the transmission site to minimise fault durations. FM radio Over the period, P&CT worked with Broadcast Australia on the upgrade of 15 high-power FM transmission sites to replace 45 old valve transmitters with new solid-state transmitters. These units are more energy efficient and will also ensure the network continues to operate effectively and reliably over the long term. Broadcast Australia has also installed additional or enhanced existing transmitter redundancy at each of these sites, to provide an additional transmitter at each site that can be remotely brought online should one of the existing in-service units fail. This 'n+1' redundancy will deliver increased uptime for ABC FM radio services at these 15 sites. Digital radio Working with Broadcast Australia, the P&CT Transmission team launched a digital radio service in Darwin City, to improve the coverage of the existing Darwin digital radio service. The ABC also assumed responsibility for 12 new capital city digital radio services. These services will match the coverage provided by commercial radio services in these areas. Over the year, services were established to improve digital radio reception in Caboolture, Campbelltown, Collaroy Plateau, Melbourne City, Penrith, Perth City, Perth Northern Beaches, Port Melbourne, Sydney City, Sydney Inner South, Sydney Northern Beaches and Werribee. The ABC digital radio footprint now reaches 63.16% of the Australian population. Digital television Broadcast Australia completed its high-power digital television transmitter replacement program with the installation of new transmitters at eight sites during 2018-19. This has seen the completion of the multi-year replacement program for 54 high power television transmitters across Australia, which will deliver enhanced remote-control capabilities to improve restoration times for services experiencing faults. VAST (Viewer Access Satellite Television) The ABC added the ABC Radio Geraldton service to the roster of radio services available on the VAST satellite platform, bringing the total to 20 different regional and capital city ABC Radio services available via VAST. This enabled the ABC to provide more locally appropriate content to listeners on the ABC Radio transmitters for Cue, Kalbarri, Meekatharra, Mt Magnet and Yalgoo, which now receive the ABC Radio Geraldton service from VAST as their program source for transmission. 4G / NBN Working with the ABC's service provider, Telstra, P&CT oversaw installation of 4G backup services at 19 transmitter sites. These 4G services provide additional program input resilience to augment existing copper line program feeds. The team also oversaw the transition of program input to NBN at 10 transmission sites, as part of the NBN nationwide rollout. International A refurbishment of the transmission facility in Tonga was completed during the year, including repairs to the satellite downlink dish and installation of a new transmitter. P&CT completed final on-site commissioning of the five FM services in Papua New Guinea, under a new agreement with the ABC's PNG transmission service provider. 120 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Audience reception The audience coverage and reception website was redesigned during the year: www.abc.net.au/reception. Audience members can now access dynamic information based on their location, which delivers advice on the available ABC radio and television services in their area, links to available streaming services, as well as information on planned maintenance activities on ABC radio and television services. The site includes information pages on answering common questions, including advice on antenna installations, satellite radio and television services and digital radio. Transmission Testing The ABC has been working closely with Broadcast Australia to change the way transmission service performance tests are conducted. These tests were traditionally performed annually on each service, and required the service to be switched off overnight. New testing methodology was introduced for television services in February 2018, and from September 2018 most FM service tests are now also undertaken while the transmission services are on. The amount of time services are off for annual proof-of-performance tests in 2018-19 financial year was 41% lower than in 2017-18. This is primarily due to an 80% reduction in time off for TV tests and a 35% reduction in time off for FM tests. The new system delivers rigorous testing methodology together with improved service availability for ABC audiences. Proportion of the population able to receive transmissions from ABC broadcasting services (as at 30 June 2019) Aust ACT/ NSW Vic Qld WA SA Tas from Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016 Census data. 1 DAB+ services are provided in all state and territory capital cities. There are eleven digital radio services provided on this platform: ABC Radio, RN, triple j, ABC NEWS on radio, ABC Classic, Double J, ABC Jazz, triple j Unearthed, ABC Grandstand, ABC Country and ABC KIDS. NB: These figures are related to the ones provided in last year's Annual Report, but with two additional two rows for clarity - as there are multiple ways to receive digital radio. 2 ABC provides two digital radio services on the digital television platform. During 2018-19, these were Double J and ABC Jazz. 3 ABC provides 47 digital radio services on the VAST platform. This includes 20 different regional and capital city versions of ABC Radio, as well as RN, triple j, ABC NEWS on radio, ABC Classic, ABC Classic 2, Double J, ABC Jazz, triple j Unearthed, ABC Grandstand, ABC Country and ABC KIDS. As the VAST platform is delivered via satellite, it is available to all Australians. The appropriate equipment (including a satellite dish) is required to access radio and television services via VAST. Working at the ABC 121 Capital works Cladding In 2017-18, the ABC underwent an essential assessment of its building cladding at all ABC sites. The outcome revealed the ABC's Ultimo building no longer complied with the current Building Code of Australia fire safety standards. As a result of recommendations following that assessment, the ABC undertook to remove and replace the combustible cladding. Over the year, the atrium scaffolding, hoarding and tower crane installation necessary to facilitate the cladding replacement works were established, with 90% of internal scaffolding in place at the end of the period. External bounding construction work was commenced and work to service the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade replacement was well advanced, as was the replacement of internal safety systems such as smoke detectors, fire hydrants and emergency signage and the installation of new fire control panels. The project team continues to identify, and implement actions to mitigate, various project related risks. Protecting the safety of ABC staff has been paramount throughout the process. Construction, fire safety, and remediation works will continue throughout 2019-20. Ultimo Foyer The foyer upgrade project was completed in 2018-19 with the completion of the upgrade to the carpark entrance and appropriate security works. Minor upgrades were also completed to the foyer area including additional furniture and the installation of the Countdown signage. Integrated Media System (IMS) The IMS project was completed in 2018-19, with its final site successfully implemented in Darwin in February 2019. Over its life, the project saw the implementation of the IMS into eight capital cities and 47 regional sites, with more than 3,100 users from across Radio, Regional, News, Content Services and Technology teams trained in its use. Establishment of the IMS has enabled ease of content sharing not only between radio and news areas, but also between every ABC site around Australia. The project had set aside funding to assist with version upgrades in the capital cities, which are now underway and being managed by the Technology team. News Studio Automation During 2018-19, the News Studio Automation project continued technical implementation of replacement hardware and software in ABC studios, and rolled out related operational training. The project was completed successfully in April 2019, with the last studio online in Sydney, coinciding with the upgrade of that location's 7pm News set to create a high functioning facility. Currently all studio automation upgrades are in operation and running well. Melbourne Accommodation Project (MAP) The Melbourne Accommodation Project was completed in the 2017-18 financial year with all facilities operational. Several minor post-completion works were commenced in 2018-19, including completion of a Terrace refurbishment which has provided the ABC Melbourne building with a usable, WHS-compliant outdoor facility for staff and broadcasts. Other works included replacement of essential waterproofing, TV Edit Suite conversion and studio lighting upgrades. Renewing Adelaide Project The Renewing Adelaide Project reached practical completion on 3 April 2018. The SA Property team managed the Defects Liability Period of 12 months and it has been effectively extended after consultation with the builders. Outstanding defects comprising those relating to minor electrical services, architectural and acoustic aspects, and glazing are 98% complete. It is estimated that all works will be completed by September 2019. 122 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Government submissions In 2018-19, the ABC made 11 submissions to Government departments, Parliamentary committees and industry review bodies. These included submissions to the Australian Government Soft Power review, a response to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission Digital Platforms Inquiry preliminary report, and a submission to the House Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts Inquiry into the Australian music industry. The ABC's reports, submissions and publications can be found at http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/. Strategy The Strategy team leads the development, and supports the implementation, of the strategic priorities of the Corporation. In 2018-19, this work included the development and delivery of a comprehensive five-year outlook on the ABC's operating environment, drafting the ABC's Corporate Plan, and supporting the articulation of divisional strategies. The team played a leading role in shaping ABC responses to public policy inquiries such as the ACMA review of the future delivery of radio services in Australia, the Government's Competitive Neutrality Inquiry and the ACCC's Digital Platforms Inquiry. The Strategy team also supported the ABC's engagement with the Government's Efficiency Review. During the year, the team actively engaged with other Public Service Media and bodies such as the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the Public Media Alliance (PMA), to identify, research and champion common themes such as opportunities for content collaboration and approaches to market challenges, and to support and strengthen policy development. In November 2018, the Strategy team began reporting directly to the Managing Director. Together with the ABC's content and support divisions, the Strategy team has worked to deliver a sustainable ABC and invest in the ABC of the Future, and will continue to do so throughout 2019-20. Audiences The ABC Audiences team manages the audience experience in a holistic way, which ensures that audiences are at the heart of everything the ABC does. The team is responsible for leading the ABC's brand, data and audience strategies, and works collaboratively with content teams to lead an integrated approach across audience insights, branding, design, acquisition and retention, marketing and partnerships. In 2018-19, the Audiences team sought to provide engagement opportunities both to audiences who infrequently use the ABC, by leveraging important national conversations and major initiatives, and to assist loyal audiences with ABC content that matched their interests. To do this, the team increased its focus on understanding audience needs through research and analytics. Audience strategy prioritised programs and initiatives that drove impact within communities, exemplified through initiatives such as the War on Waste and Invictus Games campaigns. Australians care deeply about local matters, and data insights at the ABC confirms this. The Audiences team worked across radio and the 7pm News throughout 2018-19 to enhance awareness of the ABC's local content and presenters. Core to the team's strategy was building the ABC's community profile. In late 2018, a consolidated, multiskilled Audience Support function was created within the Audiences team. This was a response to the changing support needs of audiences, where there has been a decline in written and telephone contacts, and an increase in digital support needs. The core functions of the team are to provide multi-channel support, capture critical audience feedback and suggestions, and help inform business decisions. Corporate services Working at the ABC 123 The Social Strategy team worked to improve discovery of ABC content by audiences. The team's emphasis was on improving the effectiveness of ABC social properties through their consolidation, which resulted in a 50% decrease in the number of ABC social accounts and an improvement in overall audience engagement. Training in the more efficient publishing of content and improved governance was provided to social content creators. Improvements were also made to the structure of Audience Data & Insights. As the ABC's data and analytics needs have grown, so too have the skills in this area. This along with the team's strong digital marketing skills have meant greater customer relationship management capability for the ABC. ABC's in-house creative team is called ABC MADE. They provide strategic, audience-centric creative solutions for all ABC brands, content, products and services. The multi-disciplinary team is comprised of television and radio promo producers, digital, print and motion designers, and production staff. In 2018, ABC MADE produced the large campaign around ABC Yours. In addition to larger brand projects, ABC MADE output more than 100 television promos and 400 radio promos per week in 2018-19. The team has been recognised locally and internationally for creative excellence. Brand The Audiences team is responsible for managing the ABC brand. In August 2018, the ABC launched a new brand position, ABC Yours, to reflect the ABC's role for all Australians. This work celebrated Australia's rich and diverse culture and featured many community groups and individuals, who came together in a celebration of country and spirit. The iconic Seekers anthem I am Australian, reinterpreted by triple j Unearthed artist Emily Wurramara, was the soundtrack. High profile talent such as Tim Minchin and Jimmy Barnes gave their time, free of charge, to tell warm, passionate and heartfelt ABC stories. The brand campaign rolled out throughout the year and was highly regarded by audiences. The ABC has gradually been evolving all brand logos away from the chrome logo (the lissajous or ABC 'worm'), to a block logo, in line with digital accessibility requirements and the increasing amount of online content. In 2018-19 this included the rebranding of regional radio stations, creating new aural and visual identities. The Audiences team also simplified ABC Classic FM to ABC Classic, to focus on its vision to be the home of classical music for all Australians on radio, online, via the ABC listen app or through album releases. Audience support Managing audience feedback The Audience Support function was centralised within the Audiences team in September 2018. The team collates audience feedback from a range of audience touchpoints ABC and ABC ME apps \u00e2\u00a2 ABC listen app \u00e2\u00a2 ABC NEWS app \u00e2\u00a2 triple j app \u00e2\u00a2 the 'Contact the ABC' webform \u00e2\u00a2 letters. The table below sets out the volume of audience feedback received by contact channel between 30 September 2018 and 30 June 2019: Contact channel Volume % of Total Phone calls* 87,300 62.5 Webform/letters 35,607 25.5 App contacts 16,833 12.0 Total 139,740 100.0 * includes business transfers. Of the audience feedback received, written complaints alleging a breach of the ABC Code of Practice or ABC Editorial Policies were referred to Audience and Consumer Affairs, a separate unit within the ABC (see pages 147). 124 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Key feedback matters In 2018-19, contact from the ABC's listeners, viewers and online audiences involved mixed responses to a wide range of matters, with the following being key contact drivers: \u00e2\u00a2 coverage of the visit to Australia by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for the opening of the Invictus Games \u00e2\u00a2 coverage of the Invictus Games \u00e2\u00a2 New Year's Eve coverage \u00e2\u00a2 Australia Day programming including the Australian of the Year Awards ceremony through to the Australia Day live concert \u00e2\u00a2 current affairs panel program The Drum \u00e2\u00a2 the Al-Jazeera documentary How To Sell A Massacre \u00e2\u00a2 the Q&A: Budget Special, along with coverage of the federal election campaign and a range of election specials on The Drum, and Australia Votes: Election Night Live \u00e2\u00a2 news coverage around Cardinal George Pell, the mosque attack in Christchurch, and the broadcast of the Christchurch Memorial Service \u00e2\u00a2 the raid of the ABC offices by the Australian Federal Police in June 2019 in relation to The Afghan Files \u00e2\u00a2 Bob Hawke's State Memorial Service.

Legal Services In 2018-19, ABC Legal focused on four objectives: \u00e2\u00a2 providing quality legal services \u00e2\u00a2 supporting and developing its people through mentoring and training \u00e2\u00a2 encouraging innovation \u00e2\u00a2 sharing knowledge within the team. Working closely with the General Counsel, a Head of Legal Operations role was created to drive these objectives, and the team looked at ways to build capacity, improve consistency and quality assurance, better manage risk, and enhance its ability to analyse and report on the work executed by the team. A dedicated Pre-Publication team was created, to enhance the provision of high quality 24/7 media law advice, and the Rights Management team was returned to the ABC Legal umbrella. The entire team moved to open plan workspaces to promote knowledge sharing and teamwork, and the implementation of automated document-signing and contract creation processes aided efficiency. The team is currently working on digital advice applications that will assist content makers in assessing their own content against legal risk. Working at the ABC 125 ABC Legal launched three online media law training modules during the period, as well as a comprehensive training schedule for content makers around Australia in areas including defamation, contempt of court and investigative journalism risks. The team refreshed its rights training for content makers, which it plans to deliver across the Corporation in 2019-20, and ran a series of tailored in-house training sessions for its people. Legal was involved in a number of major projects across the ABC in 2018-19, including: \u00e2\u00a2 managing the search warrant served by the Australian Federal Police in relation to ABC reporting on Australian military in Afghanistan \u00e2\u00a2 defending the ABC in the McLachlan and Chau Chak defamation matters \u00e2\u00a2 advising the ABC on reporting the Pell proceedings \u00e2\u00a2 advising on preparation of the supplementary submission to the Competitive Neutrality Inquiry and assisting the Right to Know coalition with submissions concerning reform of the Defamation Act 2005 (the NSW Act) \u00e2\u00a2 playing an integral role in the pan-ABC Rights Project to develop a new rights strategy and acquire a new digital rights system for the ABC \u00e2\u00a2 advising on various international strategies. ABC Legal provided advice to the Corporation following the termination of the former Managing Director's appointment, the resignation of the former ABC Chair, and throughout the Departmental and subsequent Senate inquiries into allegations of political interference in the ABC. The team's business-as-usual work included: \u00e2\u00a2 in addition to daily rolling news coverage and current affairs, providing pre-publication advice to content-makers across the ABC on more than 500 programs, podcasts and investigations \u00e2\u00a2 successfully resolving or defending more than 120 complaints across a broad range of areas including defamation, copyright and contempt \u00e2\u00a2 responding to more than 40 external requests for program material, and handling over 15 challenges to suppression orders and applications for court material \u00e2\u00a2 corporate governance and privacy work \u00e2\u00a2 settling finance, production and rights agreements for over 100 audio and audio-visual productions including the Invictus Games, Mystery Road Series 2, Les Norton, Stateless, Australia Day, Stargazing - the Moon and Beyond and Bluey Series 2 \u00e2\u00a2 drafting and negotiating a range of technology related contracts including for cloud services and the acquisition of hardware and software and support services \u00e2\u00a2 working on significant property matters including the replacement of cladding on the ABC Ultimo building and the potential sale of the ABC's Gordon Street property in Melbourne, and assisting with contracts relating to construction and property management and maintenance \u00e2\u00a2 assisting ABC Commercial with activities such as content licensing, book and magazine publishing, and music recording, licensing and publishing \u00e2\u00a2 undertaking copyright clearances, rights assessments for re-use and supply, and the coordination of repeat fees and residuals for myriad programs and services. 126 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Responsibility 127 Baker Boy performs at New Year's Eve 2018 - the Night is Yours.

Freedom of expression is enshrined in the ABC Editorial Policies. The ABC's commitment to impartiality and diversity of perspectives reflects the importance of diverse sources of reliable information and a plurality of views within a healthy democracy. In pursuing impartiality, the ABC is guided by the following: \u00e2\u00a2 a balance that follows the weight of evidence \u00e2\u00a2 fair treatment \u00e2\u00a2 open-mindedness \u00e2\u00a2 opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression with respect for privacy. Accessibility of content and services In 2018-19 the ABC continued to improve the accessibility of its content and services. Improving access for people with a hearing impediment Captioning is the process by which speech or scenes are described in text for viewing on-screen. Closed captioning indicates the availability of text that can be activated by users if required. The ABC provides a closed captioning service for its television services ABC main channel, ABC COMEDY, ABC KIDS, ABC ME and ABC NEWS. In 2018-19, captions were available on 99.9% of programs broadcast on ABC main channel between 6am and midnight and 72% of those broadcast on ABC COMEDY between 7.30pm and midnight. 73% of the content on ABC ME and 78% of the content on ABC KIDS was captioned. More than 55% of content broadcast on ABC NEWS was also captioned and where available included signing for the hearing impaired. Closed captions were also available with much of the programming on iview including iview exclusive content. The ABC provides greater access to key events by providing captions for broadcasts such as Anzac Day marches and memorial services, and Australia Day events. Other notable events were captioned during 2018-19. As part of the ABC's coverage of New Year's Eve, the ABC featured an audio description of the Sydney fireworks and celebrations, availably nationally on ABC Local Radio, digital radio and through the ABC listen app. Improving access for people with a visual impairment In 2018-19, 23 titles published by ABC Books were made available through ReadHowYouWant, an Australian service that offers print-on-demand reformat publishing for people unable to read standard formatted books. Text is enlarged and customised to suit the capabilities of the reader. ABC Audio provided an extensive range of genre and age-diverse audio books accessible to the vision impaired and people with a print disability. In 2018-19, ABC Audio released 90 titles in both physical and digital formats, through licence agreement with audio book publisher Bolinda. Of those, 11 included ABC-devised content, 51 were adult titles and 39 were children's titles. Work was undertaken throughout 2018-19 to improve the accessibility of graphics used on social media platforms. A style guide was created for social media producers outlining appropriate colour options, contrast and text size. Several program websites were updated with assistive technologies such as screen readers and navigation switches for people with impaired vision, and optimised for easy reading on more devices, including smartphones and tablets. Corporate responsibility in a broadcasting context Responsibility 129 Digital accessibility The ABC strives for equal access to its digital websites, mobile applications and documents by people with limited vision, hearing, speech, mobility or cognition, in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). In 2018-19, the ABC made many events and programs broadly available, including the Hottest 100 and Classic 100 polls and countdowns, the Invictus Games, Heywire 2019, NAIDOC Week and the inaugural DisRupted initiative. Australians turn to the ABC for information about elections, candidates and event coverage. In 2019, the complex details and data for election coverage were provided for everyone in accessible, digestible formats through the ABC NEWS website, helping Australians make informed decisions. Further initiatives to improve access included new ways to search ABC content, a reimagined iview Connected TV application, consumer support for services like ABC iview and the evolution of the ABC's Digital Language System (a library of reusable, accessible components that steers product development). Apps such as triple j, ABC listen and ABC NEWS enjoyed ongoing improvements for use by everyone. Reports, publications and other resources were made readable and usable for all. These included the ABC Annual Report 2018 and the ABC Equity & Diversity Report 2018 and a range of educational aids and games. Protecting young or vulnerable audiences The ABC's Editorial Policy framework sets out guidelines to protect vulnerable audiences such as children. Advice and training in the ABC Editorial Policies is delivered on an ongoing basis. Upward referral - a key concept within the policies - ensures complex decisions are not made in isolation. All television programs other than news, current affairs and sporting events, are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. The ABC ensures that graphic or distressing news content is preceded by a warning, to give readers, listeners or viewers the opportunity to avoid the content if they choose. Content created especially for children and available on iview or apps is accompanied by classification advice and warnings where appropriate. As with broadcast, children's content on digital properties is restricted to G and PG. Both the ABC KIDS iview and ABC ME apps, along with the main iview service, include a parental filter so parents can control their children's viewing boundaries. The ABC's websites and apps for children follow strict protocols to minimise risk to children and protect their privacy. With the creation of content and experiences for children across all platforms, consideration of sensitivities and risk is paramount. The online protection of children is a shared responsibility between the ABC, the parent/ guardian, and the child. The ABC aims to ensure that children and young people who engage with the ABC's online spaces understand the possible risks they face and how to minimise them. Providing information about online safety is encouraged on ABC platforms designed for children. ABC Regional & Local's user-generated content projects, ABC Open1 and Heywire, have clear moderation guidelines that address how they handle sensitive content and 'at risk' contributors or audiences. Measures can be implemented to protect contributors and audience members. In addition to being guided by the editorial policies, Heywire consulted with a range of youth mental health organisations such as Headspace to create a Code of Conduct for all adults attending Heywire events, which provides advice on how participants can be supported and any possible harms reduced. 1 ABC Open was decommissioned on 30 June 2019. All contributions have been retained and are available. The ABC's new audience-image portal, ABC My Photo, will be launched in 2019-20. 130 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Where required, steps are taken to protect the anonymity of young contributors who are writing about sensitive issues, such as domestic violence or mental illness. Contributors are invited to use an alias and generic file images when writing about sensitive topics. On occasion, details may be edited or removed from a contribution or user profile to protect the identity of the author. Contributors are also encouraged to avoid sharing this kind of content on their personal social media accounts if there is a chance they could be identified as the author. triple j has strategies in place to ensure its younger audiences are protected from harm and offence. Editorial content which is likely to cause harm or offence to younger sections of the audience is scheduled in appropriate time periods such as later in the evening. The Hook Up, for example, which discusses sex and relationships, is programmed for after 9pm on Sundays. Warnings are given before playing music containing language or content that is assessed as likely to offend the triple j audience and prior to other types of content which risk causing harm to vulnerable audiences. All ABC DVD product is subject to formal classification by the Classification Board, and appropriate warnings/guides are attached to each product. ABC CDs display appropriate warnings regarding language and content. ABC Commercial's Events business contracts event management to third party promoters. Under these event management contracts, promoters are required to warrant that all venues will be safe and fit for purpose. The contracts also stipulate promoters must conduct themselves in accordance with all international, national, federal, state, and local laws, and treaties. ABC Commercial's promoter agreements explicitly ensure current compliance with state and territory-based legislation regarding working with children. Improving digital literacy Enhancing digital literacy promotes better understanding the digital environment in which so many Australians now engage. ABC teams regularly review their content and projects in response to audience needs, behaviours and expectations in an increasingly digital world. In 2018, a new role was created in the Regional & Local team to lead work on increasing and supporting digital literacy, and in September 2018, the ABC held its inaugural Media Literacy Week to help audiences navigate the modern media landscape. More than 50 pieces of original content were created for a range of platforms and programs across the week, including interactives, community competitions and teacher guides. A Media Literacy Week site was created, and online resources produced by ABC Education assisted school students to better distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate ('real' and 'fake') news sources. The team also broadcast the series Citizen Code to teach young people to protect themselves in the face of cryptology, big data, tracking and cookies, and to provide education about social media and other virtual realities. As part of the week, and in collaboration with the University of Tasmania, the ABC convened Navigating the News, the first Australian conference to bring media organisations, academics and educators together to discuss how to build trust in public-interest journalism and advance community media literacy. In 2018-19, Play School themed a week of episodes 'Gadgets and Gizmos', showing preschoolers how to code a robot and create simple tablet animations to tell stories. BtN provided practical digital literacy content for primary school-aged audiences. For older children, Good Game Spawn Point covered the need for balanced and healthy online habits in its 'Gamer Life' series, and developed the 'How to Build a Computer' series for computer newbies. triple j's Hack and ABC News continued to educate via regular content focused on media literacy, with coverage of matters such as online scams, catfishing, trolling, cryptocurrencies, online dating, and the impact of data breaches. Responsibility 131 Energy In 2018-19, overall ABC energy consumption decreased slightly, with a 1% change from 2017-18. The nature of ABC business, and in particular its reliance on technology, necessarily involves high levels of energy consumption. This is reflected in energy use figures for New South Wales where there is a significant concentration of the ABC's workforce and production. Energy reduction initiatives in 2017-18 included: \u00e2\u00a2 LED was nominated for all light replacements \u00e2\u00a2 inverter AC replacement units were installed \u00e2\u00a2 staff were encouraged and reminded to contribute to energy saving by switching off HVAC and lighting when not required in their workplace. Solar hot water systems are installed in 10 ABC sites: Port Macquarie and Newcastle (NSW), Canberra (ACT), Brisbane and Gold Coast (Qld), Port Pirie (SA), Launceston (Tas), Albany and Broome (WA), and Alice Springs (NT). The impact of solar hot water usage on ABC energy consumption is not currently measured. Energy consumption 2018-19 State/ Territory 2018-19 2017-18 % -1% Emissions The ABC uses the National Green Accounts (NGA) factors published by the Department of the Environment and Energy to identify and quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018-19, the ABC captured electricity data via the BidEnergy platform for electricity, while data for diesel generators and gas consumption was manually extracted. There was a 8.8% decrease in emissions overall in 2018-19, when compared with 2017-18 levels.

Council data is not available. Increase in waste volumes in Queensland over 2018-19 can be attributed to two factors: firstly, streamlining of loading dock operations has all tenancy waste picked up by the ABC's national contractor, with the ABC subsequently invoicing the properties' other tenants; secondly, data is now recorded in regional sites where previously waste was not collected via the national contractor. Targeted initiatives to reduce waste across the ABC sites in 2018-19 included: \u00e2\u00a2 the Southbank (Vic) Simply Cups initiative, which resulted in 17,856 coffee cups diverted from landfill \u00e2\u00a2 a water fountain installation in Southbank (Vic) to reduce plastic bottles going to landfill - in excess of 500 bottles were diverted from landfill in the first month \u00e2\u00a2 the recycling of toners via Planet Ark's collection program Close the Loop \u00e2\u00a2 the recycling of old mobile phones via Mobile Muster \u00e2\u00a2 the collection of e-waste and batteries by SUEZ \u00e2\u00a2 zip water dispensers for hot and cold filtered water were installed in the Perth site \u00e2\u00a2 the continued removal of under desk bins at several locations, to increase recycling and reduce general waste - in the Adelaide site, all desk bins have been removed in both the ABC's office and all tenancies in the building and have been replaced by bin stations. Gardening Australia's Costa Georgiadis. Image: Malcolm Sutton Responsibility 133 Environmental sustainability in the supply chain Travel and transport Although the nature of the ABC's operations, in particular its news and current affairs activities, necessitates frequent domestic and international travel, the ABC encourages employees to reduce domestic travel. Whenever possible, employees are encouraged to consider the use of video conferencing and other alternatives to travel. Facilities for employees who walk or cycle to work are provided at most capital city and some regional sites, and include secure bike parking, showers and lockers. Travel by air There was a 3.1% decrease in kilometres flown by ABC employees in 2018-19, compared to the previous year. 2018-19 2017-18 Difference Domestic kms flown 19,004,347 -3.1% Domestic fleet travel In 2018-19, there was an increase in domestic fleet vehicle travel, with kilometres travelled up 6% on the 2017-18 figure. Of the 311 vehicles in the ABC Fleet, increased from 307 in 2017-18, 37 were owned and 274 were leased by the ABC. Fourteen were hybrid vehicles, which equates to 4.5% of the fleet. 2018-19 2017-18 Difference Domestic kms travelled 3,577,790 3,384,659 195,350 No of vehicles 311 307 4 Heritage Strategy The ABC has prepared a Heritage Strategy in accordance with section 341ZA of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the EPBC Act). The EPBC Act sets out the ABC's responsibilities to protect and conserve the Commonwealth Heritage values of places that it owns or controls. The Strategy is intended to inform the Minister and the Australian Heritage Council of the identification, assessment and monitoring of those places. The ABC's 2018-2021 Strategy was approved by the Department of Environment and Energy, which administers the EPBA Act, in September 2018 and is available online.

Changes were made to the structure of the emergency broadcasting team to respond to this increase and provide additional support to affected communities. Details regarding ABC emergency broadcasting can be found in the chapter Yours in the Community (pages 51-64). Content impact The ABC's Content Teams aim to make a difference for their audiences, through the impact of the content they create, and in the communities they engage with, work with and portray. Delivering effective environmental, cultural and social change is part of what drives ABC content makers. Coverage of the Invictus Games (see page 41) raised awareness of adaptive sport and mental health issues. For the daily television update show Invictus Games Today, the production team sent scripts to captioners to obtain superior captions for a live program. Producers were briefed about the importance of protecting vulnerable audiences and the appropriate approach and language to use when interviewing people with physical and mental illnesses. The show was co-hosted by disability advocate and wheelchair tennis champion Dylan Alcott. Dylan also co-hosted the ABC's new live music show The Set throughout the year. ABC serial drama The Heights and children's series Hardball also featured people living with disabilities in leading roles and in 2018, the ABC Children's team partnered with Screen Australia on DisRupted, an initiative supporting and showcasing the best of Australia's next generation of content makers living with disability. Employable Me promoted opportunities for jobseekers with disability while providing a window for viewers into their lives, and You Can't Ask That continued to enlighten Australians about the challenges and realities of misunderstood groups. The 2018 ABC telemovie Riot, which explored Australia's 1970s gay liberation movement, became an official part of NSW Police officer training in 2018-19. For the Hottest 100 in January 2019, triple j teamed up with Lifeline to raise more than $700,000, ensuring the suicide prevention charity's volunteers can attend to around 4,000 additional calls each year. To address gender imbalance in daily news reporting, ABC News initiated a pilot program called the 50:50 Project to increase female contribution and representation in broadcast and digital services. Discussion program The Drum continued to broaden the diversity of its panels in 2019, with its new longer format allowing more time for discussion and more people on the desk. The panels skew female and actively seek to bring expertise from diverse participants across culture, religion, politics, socioeconomics and physical abilities. The Asia Pacific Newsroom in Melbourne significantly directed its attention to digital reporting for language groups.

War on Waste There can be little doubt of the impact of the ABC's War on Waste program and associated initiatives. One in two (56%) Australians were aware of War on Waste and the campaign contributed to major social and environmental change across Australia. A report by the University of Technology Sydney and the ABC identified 452 high-impact waste reduction initiatives by schools, hospitals, businesses, governments and community groups that were inspired by the series.1 Among these were: \u00e2\u00a2 Woolworths' decision to remove plastic straws from its stores in Australia and New Zealand \u00e2\u00a2 the Western Australian Government's banning of single-use plastic bags \u00e2\u00a2 a surge in cafes offering discounts to customers with reusable cups, preventing almost 61 million single-use cups from ending up in landfill \u00e2\u00a2 schools introducing co-mingled recycling and e-waste collections \u00e2\u00a2 hospitality businesses banning single-use plastic straws \u00e2\u00a2 hospitals and clinics introducing recycling systems and replacing single-use plastics and polystyrene with reusable products Educational resources and a Community Action Toolkit created with online environmental action facilitator Good For The Hood were provided to empower community groups and individuals to improve their waste reduction. The Toolkit has been downloaded more than 5,000 times as communities continue to benefit from the War on Waste. War on Waste presenter Craig Reucassel. Responsibility 137 Social responsibility in the community Community service announcements Local Radio stations provide information about issues relevant to local listeners, including announcements for appeals that support communities. Stations also undertake emergency service announcements as part of the ABC's emergency broadcasting work. Humanitarian appeals The ABC works with Australian and international aid agencies during crises and humanitarian aid appeals when it is appropriate and possible to do so, highlighting the work of these agencies as they attempt to provide shelter, food, education, healthcare and other forms of relief. The ABC Appeals website at http://www.abc.net.au/ appeals/ provides information about current crises and suggests appropriate agencies to which audiences can donate. In 2018 the ABC supported the Red Cross Australian drought appeal, and in February 2019 the ABC supported the Australian Red Cross Society, GIVIT, the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul Society Queensland and Uniting Care in raising funds to assist those affected by the floods in Far North Queensland. Connecting with communities The ABC continued to focus on connecting with all Australian communities throughout 2018-19, both directly and through its broadcasting services. Additionally, ABC International Development (ABCID) enables partner organisations in the Indo-Pacific region to pursue quality journalism, engaging storytelling and building strong local connections. These many and varied relationships are detailed in the Yours in the Community chapter (pages 51-64).

The Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act 2018 came into effect on 1 January 2019 and the ABC is now considering the application of the Act across its supply chain including implementation activities in relation to the four key mandatory reporting criteria, being: 1. the ABC's structure, operations and supply chains 2. possible modern slavery risks 3. actions to assess and address modern slavery risks, including due diligence and remediation processes 4. how the ABC assesses the effectiveness of its actions. The ABC is currently developing a program to address these key criteria with the aim to provide the first ABC Board approved statement on its progress by the initial reporting date of December 2020. Social responsibility in the workplace Information about the ABC's values at work, workplace health and safety, and diversity in the workplace, can be found in pages 103-114. The ABC's employees are also committed to creating a wealth of content that reflects the diversity of its audiences. Information about the ABC's social investment via its content can be found in 'Content impact' on page 136, and throughout the Annual Report. Mental health in the workplace The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) was available to all ABC employees and their immediate family members during 2018-19. The EAP service is provided by Converge International and comprises confidential short-term counselling service for a broad range of personal and work-related issues, in addition to specific advice through CareerAssist, ManagerAssist, MoneyAssist, FamilyAssist and LegalAssist. All EAP services are available 24/7 both locally and internationally. During 2018-19, ABC Staff were provided with access to additional dedicated telephone helplines offering specialised support for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander peoples, LGBTQI, Domestic & Family Violence, Eldercare, and Disability and Carers. The ABC Trauma and Resilience Program provides employees access to specialist clinicians on a confidential referral basis. Employees affected by potentially traumatic events in the course of their work are able to access up to 6 sessions. Employees appointed to international bureaux are provided with a dedicated clinician for the duration of their appointment. Employees are also able to access peer-to-peer psychological first aid through the Trauma Peer Support program. At the end of 2018-19, there were 77 peer support leaders across the organisation. In 2018-19, the ABC continued to offer professional assistance and counselling through redundancy and career transition specialists Trevor-Roberts, who were primarily utilised in cases of redundancy. The service assisted participants in dealing with the impact of being made redundant as well as guidance with analysing career options, resume preparation and developing job search and interview skills. The services are available to those made redundant for six months after leaving the ABC. Responsibility 139 Product responsibility Product information and labelling The ABC ensures all products are appropriately labelled. No changes to the ABC's policy or practices regulating product information or labelling were made during 2018-19. If applicable, packaging displays information about appropriate disposal of the packaging. ABC licensed merchandise packaging is clearly marked if it is a potential hazard. Quality assurance All licensees of ABC branded merchandise have contractual obligations to manufacture high quality products that meet Australian Standards applicable to the product. Children's products are safety tested to the Standards AS/NZS ISO 8124 parts 1, 2 and 3 if applicable. Products aimed at adults also may be required to be tested to relevant standards. Licensees are required to provide certificates to prove the test results. If there are no applicable Australian Standards or testing procedures for a product aimed at children, the ABC requires that licensees or manufacturers perform tests that conform to American or European testing, to safeguard product safety and quality. Licensees test for colourfastness, shrinkage and flammability of apparel products. These products are required to meet retailers' individual standards. Product complaints and recalls In 2018-19, there were no product recalls or instances of non-compliance with safety standards associated with products produced, distributed, licensed or sold by the ABC. In light of the legislated requirement to report death within 48 hours to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) any products that have caused, or may cause, serious injury, the ABC developed a comprehensive Product Recall Procedure. The procedure covers all products that ABC Commercial produces, distributes, licenses, and sells. The procedure stipulates that once a product recall has been initiated, the ACCC guidelines are followed. Customer safety and satisfaction is of paramount concern to the ABC when it comes to the creation and distribution of quality products and services.

Image: Jared Leibowitz Accountability Contents Corporate governance 142 Risk 143 Audit 144 Corporate reporting 145 Privacy 146 Editorial complaints management 147 Enabling legislation ABC corporate objectives, strategies, policies and activities derive from the requirements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (the ABC Act). In particular, section 6 of the Act, the ABC Charter, outlines the functions of the Corporation and section 8 lays out the duties of the Board (see Appendix 1, page 210). The ABC Act expressly provides for both the editorial and administrative independence of the Corporation, thereby investing the Board with considerable discretion. In acknowledgement of that independence, the ABC accepts the obligation to meet the highest standards of public accountability. Responsible Minister The ABC is an agency within the portfolio of the Australian Department of Communications and the Arts. From 1 July 2018 to 29 May 2019, the responsible minister was Senator the Honourable Mitch Fifield, Minister for Communications and the Arts. From 29 May 2019 to the end of the reporting period, the responsible minister was the Honourable Paul Fletcher MP, Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts. Governance and management processes Board governance The roles and responsibilities of the Board are described in Appendix 1 (see page 210). The ABC Board held six scheduled meetings during 2018-19. In addition, the non-executive Directors of the Board met on 13 additional occasions. The Risk & Audit Committee met on six occasions, the People & Remuneration Committee met on four occasions, and the Editorial Committee met on two occasions. Further information about the ABC Board and its Committees is provided in Appendix 2 (see pages 211-14). Management processes Throughout 2018-19, the Managing Director or Acting Managing Director chaired weekly meetings of the ABC Executive Leadership Team, comprising Team Directors and the Heads of specialist support units reporting to them, to ensure oversight of business-as-usual processes as well as address any topical matters. The Leadership team also attended longer monthly meetings to discuss and make decisions regarding strategic, operational, compliance and other issues. Corporate governance 142 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 The ABC's governance framework includes a number of executive, advisory and working groups that provide guidance and leadership around areas such as digital strategy, risk management, information technology, work health and safety, content planning and collaboration, and policy development. Corporate Plan The ABC's strategy is informed by the broader corporate objectives and outcomes in the ABC Corporate Plan. The requirement to prepare a corporate plan in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the PGPA Act) came into effect on 1 July 2015. Under section 35 of the PGPA Act, the accountable authority of the ABC is required to prepare a corporate plan at least once each reporting period. The corporate plan must be prepared in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014 (the PGPA Rule). The ABC Corporate Plan 2018-19 was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the PGPA Act and PGPA Rule and is published on the ABC's corporate website at http://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/. The ABC Corporate Plan 2018-19 also meets the requirements of section 31B(1) of the ABC Act by outlining the overall strategies and policies that the Corporation will follow to ensure that the Board fulfils its duties under section 8 of the ABC Act, and includes a forecast of the revenue and expenditure of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including a forecast of capital expenditure and borrowings. In 2018-19, the Strategy team continued to lead the development and implementation of ABC strategy and planning. For more on their activities see page 123. The ABC Risk team is responsible for the continued refinement of the ABC risk management framework. This includes providing counsel to the Board and management on how to identify, assess and manage risk. In 2018-19, the Risk team continued to refine the way in which risk incidents were recorded and analysed, so as to provide close to real-time insights to the Board and management on the effectiveness of the risk management framework. The team also continued to develop a comprehensive all employee program of risk related learning and development, that will support the enhancement of a positive risk culture and help maintain risk management capability across the Corporation. A core part of the Risk function is Business Continuity. The ABC's business continuity program manages the development, testing and maintenance of the Corporation's business resilience, crisis management and disaster recovery programs. The program continues to focus on effectively managing foreseeable business disruptions. The ABC's Board of Directors and management oversee and continue to be committed to developing and refining a fit-for-purpose risk management framework that will both protect and enhance value through the timely and accurate identification, assessment and management of all risks. Risk Accountability 143 Internal audit Group Audit supports governance at the ABC through objective assessment of strategic priorities, including those set out in the Investing in Audiences strategy. Audits are conducted in accordance with international auditing standards. Group Audit prepares and delivers the ABC's Audit Plan, which is approved by the Risk & Audit Committee. Further information on Group Audit's interactions with Board committees is provided in Appendix 2 (see page 212). Group Audit is responsible to the Risk & Audit Committee for contributing to the achievement of the Corporation's goals and objectives by: \u00e2\u00a2 evaluating processes that manage the ABC's key operational, financial and compliance risks \u00e2\u00a2 providing recommendations to management \u00e2\u00a2 playing a role in developing and maintaining a culture of accountability and integrity, including undertaking investigations in relation to fraud or public interest disclosure allegations \u00e2\u00a2 being responsive to the Corporation's changing needs and striving for continuous improvement in the performance of its activities \u00e2\u00a2 facilitating and supporting the integration of risk management into day-to-day business activities and processes \u00e2\u00a2 utilising technologies and data to efficiently assess control performance. In 2018-19, Group Audit completed 25 assignments, including coverage of editorial, finance, information technology, health and safety and project management processes. The team continued to operate with a combination of in-house employees and external providers of internal audit services. Coordination with external auditors Group Audit liaises with the ABC's external auditors the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), and its nominated representative, KPMG. In 2018-19, work with external auditors included seeking advice on proposed areas of focus, identifying areas of potential external audit reliance on audits undertaken by Group Audit, and ensuring that there was minimal duplication of audit coverage.

To meet these requirements, the ABC maintains an internal compliance reporting framework, comprising internal controls and governance procedures together with other sources of assurance and information to ensure that relevant PGPA Act reporting requirements are achieved. There was no significant non-compliance with the finance law - which includes the PGPA Act and Rule and any other instrument made under the PGPA Act, for example the PGPA Financial Reporting Rule 2015 - required to be notified to the responsible Minister under section 19(1) (e) of the PGPA Act during the 2018-19 reporting period. Annual Report The ABC is required by section 46 of the PGPA Act to prepare an annual report. The report must be submitted to the responsible minister for presentation to the Parliament. The ABC Annual Report 2018 was submitted to the Minister for Communications and was tabled in Parliament on 31 October 2018. Report against the ABC Corporate Plan 2018-19 Reports against the key performance indicators and forward estimates presented in the ABC Corporate Plan 2018 are set out in the Annual Performance Statements on pages 87-99, and the Financial Statements on pages 150-207. Freedom of Information The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act) gives the public the right to access documents held by the ABC. During 2018-19, the ABC received 70 requests for access to documents under the FOI Act. Six requests were granted in full, 17 were granted in part, 25 were refused in full and 12 were withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn, with two of those requests dealt with outside of the formal FOI process. Ten requests were still being processed at the end of the financial year. Of the 42 requests that were refused or part-refused, 30 were (or involved some documents that were) outside the scope of the FOI Act. Section 7 and Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act specifically exempts documents relating to the ABC's program material from the operation of the FOI Act. One matter was the subject of Internal Review and the decision in that matter was affirmed. Nine decisions were the subject of review by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). Three of those applications were withdrawn, one was resolved and closed under section 55F of the FOI Act when the applicant and the ABC reached a satisfactory agreement, and five matters were still being processed as at 30 June 2019. In accordance with section 8(1) of the FOI Act, the ABC maintains an Agency Plan which describes how the ABC will comply with the Information Publication Scheme (IPS) requirements set out in Part II of the FOI Act. This Plan remains under review and an updated Plan will be finalised in 2019-20. The ABC's IPS Agency Plan and FOI Disclosure Log are published on the ABC's corporate website at https://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/freedom-of-information/. Corporate reporting Accountability 145 The ABC is required to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988. The ABC Privacy Policy is published on the Privacy page of the ABC corporate website. The Policy sets out the kind of information the ABC will collect, the circumstances in which the ABC may use and disclose such information, how individuals may access their personal information, and how and to whom individuals may complain about a breach of privacy. On 1 July 2018 the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code (the Code) commenced. The Code introduced a best practice approach to privacy governance. The ABC has implemented a pan-ABC privacy framework which has improved and enhanced the information on privacy that is available for its audience and created a strong culture of privacy within the ABC. The Privacy page on the ABC corporate website has been updated to include the ABC Privacy Assurance, a summary of the Privacy Policy, a detailed Privacy Collection Statement and the register of Privacy Impact Assessments. The ABC's General Counsel acts as the Privacy Champion. The ABC Privacy Assurance is the ABC's commitment to privacy to its audience and guides and informs privacy-related decisions and behaviour across the ABC. The ABC makes its Privacy Assurance directly to its audience and is published on the ABC website in this form: Transparency We have transparent practices and explanations of what personal information we collect and why, and how we may use your personal information Control We use your personal information to give you more and better choices from our services. We tell you how you can control the use of your personal information and interact with the ABC Trust We value your trust, will keep your personal information secure and never sell or share your personal information to anyone for commercial purposes. The Privacy page also includes a plain English summary of the Privacy Policy that is designed to be easier to read and more accessible than the full Privacy Policy. The Privacy Collection Statement provides a detailed explanation of the types of personal information that the ABC collects, holds, uses and discloses as part of the ABC's interaction with the public and its audience. Privacy considerations are now embedded in ABC business processes. When ABC personnel are involved in a project that collects personal information they are required to complete a privacy questionnaire. The Privacy Officer reviews that information to determine whether the project may be considered a 'high privacy risk' project. A project may be high privacy risk if it involves any new or changed ways of handling personal information that are likely to have a significant impact on the privacy of individuals. The ABC is required to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment for all high privacy risk projects. A Privacy Impact Assessment is a systematic assessment of a project that identifies the impact the project might have on the privacy of individuals and sets out recommendations for managing, minimising or eliminating that impact. The ABC maintains a public register of the Privacy Impact Assessments it conducts for all high privacy risk projects. Data breach notification Data breach notification laws have been in effect since February 2018 and make it mandatory for the ABC to report a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm to any affected individuals. Notification must be made to the affected individuals and the regulator. In 2018-19, the ABC did not experience any data breaches that required notification to the Privacy Commissioner. Privacy 146 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Audience and Consumer Affairs Written complaints that are potentially editorial - about issues such as factual inaccuracy, bias or inappropriate content - are referred to Audience and Consumer Affairs (A&CA), a unit which is independent of ABC program areas. An internal restructure of the Editorial Policies team in September 2018 (see page 115) saw the remit of the A&CA change to focus specifically on these editorial complaints. Previously, the team also handled audience contact with the ABC containing requests for information, suggestions and appreciations, as well as complaints about matters of personal preference which did not raise issues of compliance with the ABC's editorial standards. These contacts are now handled by Audience Support (for reporting, see page 124). Once in receipt of a written complaint, A&CA conduct an initial assessment to identify if the matter raises editorial issues. Where such a complaint suggests that the ABC may have breached its Editorial Policies or Code of Practice, A&CA conducts a further assessment to determine appropriate handling in accordance with the ABC Complaint Handling Procedures. A&CA may themselves investigate the complaint and determine whether ABC editorial standards have been met. Where the matters raised are less serious, A&CA may refer the complaint for direct handling to the content area responsible. In cases where a complaint is investigated and the ABC's editorial standards have not been met, the complaint will be upheld (either fully or in part). Complaints also can be resolved by prompt action being taken to remedy a matter. Overall complaint handling During 2018-19, A&CA assessed and finalised 5,675 written complaints. The unit provided a personal response to 2,308 of these complaints and 2,179 complaints were referred to other areas of the Corporation for direct response. No substantive response was required for 1,188 complaints. Editorial complaint handling Of the 5,675 complaints assessed by A&CA, 3,021 were determined to be editorial (raising 3,104 issues). The unit investigated 1,420 editorial complaints (raising 1,503 issues), provided responses to 48 editorial complaints that did not require investigation, referred 1,548 editorial complaints to content areas for direct response, and closed 5 editorial complaints without response. Nature of editorial complaint issues Subject Issues % total Factual inaccuracy 782 25.2% Party political bias 616 19.8% Bias (other than party political)* 613 19.7% Inappropriate content 418 13.5% Lack of balance 264 8.5% Unfair treatment 254 8.2% Other 157 5.1% Total 3,104 100.0% * Includes claims of bias in relation to issues such as international coverage, sport and religion. Editorial complaints management Accountability 147 Outcome of investigated complaints During 2018-19, 50 editorial complaint issues (3.3% of all investigated issues) were upheld. A matter is upheld in cases where A&CA determine that ABC editorial standards have not been met. A further 115 issues (7.7% of all investigated issues) were resolved, after the relevant content area took prompt and appropriate action to remedy the cause of the complaint. All findings in relation to upheld and resolved complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staff responsible. In 2018-19, actions taken in response to upheld and resolved complaints included written apologies to complainants, on-air corrections, counselling or other action with staff, removal of inappropriate content or correction of material on ABC Online, and reviews of - and improvements to - procedures. Summaries of upheld and resolved complaints are published on abc.net.au as individual complaints are finalised, providing timely access to complaint decisions. The ABC also publishes a quarterly statistical overview of audience contacts on its corporate website. Timeliness A&CA seeks to respond to all complaints as quickly as possible and aims to respond within 30 days of receipt, in accordance with the timeliness standard for complaint handling that is specified in the ABC's Complaint Handling Procedures. Of the 2,308 complaints that A&CA responded to directly between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, 1,994 (86.4%) received responses within 30 days. Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response, or who do not receive a response to their complaint within 60 days, may seek review from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). During 2018-19, the ACMA advised the ABC that it had finalised investigations into seven such matters (compared to 14 in 2017-18). In one case in 2018-19 the ACMA found a breach of the ABC Code of Practice. Catalyst, 14 August 2018 The ACMA found a breach of due impartiality in the Catalyst episode 'Feeding Australia: Foods of Tomorrow' (part 1). ACMA concluded that the program did not present beef with the same open-mindedness and fair treatment as it did other foods. The ABC noted the findings but respectfully disagreed with the ACMA's view that the program lacked impartiality. Commonwealth Ombudsman The Ombudsman's office did not notify the ABC of any investigations into the ABC's handling of complaints commenced or finalised during the 2018-19 reporting period. 148 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Aaron Pedersen (Jay) in Mystery Road.

Financial Outcome 2018-19 The ABC operated within its total sources of funds and revenue from Government for the 2018-19 financial year, recording total comprehensive income of $38.3 million. Sources of Funds 2018-19 The ABC was allocated $1,045.9 million in the May 2018 Federal Budget, reflecting a further decrease in base funding of $12.5 million related to the previously announced ABC/SBS Additional Efficiency Savings Measure, offset by indexation on base funding and one-off funding received in relation to the previously announced Enhanced News Services initiative. The ABC also received $62.5 million from other sources, including ABC Commercial during the year. The chart 'ABC source of funds' depicts the ABC's budgeted funds for the various categories against actual sources for 2018-19 and its budgeted sources for 2019-20.

The Year Ahead Revenue from Government In the 2019-20 Budget the Government announced additional funding of $43.7 million over three years for continuation of the Enhanced News Services initiative under the 'Guaranteeing National Broadcaster ABC and SBS' measure. This includes $14.3 million provided in 2019-20, with the renewed funding being for three years only, terminating on 30 June 2022. 2019-20 is also the first year impacted by the three year pause to indexation of ABC General Operational Activities base funding, announced by Government in the May 2018 Budget as part of the 'Funding for Australian Film and Television Content and the National Broadcasters' measure. This results in a reduction of $14.6 million in 2019-20 and a total reduction of $83.7m over the three years 2019-20 to 2021-22, with an ongoing reduction to the funding base of $41.3m per annum in future years beyond 2021-22. This is offset by a year on year reduction in 2019-20 of the amount for the previously announced ABC/SBS Additional Efficiency Savings Measure.

Budget Strategy The Budget for 2019-20 faces an environment of constant change in the media landscape, with the growth of digital formats and emergence of global players driving sophisticated and targeted multiplatform content delivery. There has never been a more challenging time for the ABC to deliver on its Charter, while at the same time reshaping the business to remain competitive and relevant in a digital era. 2019-20 represents the first year of the new triennial funding period, including renewed three-year funding for Enhanced News Services. It is also the first year impacted by the operational funding indexation pause announced in the May 2018 Budget, as outlined above. This funding reduction comes on top of the ABC/SBS Efficiency Savings measure previously announced in 2014-15 Budget, and places additional pressure on the ABC's budget strategy over the next three years. The ABC is in the process of reviewing a program of initiatives to achieve the savings required to operate within the reduced levels of funding for the next three years and beyond. Given that the ABC has already achieved significant productivity gains in response to past budget cuts, the impact of the funding reduction cannot be absorbed by efficiency measures alone, with some initiatives likely to impact on content. The ABC remains committed to prioritising available resources to enable it to most effectively deliver on its Charter obligations and remain relevant to audiences in Australia's cultural and media landscape into the future. $1,201 $879 $ Millions Years 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1,000 1,050 1,100 1,150 1,200 revenue from Government including capital indexed at 2018-19 levels - December 2018, six months CPI Index 29.5% reduction from 1985-86 to 2019-20 154 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Comparative Revenue from Government The 2019-20 operational revenue from Government of $879 million represents a decrease in real funding of $367 million or 29.5% since 1985-86 as depicted in the chart 'ABC operational revenue from Government'.

Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 166 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 2. Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and Original Budget Explanations are provided for significant variances between actual results and the original budget, as reflected in the May 2018 Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) of the ABC. Significant variances are typically greater than $20,000,000 though they include variances which are relevant to the performance of the ABC, not merely numerically significant variances between the original budget and the actual amounts. The budget is not audited. The ABC's total comprehensive income for the financial year to June 2019 was $38,304,000. This result was $23,337,000 higher than the budgeted total comprehensive income of $14,967,000. The primary factors which contributed to this total variance were the upward revaluation of the Corporation's Ultimo, New South Wales premises, as detailed in Note 2E, together with the factors outlined in Note 2B and 2D. The original budget did not incorporate these factors due to their unpredictable, uncontrollable and/or unplanned nature. A. Timing of original budget The original budget was prepared prior to the completion and approval of the ABC's internal budget by the ABC Board. Differences between the original budget and the ABC's internal budget allocations may result in amounts being reflected in different line items between the original budget and the actual results at 30 June 2019. B. Employee benefits Employee benefits expenses are higher than the original budget primarily due to the recognition of estimated historical entitlements owed to casual employees. Refer to Note 11A Employee provisions for further commentary. A further component of the variance is due to additional employee benefits expenditure relating to content creation which was originally budgeted to be expended against suppliers. Consequently, supplier costs were lower than the original budget, however this variance is not observable due to the additional supplier costs of $19,508,687 incurred as a result of the ABC's Ultimo remediation project. C. Sale of goods and rendering of services Own-source revenue from sale of goods and rendering of services is lower than the original budget mainly due to the closure of ABC Retail in 2018-19. The closure of ABC Retail also resulted in reduced Employee benefits and Supplier expenditure. The cessation of the ABC's retail business was not factored into the budget as it was not planned at the time that the budget was set. D. Insurance recoveries A gain has been recognised for an insurance recovery that the Corporation expects to receive for the cost of certain remedial works on the ABC's Ultimo building. This recovery was not factored into the original budget as the recovery was not virtually certain at the time of preparing the budget. A receivable has been recognised for the insurance recovery at 30 June 2019 and is expected to be recovered in the 2019-20 financial year. Financial Statements 167 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 2. Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and Original Budget (continued) E. Changes in asset revaluation reserve Independent property valuers, MMJ Advisory, undertook a desktop valuation of the ABC's Ultimo premises as at 30 April 2019. Consequently, revaluation increments of $28,000,000 for land and $7,465,134 for buildings on freehold land were credited to the asset revaluation reserve and included in Changes in asset revaluation reserve within Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Reserves within the Statement of Financial Position and Net revaluation of land and buildings in the Statement of Changes in Equity. In addition, a small revaluation increment has been recognised due to the anticipated sale of a freehold property in Karratha, Western Australia. F. Receivables Refer to the commentary in Note 2D. G. Other investments The Other investments balance is lower than the original budget mainly due to the actual opening balance at 1 July 2018 being lower than the budgeted opening balance. This was due to a draw down on other investments in 2017-18 to fund additional expenditure on content and remediation of the ABC's Ultimo building, which was not factored into the budget. As a result of these factors Net cash from operating activities was also lower than the original budget. H. Land Refer to the commentary in Note 2E. I. Plant and equipment The original budget was finalised prior to the preparation of the Corporation's internal capital investment budget. The capital plan resulted in reduced investment in plant and equipment and increased investment in intangibles (specifically software) in 2018-19. This investment mix is reflective of the ABC's Product and Technology investment program which centres on the digital modernisation of the Corporation. J. Intangibles Refer to the commentary in Note 2I. K. Other provisions The Other provisions balance is higher than the original budget due primarily to the recognition of estimated expenses associated with the remedial building work referenced in Note 2D. L. Employee provisions Refer to the commentary in Note 2B. M. Cash Flow Statement Movements in the Cash Flow Statement including lower than budgeted Net cash from operating activities are largely reflective of the explanation provided in Note 2G. In addition, the Cash Flow Statement shows the gross amounts related to the purchase and proceeds of investments separately under investment activities whilst the original budget shows a net figure against Purchase of investments. 168 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 3. Overview The Corporation is a Corporate Commonwealth, not-for-profit entity. Its functions are set out in section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. Those functions are reflected in the statement of purpose in the ABC Corporate Plan 2018-19, which was prepared in accordance with section 35 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). The Corporation sets out to achieve one outcome: inform, educate and entertain audiences throughout Australia and overseas through innovative and comprehensive media and related services. The continued existence of the Corporation in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continued funding by Parliament. Accounting Framework The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Corporation are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements are general purpose financial statements as required by section 42 of the PGPA Act. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with; \u00e2\u00a2 PGPA (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 (FRR); and \u00e2\u00a2 Australian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. The Corporation's financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. Significant Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the accounting policies listed throughout the financial statements and accompanying notes, the Corporation has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer. In addition, the Corporation has taken the fair value of plant, equipment and intangibles to be the depreciated cost which is representative of depreciated replacement cost. Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The Corporation has applied estimates and assumptions to the following: \u00e2\u00a2 Depreciation, as detailed in Note 4C Depreciation and amortisation, and Note 7A Land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles; \u00e2\u00a2 Program amortisation, as detailed in Note 4D Program amortisation, and Note 7C Inventories; \u00e2\u00a2 Impairment of financial instruments, as detailed in Note 4F Impairment loss on financial instruments ; \u00e2\u00a2 Impairment of non-financial assets, as detailed in Note 4G Write-down and impairment of other assets; \u00e2\u00a2 Valuation of properties, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 7A Land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles; \u00e2\u00a2 Provision for make good and Provision for building maintenance (cladding), as detailed in Note 10 Other Provisions; and \u00e2\u00a2 Employee provisions detailed in Note 11 Employee Provisions. Financial Statements 169 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 3. Overview (continued) No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. New Accounting Standards Adoption of New Australian Accounting Standard Requirements AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) This Standard replaces AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. It amends the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets and liabilities and the recognition and de-recognition requirements for financial instruments. Changes to hedge accounting align the accounting with risk management objectives. AASB 9 applies allowances for impairment based on expected credit losses, rather than as and when an impairment event occurs. This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. AASB 9, adopted by the Corporation from 1 July 2018, introduces a single classification and measurement model for financial assets, dependent on both: \u00e2\u00a2 An entity's business objective for managing financial assets; and \u00e2\u00a2 The contractual cash-flow characteristics of those financial assets. The initial recognition and subsequent measurement of the Corporation's financial assets under AASB 9 has had minimal impact on its financial position as most of the Corporation's financial assets comprise held-to-maturity investments or cash and cash equivalents. With the exception of derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value through surplus/(deficit), the Corporation will continue to measure its financial assets at amortised cost, based on the following conditions being met: \u00e2\u00a2 Financial assets are held to collect contractual cash flows; and \u00e2\u00a2 Payments comprise solely of principal and interest and occur on the principal outstanding. Impairment of financial assets and transition to AASB 9 Financial Instruments Under AASB 9, impairment of financial assets is provided for based on future expected credit losses (ECLs) rather than as and when existing debts are deemed to be impaired. This principle also allows for the expectation of credit losses to be adjusted in response to certain factors, for example prevailing or anticipated market conditions. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost (as is the case with the ABC) or fair value through other comprehensive income. The impact to the ABC's financial statements is not material and no adjustment was required to be recognised in retained earnings upon adoption at 1 July 2018. Future Australian Accounting Standard Requirements The following new standards and amendments to standards were issued by the AASB but are effective for future reporting periods. The expected impact of adopting these pronouncements on the Corporation's financial statements is outlined below. This will be assessed periodically up to the date the standards are formally adopted. 170 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15) AASB 15 provides a single principle-based five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers. It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts currently included in AASB 11 Construction Contracts and AASB 118 Revenue. AASB 2016-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Australian Implementation Guidance for Not-for-Profit Entities permits not-for-profit entities to apply this Standard for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Transition to AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers This Standard applies predominantly to transactions made by ABC Commercial. The ABC has reviewed ABC Commercial contracts to determine the impact of AASB 15 on revenue recognition. The ABC expects the changes attributable to the adoption of AASB 15 to have little impact as ABC Commercial already recognises revenue when performance obligations are met. In addition, changes to the disclosure requirements are not expected to be material to the ABC. AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities (AASB 1058) AASB 1058 clarifies and simplifies the income recognition requirements that apply to not-for-profit (NFP) entities, in conjunction with AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The requirements of this Standard more closely reflect the economic reality of NFP entity transactions that are not contracts with customers. The timing of income recognition depends on whether such a transaction gives rise to a liability or other performance obligation (a promise to transfer a good or service), or a contribution by owners, related to an asset (such as cash or another asset) received by an entity. Under AASB 1058, the ABC is required to apply the recognition criteria set out in AASB 1004 Contributions, to Revenue from Government. Under AASB 1004, income arising from the contribution of an asset (in this case cash) to the entity shall be recognised when and only when, all of the following conditions have been met: \u00e2\u00a2 The entity obtains control of the contribution or the right to receive the contribution; \u00e2\u00a2 It is probable that the economic benefits comprising the contribution will flow to the entity; and \u00e2\u00a2 The amount of the contribution can be measured reliably. The ABC currently applies the above criteria to Revenue from Government and therefore the adoption of AASB 1058 is expected to have no impact. AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16) AASB 16 sets out the principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and will replace existing accounting requirements for leases in reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. Under current requirements leases are classified by lessees either as finance leases which are recognised on the Statement of Financial Position or operating leases which are not recognised on the Statement of Financial Position. The application of AASB 16 will result in the recognition of all leases on the Statement of Financial Position in the form of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability based on the discounted value of committed lease payments. Over the life of the lease, the liability incurs interest and is reduced as lease payments are made, and the asset is amortised over its useful life. Financial Statements 171 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 3. Overview (continued) Lessor accounting under AASB 16 is substantially unchanged from current accounting requirements under AASB 117 Leases and has no material impact to the ABC. Based on an assessment undertaken by ABC management, certain broadcast distribution and transmission arrangements, which are currently classified by the ABC as service agreements, will be captured as leases under the new Standard. The assessment also concluded that a number of the ABC's broadcast distribution and transmission arrangements fall outside the scope of the Standard. These arrangements will continue to be recognised as services. The new Standard is also expected to impact leases which are currently classified by the ABC as operating leases, being mainly leases over premises and motor vehicles. The ABC will apply the Standard retrospectively, using the modified retrospective method, recognising the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard in retained earnings and reserves as at 1 July 2019. Based on the ABC's assessment, the Standard's likely impact on first-time adoption is as follows: \u00e2\u00a2 There will be a material increase in lease assets and financial liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position; amounts are approximated at: - recognition of Finance Lease Liabilities of $650 million to $700 million; and - recognition of Right of Use (RoU) Assets of $650 million to $700 million. \u00e2\u00a2 Approximately $1 million to $3 million is expected to be recognised against the value of the RoU Assets relating to property lease make-good costs expensed in prior periods. This will be adjusted against opening retained earnings resulting in a reduction in equity. \u00e2\u00a2 Finance costs and depreciation expenses in the statement of comprehensive income will be higher as the implicit interest in lease payments will be presented as part of finance costs and the depreciation of the right of use asset will be presented as depreciation rather than being included as supplier costs. A net additional expense of between $5 million to $10 million is expected to be incurred in the 2019-20 financial year as a result of the application of AASB 16. \u00e2\u00a2 Operating cash outflows will be lower and financing cash outflows will be higher in the cash flow statement as principal repayments on all lease liabilities will be included in financing activities rather than operating activities. Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, gains, expenses and losses are recognised net of the amount of GST except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the revenue or expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST receivable from the ATO is included as a financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position while any net amount of GST payable to the ATO is included as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position in Other payables. 172 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Income Tax The Corporation is not subject to income tax pursuant to section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. Two of the Corporation's controlled entities, Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, while subject to income tax, have been inactive up to and including 30 June 2019. The Corporation's interests in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited are subject to income tax. ABC AustraliaPlus (Shanghai) Cultural Development Co. Ltd, incorporated in the People's Republic of China, is not subject to Australian income tax. Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) The Corporation is subject to Australian FBT. Events after Reporting Period There were no material events after the reporting period that would have a material impact on the operations of or finances of the Corporation.

Repairs and maintenance Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrade or enhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred. Operating leases Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. Depreciation Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation rates are initially based on their useful lives, reviewed each year and adjusted as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are referenced in Note 7A Land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles. Amortisation of intangibles Intangibles comprise software for internal use. These assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Software is initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-8 years (2018 3-8 years). The amortised cost is considered to approximate fair value. These assets are assessed annually for potential impairment. Refer to Note 4G Write down and impairment of other assets. Amortisation of produced programs The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: \u00e2\u00a2 News, Current Affairs, Live Programs, Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics - 100% on first screening; \u00e2\u00a2 Childrens, Education and Movies - straight line over three years from completion of production; \u00e2\u00a2 iview-only programs - 100% on first release; and \u00e2\u00a2 Programs not covered above - 100% on first screening. The costs of programs produced for Radio and ABC International are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal.

Impairment loss on financial instruments Under AASB 9 Financial Instruments, impairment of financial assets is provided for on the basis of future expected credit losses (ECLs) rather than as and when existing debts are deemed to be impaired. It also allows for the expectation of credit losses to be adjusted in response to certain factors, for example prevailing or anticipated market conditions. Write-down and impairment of other assets Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment is made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. At 30 June 2019, the Corporation had performed assessments to determine the extent of any indications that assets may be impaired and the resultant financial impact has been incorporated in the financial statements. Gains or losses on disposal of assets Gains or losses from disposal of assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. Lease expense commitments Commitments are GST inclusive where relevant. GST recoverable is disclosed separately. Net commitments for minimum lease payments in relation to non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows: 2019 $'000 2018 $'000 One year or less 3,410 5,115 From one to five years 3,988 6,117 Over five years - 1,947 Total operating lease expense commitments 7,398 13,179 GST receivable on operating lease expense commitments One year or less (319) (293) From one to five years (391) (302) Total GST receivable on operating lease expense commitments (710) (595) Nature of operating lease General description of leasing arrangement Motor vehicles - business and senior executive Fully maintained operating lease over 24/36 months and/ or 40,000/60,000 kilometres; no contingent rentals; no renewal or purchase options available.

AASB 16 Leases A component of the commitments in the above table will be recognised as leased right of use assets and lease liabilities under AASB 16 from 1 July 2019. Those leases which are exempt from AASB 16 will continue to be expensed on a straight-line basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets.

Rendering of services Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion and the meeting of performance obligations of contracts at the reporting date, when; \u00e2\u00a2 the amount of revenue and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and \u00e2\u00a2 the probable economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the Corporation. The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date is determined by reference to the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms. Receivables, which have 30-day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due, less any impairment allowance for bad and doubtful debts. The collectability of debts is reviewed periodically. Allowances are made for expected credit losses. 178 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Interest Revenue Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method and if not received at balance date, is reflected in the Statement of Financial Position as a receivable. Subsidies and grants The Corporation receives grant monies from time to time. Most grant agreements require the Corporation to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for a specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordance with the agreement. Share of revenue attributable to joint operations Share of revenue attributable to joint operations represents the ABC's 50% share of MediaHub's Revenue from continuing operations. Foreign currency transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the hedged rate. All gains and losses are taken to surplus/ (deficit) except for forward exchange contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges used to hedge highly probable transactions. Gains on cash flow hedges held at balance date are taken to equity. Operating leases revenue commitments 2019 $'000 2018 $'000 One year or less 1,611 2,447 From one to five years 3,857 2,233 Over five years 1,921 2,082 Total operating lease revenue commitments 7,389 6,762 GST payable on operating lease revenue commitments One year or less (133) (209) From one to five years (330) (168) Over five years (175) (189) Total GST payable on operating lease revenue commitments (638) (566) These commitments, largely relating to rental income for letting out office space, are GST inclusive where relevant. GST payable to the ATO is disclosed separately. Lease terms are typically between 1 to 5 years in duration and income is subject to increases in accordance with CPI or other agreed increment. Financial Statements 179 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 Financial Position Recognition and measurement Acquisition of assets Assets are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and income at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities The Corporation has adopted the following general policies relating to the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. The fair value of land is determined by reference to the market value of the land component of ABC property because it is possible to base the fair value on recent sales of comparable sites. The Corporation's independent valuers detail these reference sites in valuation reports for respective properties. The fair value of buildings, plant, equipment and intangibles is determined by reference to depreciated replacement cost as they are typically specialist in nature, with broadcasting in mind. Generally, the fair value of the Corporation's other financial assets and liabilities is deemed to be their carrying value as it approximates fair value. The fair value of long-term loans is the net present value of future discounted cash flows arising. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy: \u00e2\u00a2 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \u00e2\u00a2 Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and \u00e2\u00a2 Level 3 - unobservable inputs for an asset or liability. The Corporation holds a freehold property classified as held for sale, which was tendered for sale in an open market as disclosed in Note 7B Assets classified as held for sale . The sales process has been administered at arm's length by an independent agent. Apart from the above asset, the Corporation does not hold any assets or liabilities measured at fair value that are classified as Level 1 inputs (i.e. with reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities). Assets and liabilities measured at fair value and classified as Levels 2 and 3 are detailed in Note 7A Land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and non-interest-bearing financial liabilities (except for derivatives used for hedging) of the Corporation, are measured at amortised cost that approximates their fair value. There have been no recurring fair value measurements transferred between the respective levels for assets and liabilities to 30 June 2019. Foreign currency transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the hedged rate. All monetary foreign currency balances are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at balance date. Monetary assets and liabilities of overseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars at the applicable exchange rate at balance date. 180 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 6.

Financial Assets (continued) Recognition and measurement Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at their nominal amounts and include: \u00e2\u00a2 cash on hand; and \u00e2\u00a2 cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are held for the purpose of collecting the contractual cash flows where the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, that are not provided at below-market interest rates, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method adjusted for any loss allowance. These are included in current assets, unless they mature more than 12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date, in which case they are classified as non-current assets. Other receivables Other receivables include forward exchange contracts at fair value through surplus/(deficit) of $62,159 (2018 $102,616). Under the fair value measurement hierarchy, these are Level 2 financial instruments as defined earlier under Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities. The balance represents estimated future cash flows, based on market forward exchange rates at 30 June 2019 and the forward contract rate, discounted by the observable yield curves of the respective currencies. The above amount reflects a 2.2% average depreciation (2018 5.5%) of the Australian dollar against those currencies for which forward exchange contracts have been taken out, where the market forward rate at 30 June 2019 is lower than the contracted rate. Insurance recoveries At 30 June 2019, Receivables (Goods and services) included $13,727,176 (2018 nil) for amounts invoiced to Comcover for insurance recoveries relating to expenditure incurred on the remediation of the ABC's Ultimo building. At 30 June 2019, Other receivables - Other, including receivables attributable to joint operations included $29,544,550 (2018 nil) for insurance recovery amounts yet to be invoiced. The total Receivables amount recognised in respect of the insurance recovery for the ABC Ultimo remediation works is $43,271,726. This represents the amount that the ABC is virtually certain of recovering.

The carrying amount is reduced by way of an impairment allowance account. The loss is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. \u00e2\u00a2 Bad and doubtful debts The Corporation assesses the likelihood of recovery of those debts, factoring in past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified. \u00e2\u00a2 Impairment and transition to adoption of AASB 9 Financial Instruments The ABC calculates an expected credit loss (ECL) provision, based on historical rates of credit impairment, adjusted for any external factors likely to impact the rate of impairment. The carrying value of the ECL provision is monitored against the value of debts likely to be considered at risk of being non-recoverable. At 30 June 2019, the balance of the ECL provision is $141,844 (2018 $75,594). For the year ended 30 June 2019, the Corporation has identified $132,284 of outstanding debt attributable to customers at risk of non-recoverability. This is fully covered by the ECL provision. Of prior years' balances, $62,877 was recognised as bad debts and $12,717 was recovered. Other investments (held to maturity financial assets) Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Under AASB 9 Financial Instruments, held-to-maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. Surplus cash is invested into short term investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are due to be recovered within twelve months.

The fair value of land is determined based on market comparability, using recent sales history for comparable sites as referenced by independent valuers. The exception to this is the Karratha, Western Australia referred to below, which is a Level 1 non-financial asset, which was revalued to reflect a quoted price. Independent property valuers, MMJ Advisory undertook a desktop valuation of the Harris Street, Ultimo site as at 30 April 2019. Consequently, a revaluation increment of $28,000,000 (2018 $4,300,000) for land and an increment of $7,465,134 (2018 $3,537,121) for buildings on freehold land was credited to the asset revaluation reserve and included in Changes in asset revaluation reserve within Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Reserves within the Statement of Financial Position and Net revaluation of land and buildings in the Statement of Changes in Equity. As outlined above, due to the anticipated sale of a freehold property, Karratha, Western Australia, a revaluation increment of $59,251 for land and an increment of $78,352 for buildings on freehold land was credited to the asset revaluation reserve and included in Changes in asset revaluation reserve within Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Reserves within the Statement of Financial Position and Net revaluation of land and buildings in the Statement of Changes in Equity. This property is reflected in Note 7B Assets classified as held for sale. Level 3 non-financial assets comprise buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles, with no observable market data for the assets. Given the specialised nature of the Corporation's buildings, valuation is determined with reference to depreciated replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying value of the Corporation's plant and equipment represents its depreciated replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of its fair value. The carrying value of the Corporation's software for internal use represents its amortised replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of its fair value. Asset recognition threshold Purchases of land, buildings, plant, equipment and intangibles are recognised initially at cost in the Statement of Financial Position. Purchases costing less than $2,000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Revaluations Following initial recognition at cost, the fair value of property, plant, equipment and intangibles is measured based on depreciated replacement cost. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary from the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class, previously recognised through surplus/(deficit). Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through surplus/(deficit) except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the re-valued amount.

Any such costs are provided for in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Statement of Financial Position. The Corporation entered into a contract, subject to finance, for the sale of its Karratha, Western Australia property. The contract was signed on 30 May 2019 for a sale price of $335,000. Inventories (general) Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Produced programs Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include co-production fees, direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Statement of Financial Position. Write-down of inventory held for distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential, and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the value of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. Write-down of retail inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value will be recognised as an inventory expense reduction in expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.

The total loan facility is $30,000,000 (2018 $50,000,000) and is provided on a long-term fixed interest rate basis at a weighted average interest rate of 1.95% (2018 1.88%). Interest is payable annually in arrears at the loans' anniversary dates. The fair value of Loans from the Department of Finance at 30 June 2019 is $30,476,369 (2018 $50,231,245), which approximates the carrying value of $30,000,000 (2018 $50,000,000). Under the fair value measurement hierarchy, this is a Level 2 financial instrument. This has been derived on future cash flows based on timing of contractual borrowing costs and the principal repayment, discounted by the Australian Government bond rate for a bond of equivalent duration. Two of the remaining repayment tranches of $10,000,000 are payable in April 2020 while the third is payable in April 2021. The discount rate applied to the cash flow forecasts and the principal value of the remaining drawdown maturing beyond 12 months was the Australian Government 2-year bond rate, 0.98% (2018 2.00%). No loan payments span beyond 3 years, so the 3-year bond rate was nil (2018 2.07%). Share of loans in joint operations represents the ABC's 50% share of MediaHub's loan balances with the ANZ Banking Corporation. At 30 June 2019, MediaHub had drawn loans under six facilities with ANZ Banking Corporation, with an aggregate balance of $5,441,667 (2018 $3,294,000). The ABC's share, as reflected in its Statement of Financial Position, is $2,720,834 (2018 $1,647,000). These facilities are generally repayable over 5 years. At 30 June 2019, a further facility of $1,000,000 had not been drawn upon. The facility is provided on an average variable interest rate to 30 June 2019 of 3% (2018 3.35% to 3.5%).

The provision for make good represents the estimated cost to make good 27 (2018 27) leased properties at the end of the lease term. The estimated cost is based on management's best estimate of the cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. The movement in the provision for make good was impacted by a downward revision in certain make good estimates. During the year, the ABC provided a further $19,508,687 (2018 $30,704,936) for remediation works to replace the external cladding on the Ultimo, NSW building, to ensure compliance with the current BCA Fire Safety Standards. This resulted in a total provision of $50,213,623. For the year ended 30 June 2019, expenditure incurred on this project was $17,601,011 (2018 nil), resulting in a balance in the provision of $32,612,612 (2018 $30,704,936). 190 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 People and Relationships 11. Employee Provisions 2019 $'000 2018 $'000 11A Employee provisions Annual leave provisions 159,795 134,670 Employee provisions are expected to be settled in: no more than 12 months 144,562 120,624 more than 12 months 15,233 14,046 Total employee provisions 159,795 134,670 (a) The settlement of employee provisions is based on the individual employee's entitlement to leave. Where an employee has a current entitlement to leave (i.e. is presently entitled to take the leave), the value of that entitlement is included in the employee provisions expected to settle in no more than 12 months. Where the Corporation expects that an employee will be entitled to leave in the future but is not yet entitled to that leave, the value of the leave is included in the employee provision expected to settle in more than 12 months. (b) A provision is made for estimated historical salary and wages and superannuation entitlements owed to certain casual employees. This estimate is based on an extrapolation of entitlements calculated for a portion of potentially affected employees and factors-in risks and uncertainties associated with the settlement of the liability. The provision for superannuation also includes an amount in respect of an outstanding employer contribution to a defined benefit superannuation scheme. Recognition and measurement Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits expected within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts. Other long-term employee benefits are measured as the net total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period minus the fair value at the end of the reporting period of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Leave Leave liabilities are calculated based on employees' remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will apply at the time the leave is taken, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The calculation is based on the anticipated length of time taken for an employee to fully settle his/her leave entitlement. The liability for long service leave has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities Ltd. The liability for long service leave is the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Corporation resulting from employees' services provided up to 30 June 2019. The estimate of the present value of the liability considers attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. A discount rate of 1.2% per annum was applied to calculate the present value of the liability (2018 2.6%). This discount rate is based on the Commonwealth Government bond yield for a bond with a similar term to the liability. Redundancy A provision is made for separation and redundancy benefit payments. The ABC recognises a provision for termination when it has developed a detailed formal plan for the terminations and has informed those employees affected that it will carry out the terminations. Financial Statements 191 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 11. Employee Provisions (continued) Superannuation ABC employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-Commonwealth Superannuation fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other non-Commonwealth funds are defined contribution schemes. The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported in the Department of Finance's administered schedules and notes. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee defined benefit superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation's employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions in the same manner as contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2019 represents outstanding contributions at the end of the period. Expenses Expenses attributable to the aforementioned employee benefits and provisions are reported in Note 4A Employee benefits . 12. Key Management Personnel Remuneration Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of the Corporation.

Financial Instruments (continued) Recognition and measurement Financial Instruments Financial Assets The Corporation classifies its financial assets in the following categories: \u00e2\u00a2 financial assets at fair value through surplus/(deficit); \u00e2\u00a2 held-to-maturity investments; and \u00e2\u00a2 loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date. Effective Interest Method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets that are recognised at fair value through surplus/(deficit). Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) or surplus/(deficit) Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through surplus/(deficit) where the financial assets: \u00e2\u00a2 have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; \u00e2\u00a2 are derivatives (except for derivative instruments that are designated as, and are highly effective hedging instruments); or \u00e2\u00a2 are parts of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and have a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Forward exchange contracts in this category are classified as current assets. Financial assets at fair value through surplus/ (deficit) are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in surplus/ (deficit). The net gain or loss recognised in surplus/(deficit) incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised through surplus/ (deficit) except if they are classified as a cash flow hedge where they are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity. 200 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Classification of financial assets on the date of initial application of AASB 9 Financial Instruments Financial assets class AASB 139 original classification AASB 9 new classification AASB 139 carrying amount at 1 July 2018 ($'000) AASB 9 carrying amount at 1 July 2018 ($'000) Loans, receivables and cash Cash and cash equivalents Amortised cost Amortised cost 6,844 6,844 Goods and services Other Amortised cost cost 7,366 (held to maturity) Amortised cost Amortised cost 167,400 167,400 Forward exchange contracts valued at fair value through surplus/(deficit) Fair value through surplus/(deficit) Fair value through surplus/(deficit) 103 103 Total financial assets 190,935 190,935 Reconciliation of financial assets on the date of initial application of AASB 9 Financial Instruments AASB 139 carrying amount at 30 June 2018 ($'000) Reclassification ($'000) Remeasurement ($'000) AASB 9 carrying amount at 1 July 2018 ($'000) Financial assets at amortised cost Cash and cash equivalents 6,844 - - 6,844 Goods and services receivables 4,279 - - 4,279 Other receivables 4,943 - - 4,943 Accrued revenue 7,366 - - 7,366 Other investments (held to maturity) 167,400 - - 167,400 Financial assets at fair value through surplus/(deficit) Forward exchange contracts valued at fair value through surplus/(deficit) 103 - - 103 Total financial assets 190,935 - - 190,935 Financial Statements 201 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 14.

These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective interest basis. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contracts are entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their net fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in surplus/(deficit). Amounts taken to equity are transferred to surplus/(deficit) when the hedged transaction affects the surplus/(deficit), such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. 202 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to surplus/(deficit). If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to surplus/(deficit). 14.3 Financial Risk Management The Corporation's financial risk management policies and procedures are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Corporation, to set appropriate risk limits and controls to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous year. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a regular basis. To meet the Corporation's regular financial risk management objectives, surplus cash is invested in short term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as other receivables. The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into trade financial instruments for speculative purposes. Under Section 25B of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the Corporation's Foreign Exchange Policy is conducted to reduce or eliminate risk on the Corporation's known exposures and activities and will be recorded under accepted accounting standards. The Corporation's aims, by entering into foreign currency hedging arrangements are outlined in Note 4 Expenses and the Financial Position section under \"Foreign currency transactions\". 14.4 Fair Values of Financial Instruments Forward exchange contracts The fair value of forward exchange contracts is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. At 30 June 2019 this was a receivable of $62,159 (2018 net receivable of $86,503). The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) are determined using a Level 2 technique based on the forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period using assumptions that are based on market conditions at the end of each reporting period. Loans The fair values of long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. At 30 June 2019, the Corporation's loan facility with the Department of Finance is $30,000,000 (2018 $50,000,000) and progressively matures by 8 April 2021. This was to cash-flow the construction of the now complete purpose-built facility in Southbank, Victoria. The Corporation repaid $20,000,000 during the year to 30 June 2019 (2018 $20,000,000). As disclosed in Note 9 Interest Bearing Liabilities, the fair value of the loan at 30 June 2019 is $30,476,369 (2018 $50,231,245). Financial Statements 203 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2019 14. Financial Instruments (continued) 14.5 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, short term investments and derivative instruments. The Corporation has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation assesses credit ratings through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with credit ratings of at least A- as assigned by Standard & Poor's. The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of the expected credit loss provision, of those assets as indicated in the Statement of Financial Position. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by the net fair value of the contracts. 14.6 Hedging Instruments The following table sets out the gross value to be received under forward exchange contracts, the weighted average contracted exchange rates and the settlement periods of outstanding contracts for the Corporation. Sell Australian Dollars Average Exchange Rate 2019 $'000 2018 $'000 2019 2018 Buy USD Less than 1 year 2,669 1,834 0.7133 0.7705 Buy GBP Less than 1 year 176 537 0.5627 0.5555 Buy EUR Less than 1 year - 78 - 0.6329 Specific hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments when exposures of $50,000 or greater are entered into under a firm contract for goods or services involving a specific foreign currency amount and payment date. Exposures are covered if they fall within a set period, which can generally be a minimum of 3 months or maximum of 6 months subject to market conditions. A net loss of nil (2018 net loss of $2,083) on specific hedges of foreign currency purchases, outstanding as at 30 June 2019, was recorded. The Corporation's cash flow hedges were all effective during the period. 204 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 General hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments when exposures less than $50,000, of a recurrent nature and with varying foreign currency amounts and payment dates are incurred. General cover is typically held between 20% and 80% of estimated exposures for USD, GBP and EUR subject to market conditions. At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy USD, GBP and EUR. Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been taken to surplus/(deficit). The net gain is $58,648 (2018 net gain of $96,486) on general hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases, outstanding as at 30 June 2019.

Recognition and measurement Contingent assets and liabilities Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of an asset or liability or represent an asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is greater than remote. Contingencies are disclosed on a net basis. Quantifiable and significant remote contingencies The Corporation has neither material contingent assets nor remote contingent liabilities at 30 June 2019 (2018 nil). Unquantifiable contingencies In the normal course of activities, claims for damages and other recoveries have been lodged at the date of this report against the Corporation and its staff. The Corporation has disclaimed liability and is actively defending these actions. It is not possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments which may be required or amounts that may be received in relation to any of these claims. Commitments Lease expense, lease revenue and capital purchases commitments are disclosed in Note 4, Note 5 and Note 7 respectively. 206 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 John Hanley records a time capsule for his wife on The Recording Studio.

Regulatory Framework The ABC Board is required, under paragraph 8(1) (e) of the ABC Act, to develop a code of practice relating to its television and radio programming, and to notify this code to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (\"the ACMA\"). A complaint alleging the ABC has acted contrary to its Code of Practice in its television or radio programming may be made to the ABC. A complainant is entitled under section 150 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (\"the BSA\") to take their complaint to the ACMA if, after 60 days, the ABC fails to respond to the complainant or the complainant considers the ABC's response is inadequate. The ACMA has a discretionary power to investigate a complaint alleging the ABC has, in providing a national broadcasting service, breached its Code of Practice. Section 151 of the BSA provides that the ACMA may investigate the complaint if it thinks that it is desirable to do so. The ACMA's jurisdiction under sections 150-151 does not encompass the ABC's print content or content disseminated by the ABC over the internet or through mobile devices. However, the eSafety Commissioner has separate jurisdiction under Schedule 7 to the BSA in relation to content hosted on websites or transmitted through mobile services where that content is either \"prohibited content\"1 or \"age-restricted content\".2 The eSafety Commissioner is empowered under Schedule 7 to require content service providers and content hosts to remove or prevent access to these types of content. The ABC voluntarily complies with the Content Services Code, which is registered as an industry code with the eSafety Commissioner under clause 85 of Schedule 7 to the BSA. The Content Services Code does not apply to content delivered through online or mobile services where that content has been previously transmitted on radio or television. Except as expressly provided by the BSA, the regulatory regime established by the BSA does not apply to the ABC: subsection 13(5) of the BSA, and section 79 of the ABC Act. II. Scope of the Code The requirements of this Code are set out in the sections dealing with Interpretation and Standards in Part IV and the Associated Standard in Part V. The Standards in Part IV apply to radio and television programs broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air television or radio broadcasting services. The Associated Standard in Part V applies only to television programs broadcast by the ABC on its domestic free-to-air television services. Complaints about content on the services named above fall within the scope of the Code except where: \u00e2\u00a2 the complaint concerns content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings; \u00e2\u00a2 the complaint was frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith; \u00e2\u00a2 the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint, where the complaint alleges a breach of Fair and honest dealing (Standards 5.1-5.8) or Privacy (Standard 6.1). 1 Prohibited content essentially involves content that is classified either as RC (Refused Classification) or X18+. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, detailed instruction in crime, and violence or drug use. 2 Age-restricted content involves content classified as R18+ or MA15+ that is delivered through a mobile device or through a service that provides audio or video content for a fee. This type of content must be subject to a restricted access system, i.e. measures put in place to protect children under the age of 15 from exposure to unsuitable material. This category of content includes material containing strong depictions of nudity, implied sexual activity, drug use or violence, very frequent or very strong coarse language, and other material that is strong in impact. 216 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 \u00e2\u00a2 the complaint was lodged with the ABC more than six weeks after the date when the program was last broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air radio or television services, unless the complaint is accepted for investigation on the grounds that is appropriate to do so, having regard to: - the interests of the complainant in the subject matter of the complaint; - the seriousness of the alleged breach; - the reason(s) for the delay; - the availability of the program content which is the subject of the complaint; and - any prejudice the delay may otherwise have on the ability to investigate and determine the matter fairly. III. Resolved Complaints The ABC seeks to comply fully with the Code and to resolve complaints as soon as practicable. A failure to comply will not be a breach of the Code if the ABC has, prior to the complaint being made to the ACMA, taken steps which were adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances to redress the cause of the complaint. To illustrate, a failure to comply with Standards 2.1 or 2.2 (Accuracy) will not be taken to be a breach of the Code if a correction or clarification, which is adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances, is made prior to or within 30 days of the ABC receiving the complaint. IV. Principles and Standards Preamble The ABC belongs to the Australian people. Earning and retaining their trust is essential to fulfilling the ABC's charter and its responsibilities under the ABC Act to provide innovative and comprehensive services of a high standard to Australian and international audiences. The principles and standards set out below are the means by which the ABC seeks to meet these obligations. They uphold the fundamental journalistic principles of accuracy and impartiality, to protect the ABC's independence and integrity. They recognise that ABC content must be created in a way that is respectful towards audiences and mindful of community standards in areas like harm and offence. At the same time, they recognise that the ABC needs to be adventurous, brave and creative: Adventurous in encouraging new and sometimes confronting forms of art and entertainment. Brave in reporting without fear or favour, even when that might be uncomfortable or unpopular; and Creative in finding new ways of telling Australian stories, reflecting Australian culture and sharing in the Australian conversation. By holding to these principles and standards, the ABC seeks to be accountable to the Australian people who fund us. 1. Interpretation In this Code, the Standards must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Principles applying in each Section. From time to time, the ABC publishes Guidance Notes which do not in themselves impose obligations on the ABC, but which may be relevant in interpreting and applying the Code. The Standards in Parts IV and V are to be interpreted and applied with due regard for the nature of the content under consideration in particular cases. The ABC is conscious that its dual obligations - for accountability and for high quality - can in practice interact in complex ways. It can be a sign of strength not weakness that journalism enrages or art shocks. The Standards are to be applied in ways that maintain independence and integrity, preserve trust and do not unduly constrain journalistic enquiry or artistic expression. Appendices 217 2. Accuracy Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Credibility depends heavily on factual accuracy. Types of fact-based content include news and analysis of current events, documentaries, factual dramas and lifestyle programs. The ABC requires that reasonable efforts must be made to ensure accuracy in all fact-based content. The ABC gauges those efforts by reference to: \u00e2\u00a2 the type, subject and nature of the content; \u00e2\u00a2 the likely audience expectations of the content; \u00e2\u00a2 the likely impact of reliance by the audience on the accuracy of the content; and \u00e2\u00a2 the circumstances in which the content was made and presented. The ABC accuracy standard applies to assertions of fact, not to expressions of opinion. An opinion, being a value judgement or conclusion, cannot be found to be accurate or inaccurate in the way facts can. The accuracy standard requires that opinions be conveyed accurately, in the sense that quotes should be accurate and any editing should not distort the meaning of the opinion expressed. The efforts reasonably required to ensure accuracy will depend on the circumstances. Sources with relevant expertise may be relied on more heavily than those without. Eyewitness testimony usually carries more weight than second-hand accounts. The passage of time or the inaccessibility of locations or sources can affect the standard of verification reasonably required. The ABC should make reasonable efforts, appropriate in the context, to signal to audiences gradations in accuracy, for example by querying interviewees, qualifying bald assertions, supplementing the partly right and correcting the plainly wrong. Standards: 2.1 Make reasonable efforts to ensure that material facts are accurate and presented in context. 2.2 Do not present factual content in a way that will materially mislead the audience. In some cases, this may require appropriate labels or other explanatory information. 3. Corrections and clarifications Principles: A commitment to accuracy includes a willingness to correct errors and clarify ambiguous or otherwise misleading information. Swift correction can reduce harmful reliance on inaccurate information, especially given content can be quickly, widely and permanently disseminated. Corrections and clarifications can contribute to achieving fairness and impartiality. Standards: 3.1 Acknowledge and correct or clarify, in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable: a. significant material errors that are readily apparent or have been demonstrated; or b. information that is likely to significantly and materially mislead. 4. Impartiality and diversity of perspectives Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Aiming to equip audiences to make up their own minds is consistent with the public service character of the ABC. A democratic society depends on diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. A broadcaster operating under statute with public funds is legitimately expected to contribute in ways that may differ from commercial media, which are free to be partial to private interests. 218 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Judgements about whether impartiality was achieved in any given circumstances can vary among individuals according to their personal and subjective view of any given matter of contention. Acknowledging this fact of life does not change the ABC's obligation to apply its impartiality standard as objectively as possible. In doing so, the ABC is guided by these hallmarks of impartiality: \u00e2\u00a2 a balance that follows the evidence; \u00e2\u00a2 fair treatment; \u00e2\u00a2 open-mindedness; and \u00e2\u00a2 opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC aims to present, over time, content that addresses a broad range of subjects from a diversity of perspectives reflecting a diversity of experiences, presented in a diversity of ways from a diversity of sources, including content created by ABC staff, generated by audiences and commissioned or acquired from external content-makers. Impartiality does not require that every perspective receives equal time, nor that every facet of every argument is presented. Assessing the impartiality due in given circumstances requires consideration in context of all relevant factors including: \u00e2\u00a2 the type, subject and nature of the content; \u00e2\u00a2 the circumstances in which the content is made and presented; \u00e2\u00a2 the likely audience expectations of the content; \u00e2\u00a2 the degree to which the matter to which the content relates is contentious; \u00e2\u00a2 the range of principal relevant perspectives on the matter of contention; and \u00e2\u00a2 the timeframe within which it would be appropriate for the ABC to provide opportunities for the principal relevant perspectives to be expressed, having regard to the public importance of the matter of contention and the extent to which it is the subject of current debate. Standards: 4.1 Gather and present news and information with due impartiality. 4.2 Present a diversity of perspectives so that, over time, no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented. 4.3 Do not state or imply that any perspective is the editorial opinion of the ABC. The ABC takes no editorial stance other than its commitment to fundamental democratic principles including the rule of law, freedom of speech and religion, parliamentary democracy and equality of opportunity. 4.4 Do not misrepresent any perspective. 4.5 Do not unduly favour one perspective over another. 5. Fair and honest dealing Principles: Fair and honest dealing is essential to maintaining trust with audiences and with those who participate in or are otherwise directly affected by ABC content. In rare circumstances, deception or a breach of an undertaking may be justified. Because of the potential damage to trust, deception or breach of an undertaking must be explained openly afterwards unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. Standards: Dealing with participants 5.1 Participants in ABC content should normally be informed of the general nature of their participation. 5.2 A refusal to participate will not be overridden without good cause. Opportunity to respond 5.3 Where allegations are made about a person or organisation, make reasonable efforts in the circumstances to provide a fair opportunity to respond. Appendices 219 Attribution and sources 5.4 Aim to attribute information to its source. 5.5 Where a source seeks anonymity, do not agree without first considering the source's motive and any alternative attributable sources. 5.6 Do not misrepresent another's work as your own. Undertakings 5.7 Assurances given in relation to conditions of participation, use of content, confidentiality or anonymity must be honoured except in rare cases where justified in the public interest. Secret recording and other types of deception 5.8 Secret recording, misrepresentation or other types of deception must not be used by the ABC or its co-production partners to obtain or seek information, audio, pictures or an agreement to participate except where: (a) justified in the public interest and the material cannot reasonably be obtained by any other means; or (b) consent is obtained from the subject or identities are effectively obscured; or (c) the deception is integral to an artistic work. In cases, the potential for harm must be taken into consideration. 6. Privacy Principles: Privacy is necessary to human dignity and every person reasonably expects that their privacy will be respected. But privacy is not absolute. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression. Standards: 6.1 Intrusion into a person's private life without consent must be justified in the public interest and the extent of the intrusion must be limited to what is proportionate in the circumstances. 7. Harm and offence Principles: The ABC broadcasts comprehensive and innovative content that aims to inform, entertain and educate diverse audiences. This involves a willingness to take risks, invent and experiment with new ideas. It can result in challenging content which may offend some of the audience some of the time. But it also contributes to diversity of content in the media and to fulfilling the ABC's function to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts. The ABC acknowledges that a public broadcaster should never gratuitously harm or offend and accordingly any content which is likely to harm or offend must have a clear editorial purpose. The ABC potentially reaches the whole community, so it must take into account community standards. However, the community recognises that what is and is not acceptable in ABC content largely depends upon the particular context, including the nature of the content, its target audience, and any signposting that equips audiences to make informed choices about what they see, hear or read. Applying the harm and offence standard, therefore, requires careful judgement. What may be inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Coarse language, disturbing images or unconventional situations may form a legitimate part of reportage, debate, documentaries or a humorous, satirical, dramatic or other artistic work. Standards: 7.1 Content that is likely to cause harm or offence must be justified by the editorial context. 7.2 Where content is likely to cause harm or offence, having regard to the context, make reasonable efforts to provide information about the nature of the content through the use of classification labels or other warnings or advice. 220 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. 7.4 If inadvertent or unexpected actions, audio or images in live content are likely to cause harm or offence, take appropriate steps to mitigate. 7.5 The reporting or depiction of violence, tragedy or trauma must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Avoid causing undue distress to victims, witnesses or bereaved relatives. Be sensitive to significant cultural practices when depicting or reporting on recently deceased persons. 7.6 Where there is editorial justification for content which may lead to dangerous imitation or exacerbate serious threats to individual or public health, safety or welfare, take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, particularly by taking care with how content is expressed or presented. 7.7 Avoid the unjustified use of stereotypes or discriminatory content that could reasonably be interpreted as condoning or encouraging prejudice. 8. Children and young people Principles: The ABC aims to provide children and young people (under the age of 18) with enjoyable and enriching content, as well as opportunities for them to express themselves. Children and young people participate and interact with the ABC in various ways - as actors, presenters, interviewees, subjects, content makers and audience members. The ABC has a responsibility to protect children and young people from potential harm that might arise during their engagement with the ABC and its content. The ABC shares this responsibility with parents/guardians and with the child or young person him/herself. In particular, the ABC recommends that parents/ guardians supervise children and young people's access to content, their participation in interactive services, and their exposure to news and current affairs. It is not always possible to avoid presenting content that may be distressing to some audience members. Standards: 8.1 Take due care over the dignity and physical and emotional welfare of children and young people who are involved in making, participating in and presenting content produced or commissioned by the ABC. 8.2 Before significant participation of a child or young person in content produced or commissioned by the ABC, or in interactive services offered by the ABC, consider whether it is appropriate to obtain the consent of both the child/young person and the parent/guardian. 8.3 Adopt appropriate measures wherever practicable to enable children and young people, or those who supervise them, to manage risks associated with the child/ young person's participation with, use of and exposure to ABC content and services designed for them. 8.4 Take particular care to minimise risks of exposure to unsuitable content or inappropriate contact by peers or strangers. V. Associated Standard: Television Program Classification Status of Associated Standard This Associated Standard is approved by the ABC Board and is binding. It is for consideration by relevant editorial decision-makers when providing advice on compliance and by complaints bodies when dealing with complaints. The Associated Standard is provided to assist interpretation of or otherwise supplement the standard in the Editorial Policies to which the Associated Standard relates. Appendices 221 This Associated Standard forms part of the Code of Practice notified to the Australian Communications and Media Authority under section 8(1)(e) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. Key Editorial Standard 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. Principles: The ABC applies the classifications listed below to the broadcast of all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are adapted from the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Classification Board made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The guiding principle in the application of the following classifications is context. What is inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Factors to be taken into account include: the artistic or educational merit of the production, the purpose of a sequence, the tone, the camera work, the intensity and relevance of the material, the treatment, and the intended audience. Standards: 7.3.1 Television Classifications G - GENERAL G programs may be shown at any time. G programs, which include programs designed for pre-school and school-aged children, are suitable for children to watch on their own. Some G programs may be more appropriate for older children. The G classification does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or storylines that are not of interest to children. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: \u00e2\u00a2 have a light tone, or \u00e2\u00a2 have a very low sense of threat or menace, and \u00e2\u00a2 be infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be gratuitous. Sex: Sexual activity should: \u00e2\u00a2 only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and \u00e2\u00a2 be infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be gratuitous. Artistic or cultural depictions of nudity in a sexual context may be permitted if the treatment is discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. Language: Coarse language should: \u00e2\u00a2 be very mild and infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. 222 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: \u00e2\u00a2 infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 not detailed, and \u00e2\u00a2 not gratuitous. PG - PARENTAL GUIDANCE (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, PG programs may be shown in accordance with Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: \u00e2\u00a2 mild in impact, and \u00e2\u00a2 not shown in detail. Sex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: \u00e2\u00a2 be discreet, and \u00e2\u00a2 be infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent. Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous. M - MATURE (Recommended for people aged 15 years and over) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, M programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category - the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be strong. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: \u00e2\u00a2 not contain a lot of detail, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: \u00e2\u00a2 be infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 not have a strong impact, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be gratuitous. Appendices 223 In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: \u00e2\u00a2 discreet and infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: \u00e2\u00a2 be infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA15+ - MATURE AUDIENCE (Not suitable for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, MA15+ programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years. Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category - the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should not be gratuitous. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact. In realistic treatments, detailed depictions of violence with a strong impact should: \u00e2\u00a2 be infrequent, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be prolonged, and \u00e2\u00a2 not be gratuitous. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Depictions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or exploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown but should not be promoted or encouraged. More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context. 7.3.2 Implementation Guidelines The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time zones. 224 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Possible reasons might include, for example, the need to schedule programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, in timeslots most suitable for their target audiences. Programs, including those having a particular classification under the Classification Board's Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games, may be modified so that they are suitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Broken Hill in New South Wales shares a time zone with South Australia but ordinarily receives the ABC's New South Wales TV services. Given the time zone difference, some programs are broadcast outside their classification time zone. 7.3.3 Television Classification Symbols The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the promotion. 7.3.4 Consumer Advice Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program. 7.3.5 Classification of Live Content Many live programs fall into the classification exemption categories (news, current affairs and sporting events). Some, such as live music or comedy programs, do not fall into the exemption categories and pose a particular challenge to classify accurately. The ABC makes reasonable efforts to classify these programs accurately by reviewing scripts, lyrics, outlines, and any pre-recorded material, and briefing program makers and talent as required. A failure to provide an accurate classification symbol or consumer advice prior to a live (or as-live) program will not be regarded as a breach of standards as long as reasonable efforts were made to classify it and appropriate steps are taken to mitigate any harm or offence.

Commonwealth entities are required to present remuneration for key management personnel, senior executives and other highly paid staff, as defined in the PGPA Rule. Key management personnel Key management personnel (KMP) are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity. The Corporation determined KMP as the members of the Board, the Managing Director, Content Team Directors and the Chief Financial Officer. Senior executives Senior executives are employees employed in a position equivalent to classification Groups 9 to 11 of the table in Schedule 1 to the Public Service Classification Rules 2000. The Corporation determined senior executives as executive directors who are not KMP (Senior Executives). Other highly paid staff Other highly paid staff are employees who are neither KMP nor senior executive and whose total remuneration paid during the year exceeded $220,000 (Other Highly Paid Staff). Total remuneration Total remuneration is defined in the PGPA rule as the sum of the following (calculated on an accrual basis): a) base salary b) performance pay and bonuses c) other benefits and allowances d) superannuation contributions (made by the employer) e) long service leave f) other long-term benefits g) termination benefits. Executive and employee remuneration policy At the core of the ABC's approach to remuneration is a need to ensure the Corporation can realise its strategic priorities through an ability to attract and retain employees who deliver on its priorities and deliver value for audiences into the future. On the next page is ABC's approach to remuneration for Executive Key Management Personnel, Senior Executives and Other Highly Paid Staff for the year ended 30 June 2019. Appendices 229 Remuneration principles Remuneration framework Equitable We ensure our remuneration approach is consistent and equitable Market competitive We attract and retain the best talent to meet our current and future workforce needs Performance aligned We recognise and reward for contribution to performance goals and targets Transparent We have a transparent and disciplined approach to managing remuneration decisions and costs Fixed remuneration At risk remuneration Element Fixed remuneration comprises base salary, superannuation and benefits. Executive KMP, Senior Executives and some Other Highly Paid Staff are eligible to receive an at risk payment for the achievement of performance targets. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal), consented to the removal of at risk pay for the Managing Director (MD) from 1 June 2018. Performance Reviewed annually to reflect the experience, competence and contribution of individuals whilst remaining conservatively competitive against the market. For Executive KMP and Senior Executives, half of the at risk opportunity is linked to ABC corporate objectives and half is linked to individual objectives. Some Other Highly Paid Staff are eligible to receive an at risk payment for the achievement of performance targets, some are eligible to be paid a performance bonus in accordance with the terms in the Senior Employment Agreement 2015 and some are eligible to be paid a bonus in accordance with the ABC Enterprise Agreement 2016-19. Alignment Attracts and retains the best talent to meet ABC's strategic priorities. Varies annual remuneration up or down to reflect contribution, aligned with ABC's strategic priorities. Target remuneration mix Executive KMP (excluding MD) and Senior Executives Eligible Other Highly Paid Staff Fixed remuneration At risk remuneration 83-93% 87-98% 7-17% 2-13% 230 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Remuneration governance All Executive KMP, Senior Executives and Other Highly Paid Staff are employees of the ABC. Remuneration and other terms of employment are formalised as follows: \u00e2\u00a2 Executive KMP and Senior Executives (Executives): Individual employment agreement. \u00e2\u00a2 Other Highly Paid Staff: Individual employment agreement or engaged through either the ABC Senior Employment Agreement 2015 or the ABC Enterprise Agreement 2016-19. During the year ended 30 June 2019, ABC's People & Remuneration Committee (PRC) assisted the Board in fulfilling its governance responsibilities in relation to remuneration. Outlined below is the ABC's approach for setting, monitoring and approving remuneration policy and amounts. Note that the Managing Director's (MD) remuneration arrangements, including the MD's annual total remuneration amount, are set by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal). The PRC was dissolved by a resolution of the Board in April 2019. Beyond this date, matters considered by the PRC will be considered by the full Board. The responsibilities of the Risk & Audit Committee now include review of remuneration policies and practices for recommendation to the Board. MD \u00e2\u00a2 Recommend Executive KPIs \u00e2\u00a2 Evaluate and provide recommendations regarding Executive performance assessments and remuneration outcomes \u00e2\u00a2 Approve performance assessments and remuneration outcomes for Other Highly Paid Staff, as recommended by ABC's managers PRC \u00e2\u00a2 Review MD's proposals regarding staff \u00e2\u00a2 Approve Executive remuneration policies and practices with respect to individual remuneration arrangements, KPIs, performance assessments and remuneration outcomes \u00e2\u00a2 Provide recommendations regarding MD KPIs and performance assessments against those targets ABC Board \u00e2\u00a2 Review and approve recommendations referred by the PRC Appendices 231 Non-executive director (NED) remuneration All ABC NEDs are appointed by the Commonwealth of Australia through the Shareholder Ministers. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory body overseeing the remuneration of key Commonwealth offices, determines fees for all ABC NEDs. ABC is required to comply with the Tribunal's determinations and plays no role in the consideration or determination of NED fees. The Tribunal sets annual Chair, Deputy Chair and Board Member fees (exclusive of statutory superannuation contributions) which are inclusive of all activities undertaken by NEDs on behalf of ABC (i.e., inclusive of Committee participation).
