Chakhtoura M, Akl E A, Arabi A, El Ghandour S, Shawwa K, El Hajj Fuleihan G. Abstract : Background : Countries in t he Middle East and North Africa (MENA) register some of lowest vitamin D levels worldwide. Yet, t he optimal dose of vitamin D re quired to reach desirable serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in populations from this region is un known. Objectives : The main objective is to define the mean 25(OH)D level reached with low (<800IU ), moderate (800 -2,000IU) or high ( >2,000 IU) daily dose of vitamin D in subjects in the MENA countries, by age and reproductive status . We will also deduc e the mean serum 25(O H)D level reached by 97.5% of individuals in above treatment groups , as well as the p roportion of subjects who reach a mean 25(OH) D level 20 ng/ml in the three above treatment groups . Other outcomes investigated are fracture rate, fall and imbalance r ate, kidney stones rate, hypercalcemia -hypercalciuria, hyperparathyroidism, metabolic parameters (diabetes and lipids), bone mineral density, muscle strength, mortality. Materials and methods: Data sources : A search for English and Non -English articles will be done using M edline, PubMed, the Coch rane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE, Poplin e and Index Medicus and Global Health Library without any time restriction. We will also search ClinicalTrial.gov and the WHO I nternational Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) to try to retrieve unpublished or preliminary data by directly contacting the authors. In addition, references listed in recently published r eviews will be screened . Vitamin D experts will be also contacted. Study selection : Only randomized c ontrolled trials of oral vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol) with or without calcium supplementation , versus calcium supplementation or placebo , or those comparing different doses of vitamin D, conducted on community dwelling individuals in MENA countries , will be included. Data Extraction: Duplicate and i ndependent data extraction will be done using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators . Discrepancies will be solved by discussion, and when unsuccessful by an expert author. Risk of bias: Risk of b ias assessment will be done on all included studies, by 2 reviewers in duplicate and independently , using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool 2011 . Summary measures: Continuous outcomes will be expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence i nterval (CI). Dichotomous outcomes will be expressed as risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. Primary analysis and additional analysis : The primary analysis will be done using a random -effects model. Additional pre -specified subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will be done according to gender, type of vitamin D (D2 or D3), vitamin D assay, use or not of calcium supplementation and BMI. Sensit ivity analysis, if applicable , will be done, restricting the analysis to published trials, MENA individuals living in MENA countries exclusively and trials with mean baseline 25(OH)D 20ng/ml . Risk of bias across the studies: Publication bias and bias due to selective outcome reporting will be assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's test . Effects of Different Doses of Vitamin D Replacement in Middle Eastern and North African Population: a Systematic Review and Meta -analysis. INTRODUCTION : Hypo vitaminosis D is a worldwide problem (1, 2). Low 25(OH)D levels , defined as <20ng/ml, are prevalent in developing countries, especially in the Middle East, South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa (2, 3). In the Middle East and North Afr ica (MENA) region , in addition to advancing age and female gender, similar to other countries, specific risk factors in adults includ e multiparity, clothing style, season, socio - economic status and urban living (4). Prolonged breast feeding without adequate supplementation is a major predictor of hypovitaminosis D in infants (4). Vitamin D can be supplemented as ergocalciferol (D2) o r cholecalciferol (D3). They differ by the composition of their side chain and may differ slightly in their effect on vitamin D status ; the superiority of D3 in raising serum 25(OH)D levels , compared to D2 , has been d emonstrated in a recent meta - analysis by Tripkovic et al . (5). Enteral and parenteral preparations are available. The data on the difference between various dosing regimens on efficacy and safety is inconclusive (6-8). In one study comparing d aily, weekly and monthly dosing frequencies in elderly following hip fracture , all doses have shown to be equally effective (9). Vitamin D receptors are widespread in different tissue s, explaining the different physiologic effects of vitamin D beyond the skeleton (10). Observational studies have associated hypovitaminosis D with increased risk of infections, cancer , auto -immune and cardio -vascular diseases (11). Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that vitamin D supplementation improve s multiple skeletal and possibly non-skeletal outcomes , including in adults a protective effect of vitamin D against falls (12) and fractures (13) and maybe decreased overall mortality (14), and in children improvement in BMD (15). The latest Institute of Medi cine (IOM) and Endocrine Society (ES) respective guidelines on vitamin D replacement in the general population, in 2010, were based on a systematic review of literature and defined the dietary requirements of vitamin D based on mineral and skeletal outcome s (16, 17). They did not target specifically MENA countries where 25(OH)D levels are lower compared to Western population (2). Furthermore, the ES guidelines have collected a wealth of RCTs conducted in each age category but suggested to use higher doses to reach their target of 25(OH)D level 30 ng/ml (16); doses that have been infrequently used in RCTs . IOM and ES differ in their recommendations in terms of target populations and desirable levels as well as other criteria used , and these are detailed in Appendices 1 and 2. A previous systematic review by Autier et al . in 2012, assessed the influence of vitamin D supplemen tation on 25(OH)D level (18). However, this revi ew targeted Caucasian population and only individuals above age 50 years ; In addition, the authors did not systematically assess the risk of bias of the included trials . Similarly, Cashman et al . conduct ed a systematic review and meta -regression analysis of RCTs of vitamin D intake in 2011 to help define dietary intake recommendations in Europe. This review was limited to trials conducted in winter (minimal sun exposure) , at latitudes higher than 40\u00b0S or 40\u00b0N and using vitamin D doses 2000 IU per day only and published before September 2007 (19). Another review that included all RCTs that used high doses of vitamin D revealed that these were exclusively conducted in Caucasian subjects in western societies (11). Finally, a more recent meta - analysis, using the meta -regression method, found that higher increases in serum 25(OH)D occur with increasing age (>80 years), vitamin D dose (>800 IU daily), duration (>6 months) and decreasing baseline level (<50 nmol/l) (20). Four recent met a-analys es failed to show a significant protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on multiple skeletal (adult BMD, hip fractures) and non -skeletal clinical outcomes (cancer, cardiovascular , diabetes and overall mortality) (21-24). However, these studies have multiple limitations . First, the change in 25(OH)D levels have not been consistently documented in the included trials, and if so, the mean 25(OH)D level achieved was between 50 and 70 nmol/l, implying that 50% of the study population reached levels that were below the above cut -offs and this may explain the absence of beneficial effect of vitamin D on various outcomes . Second, the duration of the studies may not have been long enough to allow for the beneficial effect s of vitamin D supplementation to manifest (24). Third , some of the trials included in the se meta -analyses (19, 22) used infrequent dosing (every 3, 6 or 12 months) with high dose of vitamin D supplementation ; regimens that might not maintain steady 25(OH)D level s for the study duration (25). Interestingly , the stud y by Sanders et al ., in a 3.5 years trial, revealed an increase in hip fracture risk using a single high dose of 500,000 IU once , higher risk in the first 3 months following the yearly dose administration (26). Conversely, an individual participant -level data meta - analysis revealed that vitamin D intake 800 -2000 IU/day decreased the risk of both hip and vertebral fractures (13). This review addresses the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D level in MENA population across all life cycle . It tries to evaluat e the applicability of the IOM Recommended Daily Allowance ( RDA ) to subjects from MENA countries. The RDA for vitamin D, is by definition the vitamin D dose that would allow to 97.5% of participants to reach a desirable 25(OH)D level 20 ng/ml. The latter is a conservative desirable 25(OH)D level defined by IOM as one that has a beneficial effect on mineral metabolism at the population level. 2-OBJECTIVES : The main objective is to define the mean 25(OH)D level reached with low (< 800IU), moderate (800 - 2,000IU) or high (>2,000 IU) daily dose of vitamin D in subjects in the MENA countries, by age and reproductive status. We will also deduce the mean serum 25(OH)D level reached by 97.5% of individuals in above treatment groups, as well as the proportion of subjects who reach a mean 25(OH) D level 20 ng/ml in the three above treatment groups. This would allow validation of the applicability of the IOM to subjects in MENA countries. Other outcomes investigated are fracture rate, fa ll and imbalance rate, kidney stones rate, hypercalcemia -hypercalciuria, hyperparathyroidism, metabolic parameters (diabetes and lipids), bone mineral density, muscle strength, mortality . 3-METHODS I-Eligibility criteria : a- Type -RCTs -English and Non -English articles. -Published and unpublished data. We will try to get access to unpublished data of studies identified on trials registry through contact of authors. -No publication date restriction . -Exclusion criteria : -Prospective interventional studies that are not randomized . -Studies that did not report pre or post intervention 25(OH)D level . In such a case, first we will try to contact the authors to get information about 25(OH)D level; If such information would n ot be available or we would not get any reply, the study will be excluded. b- Type of participants: -Inclusion criteria: -Middle East and North Africa including the following countries: Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Palestine/Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Kuwait, Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, United Arab Emirates. -Apparently healthy, c ommunity dwelling individuals. -Healthy individuals given vitamin D as a preventive measure of certain diseases or individuals with mild diseases that have no reason to have altered vitamin D metabolism . -Both sexes . criteria : -Rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults characterized by low 25(OH)D , below 15 ng/ml with evidence of laborator y and radiologic abnormalities, as these individuals require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation (higher than the doses recommended for the general population) . -Institutionalized and hospitalized individuals ; this would only apply to elderly and their needs are different . Public health guidelines should target the general population , not this unique subgroup . -Individuals with chronic illnesses (chronic kidney disease (GFR 30 ml/min) , chronic advanced liver disease, heart failure (NYHA class 3) -Individuals with conditions or on drug therapy that might affect vitam in D metabolism and vitamin D binding prot ein /metabolism (anticon vulsants, steroids, anti -Vitamin D (D2 or D3) supplementation of any dose, given orally, daily, weekly or monthly , with or without c alcium supplementation . -Exclusion criteria: that used synthetic or vitamin D supplementation , as this type of supplementation is not recommended for the general population (16, 17). -Studies that used vitamin D supplementation given intra -muscularly as the intra - muscular preparations have a mor e delayed peak in 25(OH)D level that can occur at 120 days (27). -Studies that gave vitamin D supplementation for less than 3 months since 25(OH)D has a half -life of 2 weeks and at least 10 weeks are needed to reach a steady state (28). -Studies that gave vitamin D supplementation spaced more than 1 month , given that 25(OH) D levels cannot be maintained with infrequent dosing (at intervals more than one month ) (25, 29). -Studies that used vitamin D supplementation as fortified food as the amount of vitamin cannot be defined accurately (30). d- Outcome measures : -Primary outcome measures : Mean difference in s erum 25(OH) D level reached and proportion of individuals who reach a 25(OH)D level 20 ng/ml between any two treatment arms , be it between vitamin D groups themselves (high dose versus low dose , high v ersus moderate dose , moderate dose versus low dose ), or vitamin D groups and pla cebo , in each age category and reproductive status . -Secondary outcome measures : Comparing between the different treatment groups and in each age category : -Incidence of hypercalciuria/hypercalcemia . -Incidence of kidney stones . -Incidence of hip fracture. -Incidence of fall and imbalance. -Serum calcium level . -Urinary calcium level . -Serum . -Serum . -Bone mineral s parameters . -All m ortality. -Other adverse events (other than hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, kidney stones, if present) . II-Information sources and search : Studies will be identified by searching electronic databases using the relevant Mesh Terms and keywords related to Vitamin D, MENA and RCTs . The searc h will be applied to Medline (1946 till present ), Embase , PubMed and Cochrane Library without time or language limitation . For full details of search strategy, see A ppendix 3. Similarly, the search will be done in Poplin e, Index Medicus and Global Health and i n trials registries , ClinicalTrial.gov . and the WHO international C linical Trials Registry (ICTRP) . The references lists of all systematic reviews of RCTs that were published in the last 10 years will be screened. Experts in the field , involved in International vitamin D guidelines , Professors Paul Lips, Michael Holick and Roger Bouillon , will be contacted to enquire about any trial that could be relevant to our review and that would not have been caught by our search. III-Study selection: References retrieved in the search strategies will be reviewed in duplicate and independently by reviewers . One reviewer (MC) will screen all references. Two other reviewers (SG and KS) will partake references screening and each one of them will screen half of the references . After exclusion of duplicates (duplicates retrieved from different databases (using endnote library) and duplicate reporting using manual check ), screening of abstracts will be done based on our PICO question. We will retrie ve the full text of citations included by at least one reviewer. Full text s of retrieved articles will be screened in duplicate and independent manner , using a standardized scr eening form . A calibration exercise will be done on a sample of abstract s and full text s to make sure screening by reviewers abides by the standardized forms. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with an expert author (GEHF) . IV-Data collectio n process: We will develop a priori a data collection form. It will be pilot tested on 4 randomly included articles and refined accordingly. Data extraction will be done in duplicate and independently. One review author (MC) will extract relevant data from all included studied. Two other review authors (SG and KS), independently, will partake data extraction of included studies whereby every one of them will extract data from half of the included studies. Disagreement between reviewers will be resolve d by discussion; if disagreement will not be reached, a n expert author (GEHF) will intervene to make a decision. In case of missing data, authors will be contacted by email. In case of Non -English articles, translation into English will be implemented. Figure 1. shows the flow diagram of the systematic revie w. V-Data items: Information will be extracted from each trial on the following characteristics : -Characteristics of study participants , per each treatment arm : -Country of origin . -Age. -Sex. -Ethnicity . -Presence or -Mean 25(OH)D level ELISA, LCMS, HPLC, etc..) Laboratory quality -Characteristics alcium administration . -Comparator used Placebo Vitamin D: Type, Dose, frequency, vehicle, presence or absence of concomitant calcium supplementation . -Characteristics of outcome measure , per each treatment arm : -Proportion of individuals who reach 25(OH)D 20 ng/ml and m ean 25(OH)D level at the end of the stu dy. -Mean serum calcium , PTH, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, HDL, LDL, TG level s and mean urinary calcium level. -Muscle strength and other muscle parameters (handgrip strength, jump height ... ). of kidney episodes. -Mortality . -Other adverse events . VI-Risk of bias in individual studies: The risk of bias of each individual study will be assessed by two reviewers in duplicate and independently , using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool (Cochrane Handbook 2011) . The risk of bias will be assessed at the level of seven domains: adequacy of randomization, concealment of allocation, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assess ors, extent of loss to follow -up (incomplete outcome data), selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. For each domain, judgment will be done qualitatively, answered as yes/no/unclear, based on answering a specific question , and as described i n the Cochrane Handbook . An answer \"yes\" indicates a low risk of bias. An answer \"No\" indicates a high risk of bias. \"Unclear\" judgment is made when the risk of bias in unknown. A calibration exercise will be done to ensure adequate assessment by diffe rent reviewers. VII-Summary measures: Continuous outcomes will be expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Dichotomous outcomes will be expressed as risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. Our primary outcome is the mean difference in 25(OH)D level reached between any two treatment arms (placebo versus high dose , placebo versus low dose , placebo versus moderate dose , low dose versus high dose , low dose versus moderate dose and moderate dose versus high dose ), and in each age category (infants 0 -1 year, children and adolescents 1 -18 years, adults 18 -65 years, elderly > 65 years ) and in pregnant women. We will determine also t he proportion of individuals who reach a 25(OH)D level 20 ng/ml and the mean 25(OH)D level reached by 97.5% of individuals in different treatment groups. We will calculate the RR and 95% confidence interval (CI) of hip fracture, kidney stones, hypercalcemia /hypercalciuria , falls and imbalance episodes, mortality and other adverse events in vitamin D groups compared to placebo , or in different vitamin D groups. We will calculate the mean difference in serum calcium and PTH , fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, HDL, LDL, and TG level, urinary calcium level , muscle strength and BMD in vitamin D g roups compared to placebo groups or in different vitamin D group s. For mortality, if available information, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI will be calculated. Quantitative analysis will be done on an intention to treat analysis. IX-Planned methods of anal ysis: A meta -analysis will be done when at least 2 studies are available for each comparison, in each age category . If at least 10 studies will be retrieved for each age category, a meta -regression will be used to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation dose, in addition to other covariates (type of vitamin D (D2 vs D3), duration of the intervention , gender, baseline 25(OH)D level BMI) on serum 25(OH)D level . The primary analy sis will be done using a random -effects model. To te st the robustness of our results, a fixed effect model will be used also. Assessment of heterogeneity: Statistical heterogeneity between studies will be assessed using Chi square with significance at p -value 0.1. The quantitative assessment of heterogene ity will be done using I2. In case of heterogeneity, pre -specified sub -group analysis will be done. X-Risk of bias across studies: The risk of bias will be assessed for the included studies: -Publication bias will be assessed by doing a funnel plot of included studies. For each trial , we will plot the effect by the inverse of its standard error .. The symmetry of the funnel plot will be checked visually and formally with Egger's test. -Selective outcome reporting will be assessed by looking for the availability of a published protocol for each included study. Otherwise, the methods w ill be explored and the reported pre -planned outcomes will be compared with the outcomes cited in the results. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool (Cochrane Handbook 2011) for bias assessment will be used to make our judgmen t. XI-Additional analysis: Subgroup analys es are pre-specified. In case of heterogeneity in results, subgroup analysis will be done, based on covariates that we expect them to affect the response to vitamin D supplementation and 25(OH)D level, as follows: -Vitamin D assays, well known to affect 25(OH)D level (31, 32). -Type of vitamin D, D2 vs D3, since D2 may raise 25(OH)D to a lesser extent compared to D3 (5). -Presence or absence of concomitant calcium supplementation, as side effects secondary to calcium might reduce compliance, as well as a direct effect on 25(OH)D level, reflecti ng decreased 25(OH)D metabolism (33, 34). -Gender, universal confoun der (18, 19). -Obesity as BMI might be one of the predictors of circulating 25(OH)D level (34). Sensitivity analysis will be performed in order to assess the effect of relevant factors on the effect measure, if appl icable, as follows: -restricting the analysis to published trials only. -restricting the analysis to MENA individuals living in MENA countries exclusively -restricting the analysis to studies with baseline 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L, since lower baseline vitamin D levels respond more to vitamin D supplementation (20, 35) References: 1.
