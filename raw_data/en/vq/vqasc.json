The Atharva Veda contains n ot only the magic s pells and the occult scienc es bu t also the Ayurveda that deals with the diseas es, injuries, f ertility, sanity and health. Ayurveda incorp orates all forms o f lifestyle in therapy. Thus yoga, ar oma, meditation, ge ms, amulets, herbs, d iet, astr ology, color and surgery etc. are used in a comprehensive manner in treating patients . Treating im portant a nd sensitive spots on the body called Marmas is described in Ayurveda . Massages, exerc ises and yoga are rec ommended. Histor y The knowledge we have n ow is by thr ee surviving texts of Charaka , Sushrut a and a Samhita me aning collectio n of verses written in Sanskrit). S ushru ta (4th century A.D.) wrote his Sa i.e ta Samhita. Vaghbata (5th c entury A.D.) co mpile d the third se t of major texts c alled Ashtanga Hriday a and Ashtanga Sangraha. Charak a's School o f Physicians a nd Sushrut a's School o f Surgeons became the basis o f Ayurveda and helped orga nize an d syste matic ally classi fy into bra nches of medicine and surgery. Sixteen major su pplements (Ni ghantus) were wr itten in the Dhanvan tari Bahavaprak asha, Raja and Shalig rama to name a few - that helped re fine the prac tice o f Ayurveda . New drugs were ad ded and ineffective on es were disc arded. Expa nsion of applicatio n, identification of new illnesses a nd finding subs titute treatments se emed to have been an evolving process. Close t o 2000 plants that were us ed in healing diseases a nd abating sympt oms were id entified in these s upplem ents. Dridhabala i n the 4th century rev ised the Ch araka Samhita. The texts o f amhita were revised a nd supplemented by Nagarjuna in the 6th century . There develo ped eight br anches/divisions o Shalakya treatment of head and neck, Ophthalm ology and ear, nose, throat) 3. Shalya Tantra b hritya (P ediatrics) 7. Rasayan a (science of rejuvenation or anti-ageing) 8. Vajikaran a (the scie nce o f fertility and aphrodisiac) Many modern medicati ons were derived f rom plants allu ded to in Ayurveda texts. The oft-cited exam ple is t hat of Rauwolfi a serp entina t hat was used to treat headache, anxiety and snakebit e. Its derivative is used in tr eating blood press ure today. Two areas of contributi on of Indian physicians were in treating snakebite and prevention of small pox. Det ailed a ccount of steps to be followed a fter a poisonous sn ake bi te including applicatio n of tourniquet and lancing the site by c onnecting th e two f ang marks and sucking the poison out is d escribe d. A decoctio n of the medicinal pl ant R auwolfi a serp entina is n ext applied to the wound . A form of vaccinatio n for small pox was commonly practic ed in India lo ng before the West discovered the me thod. A small d ose of pus from the pustule o f small pox lesio n was inoculated to develop resist ance. Chara ka Samhita Charak a was said t o have be en in the court of the Kushana king, Kanishka during th e 1st century A. D. Some authors date him as far back as the 6th century B.C. d uring Buddha perio d. The sacred tr ust b etween physic ian and patient was held in high e steem by Charaka and patient confidentiality , similar to the Hipp ocratic O ath, was deemed the proper co nduct for a practicing physician. C haraka also told us that the word Ayurveda was derived f rom Ayus, meaning life and Veda meaning knowledge. Neverthel ess, acc ording to Charak a the word Ayus denotes m ore than jus t life. Ayus de notes a combinati on of the body, sens e organs , mind and soul. The principles o f treatment in Charak a's teachings to ok a holistic a pproach that treated not just t he symptoms o f the diseas e but the body, mind and soul as single e ntity. Com piled by Ch araka i n the form of discussions and symp osiums held by many scholars, Charak a Samhita is t he most ancient and authoritati ve text th at has survived. Written in Sanskrit in verse f orm, it has 8400 metrical ve rses. The Samhita deals m ainly with the diagn osis and treatment of dise ase process through int ernal a nd extern al applicatio n of medicine . Called Kaya-chikitsa (int ernal m edicine), it aims at treating both the body an d the spirit an d to strike a balance b etwee n the two. F ollowing diagnosis, a series o f methods to purify both the body and spirit with purgation and detoxificatio n, bloodletti ng and emesis a s well as e nema (known as Pancha-karma) ar e utilized. The emphasis s eems to be to tackle diseases i n the early phase or in a preven tative ma nner be fore the first symp toms appear. Ayurvedic diagn osis and treatment is tra dition ally divided into eight branches (stha nas) b ased on the approach of a physician towards a disease pr ocess. Charak a described them thus: 1. Sutra-sthana - Nidan 3. Vimana-st han- diagnos tics 4. Sharira-sthana - physiology and anatomy 5. Indriya-sthana - pr ognosis 6. Chikitsa-sth ana - therapeutics 7. Kalpa-sth ana - pharmaceu tics 8. Siddhi-sthana - success ful tre atment. Detailed a ccou nts o f various m ethods of diagn osis, st udy of various st ages o f symptoms a nd the comprehensive m anagem ent and treatment of debilita ting diseas es like di abetes mellit us, tuberculosis, asthma and arthritic co nditio ns ar e to be found in the Charak a Samhita. There is even a detailed acc ount of fetal develop ment in the mother's womb, which can rival descriptions o f modern medical t extbooks . Charak a als o wrote details a bout building a h ospital. A good hospital should b e loc ated in a breezy spot free of smoke and objectionable s mells a nd noises. Even the equip ment needed includi ng the brooms a nd brus hes a re detailed. The personnel should b e cle an and wel l behaved . Det ails about the roo ms, c ooking ar ea and the priv ies a re given. Conversatio n, recitati ons a nd entertainm ent of the patient were en couraged and said t o aid in healing the ailing patient. Sushruta Samhita Sushruta was a surgeon in the Gu pta courts in t he 4th century A.D. Though Indian classics is full of accounts o f healing thr ough tr anspl antation of head and lim bs as well as eye b alls, Sushruta Samhita is t he first authentic t ext to describ e me thodology of plastic s urgery, cosmetic a nd pros thetic surger y, Ces arean sec tion a nd setting of compound fractures. Sushruta had in his p ossessi on an armamentarium of 125 surgical ins truments made of stone, metal and wood. Forceps , scalp troc eedles a nd scissors we all available t o the surgeon . Rhin oplasty (plastic s urgery of the nose) was fi rst presented to the world m edical community by Su shrut a in his Sa mhita, where a detailed method of transpositio n of a forehead flap to rec onstruc t a severed nose is given. S evered noses were co mmon form of punishment. Torn ear lobes also were c ommon due to heavy jewelry worn on ear lobes . Sushrut a describe d a m ethod of repair of the torn ear lobes. Fitti ng of prost hetics f or severed limbs were als o commonly performed feats.Sushruta wrote, \"Only the union of medicine and surger y cons titutes the complete doctor. The doctor who lacks knowledge o f one of these branch es is like a bird with on ly one win g.\" W hile Charak a concentrated on the ernal edicin e). S expo unded on the Shalya Tantra (surgery). The Samhita contains m ostly poetry verses but also has some d etails in prose. 72 different ophthalmic d iseas es and their treatment are me ntioned in great detail. Pterygium, glauco ma and treatment of conjunc tivitis were well known to Sushruta. Re moval of cataract by a method called couching, wherein t he opaque l ens is p ushed to a side to improve vision was practic ed routinely. Techniques of suturing and many varieties of bandaging, p uncturing and probing, drain age an d extrac tion ar e detailed in the ma nuscript. Ashtanga Hrid aya Vaghbata in the 5th century compile d two sets of texts calle d Ashtanga S angrah a and Ashtanga Hridaya. It details the Kaya-chikitsa of Charak a Samhita and the var ious surgical procedures of Sushruta Samhita. The emphasis seems to be more on the physiological rat her than the spiritual a spects o f the diseas e processes . Ashtanga Sangraha is written in pros e whereas t he Ashtanga Hrida ya is in poetry for recit ation of the Verses. The Ancient ayurvedic Ph ysician Originally only Bra hmins ( a certain ) we re practicing physicians. ater pe ople from other c astes b ecame wel l versed in the art of healing and a term Vaidya came to be applied to the practition ers. Merely by th eir art and knowledge, t he physic ians gaine d high s ocial st atus regardless o f their cast e of birth. The court physician was o f politic al importanc e and sat on the right side of the throne, an important symb olic place. Though t he physic ian, patient, the nurse and the medicine were all importan t in c uring a disease , the physician was thought t o be the most important. The codes o f conduct for physicians a nd medical s tudents we re laid d own by t he texts. The poor an d downtrod den we re to be treated free of charge. O thers were c harged a ccording to their ability to pay . The physician was expect ed to behave in a n exe mplary manner, conforming to the high est ideals of profession al an d personal life. His dress, m anner and speec h were expect ed to be beyon d reproach . Medic al education was ard uous, c onsisting o f many years o f sacrifice learni ng the art of healing. V isiting th e sick, c ollecting her bs and preparatio n of drugs, memoriz ing th e Vedic texts o f Ayurveda , performing pr oced ures o n dead animals, me lons, and leather bo ttles and bladders we re part of the training. These exerc ises helped refine both theoretical and practical trai ning of the student. W hen finally the student is de emed ready to practic e on his own, he was certified by t he ruler. Recent History Before Ayurveda bega n its rec ent renewal in t he West, it went thr ough a period of decline in India when Western medical e ducation became d ominant during the era of British rule . Ayurveda became a second-class o ption used prim arily by tra dition al spiritual pr actitio ners and the poor. After India gained its independenc e in 1947, Ayurveda gaine d groun d and new schools beg an to be establishe d. Today more than five h undred Ayurvedic c ompanies an d hospitals h ave op ened in the last ten years, a nd several hu ndred sc hools have b een establish ed. Although Ayurveda remains a secon dary system of health c are in India, t he trend toward co mplementary care is e merging, an d Western a nd Ayurvedic physic ians often work side by side. Interest in Ayurveda i n the West bega n in t he mid 1970's a s Ayurvedic te achers from India bega n visiting the Unit ed States a nd Europe. By sharing th eir knowledge th ey have inspire d a vast move ment toward b ody-mind-spirit medicine. Today Ayurvedic colleges are opening througho ut Europe, Australia, a nd the Unit ed States. OUR COSMIC BEG INNING TRIGUN A Three prim ordial f orces, or five el ements - spac e, air , fire, water and earth - birt h the entire cr eatio n. The principle of stillness, tamas, replenishes t he universe a nd its bei ngs and is t he m ain principle of support within t he physical u niverse. The principle of self-organiz ing activity, rajas , gives motility and co-ordination t o the universe a nd human life. The Principal o f harmonic a nd cosmic intelligence , sattva, maintains universal an d individual stasis a nd ess. These operating thr ough t he five el ements they have creat ed, directly interface with human existe nce. On the physical pl ane, tamas works clos ely with the physical functions of the body, summarized a s bodily humors called doshas, tissu es an d wastes . Tamas is s aid to exercise the great est in fluence o n the body's water aspect, or Kapha dosha(humour )* human and gives the body its ability to cogitate and to endure long p eriods o f gest ation. Rajas in fluences t he psychic plane of existe nce a nd works clos ely with the psychological functions of the body. On the physical level, r ajas is sai d to exercise th e most influence on the body's air as pect, Vata Dos ha (h umour)*. It gives us our power t o transform what is b eing perceived externally into thoughts, c once pts, visions, and dreams. Referred to as the universe' s cos mic int elligenc e, the third princi ple sa ttva, per meates ea ch and every minute cell of our be ing. It functions thr ough o ur existenti al states o f awaren ess, although it also influences the physical organis m to some ext ent. Within the physical body, sattva is s aid to exercise t he most influenc e on its f ire aspect, Pitta dosha (humour)*. Clos ely linked to the universal s ubtle fire, tejas, the sattva principle m aintains the cos mic me mory of the entire cre ation- the collective me mory of every human- each in dividual's memory accumulate d from the beginni ng of time through each rebirth un til the presen t time i.e- our personal wisdom . *all th e above m entioned doshas will be explain ed in detail in the coming chapter( tridosh)The Pancham ahabhutas As m entioned earlier five ele ments( pa nchmahabhutas) which birt h the entire cre ation. According t o Ayurveda everything in life is c omposed of the Panch amahabhuta s - Akash (Space), Vayu (Air), Jal (Water), Agni (Fire) an d Prithvi (Earth). Omnipres ent, they are mixed in an infinite var iety of relative pro portio ns suc h that each form of matter is disti nctly uniqu e. Co nstantly changing and interacting w ith each other, they creat e a situa tion of dynamic flux that keeps t he world going. This is a small example: W ithin a simple, single living cell for exam ple the earth element predominat es by g iving struct ure to the cell. The water element is pr esen t in the cytoplasm or the liquid w ithin the cell m embrane. The fire element regulat es the m etabolic processes regulating th e cell. While the air el ement predomina tes the gases t herein . The space occupied by the cell de noting the last of the elements. In the cas e of a complex, mu lti-cellular organism as a human being f or instance , akash (spac e) corresp onds to spac body (mouth, nostrils, abdomen etc.); vayu (air) denotes the move ment (ess entially muscular); agni (fir e) controls t he functioning of enzymes (intelli gence, digesti ve syste m, m etabolism); jal (water) is in all bo dy fluids (as p lasma, saliva, digesti ve juices); an d prithv i (eart h) manifests itsel f in the solid struc ture o f the body (bones , teeth, flesh, hair et al). The Panchmah abhu tas therefore serve as the foundation o f all d iagnosis tr eatment modalities in Ayurved a and has served as a most valuable theory for physic ians to detect and treat illness o f the body and mind succ essfully. For exa mple if a person has m ore o f the fire element in the body he may su ffer from more a cid secretio n (gastric/ digesti ve), which i f causing harm in the form of hyperacidity etc., can be controlled by giving him food which contains more of jala (water) mahabhuta in it like sugarcan e juice etc. Table - 1 Panch Mahabhutas Sense Organs Sensory Facu lty Propertie s Actions Space Ears Hearing *Creates n atural sp ace in the bodyProduc es softness, lightn ess and porosity * No disti nct taste Air Skin Touch *Light, cle ar and dry .Crea tes dryness , lightness a nd wasting *Governs movem , joints, a nd other m otor functions. *slightl y bitter ta ste Fire Eyes Sight *Rough & bright Helps in digesti on, improves eye sight *Controls t emperature and luster of body colour . *Punge nt taste Earth Nose Smell *Heavy, immobile, compact & rough.*Increas es firmness & strength of the body *Controls orga ns as teeth, nails, f lesh, skin, tendons & m uscles.*Acts a s a n utrient, and purgati ve *Sweet fluid*Imparts . *Slimy , fat and content & purgati ve *Sweet & astringent purgati ve. Languag e of the Dosha s) The Physical, p sychic an d cosmic l anguage o f the body is cre ated from the circa dian rhythm of the universe s et in motion some b illions of years ago when the five great elements were born. Space, air , fire, water and earth, the first m aterial for life, are the basis o f the Vedic scienc es. In Ayurveda h uman physiology and anatomy ro oted in b odily These three princi ples su pport all o f life and are more than the physical su bstance o f our anatomy . Dosh as are three in number called Tridos has (tri meaning t hree and dosh as being t he basic physical energies/humors) . They are the primary and esse ntial f actors of the human body that govern our entire physical struct ure a nd function. Derived fr om the Panchm ahabhutas (five e lements), each dosha - which like th e elements cannot be detected with our se nses but their qualities c an be. They are the combination of any two o f the five bhutas (five elements) with the pre domina nce o f one. Calle d Vata, Pitta and Kaph a in Sanskrit, these three are onsibl e for all the physiological and psychol ogical pr ocesses within t he body and mind - dyn amic f orces that determi ne gro wth and decay. Every physical ch aract eristic, mental ca pacity and the emotional tendency of a human being c an therefore b e expl ained in terms o f the tridosh as.When existing in the body of all living organis ms, t he five el ements co ngregat e in a certain pattern and are known in Sanskrit as doshas, the literal m eaning o f which is, \"that which is quick to go out of balance.\" Doshas imply that the human system m aintains a delicat e balance, its dyn amic el emental co mposition a lways being on the ver ge of disord er. The doshas are a classic exa mple of energy and matter in dyna mic accord. All matter born from energy remains intricat ely woven within its c ore n ature o f energy. In a state of balance or equilibrium, doshas a re consid ered a n energy force in t hat we cannot visibly detect them as they move thr ough a nd support b odily function. For exam ple m ost of the physical p henomena ascribed to the nervous system by modern physiolog y for exa mple , can be identified with Vata. Just as the entire ch emical pr ocess operating in the human body ca n be attribut ed to Pitta, inclu ding enzymes , hormones a nd the comple te nutritio nal s ystem. And the activities o f the skeletal a nd the anabolic system , actually the entire p hysical volu me o f an orga nism, can be considere d as Kapha. In a state of imbalance or disequilibrium t he doshas become visible a s excessive mucus, bile, flatus, a nd physical ma tter. When these e arly signs of disord er are ignore d, imbal ances can quickl full-blown dise ases. u nique m he alth, air a nd space\u2014b oth ethereal elements - form one of the three doshas c alled Vata. Here air exercises its p ower o f mobility only when spac e is available. The elements fire and water f orm a second dosha called Pitta. Here t he bodily water protects the heat of the body from burning through. An exa mple of bodily fire is t he acid in our stomachs, which, i f leaked from the stomach, is c apable o f burning t he orga nism with th e force of a raging fire. Water is the buffering f orce that contains the body's fires. The elements water a nd earth combine to form the third d osha called Kaph a. Because o f their mutual density, water gives earth its f luidity. Without water , earth would b ecome stagn ated and inert. Thus, the Kapha dosha enables a certain fl uidity in t he body without depriving it of its solid s upport. Thus the three doshas co-exist in all liv ing organisms . It is importan t to realize that these three ar e forces an d not substances. Kapha is not mucus; it is th e force that causes m ucus to arise. Similarly pitta is no t bile; but that which ca uses bil e to be produce d. And they are c alled dosh as - literally meaning `f aults' or `out of whack'- as they indicate the fault lin es al ong which t he system can become imbalanced . It is eq ually importa nt to understa that the three dosha s within a ny perso n keep changing constantly due to their d oshic qu alities (explained in t he next ch apter), th e specif ic lifestyle and environment of the perso n, time and the season. Rem ember that these t hree are not separat e energies but different aspects of the same energy, pres ent toget her in an infinite variety of combination .The degre e to which e ach dosha exists within a person determi nes t he individual's constituti on, commonly referred to as body type (prakriti , which will be mentioned in the forthcoming pages). Each dosh a thus sh ares a quality with another (alth ough t here rem ain slight di fferences in the nature of shared quality ). Also, each has an inhere nt ability to regulat e and balance its elf, which comes from the opposit e qualities t hat arise f rom the dosha s constitu ent (basic) elements. When the dosh as are in balance i.e. in a state of equilibriu m, we remain h ealthy. As Chara ka, the great ayurvedic sage, explaine d: \"Vata, pitta and kaph a maintain the integrit y of the living human organis m in t heir nor mal s tate and combine so a s to make the man a comple te being w ith his indri yas (sense organs) po ssess ed of strength, go od complexion and assure d of longev ity.\" It is o nly when that there is imbalanc e within th ese three doshas th at disease is c ause d. And since it is th e stro ngest dosh a in the constituti on that usually has the great est tendency to increas e, one is mo st susce ptible t o illness es ass ociat ed with an incre ase o f the same. THE THREE DO SHAS & THEIR B ASIC QU ALITIE S Table-2 Vata Pitta Kapha (Air and Sp ace) (Fire a nd W ater) (Water and E arth) Light Light Heav y Cold Hot Cold Dry Oily Oily Rough Sharp Slow Subtle Liquid Slimy Mobile Sour Dens e Clear Pungent Soft Dispersing Erratic Astringen t Eash dosha als o has a primary function in the body. Vata is the moving f orce, Pit ta is t he force of assimila tion, and Kapha is t he force of stability. Vata, the m ost dominant of the doshas, governs bo dily move ment, the nervous system, and the life force. Without Vata's mo bility in t he body, Pitta and Kapha would b e rendered la me. Pitta governs enzymatic and hormonal activities, and is res ponsible f or digestio n, pigme ntation, body temperature, hunger, thirst, a nd sight. Furt her, Pitta acts as a balancing force Vata Kapha. Kapha governs the body's ovides mois ture t o the skin, h eals wounds, and regula tes V ata and Pitta. Vata, Pitta, and Kapha pervad e the entire body, but their prim ary domains are in the lower, middle, a nd upper body, respectively. Kapha rules t he (UPPER) head, neck, thorax, ch est, and upper portion of the stomach, fat tissues, and the joints. Pitta pervad es th e (MIDDLE) ch est, umbilical area, stomach, small intestines, sweat and lymp h glands , and the blood. Vata dominates the (LO WER) bo dy, pelvic region, colon, bladder, urinary tract, t highs, legs, ar ms, b ones, and nervous system. Apart form its m ain site ; each dosha has four secondary sites loc ated in di fferent areas o f the body. Thus each dosha then has five sites c onsid ered to be its ce ntres o f operation, which includ e the various o utreach systems b ecause of which t he entire body functions. The doshas interact c ontin uously with the external el ements to reple nish t heir en ergy within t he body. Each of the three doshas' five sites has a specific res ponsibil ity towards th e maintenance of the organis m. PHYSIO- PSYCHOLOGIC AL AND PATHOLOGIC AL NATURE O F THE DOSH AS Five Airs of V ata The five sit es or c entres o f operation and systemic ou treach t hrough which V ata casts its influence on the entire orga nism ar e calle d the five namely: eans 'life' is th e first a ir of the universe a nd of the body. Although loc ated in the body between the diaphragm a nd throat, it not only pervades t he region of the heart and chest, but also up into the face and brain. Pra na aids i n the chewing and swallo wing of food and provides im mediate nourish ment to all vital tissues of the body. The system is c onstantly being rejuvenated through the natural r hythm of the breath's inhalatio n, exh alatio n, and timely retention. The activity of the col on is a ttuned to the res piratio n's rhyth m; n of extracti ng 'prana' i.e life from the digeste d food and diffusing it in to all of the tissu es in the body. When the colon is d isturb ed and unable to fulfil its natural a bility to extract a nd diffuse pr ana, this un used prana becomes waste. Prana facilitates all move ment in and out of the body. It moves i n the region of the heart, causing it to beat. It carries food through t he oesophagus i nto the stomach. Pr ana sus tains the heart, arteries , veins, se nses, and our wisdom faculty, (buddhi). When prana cannot function pro perly our very life force is t hreatened. Res piratory ailments suc h as bronchitis an d asthma res ult. He art ailm ents and the impulse t o vomit ar e als o relat ed to prana's imbalanc e. Air of the Throat : Udana Udana, the sec ond air o f Vata, which me ans \"ris ing air ,\" flows u pward from the umbilicus through th e lung and into the throat and nose. Known a s the air o f ejectio n, it pr ovides us with our vocal p owers and clarity of sense p erceptions. It also preserves o ur bo dy's natural f orces, such as its strengt h of will and capacity for effort. Udana has the suprem e task of keeping track o f the number of breaths we exp end. An equally supreme task is u dana's capacity to preserve me mory, both exp eriential (memories ga there d within a prese nt lifetime) and cognitive (cum ulative memories carried i nto all lives f rom the beginni ng of creation through all ti me). I mpairme nt of udana can result i n loss o f memory, impaired s peech, giddi ness or heaviness in t he head, deep-se ated fears, a nd a shortened life span). Air of the Stoma ch: Samana Samana, the third air o f Vata, is loc ated between the diaphragm and navel. It aids t he move ment of food through t he stomach and small int estin es, fans the fires of digestio n by stimulating th e production of gastric juices an d digesti ve enzymes a nd helps in t he assimila tion o f nutrients extract ed from our food. Samana is t he moving force that transports these n utrients to the various tissue elements a nd disch arges wastes into the col on. When the samana air is distur bed, it can cause mucus a ccumula tion i n the stomach called 'ama', indigestio n, poor a ssimilatio n, and diarrh oea. Air of the Colon : Apana The fourth air of Vata, apana, is loc ated in the col on and the organs of the pelvic region. Also known a s the air o f eliminati on, apana's primary function is t o relieve t he body o f feces, uri ne, flatus, s emen, and menstrual waste . Its down wa rd press ure ma intains p ositio n of the foetus and the flow of its eve ntual birth. Apana is t he most dominant of the five airs, situa ted as it is in Vata's prim ary locati on. Apana maintains t he delayed nutrition o f prana in t he organism . When apana is impaire d, dis eases of the bladder, anus, testicles, uterus, m enstrual p roblems Circul ation: Vyana Vyana is t he fifth and final air o f the Vata and is loc ated in t he heart. It diffuses the energy derived f rom food and breath throughout the entire orga nism inclu ding the skin. Circula tory in in the body's c hannels, suc h as the blo vessels, to trans port n utritive juices a nd blood throughou t the body. Vyana also carries s weat from the glands t o the skin a nd is the force behind bodily expressio ns suc h as yawning and blinking. When vyana m alfunctions, there is dryness o f the ski n and other bo dy extre mities, p oor circulatio n, and diseases s uch a s fever.

Five Fir es of P itta Pitta, formed from the elements o f fire and water , also is s aid to resid e in five sit es. These sites ar e the centers o f operation and systemic ou treach t hrough which t he Pitta dosha influences th e entire orga nism; t pachak a, ranjaka P achaka Pachaka is re ferred to in Ayurveda as t he first fire of the body. It exists in the small int estine , duodenum, gall bladder, liver, and pancreas, a nd supports the rem aining f our fires, to be discuss ed below. Pachaka's main actio n is t o diss olve and digest t he food we ea t. It als o regulates body temperature. Once digestio n has taken plac e, pachaka separat es th e food's nutritive el ements f rom its waste el ements. An imbalanc e in t his first fire, pachaka, causes indigestio n as well as a revulsion f or food. Fire of the Blood : Ranjaka True to its n ame, ranjak a, the seco nd fire of Pitta, controls t he formatio n and preservatio n of blood. Located in the liver, spleen, and stomach, ranjak a provides t he blood with its c olour and oxy gen. When ranjak a is im paired , bile compounds may a ppear in the blo od and diseases s uch a s anaemia and jaundice m ay follow. Fire of the Heart : Sadhak a The finest of the fires, sadhaka, t he third fire, is c entral t o the activity of Pitta. It reigns, along with pr ana, in the heart. With udana, it governs m emory and the retention a nd wellness o f all mental functioning. W hen sadhaka is i mpaire d, there may be psychic dist urbances, m ental disorie ntation, extreme emotional s tates, a nd craving for extre me foods, d rugs, an d so on. Fire of the Eyes: Alochak a Alochaka , the fourth fire of Pitta, exists in the pupils o f the eyes. It gives th e eyes t heir lustre and diffuses light and its s pectr um o f colours t hrough out the body, When the fourth fire is vitiated, there is im pairm ent o f vision and yellowness may a ppear in the eyes. Fire of the Skin : Bhrajak a The fifth fire, bhrajaka, is l ocated in the skin , given t he ski n its lus tre an d glea m. Bhrajak a protects t he body from extre me atmospheric c onditi ons a nd facilita tes the assimilati on of light, wind, wate r, and oil through t he skin.

Five W aters of Kapha Kapha, formed from the elements water a nd earth, als o manifests i n five doshic sites , through these c entres o f operation and systemic ou treach it i nfluences the entire organis m. The five waters of Kapha are : kledaka, avalambak a, bodhaka, tarpak a. Water of the Stoma ch: Kled aka The first water o f Kapha, kle daka, originat es in t he stomach. It is th e cause of mucus formatio n in the body. Most important of the waters, kl edak a's mois t foamy li fies f oods, a nd nourishes the remaining waters o f Kapha. W hen the first water is aggravate d, the digestion process becomes impaire d, heaviness o f the abdomen prevails, and nausea may also occur . Water of the He art : Avalamb aka The second water of Kapha, avala mbak a, resi des in the chest a It provides a plasmic ( fluid ) tiss ue covering to the heart, thus ins ulating it f rom heart & acting as a shocka bsorb er. Avalambaka also p rovides th e lim bs with their energy . When this water is dis turbed, laziness and lethargy ensure. Heart originati ng diseases suc h as rheumatic f ever an d pains in the pericardi um(tissu e aro und the heart) m ay also o ccur.Water of the T ongue : Bodha ka Bhodhaka, the third water o f Kapha, is t he one which joins the five waters of body's river. It sends water t o the tongu e and palate and gives th e percep tion of taste. It registers ea ch of the six tastes in n ature a nd sends the appropriat e impulses t o the receiv ing tissu e long before the food is ingeste d. Bodhaka water als o liquefies the food. When this water is disturb ed, crimes ag ainst t he body's natural ins tincts ar e committe d, due to the impairm ent o f taste. This cre ates Ama, the foul undigeste d rem nants o f food which stick in t he tissues an d promote diseases s uch a s obesity , bulimia , and anorexia. Generally , a thick white c oating on the tongue in dicat es th e presence o f ama in the body. Water of Head : Tarpa ka Tarpaka, Kapha's fourth water , flows in the brain an d spinal c ord. I t soothes t he sense orga ns and, as a result lubricat es an d protects t he nervous system . When this water is out of balance, the sense organs b ecome impaired . Loss of memory and dullness of sens ory perceptio ns ar e the natural result . Water of the Jo ints: Shlessaka The fifth water o f Kapha, sles aka, is located in the joints. I t lubricates the joints and gives them their solidity . Slesaka's unctuous gel pr otects the joints from heat, and gives ease and flexibility of movem ent. When this water is impaired, t he joints may be come swollen, painful, and dys functio nal.

Agni Being the biological fi re that governs metabolism, agni encompass es all th e changes in t he body and mind from the dense to the mo re subtle . Such changes includ e the digestion and absorp tion o f food, cellular tra nsformations, assimila tion o f sensory perce ptions an d mental and emotional experienc es. Agni therefore covers all th e seque nces o f chemic al interactions and changes in the body an d mind. Digesti ve abilities ar e directly proportion al to the stre ngth o f agni.Agni and pitta are clos ely connected. While both are hot and light, agni is su btle a nd dry, while pitta is gross & liquid .The heat energy to help d igestion c ontained by pitta is agni. Pitta is therefore the container an d agni the content. Agni is aci dic in na ture and stimula tes digestio n. It is su btly relat ed to the move ment of vata. In every tissue and cell agni is pres ent and is n ecess ary for maintaini ng the nutrition a nd auto-im mune m echanis m which is performed by de stroy ing micro-organis ms, f oreign bacteria a nd toxins in t he stomach and the intestines . A balanced agni therefore is v ital for health. The strength o f the body to resist dis ease and also its physical stre ngth are directly related to its he at energy determining th e metabolic processes o f the body. Disturba nces t o Agni are usually the chief caus es of disease leading to ama in the body. As per Ayur veda there ar e thirtee n types o f Agni( 12 dhatwa{tissue}agnis given b elow, & 1 jatharagni) in the body an d mind according to the conversion and the transformation made. The most import ant of them is t he Jatharagni, the gastric fir e, res ponsible f or digesting th e food eaten (can b e correlate d to hydrochl oric acid in t he stomach and the digestive enzymes and juic es secre ted into the stomach, duodenum a nd the small int estin es). I f digesti ve agni is low and the its c apacity is impaired, one may experience pain, discomfort, fe eling of heavi ness or gases gurgling, c onstipation or l oose stools. *In such co nditio ns one should pr actice t he sansarjana kram given in t he 'diet' part of the course bel ow, preventing the acc umulatio n & productio n of ama( explaine d in t he seed of disease, below) & thus diseases. Dhatus: Bodil y Tissues PHYSIOLOG ICAL ANATOMY Ayurveda has identified seven c onstit uent tiss ues whereby the body both lives and dies. These tiss ues ar e calle d dhatus. L ike d oshas, d hatus are formed from the five elements - space, a ir, fire, water , and earth. The Sapta (seven) Dhatu (tissues) e lements form the pillars of the body that form the means of nourishm ent and gro wth while providing support t o the body as well as the mind. With the help of the digestive fire, the dhatus form the body's protective bi ological system. In other words, t hey nourish and defend the internal i mmune system. If one dhatu is d efective, each successive dhatu is affected, thereby triggering a chain reacti on of impairm ent througho ut the entire tissue system. The concen tric formation of dhatus occ urs through th e ingesti on of food substances. Infinitely well expresse d by Charak a, the use of naturally healthy foods is esse ntial t o the qu ality of nutrients respo nsible f or sus taining t he dhatus: \"The availability and consumption o f a wholeso me di et are essen tial to promote the healthy growth of a person; likew ise, indulgence in unwholeso me foods pr omotes diseases.\" Equ ally relevant is t he recognitio n that mental unrest or a negative outlook c ontaminates even the mo st wholes ome foods once these have been ingeste d. Through an enormously sophistica ted proc ess o f chemical r eactio ns (m ain digestive fi re called jatharagni)*, sp urred by bo th the energy in the food and the energy vibratio ns of bodily tissues an d mental thoughts, t he nutrient called ahara ras a is pro duced. The main digestive fi re lies i n the umbilicus r egion calle d jatharagni(macrosc opic- ca n d,pancre atic juice e tc ). dhatwa-ag ni (microscpic-on the tiss ue and cellular level, c annot be seen), wh ich is a subtle part of the jatharagni a nd is totally dependent on the jatharagni. S o if the jatharagni o f a person is s trong and well workin g all t he dhatwa gnis wi ll be working properly and the all the tissue formation (e ach c ell) will be of superior qualit y and vice th e versa. The nutrient , once absorbed into the digestive tract , is synthesized by th e ras a- dhatu digesti ve fire i.e rasadhatwa-ag ni to form the first of seven tissu es, rasa dhatu. This tissue , a milky c hyle res the th plasm a tiss ue and derives its existenc e from the water element. The proper c onversion o f the pri mary nutrien t, ahara ras a, into plasm a is d ependent upon the quality of the foods, the state of mind, health of bodily prana (pra na vayu), the ma in diges tive fire i.e JATHARAGNI the fire agni). In wholes ome conditi ons, t hese factors contribute to the productio n of plentiful rasa. In unhealthy conditions, they contribu te more to the pro ducti on of wastes in t he form of mucus i. e 'ama', rather than to the productio n of healthy plas ma.

Muscle tiss ue's dominant element is e arth, the most matter-like element of the five el ements from which the dhatus derive their f orm. The body's mu scle tiss ue shares e arth's nature o f matter. Next in the dhatu nourishm ent is the fat tissue from medadhatwa- agni, calle d medas dh atu which is p ervade d by water element. It's main function is lu bricating th e entire b ody s ystem.The bone and cartilage tiss ue, (asthi dhatu) from the asthidhatwa- agni which is pervad ed by the elements air and space is next in the dhatu nourish ment line age. Ashti Dhatu - Com prisin g of bone tissu es, incl uding cartilages, its main function is t o give support to the majja dhatu and provide s upport t o the masma dhatu. The continu ously refined nutrients are then transported and converted by majjadhatwa-agni to the tissu e comprising the body's red and white b one marrow, majja dh atu. Majja Dhatu - Denoting th e yello w and red bone marr ow tissue, its m ain function is to fill up the ashti and give fullness to the body. Finally , the refined nutrient re maining after all th ese dhatus have b een fed reple nishes the dhatwa-agni. This last dhatu, once formed, is fed by th e subtle essences of the nutrients refined through the synthesis o f all the previous dhatus. I t is the subtle pervasive esse nce r emaining in the body before it becomes t he material f or procre ation. If this d hatu is contamina ted or no t properly formed, due to pollution of the nutrients, the new lif e formed from the union of sperm and ovum is u sually adversel y affected in some way or other.

The three pri mary malas being Purisa (faeces), Mutra (urine) and Sweda (sweat). Ayurv eda clearly states that only a balanced conditio n of dosha s, dhatus and malas is arogy a (good health o r dise ase f ree condition) a nd their imbalanc e is th e cause of ill health or disease. Purisa is the waste le ft back after nutrients o f digest ed food have been absorbed in t he small intestine . The consiste ncy of the faeces de pending on the ma in diges tive fire i.e jatharagni and apana vayu( refer to the 5th type of vata).T his system is known as Purishvah astrotas. The tridosha s must be in ba lance to ensure normal evacu ation. Pitta and kapha help digestio n and vata governs t he m obility throughou t the process. Any imbal ance between these c an lead to various symptoms o f abdominal he aviness or p ain, flatulence, cons tipati on or diarrhea. It may also give rise to diseas es as rhe umatoid arthritis, o steoart hritis, low-back pain, asthma, bronchitis a s well as stomach ulcers a nd irritable b owels. Mutra is derived d uring the course o f digesti on within th e human body. The first stage of urine formatio n begins in t he large intestine where f luids ar e absorb ed into the system. The entire urinary system i.e Mootrav aha st rotas-kidneys, ut erus, bladder a nd urethra, take par t in the formatio n and elimin ation of urine , regulating t he fluid balance in our b ody an d also maintaining blood pr essure. Any imbal ance of increas ed or decrease d urin e may res ult in disord ers as kidney stones uri nary infections, cystitis, abdominal p ain and bladder dis orders. Sweda (sweat) is t he third pri mary mala, and it occ urs as a waste pr oduct d uring the synthesis o f meda dhatu (fatty tissue). Elimin ated through skin pores , it controls b ody temperature. The channels res ponsi ble for bring ing the sweat to skin sur face ar e known as sweda vaha srotas. It is e ssential t hat normal f ormation and flow of sweat takes pl ace a s otherw ise it m ay lead to skin in fections, itc hing/b urning sensation over the body, loss of fluid balance and reduced body te mperature. The three princi pal ma las ar e urin e, feaces, a nd sweat. These waste pro ducts , like t he doshas and dhatus, are c omposed of the five el ements. Secondary malas includ e the intestines fatty excretio ns, e arwax, hair (b ody, head, and beard), n ails, te ars, a nd menstru al disch arge. The normal f low o f the malas is o bstructe d when ever th e Dos has are incr ease d or d ecreased beyon d their na s five-fold Ayurvedic cle ansing t herapy, is designed to assist th e body in the elimina tion of The Mal as.Balance d Dosh as (humors), he althy Agni (digesti ve fir e), a good state of tissu es(dhatus) and their pro per metab olic end- products(mala) lead to a balanced state of the senses, mind and spirit, all of which lead to sound health. AMA: THE SE ED OF DI SEASE When the body's diges tive fire is n ot adequat e, foods remain undigeste d and unabsorb ed in the intestin al tract, and ama is th e res ult. F oul-odour and sticky, ama clogs th e intestines a nd other c hannels o f the body, includi ng its b lood vessels. Ama prevents the colon in its attempt to carry out its pri mary functio ns like extracti ng the vital force, or prana, from the digest ed foods. Ama undergoes a multitude of chemical ch anges, grad ually crea ting toxins, which into the blo odstream. As m entioned earlier if the m ain digestive fire vitiates, s o do the seven other fires (d hatwagni) on the cellular (tissu e) level, thus crea ting ama in the tissues. Excess d osha and toxins (fr om ama) form a sinister t eam as they travel through different channels (as m entioned in the next topic) with great ra pidity to a weaken ed (diseas e prone/vulnera ble) par t of the body. Through its t oxicity, ama elicits a negative im mune reacti on in the body's tiss ues u ntil, f inally, disease m anifests in these organs. All int ernal dis eases begin with a ma's presence in the body, and all extern ally created diseases eve ntually produce ama. In addition t o obstructing the body's channels, a ma causes a deterioratio n in o ur stre ngth a nd energy levels. I t reduces r asa, i nduci ng lethargy and fatigu e. Equ ally crippling to the system is m ental ama, gathered through mis perce ption and disturbed emotions. Gr eed, selfishness, p ossessiveness , stubbornness, a nger, and excessive desires become mental pollutants, are also a ma. An early sign o f ama in the body is a sticky coating on the tongue . In Kapha types* , the coating is usually thick, a nd whitish i n colo ur. Pitta types* t end to have a slimy , yellowish coating and Vata itter, grayish c oating. W hen these early sympt oms occur, fasting may re adily alleviate a ma and/or th e pancha karm a therapi es administ ered a ccordi the body type a nd in the appropriat e season. * Describe d in the chapter on body types (prakruti) Role of T aste It is a s important to realize that every food's u nique c ombination o f attribu tes wi ll influence its taste and the action it causes i n the body. With every taste having a d ifferent action - as detailed bel ow. Astanga Hrd ayam clearly describes the characteristics o f each of the six tastes a nd problems that might be experie nced from its h abitual over-cons umption. Most foods being a combin ation of two or mo re of these tastes e.g. c offee is bit ter an d pungent. Sour Com prised o f the elements e arth & fire, it incre ases pitta and kaph a and is go od for heart and digesti on. Stimulates agni, moves in active Vata energy down the pelvic cavity, sets the teeth on edge and incre ases salivatio n. Excess u se may ca use lo oseness a nd flabbiness, loss o f strength, giddi ness, itc hing, irr itation, a whitish yello w pallor , swel ling, t hirsts and fever, and dis eases arising from excess pitta and kapha. Sweet Relat ed to earth & water it ases pitta and vata, producing g reater s trength i n the tiss ues and value to the aged , woun ded, emaciated and children. Universally liked, it often adheres to the insid e of the mouth, giving a feeling of pleasure, c ontentment and comfort. Good for the complexion, hair, senses a nd oja, it als o incre ases br east milk a nd helps uni te broke p arts like bones. By its virtue it prolo ngs life and helps life activities. I n excess h owever it m ay caus e diseases arising f rom fat and excess kapha e.g. obesity , skin infections , unconsci ousn ess, diabetes, e nlargem ent of neck glands or maligna nt tumors et c. Salt The water & fire in salty taste incre ases pitta and kapha. It clears ob structi on of channels a nd pores an d increases the digestive activit y and salivation . Also res ponsi ble for lubricatio n and sweating, it p enetrates th e tiss ues. An excess o f it may ca use b aldness a nd grayin g of the hair, wrinkles, t hirst, skin diseases, blood dis orders a nd loss o f body strength . Pungent Fire & air i n pungen t increas es vata and pitta ve, causes irritatio n, brings secre tion from the eyes, n ose & m outh, and gives a burning sensatio n to the mouth. It dilates th e channels a nd breaks up the hard masses. B ut an excess use of it may c ause thirst, depletio n of reproduc h, fainting, c ontrac ture, tremors, p ain in the waist an d back, and other disord ers relate d to excess o f pitta and kaph a. Bitter Air & space bei ng its elements, it increas es pitta and kaph a. Dry ing up mois ture f rom fat, muscles, f aces and urin e. It cleans t he mouth and destroys th e perception of taste. It is said to cure a norexia, worms, bacteria, p arasit es, thirst, skin diseases, l oss o f conscious ness, fever, nausea, burning se nsati on. B ut in excess, it incre ases vata, causing diseas es of vata origin a nd depletion o f tissues. Astringent Air & earth increas es vata and controls incre ased pitta and kapha. It cleans the blood and causes h ealing o f ulcers. Like bitter, it too dries u p moisture from fat. It absorbs water , causing constipa tion a nd hindering digestio n of undigeste d food. Its excess us e causes stasis o f food without digestion, flatulenc e, pain in the cardiac region , emaciation, loss o f virility, obstructi on of channels and constip ation. BALANCING SEASON AL TASTES AND BODY TYPE TASTES The apparent contradictio ns be tween the tastes a nd qualities b eneficial to each body type, and the tastes and qualities suggeste d by the cyc lical na ture of the seasons are to be underst ood in t he follow ing wa y: The tastes which are generally good for each body type may become heighte ned or pr evalent in the body and extern al environm ent due to seaso nal influences. For exa mple , of the six tastes, the pungent flavour na turally predominates during the summer; al though co nsidere d a gener ally good all-year taste for Kapha types, it needs to be used in the summer se ason with discretio n. This is b ecause in su mmer the punge nt taste prevails out of the six tastes.(According t o the seasonal a ccumula tion of the doshas , in summers there is d ecreas e of kapha and the pungent taste als o causes decrease in ka pha and incre ase of vata wh ich may lea d to vata/k apha disorders) Similarly , the salty taste which pre domina tes d uring autumn, although c onsid ered a generally excellent all-year ta ste for Vata types, needs to be reduced during th e autumn season, eve n by Vata typ es(According to the seaso nal a ccumulati on of the doshas i n autumn there is alleviation o f pitta, the salty taste a lso causes allev iation o f pitta which may le ad to pitta disord ers). In the early winter , the sweet t aste predominates, and although gen erally an excellent a ll-year taste for Pitta types, needs to be reduced during th e early winter, eve n by Pitta types. (According t o the seasonal a ccumula tion o f the doshas in winter there is incre ase i n kapha and sweet t aste als o causes i ncrease of kapha which m ay lead to kapha disord ers) Table 16 TASTES OF THE SEASONS Northerl y Phase (Winter So lstice to Summ er So lstice) Season Dry TastesElement Composition Dosha Late W inter Bitter Air and space Vata Spring Astringen tAir and earth Vata & Kapha Summer PungentAir and fire Vata & Pi tta Note: the dry tastes ar e cre ated by the progressi ve northward m ovem ent of the sun Southerl y Phase (Summer Solsti ce to W inter S olstice) Season Dry TastesElement Composition Dosha Rainy Season (early fall)SourEarth and firePitta and and SweetWater earthKapha Note: the m oist tastes ar e crea ted by the progressi ve southward m ovem ent of the sun Benefi cial Tastes According to Dosha s Vata: sweet, Pitta:Sweet, bitter, astringent Kapha: punge nt, bitter, astringentTable 17 SEASON PITTAKAPHA LATE WINTERMajor: cool, lightMinor: bitter, Major: sweet, salty, warm, m oderate unctuous, alk t, cool, alk alineMinor: bitter, salty SUMMER Major: sweet, sour, warm, m oderate unctuousMajor: sweet, bitter, cool, m oderate unctuousMajor: bitter, astringent, moderate sweet, warm, dry Minor: bitter, salty, cool, lightMinor: astringen t, lightMinor: pungent , cool RAINY SEASON salty moderate unctuous , warmMajor: unctuousMajor: salty,* warm, moderate unctuous Tropic cool, light Minor: salty, astringentMinor: pungentMajor: bitter, astringent, moderate sweet, warm, light EARLY WINTERMajor: salty, bitter,* moderate sour, warm unctuousMajor: bitter, to Vata disord ers, use bitt er as minor tas tes a nd incre ase the use of sweet a nd salty tastes during the seasons indica ted. *Pitta t ypes: If strong te ndency to Pitta disord ers, us e sour, pungent a nd salty as m inor tastes a nd increas e the use of bitter, astringent a nd sweet tastes during t he seasons indica ted. *Kapha t ypes : If strong t endency to Kapha disor ders, u se sweet,s our a nd salty as minor tastes a nd increas e the use of pungent, bitter and astringent t astes during the seasons indica ted.

See previous ch art. Important Rule s And Regulations R elated to DIET : CONCEPT OF DI ET IN AYURVED A : 1)Defination : Diet is t hat - what we eat. It includ es ever ything we eat or drink . Diet is t he cause of the ver y existence , Energy , Colo ur & 'Oja' (immunity/Ultima te purified form of all th e Sharir Dha tus i. e Body tissues) o f every living being on this earth. 2) 'Diet' is th e cause of the birt h, maintenance, & destructio n of all forms o f life on this earth. From 'Diet' only we acquire f ollowing things - c onstant growth, u nhampered gro wth , Energy , H Colo ur, Proper functioni ng of the Indriyas (Sense Organs). Improper die tis the ma jor ca use of all illness a ccording to Ayurveda. From all above statements on e can say that' In short everything depends on diet. AYURVEDIC CONCEPT OF FORM OF DIET Accor ding to Ayurveda Body is sai d to be made up of Panch Mah abhutas (Pe ntads) & hence the food also needs to be Panchbhautic (Mad e up of Panch (five) Mah abhutas) then only food can get digest ed & be utilized f or the gro wth o f Panchamahabhutas (t he basic c onstit uents of body) wh ich in turn res ults in gro wth of body. The diet should b e made up of all th e six tastes i.e . Sweet, Sour, Salty, Hot, Bitter, Astringent. It has also b een stated that acc ording to the pro perties diet again c an be of 2 types i.e. Heav y to digest , & Easy or light t o digest . Ideal Di et The ideal diet should h ave f ollowing properties:- 1) It should incre ase t he strength of body. 2) It should b e tasty/it should b e such t hat it should be liked by the one, who is taking it. 3) It should gi ve energy insta ntaneously / immedi ately after taking it. 4) It should h ave th e capacity to withhold the body & give its stre ngth & energy to carry on its regular f unctions. 5) It should s atisfy t he one taking it . 6) It should b e hot, unctuous , not dry when taken. 7) Should be taken in pro per qua ntity. 8) It should n ot be incompatible .( mentioned in uneasy combinatio ns below) The food (Diet) with all ab ove pro perties is said t o be ldeal d iet. The Diet which is o f all th e properties explain ed above c an only do the functions prescrib ed to it. 3) FUNCTIONS OF DIET (food ) 1) Instantly satisfying. 2) Gives s trength /energy. 3) Maint ains t he body & m aintains the functions o f the body . 4) Incre ases longev ity. , Recollec ting Power , & Oja . 4) TYPES OF DIE T There are four types of diet i) That which c an be drunk ii) That which c an be licke d iii) Easily chewable e.g. Rice e tc. iv) Hard food substances which ne ed to be chewed e.g. S ugarcan e, meat. Some have gi ven 6 types in additio n to the four stated above : v) which should b e sucked e.g. Ma ngo. vi) Which needs masticatio n by te eth, these inclu de ver y hard food materials e .g. various nuts. Some have s tated 8 types / forms o f food / Diet . In addition to the above 6 . vii) Those which ca n only be eaten after being gr inded into powder , various pastes etc . viii) Food substances like Suger c andy etc. 5) According to Nature - Diet h as been classi fied into 2 types He avy Diet & Light diet. Rain water , Rakt ashali (Red rice), Sa the Sali (Ol d rice), Mudga, Eina (black d eer) & lava (kind o f bird und in airid regions) are light / laghu . Milk, sugarcan e, fresh Rice, U dad( b lack gram) & meat of the animals from Anoop D esh - land with abundant water & p lantation (Marshy lands, equa torial Rain forests) are consid ered to be Guru (Heav y) 6) Seven Concept of Diet The follow ing p oints are import ant in the m aking the Diet co mplete - (pro moting health) or improper- (g iving Rise to various dise ases). 1) Basic n ature / properties o f the food 2) Combinati on of 2 or m ore food material ch anges t he qu alities / pr operties o f food material. 3) Due to boiling, roasting et c. there is change in t he properties o f the food. 4) Quantity of food we take. 5) Region has 2 meanings - the region where th e food is being taken & Secondly region means the are a the food is b een produc ed affects the properties o f food material. 6) The time when one takes th e food. 7) The order in which o ne takes the food. 7) TIME OF T AKING DI ET Proper excretion of urine & Stools, Dosh as go t o the there respective sthanas i.e sit es, strotasas ar e cle an and free from blockage & indriyas i.e. sense organs ar e sharp a nd attentive, o ne feels lightness of body , Belching with pro per s mell to it. W ith proper excretion of 'Apaan vayu' , Heart becomes Nirdosh a i.e. we feel like ea ting & dri nking. When all the above signs ar e pres ent then only one should eat; as this is t he proper ti me for taking the diet. It is s aid that when t he Dosh as go to their own respective pl aces & the Strotaras (ch annels) become cle an then only one should take Food. QUANTIT Y OF FOOD T O BE T AKE N It is d ecided accordi ng to digestive ca pacity of Agni. I f Agni is weak then one should take food only once or s hould take f ood in less qua ntity. Food taken once i.e. at one time which gets digest ed completely & properly , is said to be Matra/ Quantity of food to be taken. Consid ering four parts o f the Stomach, one should take food such that 2 parts o f the Stomach get filled by the food taken, one part to be filled by water or o ther liquid matter & one part should b e kept free for the 'Vayu' / Gas to move . One should take diet in proper quan tity. The quantity of diet to be taken depends on the digestio n capacity of the perso n which var ies from person to person & so does the Matra. 20)The amount of food, which withou t dist urbing the equilibrium o f dhatus & doshas of the body gets digeste d as well as m etabolized i n pro per ti me is t o be regard ed as the pr oper quan tity. The proper qua ntity of food does depend upon the nature o f food articles. If the food article is heavy only three fourth or half of the stomach c apacity is to be filled up. Even in the cas e of light food articles excessi ve in take is no t conducive to the maintenance o f the power of digestio n & m etabolism. IMPORT ANCE OF F OOD T AKEN IN PR OPER QU ANTITY Taken in Appropriate quantity , food certainly helps t he individual in b ringing ab out stre ngth, complexion h appiness & l onge urbing the equilibrium o f dhatus & doshas of the body. Indic ated Food :- One should regularl y ( can take ever yday ) take S hastika (a kind o f rice h arveste d in sixt y days), Sali (ory za sativum), yello w gram food cooked Rock S alt, Amalaka (emblica officinalis), Rain W ater, Ghee, Me at of animals dwelling in arid climat e & Honey. Contradicted Food : One should not regularly take heavy articles s uch a s drie d me at, dry vegeta bles, l otus rhizomes & lotus st alk. On e should never t ake m eat of a dise ased animal. Moreover , one should n ot regularl y take boil ed buttermilk, ins pissiate d milk with pork , beef, meat of buffalo with fish curd , & barley . ORDER IN WH ICH ONE SHOULD T AKE THE DIET First, on e should ea t food of sweet taste for the purpose of Vata Pitta pacificatio n. Swee t taste is helpful for pacificatio n of vata d osha pr esent in the digestive tract o r intestines . Then one should take sour & salty subs tances f or they do the function of increasing t he digesti ve juices. L astly one should take food of bitter and punge nt taste for the purpose of pacification of 'Kapha' . One should take fruits like po megra nate first in t he diet. Then one should take liquid material & then lastly semis olid & s olid f ood. EIGHT FACTORS DETERMINING THE UTILITY FOOD. The Eight f actors which d etermine the utility or otherw ise o f various types of food are. 1) nature o f food articles 2) method of their processing 3) combinati on 4) Quantity 5) Habitat 6) Time 7) Rules go verning int ake of food. 8) Wholesomeness t o individual who takes it. 21) RULES FOR T AKING F OOD Healt hy individuals a s wel l as patients sh ould observe the follow ing: While having food articles which are m ost wholeso me by nature; o ne should e at only that food in pro per qua ntity which is h ot, unctuous & not contra dictory in potency & that too after the digestio n of the pr evious me al, food should be taken in proper p lace with all t he accessories, withou t talki ng & laughing wi th conc entration of mind & paying due regard t o oneself , not too fast or too slowly. Important Rule s And Regulations R elated to Diet 1) Eat to live but don't live to eat. 2) Eat food which is be neficial. 3) Eat food in a moderate qua ntity. 4) Don't eat food, properties o f which are n ot known to you. 5) Don't eat food in a hurry or when you a re in a dis turbed state of mind, full of tensions , strains, and emotional ou tbreaks. R egain peace of mind and then enjoy food with ha ppy an d hearty mood. 6) Wash your hands, feet and mouth, using clean utensils in a clean place which is well lighted and well-ventilate d. 7) Fill half quan tity of stomach with food, one fourth qua ntity with water and liquid substances a nd keep the remaining one fourth for air. 8) A person who ta kes o nly one full me al a day is c alled Yogee (or Yoga - practiti oner). He takes light bre akfast in the morning and the healthy and happy lif e. 9) A person who ta kes two f ull m eals in a day is calle d 'Bhogi\" i.e. a lusty and greedy person who lives mostly to eat and suffers from illness a nd or ill health from time to time. 10) A person who ta kes f ull meals m ore than two tim es is c alled Roge e or a sick pers on. He a glutt onous p erson and lives only to eat. He is a lways sick a nd away from health. 11) Don't do yogic exercises immedi ately after taking f ood. It is sa fe to do them three h ours after taking food. It is b etter th erefore to do Yogic exercise e arly mo rning or in the evening when t he stomach is em pty. 12) D on't t ake food immediately after doing yo gic exercises, b ut one hour after doing th em. 13) D on't go t o bed immediately after taking s upper wait for a minimu m of one hour after it. 14) According to Ayurveda we ll balanced diet consists of food stuffs having six tastes namely Sweet, Sour, Salty, Pungen t, Bitter a nd Astringent. Diet and Mind : Yogic an d Ayurvedic spec ts. Mo dern Die tetic c onsid eratio n is only related to body. But it is a uniqu eness of Yogash astra a nd Ayurveda inti mate rela tions hip b etween diet and mind. Both the sci ences assert with pr oofs that diet affects me ntality of a human being. S atva (virtue), Raja (Aggressi ve desire) and Tama (Ignoran t slot h) are the basic qualities o f mind. Satvagun a is alwa ys stre ngthe ning, essence , underst anding, purity , clarity , compassion and love. Raj oguna implies m ovem ent, aggressiveness a nd extro versio n and it operates on a sens ual level. Tamoguna m anifests ignoranc e, inertia, h eaviness a nd dullness. Satvagun a is a positive virtue and it strengt hens and stabilizes mi nd. Rajogun a and Tamogun a are nega tive attribu tes which d estabilise an d weak en the mind. Yet all the three attribut es are requi red of course in a balanced state and having a strong control of satvaguna are n ecessary for normal f unctioning o f the mind. As the final go al of yoga pr actition er is elevatio n and uplifting o f mental faculties to attain eternal bliss o r moksha he/she should do ever ything to go on incre asing his satvagun a through pro per di et and good behaviour . Yoga becomes th e destroyer o f all woes an d sorrows and can be accomplish ed only by him who is regulate d and moderate in die t and recreatio n, regulate d in speech a nd actions, and regula ted in thinking and sle eping t oo. The T aste Proc ess The first subjective experienc e of a subs tance on the tongue is t aste (rasa). A short ti me later, one feels h eating or co oling energy (virya). Fin ally the substances have a n action on urine , fasces and sweat (vipak). For ins tance, for hot chilli peppers, o ne immediately experiences its pu ngen t taste (rasa) and heating energy (virya) , observ ing a burni ng sensation in the faces and urine (v ipaka) . Virya - Heating or Cooling En ergy When any me dicinal herb or f ood substance is put in the mouth, the first experienc e is its taste. Later, and in some c ases i mmediately, you feel its h eating or cooling energy, either in the mouth or stomach. This change is all du e to its actio n or p otent energy called Virya. By experience , one can form general rul es ab out what a taste \"feels like \" in the body. For exam ple, t he sweet taste has a cooling energy, due to its heaviness. This a ction provokes kaph a and is p leasing to pitta and vata. But there are occasi onal exce ptions to this rule. Honey is sweet but have heating en ergy. This u nexp ected effect is termed Prabhav. In this same way , sour t aste is us ually heating expect in the inst ance of lime , which is cooling. Vipak - Post-Digesti ve Effect The final post-diges tive effect of the taste on the body, mind and conscious ness is called Vipak. While sweet and salty taste h ave a sweet vipak, sour taste has a sour vipak, but that of pungent , bitter an d astringent tastes ar e all p unge nt. Knowledge o f the energy and post- digesti ve effect of food or m edicin al her bs m akes underst anding of its actio n on bodily system easy. This knowledge b eing essential f or both healing and cooking. Prabhav - Specific Unexplaine d Action When two substances o f similar taste, energy and post-digestive e ffect show entirely different action, it is called prabhav . There is n o logical expla nation for this . All gem s tones, cry stals and mantras ai d healing du e to their prabhav. Prabhav is therefore the specific, dyna mic, hi dden action of the awaren ess pres ent in the substance.Diet P lanning Choice of Food In planning th e diet it is necessary to know which f ood to have or avoid based on ones personal dosh ic constitutio n or i mbalanc e.

A list of the same is indica ted bel ow : Table 20 Milk with fish, meat, curd , sour fruits, br ead containing yeas t, cherries, yogurt Melons w ithgrains , starch, f ried foods, dairy products Starche s witheggs, tea, dairy, bananas, d ates, m ost fruits Hone y withwhen mixed with an equal a mount of clarifi ed butter, boil ed or cook ed honey Radishes withmilk, b ananas, raisins Nightshad es w ithpotato, yogurt, milk, melon, cucumber, tomato, eggpla nt Yogurt withmilk, s our fruits, melons, hot drinks, m eat, fish, mangos , starch, c hees e Eggs withmilk, m eat, yogurt, m elons, c hees e, fish, bananas Fruit w ith with any other food Corn w ith dates, raisins, b ananas Lemon withyogurt, m ilk, cuc body e dhatus, , known a s strotas in Ayurveda , these consist o f both gross c hannels, such as the intestinal tr act, lymp hatic system , arteries, veins, a nd the genit or-urinary tracts , as well as the more subtle channels, suc h as the capillar ies.( mentioned earlier in 'malas' as mootravah astrot as etc) In Ayurveda, a complex s ystem o f diagnosis is e mployed to trace the root ca use of diseas e. The diagn osis of all diseases is b ased on which o f the individual doshas are c ompromis ed and which ch annels ar e obstruct ed. An excess o f any one dosha can crea te a spill- over e ffect in the body. Thus, a diseas e originating fr om one vitiated dosha is a ble to travel through t he channels to the site of another do sha. Dos ha excess es ca n als o crea te blockages i n the channels, t hereby obstructing t heir nor mal f low. Men h ave t hirtee n groups o f channels, and wom en have fi fteen. Of the thirtee n common groups o f bodily channels, the first three a re the channels through wh ich the air (or br eath), food, and water travel; t hese are governed by V ata, Pitta, Kapha, res pectivel y. Air and the alimentary tract a nd conduct pr anic force and vitalit y through th e res piration and circulati on system s. These channels b ecome impaired by t he suppression of natural b odily urges, by ingesti ng dry or stale food, and by excessi ve physical exertio n. Sym ptoms express ed by v itiated air channels are s hallow and restricte d bre athing, fear, anxiety, and nervous tension . Food Channel s- ann avahastrotas Food channels originat e in t he stomach and carry food through the digestive system. Untim ely or in discr iminat e eating, u nhealthy foods, and low digestive fire cause vitiation of these c hannels. The symptoms o f afflicted food channels a re loss of appetite, indigestion , vomiting, an orexia, greed , and possessiveness. Water Channe ls- ud akavahastrotas Water channels originat e in t he palate and pancre as, a nd regulat e the body's fluid. Obstructio n of these p assages is ca used by excessive expos ure to heat, excessi ve use of alcohol or o ther ad dictive subs tances, a nd ingesting ver y dry foods. The symptoms o f vitiation are excessive thirst , dryness o f lips, t hroat, tongu e and palate, as wel l as selfishness and dulln ess. The follow ing seven groups o f channels s ervice ea ch of the body's seven d hatus. Like t he dhatus, the nature o f these channels ra nge from the most gross ( megasco pic) to the most subtle (Mic roscopic c ellular level) Rasa (Pl asma) Channels- r asavahastrotas Plasma c hannels begin in the heart and its several bl ood vessels and transp ort chyle an d plasma to the rasa (plasm a) dhatu (all over the body). Obstruc tion o f these passages is caused by stress, gr ief, and excessi vely cold and heavy foods. The symptoms o f vitiations ar e anorexia, drowsiness, n ausea, fainting an d anaemia, impotency, stress grief. Rakta (Blood ) Channe ls- ra ktavahastrota s Blood channels originat e in the liver an d spleen and transport bl ood to the rakt a dhatu (all over the body). This grou p of channels is o ften referred to as the circulat ory system. Vitiatio n of this system is ca used by hot and oily foods, excessive expos ure to the sun or fire, and expos ure to radio activity. The symptoms o f vitiation a re skin diseases a nd rash es, a bscess es, excessi ve bl eeding and inflammation of the ge nital organs and anus. The emotional symptoms ar e ang er, dullness , and aggressi veness. Mams a (Muscul ar) Channel s - mam savahastrotas Muscular c hannels, which originat e in the ligaments, t endons, a nd skin, s upply nutrients t o the muscle d hatu (all over t he body). Impairme nt of these channels is du e to regular in take of heavy, greas y foods, excessive sleep, sle eping a fter meals, and sedentary lifestyle. The symptoms o f vitiation a re usually benign t umors pro duced by th e muscular s swollen uvula , hemorrh oids, and of the thyroid glan ds an d adenoids. The emotional symptoms ar e lack o f mental clarity and nervous tension . Meda (Fat) Channe ls - m edavahastrota s Fat channels, co mmonly known as the adipose system, originate in the kid neys and the omentum. They s upply fat tissue ingredients to the Me da dhatus (all over t he body). V itiation of this system is du e to suppression o f diges tive ac tivities, a nd excess o f fatty foods, alc ohol, and other addictive substances. The sympt oms of affliction are generally diabetes, urinary disord ers, an d possessiveness. Asthi (Bone and Ca rtilage) Chann els - asthiv ahastrotas Bone and cartilage c hannels, commonly known as the skelet al system, begin in the hipbone and supply nutritive ingredients to the asthi (b one and cartila ge) d hatus (all over t he body). Afflictio n of these channels is generally cause d by excessi ve activity, friction o f the bones, and excessi ve in take of food which is e dry, cold or stale. S ome symp toms of vitiatio n are dry , flaky nails an d decaying teeth, painful joints, dry and thinning hair, and feelings o f deprivatio n and fear. Majja (Bone Marro w) Channe ls - m ajjavahastrotas The bone marrow channels, co mmonly referred t o as the central nervous system , supply the marrow and nerve tiss ue nutrients to the Majja (bo ne m arrow ) dhatus (all over th e body). In Ayurveda , the marrow is n ot only the matter found in the bone encas ement (called white a nd red m arrow ), but is also f ound in the br ain a nd spin al cord . Impairm ent of the bones an d joints is generally cause d by co nsumptio n of uneasy combinatio n foods, suc h as the use of animal foods with milk, or ho t and cold subs tances t aken toge ther, trauma and injury , which, in turn, affect the bone marrow . The sympt oms of vitiatio n are fainting, di zziness, loss o f memory, black outs, and compound abscesses . Shukr a (Ovum and Sp erm) Channel s - shu kravaha strotas The ovum a nd sperm c hannels ar e subtler t han the nine preceding ch annel groups. Originating in the testes an d ovaries, these c hannels ar e ordinaril y referred to as the repro ductive s ystem. They transport t he semen, ovum , and ojas e ssenc e to the m ale and female tissu es. Afflictio n of these pass ages is nor mally the result o f unwholeso me activities such as excessive or s uppressed sex, un natural s ex, sex at improper times like d uring menstru ation and pregna ncy, drug addictio ns, a nd abortions . The symptoms o f vitiation ar e impotency, infertility, and defective pregn ancy. The emotional symp toms are sexual p erverte d indulgences, selfishness, and agg ressi on. The remaining g roups o f channels c ommon to both the male a nd female are the body's three elimin ation systems. Urinar y Channe ls - mootrav ahastrotas The urinary channels b eing in t he kidn eys and bladder ej ect uri ne from the body. Impairment of these p assages is caused by the suppressio n of urina tion. The symptoms o f vitiation ar e generally excessive, sca nty, or frequent urina tion, as well as fears, a nxieties, and nervous ness. Excretor y Channel s - puri shvahastrotas The excretory channels or dinaril y referred to as the excretory system, originate in the colon and rec tum. They evacu ate feces from the body. Vitiatio n of these channels is caused by weak digesti ve fire, eating be fore the previous meal is digest ed, suppression of defecation , and ingesti ng food of opposite qu ality. The sympt oms of affliction are usually diarrhe a, constipa tion, or excessivel y hard s tools. The emotional symp toms are execessi ve attachment, dulln ess, a nd fear. Sweat Channe ls - s wedavahastrotas The last o f the excretory channels, c ommonly known as the sebaceous system, originate in the fat tissue and hair f ollicles, and exp el sweat from the body. Affliction o f these channels is caused by excessive activit y, heat, spicy foods, acidic f oods, excessive alcohol, o ther addictive substances, grief , fear and anger . The symptoms o f vitiation are excess perspiration or no perspiratio n, rough an d dry skin, b urning se nsation o f the skin, aggressi Ch exist w ithin the female body: th e menstrual c hannel, which exp els blood, secreti ons a nd tissue debris from the uterus , and the breast milk c hannel, wh ich carries milk t o the nouris hing mother's breast.

Ayurvedic Bod y Types PRAKRITI The Ayurvedic t exts provided speci fic guid elines t o help us id entify our c onstitutio nal n ature. These guid elines e nable u s to live wi sely on the earth whi le safeguarding our h ealth. From the three d oshas, Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, seven body types we re originally identified. O ur body type , which is determin ed at birth is o ur co nstitu tional nature, our prakriti. This pr rom the partic ular combin ations and permutations o f the five e lements in t he sperm and ovu m that exist during concep tion (re f to the chart be low). O nce b irth h as m ade its elemental i mprint, we cannot a lter it witho ut adversel y affecting our balance of well-being. The human constit ution, or pr akriti, is co mprised of all thr ee doshas. This means that every individual h as within hi msel f the dynamic forces of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The difference between in dividuals is the degre e to which the three doshas in teract with one another wi thin each body type. Only our physio- psychological a spects c hange, influenced as they are by social, environmental, and cultural f actors operating in our lives, an d as wel l as by our personal c hoices . The S even Orig inal Bod y Types Originally , Ayurveda defined seven body types. These were V ata, Pitta, Kapha, Sama, Vata- Kapha, Vata-Pitt a, and Pitta-Kapha. The first three types occur i n their pure from very rarely , so seldom is it t hat anyone is pri maril y influence d by on e dosha al one. Even more infrequ ent is the Sama dosha (all thr ee doshas in balance). More c ommon are the combinatio n body types, re ferred t o as dual pr akriti, i.e. Vata-Kapha, Vata-Pit ta, and Pitta-Ka pha. In more recen t times, these three dual types have been exp anded to includ e six dual types. By reversing th e two doshas within e ach dual type a nd considering it a separate type, i. e. Kapha-Vata, Pitta- Vata, Kapha-Pitt a. A pers on who h as both Vata and Pitta dominant may , therefore, be either a Vata-Pitta or Pitta-Vata type, depending on which o f the two d oshas is m ore dominant. Because the body types ar e the basis, f rom which all Ayurvedic di agnosis begins , they are explaine d here in some d etail. This expla natio n is als o intended to help you be tter underst and your own p ersonal c onstit ution.

Six week a fter making the necessary changes in your di et and daily activities a nd doing the cleansing as given in t he forthcoming pages , re'-do the Body Type c hart. The latter respo nse will be more in keeping with your true cons titutio nal n ature. Directions : Move horizontally across ea ch of the sections s et out in the chart b elow and circle the attribut es that you f eel most accura tely reflect you. Ch oose at leas t one from each section. Ask a spous e, parent, or friend to assist you with the Emotional Ch aracteristics portion of the assess ment so that your c hoices will be as objective as possible . Men are advised t o seek t he assist ance of a wom en - a spouse, a friend, or m other - for both the Physical Charac teristics and Emotional Charac teristics section of the chart. Then, moving down e ach of the three colum ns, c ount how many ch aracteristics you circled f or each body type. W hich ever column yields t he highest sc ore in dicate d your Ayurvedic body type. For exam ple, i f your scores ar e 15 for Vata, 12 for Pitta and 5 for Kapha, then your Ayurvedic body type is Vata/Pitta.

But when body types co ncern ed with mo re than one dosha is concerne d, the 'sam a' type where all t he doshas a re in equal qu antity is the best of all b ody types which is ve ry rare to find. Dinach arya In order to keep the tridosh as in a state of healthy equilibrium , digestio n & metabolism (agni) in proper or der, Ayurv eda prescribes f or each individual a speci fic daily routine ( dina - d ay & acharya - behavior). The various stages t o this daily routin e as per prakriti(constit ution), th at will enable you t o make the most out of your life are : Arising Since our biological clocks ar e attuned to the rising and setting of the sun, it is obviously better to awake an hour be fore sunrise in perfect synchronization t o the natural clock i.e between five & six in the m orning. An ideal ti me to let the body cells so ak in t he strength of a tempered sun to be charged for the day. It incre ases t he life span of an individual a nd helps maintain th e equilibrium of doshas in once body. Drinking a glass of Luke-warm water h elps flush out all t oxins accu mulated overnight in t he body.Natural Urg es The last p ortion of the night being ruled by vata - involved in the proc ess o f eliminati on - the time before dawn is b est to elimi nate the body's physical waste . Pr oper elimin ation also helps re move th e kapha that naturally accumula tes overnight. Defecation once or twice d aily is the best. Examin e your elimin ations ea m orning and if you n otice any disturbanc e indica ting poor digestio n, go o n a fast. It will allow the body rest t o correct th e system before disease s ets in . Never s uppress th e natural physical urges as elimin ation, hunger , thirst, flatus tion, for it will lead to disc omfort and even dis ease. ORAL HYGIENE Oral garg les Specific oil garg ling accordi ng to one's constit ution is be neficial for the strength of jaws, d epth of voice, glow on the face and perfect taste sensation. One who do es these garg les never gets dryness o f throat, cracking o f lips, his teeth will be free from cavities a nd be deep-ro oted, he won't su ffer from toothache and can chew the hardest o f things. HEAD OIL One who a pplies ayurvedic her bal h ead oil (acc ording to one's body constit ution) on his he ad does not suffer from headache, baldness, hair gra ying. Strength o f his h ead and forehead is speciall y enhanced, his h air be comes bl ack lo ng and deep-ro oted, his sense orga ns wo rk properly, the skin o f his f ace brighte ns, a pplyin g this he ad oil pro duces so und slee p and happiness. This oil sh ould b e applied l ukewarm, at night b efore going to bed. The best results for lus trous & thick hair is when the oil is washe d with an ayurvedic h erbal s hampoo. OILING OF E ARS Ear d iseas es due to vitiate d vata like lock jaw , difficulty in h earing, tinnitus(whistling sound in the ears),accu mula tion of wax and deafness( als o appear d uring old age) ar e prevented if ear o il called bilwatailam is used regularl y (twice in a month )i.e d ropped into the ear. It also helps ke ep the ears clean of wax and other ext ernal im purities. MassageNecess ary for every person , a regular self-massage (b efore a bath) with herbal oils is necessary at least twice a week but needs to be supplemented with profession al attention (ayurvedic oil ma ssage) o ccasio nally. It makes th e skin supple; c ontrols vata by reducing its cold, dry, light, rough & erratic qu alities, e nhances blo od circulation , encourages quicker removal o f metabolic wastes and relaxes t he body. The one who pr actices oil m assage regularl y, his body, even i f subjected to injuries or stren uous wo rk is n ot much injure d. He remains str ong and charming. The ayurvedic oil massage d one with proper oil a ccording to ones constit ution regularl y is highl y rejuvenating. Follow the normal directio n of hair growth, massage t he scalp a nd head at least twice weekly and just t he soles o f your f eet if short of time Exercise Either pa ssive like m assage or a ctive like a erobics or b oth as in yo ga postures; regular exercise increas es the body's st amin a and resistanc e to dis ease by facilitating th e immune system, cl earing all channels, pr omoting circulation & waste disposal, a nd destroying fat. Done regularl y, it can reduce a nxiet y . Depending o n age & body type, kapha s can go f or heavy exercises, pittas should d o it in mo deration (aero bics) and vatas should per form yoga and not aerobics. Never exert mo re than half your ca pacity . Avoid any kind o f exercise d uring illness, jus t after a meal and without rhythmic bre athing. Swim ming, brisk wa lking and jogg ing are excelle nt options. Cleanline ss - EFFECTS O F HAVING A BATH Bathing is puri fying, increas es libido and is li fe-giving. In today's fast life we use soaps which are m ade of chemicals , these m ake our skin dry and are harmful in the long run especi ally to childre n. Do ne after the her bal oil m assage w ith a proper ' herbal b ody scrub' it removes fatigu e, sweating an d dirt. It brings about stre ngth in t he body and is an aid par excelle nce f or the enhancement o f oja. Thorough washing of the limbs , face, mouth, eyes & nose purifies the bodies sense organs. Best done with a bath in cle an water, it should a ccom pany brushing o f the teeth (sh ould b e repeated after every meal), scraping o ff a toxicate d coating o f ama from the tongue , occasion al gargling o f salt water with a pinc h of turmeric to keep gu ms, m outh & throat healthy. Proper cleaning of the nose and the ears and washing the eyes s hould be done. Keep your h air trim med, nails filed and wear clean clot hes. Ayurveda encourages to use perfumes in moderation and feel goo d. TIME FOR US E OF COLL YRIUM - rasanjanaOne should regularl y apply the colly rium made of antimony called 'rasanjana', once in every five o r eight nigh ts as it causes lacrymatio n of the eyes. 0f all th e mahabhutas fire (tejas) dominates the eyes, s o they are especially suscep tible t o kapha (wh ich leads to cataract, blurring of vision). Therefore collyrium, which all eviates kapha, is goo d for keeping clearity of vision. The rasanjana mu st not be applied to the eyes duri ng the day time, as the eyes weake ned by the drainage wi ll be adversely affected in sunlight . Thus collyrium sh ould be applied a t night. Charak a says ' As different types of tarnishe d gold ar e spotlessly cleaned by me ans of oil, cloth & br ush, so a lso with th e use of rasanjana the eyes o f human being be come s potlessly bright like t he m oon in the cle ar sky.' USE O F NASAL DROP S One should inhale s pecially prepared oil f or nasal dro ps during all seas ons called 'anu taila'. Two drops of this o il should b e applied in both the nostrils, after hot water ba th or before going to bed with a cotton swab or ear b ud. One who pr actices t his na sal dr op therapy called n asyam in proper gi ven ti me a nd according to the prescrib ed m ethod his eyes, nose and ears are n ot effected easily by any disease or by any extern al infection. It prevents h air grayin g (hair on the head, beard, eyebrows, and eyelash es) and hair fall rather th ey grow luxuriously . Diseases such as headache, facial paralysis, lock jaw , rhinitis e tc are treated. Being no urishe d by inh alatio n of anu taila his veins, joints , ligaments a nd tendons of the head and neck gain great er strength . Their is glo w on his face, voice b ecomes sweet, established & stertoro us. All his s ense organs b ecome clear & there is c onsid erable s trength in them. Even though a pers on m ight b e gro wing older b ut the age is n ot reflected on his face. By massaging oil o n the feet roughness , lethargy, dryness, f atigue and numbness ar e instantaneously cured. Tenderness, str ength a nd steadiness o f feet are e ffected, eye sight becomes cle ar and vitiate d vata is relieved . preven tion f rom sciatica , cracking o f feet, constriction o f vessels a nd ligaments of feet is e nsured i f oil ma ssage is d one on the feet. Meditation Ideal for disciplining th e mind and removin g stress & strain, it is best done after a quick bath to cleanse yoursel f. Critical in satisfying the mind's hu nger, when done wel l it is s o nourishing that eve n the body can surv ive on less. Co ntrol o f desire, or mental hunger, is the key to longev ity. Anything ca n be meditation so long it is sinc ere a nd heartfelt. Clothing In shieldi ng from extre me temperatures , it tends to reflect the temperament of the wearer in a socie ty showing growing preponderance o f the same. Should always be light & airy( unless it is very cold), an d made of natural fi bers as cotton, wool, linen or silk. Si nce e nergy is bro ught into the body through th e crown o f the head and exits from the soles of the feet - extracti ng abnormal h eat from the system - the polluted energy usually collects in the footwear . So avoid wearing other's footwear, try not to take shoes into the house and walk bar efoot whenever possible. And wood en sandals ar e healthier than animal skin o r rubber sh oes. *all th e above m entioned products i. e oils/ shampoo etc ( a ccording t o one's constitution) c an be ordered o n our website . Sound sl eep is the ke y to good he alth ANCIEN T ayur vedic t exts while d ealing w ith right a nd ideal lifestyle have d iscusse d three pillars of life. They ar e ahara (diet), ni dra (slee p) and brahmach arya (o bservance o f sexual discipline). Out of these t hree, the concept of proper sleep finds mention in the work of every author. The time spent on slee p is likely to vary according t o the age and other situations . On an average, it is b elieved t hat a m an passes one-third o f his life asl eep. An infant sleeps 2 0 hours daily , whereas , on an average, a dults require seven o r nine hours a nd an old person five o r seven h ours of sleep in 24 hours. The require ment for sleep als o varies i ndividually. There are perso ns who ar e \"short-sle epers\" bu t do not show any si gn of illness at tribut ed to less sle ep . Physiolog y of Sleep: When the mind includi ng sensory and motor organs is exha usted and they diss ociate themselves f rom their o bjects , then the individual sl eeps . Effect of Sl eep: Happiness , mis ery, nourish ment, emaciatio n, strength, weakness, virility, sterilit y, knowledge, ignoranc e, life and death - all these occ ur depending on proper or impro per sle ep. Accor ding to Sushruta , a good sleep enj oyed at proper ti me a nd for proper perio d, tends to improve the growth, str ength, vigor and complexion o f the body. It increases the sense of well-being by freshening th e body an d mind and als o rest ores t he natural equilibrium among different body tiss ues. S o much so that the scope and importance o f good sle ep has been equa ted with the soundness o f health enjoyed by a person. There is n o physiolog ical system in the body which doesn't get th e salutary effect of sound and soothing slee p. Untim ely and excessive slee p takes away both happiness and longevity. The same sle ep, if properly enjoyed brings happiness a nd longev ity in human beings as real k nowledge brings about spiritu al power in a yogi. Indic ation of day sleep: Sleeping duri ng the day time in all s eason is pr escribe d for those who ar e exha usted by singin g, study, alcoholic drinks, s exual acts, elimi natio n therapy, carrying heavy weight, walking long dist ance; those suffering from phthisis, wasting diseases like t uberculosis, t hirst, pa in, dysp noea, h iccup , insanity, those who are too old, too young, weak a nd emaciate; those inj ured by f all and assault, those exh austed by journey by a vehicle, a nger, grief and fear, and those who are accustomed to day slee p i.e they are wo rking in night . By this t he equilibrium o f dhatus a nd strength are maintained and kapha nourish es th e orga ns and ensures longevit y. In summer seas on nights be come s horter and vata ge ts agg ravate d in t he body due to the absorptio n of fluid (ad ana kala). Therefore, during this seas on, sleep duri ng the daytime is prescribe d for all. Contra-indi cations of day sleep: Sleeping duri ng the daytime in the seasons o ther than summer is n ot advisible as it causes vitiatio n of kapha and pitta. Pers ons with excessive fat, those who are a ddicted to taking unctuous s ubstances, those with d ue the vitiatio n of kapha and those suffering fr om artificial p oisoning should n ever sleep during day time. If one violat es th e prescription regarding sleep during th e day time, he would s ubject hims elf to halimak a (type o f jaundic e), headache, timidn ess, h eaviness o f the body, malaise, loss o f digestive power , hridaya- alepa ( a feeling as if phlegm a dhered to the heart), o edema, anorexia, nausea ,si nusistis, eases the throat, impairme nt of the memory and intelligenc e, obstructio n of the circulati ng channels o f the body, fever, weakness o f sensory and motor organs a nd enhancement of the toxic effects of artificial p oisons. S o one should k eep in vie w the merits an d demerits o f sleep in various se asons and situatio ns so that it may bring happiness t o him. Dream s: After ho urs o f working( physical or mental) our m ind & body ne ed rest , so that they are once again c harged. But when we are dreaming duri ng sleep our m ind is still working , it is'nt taking res t. That is wh y people who dre am often are n ot feeling fresh( mi nd is n ot recharged) even a fter long ho urs o f slee p , or they want to sleep more in t he daytim e. The quality of sleep is hampered due to dreams wh ich in turn h ampers o ur thi nking/ working process & thus qualit y of life in t he long ru n.Effect of night a wakening: Awakening duri ng night ughness daytim e unctuousn ess a nd dosing in sitting po sture does neither cause ro ughness nor u nctuousness. Methods and m easure s to induce a good s leep : If for some reason or other, one is s ubjec ted to sleeplessn ess, h e can ins tantaneously be cured by ayurvedic her bal m assage, u nctio n, hot herbal ba th, intake o f soup of domestic mars hy and aquatic a nimals, S ali rice w ith curd, m ilk, herbal u nctuous su bstance and herbal alcohol, p sychic pl easure, s mell o f scents a nd hearing sounds o f one's own Ayurveda believes t hat usually it is t he vitiate d \"vata\" which d isturbs the natural body physiology and results i n var ious types o f sleep disturb ances. Adverse p hysical sit uatio ns suc h as like pa inful conditio ns, cra mps, an urge t o urin ate freque ntly etc can interfere with so und slee p. Social situations like an irregular ro utine, noise, excessi ve use of caffeine and alcohol a nd eating a very heavy meal clos e to bedtime m ay also r uffle the sleep pattern. I n most cases , howeve r, the cor e pro blem is emotional which inclu des anxiety , stress a nd depressio n. There are a number o f ways which can help a person to fall asleep m ore easily . The most important of these is to establish a bed time \"ritual\" compos ed of a daily timetable a nd proper sleeping environment. Short-ter m slee p dist urbances c an be overcom e by adopting taste, samvahana (rub bing the body by h and), ap plicatio n of smoothening oin tment to the eyes, head massage, c omfortable b ed, home and proper tim e. simpl e me asures like c utting ba ck on coffee and tea, especially in the late eveni ng hours, and avoiding alcohol, which m ay help sleep onset but causes e arly mo rning wakef ulness. Taking a light a nd timely dinner, avoiding lat e night TV program mes and following an exercise schedule red uce s tress an d help bring sound sleep. Ayurveda offers many herbs a nd other cl assic medicines and herbal t herapies( SHIRODHARA ) for goo d sle ep and most of these are safe and devoid o f any hangover or addictio n. For m ild-to-mo derate cases of insomnia , taking twice a day two gm powder o f ashwagandha, amla, br ahmi and shankhp ushpi (all crushe d qual parts) is qui te helpful. Aswagandharishta, Sarsva tarisht a, Brahm i Vati are assic medicines . Another her b called sarpgandha is famous f or its s omnole nt effect, but all of the above mention ed herbs should b e used only un der e xpert su pervision. Except for the cases of senile i nsomnia a nd sleepless ness a ssociat ed with other chronic ailments, long- term use of sleep-inducing m edicin es should always be avoide d. Caus es of In somnia :Elimin ation p urgation and emesis, fear, anxiety , anger , smoking, excessive physical exercise, excess bl ood letting / loss, fasting and uncomfortable b ed are caus es for insomnia . The above mentioned factors al ong w ith overwork, stress, o ld ag e, dis eases , speciall y these due to the vitiatio n of vatta like colic pain, etc. ar e known to cause sle epless ness eve n in normal in dividuals. So me are insomniac even by na ture. Bramha char ya: It refers to the state of life when any li ving being re frains from excessi ve sensuality . This state does not mean a complete sexual a bstin ence but to indulge in s ex in such a way , so as not to have a ny adverse e ffect on health. Ayurveda insists on refraining oneself form sexual ac tivities duri ng academic years (masturba tion) and is defined as Bramhacharya ashram. Ayurveda advocates sexual intercourse a fter marriage in the form of gruhastha ashram but here als o excessi ve indulgence is pr ohibit ed as it l eads to loss o f physical stre ngth, m emory, lack o f vitalit y, increas es irr itability (because of loss o f oja ,which is pro duced after consi derable am ount of sperm is st ored i n the body) and disturbs t he normal physiological functions of the body by causing a dis-equilibrium o f the three doshas. Ayurveda looks u pon sex not merely as fun but as the means of procre ation. Ayurveda believes in t he principle where excess in a ny walk o f life be it food, sleep or sex causes h arm to the body. All of this e mphasize on the regula ted functioning of the three tria ds i.e food, sleep & sex THE SI X SEASO NS PART ONE North ern an d Southern Movem ents of the Sun The seasons are d efined according to the two directio ns in which t he sun appears t o be moving. As the earth makes its annual voyage around the sun, we als o experienc e six distinct phases called the seasons. The northern an d southern move ments o f the sun ar e cre ated mainly by the ear th's relati onshi p to the sun and the mo on. The northward move ment of the sun, kn own a s adana kala in Sanskrit, begins with th e winter an d ends before the beginning o f summer. The southern m ovem ents start at the summer solstice and ends at the winter solstice and is kn own a s visargakala . During the northerly phase i.e adana kala , the sun's energy is at its stronges t and sucks mois ture f rom the ear th, leavin g it dry . Also the wind conjugates with t he sun, adding to the harsh nature pervading th e three seasons in this phase. During this h alf of the year the body tends t o be weak ened by th e sun absorbing its mois ture a nd humidity . THE THREE S EASO NS IN THE NORTHERL Y PHASE OF THE SUN The three seaso ns in t he northerly phase of the sun ar e late winter , spring, and summer. From late winter, in m id-Ja nuary, the absorbing effects o f the sun and wind incre ase progressi vely until their culmin ation in m id-Ju ne, when the sun's southward m ovem ent across the earth c ommences . Due to the sun's harshness d uring th e northernl y phase, three of the six tastes bitter , astringent and pungent-are dramatic ally enhanc ed. These three tastes s hare a constricting and absorbent nature which, when u sed in the form of food, further weaken the physical organism . THE THREE S EASO NS IN THE S OUTHERL Y PHASE OF THE SUN The southerly phase i.e visagr a in Sanskrit, influenced m ore by the moon, provides a period of cooling relie f to the earth. The sun's energy begins t o wane and more m oisture is rele ased into the atmosphere. During these remaining t hree seas ons o f the year, the body tends to gain stre ngth a nd vitality . Contrary to the northerly phase, the sun's southward m ovem ent begins a period t hat gives strengt h for earth's inhabitants a nd vegetation . During this perio d, the sun and wind are also restrain ed by t he cl ouds and rains , triggering a period of cooling releas e, which begins towards t he end of summer. The stupendous powers o f the sun begin to slacke n as a res ult of the course o f the earth's movem ent, clo ud formation, and the pres ence of wind and rain . During the southerly phase, the natures of the three re maining tastes, sweet, sour, and salty are grea tly enhanced. As a result , they contribu te to bulk a nd vigour when used in the body. The three seaso ns cre ated by the southward m ovem ent o f the sun are the rainy season or early fall, au tumn and early winters f rom mid June until towards t he beginning o f summer, the heat of the sun slacke ns pr ogressivel y until its weak est cul mina tion i n mid Novem ber. The end of the southerly phase and the begin ning of the northerly phase ma rks th e important junction o f the changing seaso ns. Daily and Seasona l Cycles THE SE VEN D AILY CYCLES The earth is a mobile f orce, which circles t he sun, just as the moon circles the earth. The daily and seaso nal cycles are cr eated by th e earth's dyn amic rela tions hip to both the sun and moon. Table 14 7 DA ILY CYCLE S OF THE DO pm & KAPHA:Domi nant 6:00 am- 10:00 am & 6.00pm-10 .00 pm Each day we experienc e six phases o f expansio n and contrac tion, all o f which are c ontrolled by the sun. At dawn, when t he sun is ab out to rise, t he dry, cold, mobile a spects o f Vata, gathered t hrough the night, are p revalent . At daybreak, the cool and heavy energy of Kapha begins t o flow ou t of the body as we rise f rom rest. At midday, when the sun is at its p eak and saps th e body with its h eat, Pitta prevails. In the early afternoon, as the sun's energy begins to wane, the dry, cold e nergy of Vata once more dominates. At sunset, whe n the sun has descen ded on the horizon, Kapha begins to pour ba ck int o the body to induce t he body to rest. Finally , at midnight, when t he sun is farthest away from the earth, Pitta once more prevails THE SE ASONS OF NATURAL ACCUMULATION, AGGRAVATION AND ALLEVI ATION Given that the term prakriti denotes both body constit ution and nature, it is only expect ed that with the changing seaso ns of nature there wi ll be corresp onding effects o n the panchm ahabhutas and thereby the dosh as of the constituti on( o f the human body ). C old, dry weath er for instance e nhances vata, hot humid clima te incr weath er aggra vates kapha. To such continu l eading to imbal ance of the dosh as, Ayurveda prescribes a seasonal r outin e to pres erve the doshic bal ance as the seasons ch ange. F or each seaso n therefore, there is a unique diet (ahar), a distinc t mode of living (vihara) and routine liv ing (karya). These keep your d oshas in a state of equilibrium a nd help you c ope with the stresses and strai ns of changing seasons. Table 15 Accumulation Aggravation Alleviation VATASummer Rainy season ,early fall, Late winterAutumnPITTARainy seasonAutumn Early winterSpring winter: During winter , the digestive power o f human beings p ossessing goo d health (strength) is enhanced due to the restraint caused upon it by the cold wind, so m uch so that it is c apable of digesting any f oodstuff irrespective of its he aviness a nd quantity . When it does not get pro per fuel, the digestive fire affects the nutritive fluids, resulting in the vitiation of vatta having cold quality . Therefore, during th e winter on e should take u nctuous, s our, salty and sweet juices of the meat of the aqu atic a nd mars hy animals, wh ich are fatty. One should a lso e at the me at of burrow -dwell ing an imals that eat by s natching. Thereafter, one should drink h erbal wine a nd have h oney. If a person habitually takes pre paration o f cow's milk, ca ne juice, f at, oil, n ew rice a nd hot water during th e winter his s pan of life is n ever decreased. In winter o ne should r esort t o ayur vedic h erbal ma ssages, unction, applicatio n of oil o n the head, fomentation , and one should reside in an underground resi denc e or a n inner heated apartment. In the winter one should see that the conveyance , bedding and seat are wel l covered speciall y by h eavy wrappers, silken cloth rop es an d blankets. One should wear h eavy and warm cloth es and should b esmear h is bo dy with he avy aguru (Aquilaria agalloch a Roxb, ki nd of herb). One should embrace a healthy wom en with h er we ll develo ped plu mpy breasts, a nd with her body besmeared with aguru (Aquilar ia agalloch a Lin n), lie d own on the bed intoxicated with stro ng passio n and may indulge in excessi ve sexual int ercourse d uring th e winter. One should avoid f ood and drinks, which ar e liable to vitiate vata; o ne should not expos e him to cold wave. Und er feeding s hould be avoide d. Dieteti cs and Regim en for spring : During the spring, th e accumulat ed kapha is lique fied by th e heat of the sun and as such disturbs th e power o f digesti on and causes m any dis eases . So, one should a dminister therapies like em esis, etc. and should avoid h eavy, unctuous, s our a nd sweet diets. O ne should n ot sleep duri ng day time. At the adven t of spring one should habitually resort t o exercise, u nctio n, oral gargles a nd collyrium. The excret ory sh ould be regularl y washed with luk ewarm water. One should b esmear h is bo dy with ch andana (Sa ha Roxb.) a nd take food consisting of barley and wheat, meat of sarab ha rabbit , antelope, common quail and gre y par tridge. One should drink h erbal wines m ade of barley . One should als o enj oy the company of wome n and blosso ms o f the garden . Dieteti cs and Regim en for summ er : During the summer, the sun evap orates the mo isture of the ear th by its rays. In that season, the intake of sweet , cold liquid and unctuous diets and drinks is prescribe d. One who takes cold mantha (a type of herbal drink) a long wi th sugar as well as the meat of the animals or birds o f aired clim ate, ghee and milk a long with Sali rice (Ory za satiu nm Linn) during this season does not suffer from any dise ases. One should either drink a lcohol in little quan tity or should avoid it, and even i f one drinks he should dri nk it al ong with pl enty of wate r. One should f urther avoid t aking diets , which are s alty, sour, punge nt or hot. Physical exercise is also to be given up during this se ason. During th e day time o ne should sleep in a n air cooled apartment. During the night , after having be smeared the body with sandal wood p aste, one should sl eep on the open airy roof (under t he cooler or air- conditioning) of the house, which is cooled by t he rays of the mo on. One should k eep him aloof of sexual interc ourse (restrict a s much as possible) a nd should e njoy gardens , cold water and flowers during t his season . Dieteti cs Reg imen for r ainy season : The body, which is weakened during the peri od of dehydratio n, with its digestive s ystem, is also weakened. It is further weakened due to the vitiation of vata and other dosas during the rains. The power to diges tion i n the period is a lso a ffected due to the gas coming out of the earth, rai nfall, incr ease of acidity in wate r. So it is advisable to be moderate a s regard t o diet and regime n during the rainy season. One should abstain from taking diluted drinks i n excess, d ay sleep, frost, water , (excessive) exercise, m oving in s un, and too much in dulgenc e in s exual intercourse. One should generally use honey in their diet and drinks. If these days are cooler du e to heavy rains a ccompanied by the storms, o ne should take food that is a littlle s our, salty and unctuous; this s erves a s an effective an tidote to the vitiatio n of vata d uring the rainy season. In order to maintain normal p ower o f digesti on one should t ake old barley , whea t and Sali rice (Oryza sa tivum Linn.) alo ng with the m eat of arid ani mals a nd vegetable soup. M ore ove r, one should dri nk th e madhvika or arista (herb al type of liquor), pure rainwater or water - boile d and cooled, mixed with little honey. It is a dvisable to apply herbal b ody scrubs , ayur vedic massages, t ake bath and wear fragrant garla nds d uring the season. One should wear light and cle an apparel a nd should resi de in a house devoid o f humidity. Dieteti cs and Regim en for autumn: The body parts a dopted for rains a nd cold is suddenly expos ed to the heat of the sun with the begin ning of autumn so the pitta accumula ted during t he rai ns gets gen erally vitiated. In this season , sweet, light c old a nd bitter foods and drinks, which h ave po tentialities t o alleviate pitta, are to be taken in pr oper quantity when there is go od appetite. Further more, the me at common qu ail, Grey Partridge, a ntelope, sh eep, wapiti, ra bbit, rice, barl ey and whe at are prescribe d during this seaso n. Intake o f ghee prepared with bitt er me dicines, p urgation, and bloodletting are a lso pr escribed for this se ason. One should avoid t aking su nbath, fat, oil, and meat of aquatic a nd marshy animals, alk aline s alt pre parations a nd curd in food. One should not sleep during day time and should n ot exp ose hims elf to frost and wind. The water which is expos ed to the heat of the sun during th e day time and to the cooling rays of the moon during, is also purified by time and is d etoxicated by st ar canopus (agagastya) is known as \"hamsodaka\", which is s potlessly clear a nd is as beneficial a s nectar f or the purpos e of bathing, dri nking and swimming. Use o f garlan ds ma de of autumnal flowers and clean apparel and als o the rays of moon in the eve ning are exce edingly beneficial in this season . Season s and Str ength Note: S = Southern SEarly wane period) NSpring, vasan ta March t ; moderate strengt h (wane peri od) NSummer, grisma May to July ; minimum s trength (wane perio d) S Rainy season (e arly fall), varsa July to September minimum stre ngth (p eak p eriod) SAutumn, sarada September t o Novem ber ; moderate strength ( peak perio d) A Woman' s Season There is an additional s easo n for women which h appens once every month during menstru ation. The beginning perio d of the full moon is th e natural cycle f or ovulatio n. Receiv ing th e essence o f the m oon at this time, a wom an's sexual i mpuls es heigh ten and her vitality is once more replenish ed. Then, during the time of the new moon she exp erienc es th e natural cycle of menstru ation. Me nstrua tion is c aused by t he sun absorbing energies f rom the earth, which in turn draw s the menstru al waste fr om the body. When the cyc le has not been tampered with by us e of contrace ptive pills and other b irth c ontrol d evices, harmful foods and activities, and disruptive sexual a ctivities, t he natural e bb and flow o f a wom an's monthly cycle re mains in harmony . Regi men to be observed by women in their Menses: During the perio d of menstruati on, a ctivities n eed to be reduced to the esse ntial s o that the body exp eriences the leas t degre e of interference. Quick warm s howers, or sp onging (wiping down t he body), is th e appropriate means of bodily cleaning during me nstruatio n. She should avoid cry ing nor take a head bath. A woma n should r efrain from all sexual f oreplay & intercourse. Day sleep and colly rium d uring the first four days of her peri ods s hould be avoide d. C onsid ered a very fragile p eriod for a woma n, this tim e is t o be used to rest a nd to allow the body to em pty it s elf before it is ren ewed. She should als o not indulge in loud and excessi ve la ughter a nd talk, nor s hould sh e hear lo ud noises. Fo od should b e easy to digest , not too heavy, not too unctuous, n or too dry or cold . She should avoid f atiguing work. All th e above things during menses may lea d to the vitiation of doshas, which may es pecially lead to gynaec ological probl ems. One may observe these rules i n ord er to event ually restore your natural cycle. During ovula tion, Pitta is m ost dominant, while Vata dominates the perio d of menstruatio n and Kapha the period follow ing me nstruati on. Seasonal Cleansing Therapi es for Each Do sha VATA: SEASONS OF AGGRAVATION Rain y: Season (E arly Fail) During the rainy seaso n, the earth rele ases m ore gases in to the atmosphere, which te nds to aggravate V ata. Furth er agg ravation is creat ed by the dampness o f the rainy seaso n and the higher aci dity in t he water at that time. The rainy peri od comes at a time when t he body, having endured the long and hars h time o f the northerly phase. Even through th e rainy season marks the begin ning of the southerly phase, a period of strength ening, t he body is still to vulnerable to resist th e onslaught o f the rains . Vata is th e dosha that leaps ou t of bounds very quickl y and is th us afflicted somewhat consisten tly throughou t the year . Howeve r, it requires special help at the end of the peri od of major agg ravation , which begins i n the summer a nd runs in to and througho ut the rainy season . Thus Vata's first annual cleansing period comes b etwee n the early and late phases o f the rainy seas on. Although V ata's main s eason of alleviatio n is th e rainy season (early fall), t he next appropria te cle ansing p eriod o ccurs a t the end of autumn. NOTE: In te mper ate climates, where there is no defin itive rain y season, the vit iation of Vata stil l occurs a t this t ime due to the northerl y movement of the sun; therefore, the same seasonal reco mmendations appl y. Late w inter Late winter is t he next se ason in which V ata is gen erally alleviated. The extrem e cold ness o f winter i ncreases the alre ady cold n ature o f Vata, and the body requi res the great est a mounts of physical warmth and nourishing foods. When not amply protected or f ed, the body begins to eat its own tiss ues, and Vata becomes aggravate d as a result. No urishing, warm f oods with sour, sweet, and salty tastes a re rec ommended to balance V ata during this ti me of year . Ayurvedic ma ssages, warm a tmosphere and clo thing are all de emed vital so that Vata may remain b alanced througho ut this season . NOT E: Although there ar e some c ooling fluences in tr opical a nd semi-tropical clim ates at this ti me of year, the late winter cle ansing progra ms reco mmended do not apply. Summ er Vata may b ecome mildly disturbed during the summer, due to the reductio n of Kapha in the body cause d by th e heat of the sun. Vata may b e nurture d at this time by sweet and nourishi ng food, decreased sexual ac tivity. Autumn The end of autumn is gen erally consid ered to be the tim e when all three doshas ca n be relieved of their excesses. Therefore, if Vata's condition was no t alleviated during the rainy season , it m ay be removed through th e elimina tion t herapies a t the end of the autumn season . Ayurveda prese nts a vast a nd illumina ting grou p of healing th erapi es. Although m any o f its practic es have b ecome virtually extinc t, we are fortunate to have a practicing knowledge o f the Panchakar ma a nd its supporting therapies . Pancha kar ma therapies i nclud e those treatments that cle anse and elimina te the aggravate d doshas an d rejuvenate the body. This helps th e tiss ues a nd doshas to regain t heir equa nimity , which lea ds to sound health. The therapies and the proper tim e to apply them are described below. These therapi es may be used by all b ody types, a ccording to how th e doshas ar e behaving. tion e nemas, as well as medicat ed herbal oil en emas, to clear t he excess dosha from the large int estin es. Enema decoc tion a re derived from herbs (per mutation and combination o f more than 100 herb ) suc h as castor, dashamula, gotu kola, and liquorice medicat ed herbal oil enema is u sually administere d as a These enemas he apana vata t its n ormal downwa rd flow and soothe Vata dist urbances i n the body. Pind a Sw eda: The Ayurvedic us e of fomentation therapy to thoroughly invigorat e the body. This therapy stim ulates th e vital tissu es an d orga ns, while alleviating body pai n. Swed an (fomentation) th erapy also removes f ear from the mind. Abhyanga: The applica tion of the Ayurveda system of massage, u sing herbal me dicated oils, sesame oil, s andalwood oil, a nd so on. Abhyanga is a vital Ayurvedic practic e used to res tore eq uanimity to the body's muscular system. This ma ssage a lso pr omotes both peace of mind and stre ngth o f limbs an d is h ighly rejuvena ting. Shiro vasti : The Ayurvedic p ractice of pouring medicated oil o n the head and allowing it to remain for a period of time. This therapy pro motes m ental clarity, stimula tes m emory power, removes stress, arrests hairfall a nd hairgre ying and completely revitali zes th e body. Shirobha yang a: The Ayurvedic a pplication of medicat ed oils to the head. Various Ayurvedic herbs (per mitaio n and combination o f more than 250 herb ) suc h as bremh i,avala,s hankpushpi e tc are boiled in ses ame oil in preparati on for shirob hyanga. The head is then amply ma ssaged with the oil, gi ving life and balanc e to the sense organs a nd rejuvena ting the entire bo dy. PITTA : SEASO NS O F AGGRAVATION Autumn Accu mulated Pitta from the rainy seaso n becomes aggravate d during t he autumn seaso n, a time when t he digesti ve fire is alrea dy tremendously affected by the long an d dry perio d of the previous n ortherly phase. Pitta is f urther a fflicted by the extrem e conditio ns of the rainy season that precedes a utumn. As the sun begins t o bright en the sky, providing t he heat necessary to eva porat e the moisture o f the rainy season just p asssed, it affects the vulnerable Pitta, causing v itiation of both the digesti on and blood syste ms . At this ti me, the liquid t hat Pitta has accumula ted during t he rai ny season dampens the digestive fir e, res ulting in a loss o f appetite. In order for Pitta to retrieve its n ormal an d excelle nt digesti on, the Ayurvedic purgative therapy of virecha na is recom mended (S ee below). The best time of the autumn season for any form of cleansing therapy is at its tail e nd , i.e. the latter part of the season when t he dosha is i n its mo st fluent form. Note - In tropi cal and sem i-tropica l climates, the best time is at the end of autu mn. Rain y Season There are many Ayurvedic he aling therapies that may be observed during b oth the rainy season and through out the autumn perio d. These includ e ma ssages, using aro matic and cooling oils s uch a s coc onut oil c ombined with sandalwood e ssential oil; daily body brushing with herbal body scru bs ; a ltering one's activities to those t hat are milder and more harmonious, especially during the initial st ages of doshic vulnerability; aroma therapy using herbal oils (p ermu tation and combin ation of more than 100 like m int, liquorice (yashti madhu), sandalwood, jasmi ne, or veti ver (ush eer), to calm the mind and stomach. Pitta S easonal Clean sing Ther apies utation a nd combinatio n of more than 500 herbs) to clear t he lower pa thwa ys of the body. This therapy hel ps to purify th e blood and to cle anse the stomach, sweat glands , small intestines , colo n, kidneys, li ver, and spl een. Substances suc h as psyllium husk(isa bgol), castor oil, cow's milk with ghe e, trivrrita and triphala are used to induce p urgation . Rakta Mokshan a: Although this for m com monly referred to as bloodl etting, is seldo m used in India today, and is illegal in the U nited States and Europe, when p erformed correctly it is a n effective form of therapy to extract toxins fr om the blood. Generally , toxins th at accu mulated under the skin a nd around the marma points (t he energy junctions o f the body's meridians) ar e elimin ated through t he proc ess o f blood-let ting. Because Pitta manifests in the waste products o f blood, many skin ail ments, s uch a s ras h, eczem a, and acne, are caused by toxins circulating in t he blood syste m. The drawin g of a small amount of blood from the vein relieves th e blood tension crea ted by these toxins. Internal use of certain bitter herbs (per mutation and combination o f more than 100 herbs ) such as neem, manjisht a, sariva, gud uchi a turmeric etc, may als o be used to purify t he blood. Shirodha ra: The use of a decoctio n, suc h as me dicated ghee and buttermilk, s ugarca ne juice, and herbal o ils on the forehead, to relie ve burning sens ations or p ain in the head and body. In the tradition al Ayurvedic a pplication , the person lies down o n a wide, s easo ned, wood en log. A vessel c alled dhara chatti, which rese mbles a wide top funnel, or a dhara p atra, a pot with a hole in bottom, is u sed, through which t he medicat ed herbal oil is drip ped rhythmically onto the centre o f the forehead where t he third eye is l ocated. Shiro dhara is a beautiful therapy which s timula te our subco nscious mind and lulls the entire b odily orga nism in to a state of calmn ess. This therapy is used to balance all thr ee doshas, employing me dicated oils and substances be st suited to the different doshas and various ail ments. Kapha : seasons of aggra vation Spring Although K apha enjoys th e strongest s tamina of the three doshas, it exp erienc es its f ragilit y in the springtim e. After the long, cold, and inert periods o f early and late winter , Kapha begins to soften so that most of the semi-frozen wastes acc umulate d during the previous s easo ns liquify. Kapha's imbalanc es are expresse d through t he feeling o f lethargy, cold, sore t hroat, lu ng congestion, cold body extre mities, a nd so on. Winter changes t o spring, almost a t the very height of the nor thernly phase o f the sun, when s trength and vigor tend to become depleted by the sun's harshness. The softening o ut of liquid waste in the body retards both the digesti ve fire and the body's metabolism , which is why Kapha's potential listless ness a nd lethargy increase . The gap b efore the full bloom of the spring se ason is the best ti me of the year for the kapha dosha to be thoroughly cleansed by means of both the elimination therapies and rejuven ative therapies . These processes relieve the excess do sha when it is in its mo st fluid form and not yet ro oted in t he body in the form of disease. Kapha then has plenty of time to mobilize during th e remaining season and does not caus e obstruc tion i n the channels. Rain y Season Kapha experie nce si milar difficulties during th e rainy season (early fall), a time when t he spring seas onal process is reversed. The end of the summer he at and the ensuing declin e in strengt h is brac ed up by t he damp and humid cold of the rainy season. During this peri od, reple nishing th erapi es us ed balance i nclud e: se asonally inh alatio n therapies usi ng aromas suc h as eucalyptus and aromatic s moke S easonal Cleansing The rapies Vamana also known a s emesis therapy , is a n ancient therapeutic method for eli mina ting Kapha's accumula tion t hrough the oral p athway. Vamana releases c ongestio n from the lungs an d provides immedi ate relief for asthmatic an d bronchial a ttacks. V amana is u sed for serious K apha disord ers and in ski n dise ases , diabetes, c hronic dis orders o f the lungs and stomach, sinusitis a nd tonsillitis. Oil massage a nd fomentation applied t o the ches t on the eve ning before the emesis t herapy is the preliminary steps t aken to induce the state most conducive to this th erapy. Nasya:It is the nasal applicatio n of medication i n both powder a nd liquid f orm. The powdere d medication is i nserte d into the nose through a tube and the liquid m edication is ap plied with a dropper. The nose is t he gatewa y to the cerebral, s ensory, and motor functions o f the body. Disorders ass ociat ed with th e movem ent of prana ar e usually correct ed by n asya therapy . Excess ka pha stor ed in the throat, nose, sinus, and head are also removed from the body as a res ult of nasya. Herbal p owders, s uch a s brahmi, shatavari etc as well as substances suc h as m ilk, ghe e, medicated oils, ginger an d garlic etc a re used, depending on the dosha and the nature of the disord er. Relationship Bet ween the Dosh as and the s easons The doshas are to the body what t he seasons are to the earth. Both the doshas a nd the seasons are cre ated from the five e lements. The elemental aspects o f the seasons are in the form of space, wind, sun, moon, rain , and the earth. H ere, we mu st understa nd the interpla y between the doshas a nd the seasonal i nfluences within t he primacy of the five elements. The doshas are n ot simply the dyna mic energy within th e body; rat her they are influenced primarily by seas onal variatio ns. K nowledge o f the seasons is rel ated to the balancing of the doshas . Therefore, a thorough u ndersta nding o f the function of the doshas within t he body necessita tes a n understa nding o f the variations within e ach season, the junctio n between seasons , and the annual rot ation of the six seasons. In many cases, the designated seaso nal tastes an d qualities appear to be contradict ory.

I n excess h owever it m ay caus e diseases arising f rom fat and excess kapha e.g. obesity , skin infections , unconsci ousn ess, diabetes, e nlargem ent of neck glands or maligna nt tumors et c. Salt The water & fire in salty taste incre ases pitta and kapha. It clears ob structi on of channels a nd pores an d increases the digestive activit y and salivation . Also res ponsi ble for lubricatio n and sweating, it p enetrates th e tiss ues. An excess o f it may ca use b aldness a nd grayin g of the hair, wrinkles, t hirst, skin diseases, blood dis orders a nd loss o f body strength . Pungent Fire & air i n pungen t increas es vata and pitta ve, causes irritatio n, brings secre tion from the eyes, n ose & m outh, and gives a burning sensatio n to the mouth.

Its excess us e causes stasis o f food without digestion, flatulenc e, pain in the cardiac region , emaciation, loss o f virility, obstructi on of channels and constip ation. BALANCING SEASON AL TASTES AND BODY TYPE TASTES The apparent contradictio ns be tween the tastes a nd qualities b eneficial to each body type, and the tastes and qualities suggeste d by the cyc lical na ture of the seasons are to be underst ood in t he follow ing wa y: The tastes which are generally good for each body type may become heighte ned or pr evalent in the body and extern al environm ent due to seaso nal influences. For exa mple , of the six tastes, the pungent flavour na turally predominates during the summer; al though co nsidere d a gener ally good all-year taste for Kapha types, it needs to be used in the summer se ason with discretio n. This is b ecause in su mmer the punge nt taste prevails out of the six tastes.(According t o the seasonal a ccumula tion of the doshas , in summers there is d ecreas e of kapha and the pungent taste als o causes decrease in ka pha and incre ase of vata wh ich may lea d to vata/k apha disorders) Similarly , the salty taste which pre domina tes d uring autumn, although c onsid ered a generally excellent all-year ta ste for Vata types, needs to be reduced during th e autumn season, eve n by Vata typ es(According to the seaso nal a ccumulati on of the doshas i n autumn there is alleviation o f pitta, the salty taste a lso causes allev iation o f pitta which may le ad to pitta disord ers). In the early winter , the sweet t aste predominates, and although gen erally an excellent a ll-year taste for Pitta types, needs to be reduced during th e early winter, eve n by Pitta types. (According t o the seasonal a ccumula tion o f the doshas in winter there is incre ase i n kapha and sweet t aste als o causes i ncrease of kapha which m ay lead to kapha disord ers)Table 16 TASTES OF THE SEASONS Northerl y Phase (Winter So lstice to Summ er So lstice) Season Dry TastesElement Composition Dosha Late W inter Bitter Air and space Vata Spring Astringen tAir and earth Vata & Kapha Summer PungentAir and fire Vata & Pi tta Note: the dry tastes ar e cre ated by the progressi ve northward m ovem ent of the sun Southerl y Phase (Summer Solsti ce to W inter S olstice) Season Dry TastesElement Composition Dosha Rainy Season (early fall)SourEarth and firePitta and and SweetWater earthKapha Note: the m oist tastes ar e crea ted by the progressi ve southward m ovem ent of the sun Benefi cial Tastes According to Dosha s Vata: sweet, Pitta:Sweet, bitter, astringent Kapha: punge nt, bitter, astringent Table 17 SEASON AL ADJUSTMENTS VATA PITTAKAPHA LATE WINTERMajor: sour, cool, lightMinor: bitter, Major: sweet, salty, warm, m oderate unctuous, alk t, cool, alk alineMinor: bitter, salty SUMMER Major: sweet, sour, warm, m oderate unctuousMajor: sweet, bitter, cool, m oderate unctuousMajor: bitter, astringent, moderate sweet, warm, dry Minor: cool, lightMinor: astringen t, lightMinor: pungent , warmMajor: unctuousMajor: salty,* warm, moderate unctuous Tropic Major: sweet, sour, warm, lightMajor: sweet, bitter, astringent, cool, light Minor: salty, astringentMinor: pungentMajor: bitter, astringent, moderate sweet, warm, light EARLY WINTERMajor: salty, bitter,* moderate sour, warm unctuousMajor: bitter, to Vata disord ers, use bitt er as minor tas tes a nd incre ase the use of sweet a nd salty tastes during the seasons indica ted. *Pitta t ypes: If strong te ndency to Pitta disord ers, us e sour, pungent a nd salty as m inor tastes a nd increas e the use of bitter, astringent a nd sweet tastes during t he seasons indica ted. *Kapha t ypes : If strong t endency to Kapha disor ders, u se sweet,s our a nd salty as minor tastes a nd increas e the use of pungent, bitter and astringent t astes during the seasons indica ted.

See previous ch art. Important Rule s And Regulations R elated to DIET : CONCEPT OF DI ET IN AYURVED A : 1)Defination : Diet is t hat - what we eat. It includ es ever ything we eat or drink . Diet is t he cause of the ver y existence , Energy , Colo ur & 'Oja' (immunity/Ultima te purified form of all th e Sharir Dha tus i. e Body tissues) o f every living being on this earth. 2) 'Diet' is th e cause of the birt h, maintenance, & destructio n of all forms o f life on this earth. From 'Diet' only we acquire f ollowing things - c onstant growth, u nhampered gro wth , Energy , H Colo ur, Proper functioni ng of the Indriyas (Sense Organs). Improper die tis the ma jor ca use of all illness a ccording to Ayurveda. From all above statements on e can say that' In short everything depends on diet. AYURVEDIC CONCEPT OF FORM OF DIET Accor ding to Ayurveda Body is sai d to be made up of Panch Mah abhutas (Pe ntads) & hence the food also needs to be Panchbhautic (Mad e up of Panch (five) Mah abhutas) then only food can get digest ed & be utilized f or the gro wth o f Panchamahabhutas (t he basic c onstit uents of body) wh ich in turn res ults in gro wth of body. The diet should b e made up of all th e six tastes i.e . Sweet, Sour, Salty, Hot, Bitter, Astringent. It has also b een stated that acc ording to the pro perties diet again c an be of 2 types i.e. Heav y to digest , & Easy or light t o digest . Ideal Di et The ideal diet should h ave f ollowing properties:- 1) It should incre ase t he strength of body. 2) It should b e tasty/it should b e such t hat it should be liked by the one, who is taking it. 3) It should gi ve energy insta ntaneously / immedi ately after taking it. 4) It should h ave th e capacity to withhold the body & give its stre ngth & energy to carry on its regular f unctions. 5) It should s atisfy t he one taking it . 6) It should b e hot, unctuous , not dry when taken. 7) Should be taken in pro per qua ntity. 8) It should n ot be incompatible .( mentioned in uneasy combinatio ns below) The food (Diet) with all ab ove pro perties is said t o be ldeal d iet. The Diet which is o f all th e properties explain ed above c an only do the functions prescrib ed to it. 3) FUNCTIONS OF DIET (food ) 1) Instantly satisfying. 2) Gives s trength /energy. 3) Maint ains t he body & m aintains the functions o f the body . 4) Incre ases longev ity. , Recollec ting Power , & Oja . 4) TYPES OF DIE T There are four types of diet i) That which c an be drunk ii) That which c an be licke d iii) Easily chewable e.g. Rice e tc. iv) Hard food substances which ne ed to be chewed e.g. S ugarcan e, meat. Some have gi ven 6 types in additio n to the four stated above : v) which should b e sucked e.g. Ma ngo. vi) Which needs masticatio n by te eth, these inclu de ver y hard food materials e .g. various nuts. Some have s tated 8 types / forms o f food / Diet . In addition to the above 6 . vii) Those which ca n only be eaten after being gr inded into powder , various pastes etc . viii) Food substances like Suger c andy etc. 5) According to Nature - Diet h as been classi fied into 2 types He avy Diet & Light diet. Rain water , Rakt ashali (Red rice), Sa the Sali (Ol d rice), Mudga, Eina (black d eer) & lava (kind o f bird und in airid regions) are light / laghu . Milk, sugarcan e, fresh Rice, U dad( b lack gram) & meat of the animals from Anoop D esh - land with abundant water & p lantation (Marshy lands, equa torial Rain forests) are consid ered to be Guru (Heav y) 6) Seven Concept of Diet The follow ing p oints are import ant in the m aking the Diet co mplete - (pro moting health) or improper- (g iving Rise to various dise ases). 1) Basic n ature / properties o f the food 2) Combinati on of 2 or m ore food material ch anges t he qu alities / pr operties o f food material. 3) Due to boiling, roasting et c. there is change in t he properties o f the food. 4) Quantity of food we take. 5) Region has 2 meanings - the region where th e food is being taken & Secondly region means the are a the food is b een produc ed affects the properties o f food material. 6) The time when one takes th e food. 7) The order in which o ne takes the food. 7) TIME OF T AKING DI ET Proper excretion of urine & Stools, Dosh as go t o the there respective sthanas i.e sit es, strotasas ar e cle an and free from blockage & indriyas i.e. sense organs ar e sharp a nd attentive, o ne feels lightness of body , Belching with pro per s mell to it. W ith proper excretion of 'Apaan vayu' , Heart becomes Nirdosh a i.e. we feel like ea ting & dri nking. When all the above signs ar e pres ent then only one should eat; as this is t he proper ti me for taking the diet. It is s aid that when t he Dosh as go to their own respective pl aces & the Strotaras (ch annels) become cle an then only one should take Food. QUANTIT Y OF FOOD T O BE T AKE NIt is d ecided accordi ng to digestive ca pacity of Agni. I f Agni is weak then one should take food only once or s hould take f ood in less qua ntity. Food taken once i.e. at one time which gets digest ed completely & properly , is said to be Matra/ Quantity of food to be taken. Consid ering four parts o f the Stomach, one should take food such that 2 parts o f the Stomach get filled by the food taken, one part to be filled by water or o ther liquid matter & one part should b e kept free for the 'Vayu' / Gas to move . One should take diet in proper quan tity. The quantity of diet to be taken depends on the digestio n capacity of the perso n which var ies from person to person & so does the Matra. 20)The amount of food, which withou t dist urbing the equilibrium o f dhatus & doshas of the body gets digeste d as well as m etabolized i n pro per ti me is t o be regard ed as the pr oper quan tity. The proper qua ntity of food does depend upon the nature o f food articles. If the food article is heavy only three fourth or half of the stomach c apacity is to be filled up. Even in the cas e of light food articles excessi ve in take is no t conducive to the maintenance o f the power of digestio n & m etabolism. IMPORT ANCE OF F OOD T AKEN IN PR OPER QU ANTITY Taken in Appropriate quantity , food certainly helps t he individual in b ringing ab out stre ngth, complexion h appiness & l onge urbing the equilibrium o f dhatus & doshas of the body. Indic ated Food :- One should regularl y ( can take ever yday ) take S hastika (a kind o f rice h arveste d in sixt y days), Sali (ory za sativum), yello w gram food cooked Rock S alt, Amalaka (emblica officinalis), Rain W ater, Ghee, Me at of animals dwelling in arid climat e & Honey. Contradicted Food : One should not regularly take heavy articles s uch a s drie d me at, dry vegeta bles, l otus rhizomes & lotus st alk. On e should never t ake m eat of a dise ased animal. Moreover , one should n ot regularl y take boil ed buttermilk, ins pissiate d milk with pork , beef, meat of buffalo with fish curd , & barley . ORDER IN WH ICH ONE SHOULD T AKE THE DIET First, on e should ea t food of sweet taste for the purpose of Vata Pitta pacificatio n. Swee t taste is helpful for pacificatio n of vata d osha pr esent in the digestive tract o r intestines . Then one should take sour & salty subs tances f or they do the function of increasing t he digesti ve juices. L astly one should take food of bitter and punge nt taste for the purpose of pacification of 'Kapha' . One should take fruits like po megra nate first in t he diet. Then one should take liquid material & then lastly semis olid & s olid f ood. EIGHT FACTORS DETERMINING THE UTILITY FOOD.The Eight f actors which d etermine the utility or otherw ise o f various types of food are. 1) nature o f food articles 2) method of their processing 3) combinati on 4) Quantity 5) Habitat 6) Time 7) Rules go verning int ake of food. 8) Wholesomeness t o individual who takes it. 21) RULES FOR T AKING F OOD Healt hy individuals a s wel l as patients sh ould observe the follow ing: While having food articles which are m ost wholeso me by nature; o ne should e at only that food in pro per qua ntity which is h ot, unctuous & not contra dictory in potency & that too after the digestio n of the pr evious me al, food should be taken in proper p lace with all t he accessories, withou t talki ng & laughing wi th conc entration of mind & paying due regard t o oneself , not too fast or too slowly. Important Rule s And Regulations R elated to Diet 1) Eat to live but don't live to eat. 2) Eat food which is be neficial. 3) Eat food in a moderate qua ntity. 4) Don't eat food, properties o f which are n ot known to you. 5) Don't eat food in a hurry or when you a re in a dis turbed state of mind, full of tensions , strains, and emotional ou tbreaks.

He takes light bre akfast in the morning and the healthy and happy lif e. 9) A person who ta kes two f ull m eals in a day is calle d 'Bhogi\" i.e. a lusty and greedy person who lives mostly to eat and suffers from illness a nd or ill health from time to time. 10) A person who ta kes f ull meals m ore than two tim es is c alled Roge e or a sick pers on. He a glutt onous p erson and lives only to eat. He is a lways sick a nd away from health. 11) Don't do yogic exercises immedi ately after taking f ood. It is sa fe to do them three h ours after taking food.

Diet and Mind : Yogic an d Ayurvedic spec ts. Mo dern Die tetic c onsid eratio n is only related to body. But it is a uniqu eness of Yogash astra a nd Ayurveda inti mate rela tions hip b etween diet and mind. Both the sci ences assert with pr oofs that diet affects me ntality of a human being. S atva (virtue), Raja (Aggressi ve desire) and Tama (Ignoran t slot h) are the basic qualities o f mind. Satvagun a is alwa ys stre ngthe ning, essence , underst anding, purity , clarity , compassion and love. Raj oguna implies m ovem ent, aggressiveness a nd extro versio n and it operates on a sens ual level. Tamoguna m anifests ignoranc e, inertia, h eaviness a nd dullness. Satvagun a is a positive virtue and it strengt hens and stabilizes mi nd. Rajogun a and Tamogun a are nega tive attribu tes which d estabilise an d weak en the mind. Yet all the three attribut es are requi red of course in a balanced state and having a strong control of satvaguna are n ecessary for normal f unctioning o f the mind. As the final go al of yoga pr actition er is elevatio n and uplifting o f mental faculties to attain eternal bliss o r moksha he/she should do ever ything to go on incre asing his satvagun a through pro per di et and good behaviour . Yoga becomes th e destroyer o f all woes an d sorrows and can be accomplish ed only by him who is regulate d and moderate in die t and recreatio n, regulate d in speech a nd actions, and regula ted in thinking and sle eping t oo. The T aste Proc ess The first subjective experienc e of a subs tance on the tongue is t aste (rasa). A short ti me later, one feels h eating or co oling energy (virya). Fin ally the substances have a n action on urine , fasces and sweat (vipak). For ins tance, for hot chilli peppers, o ne immediately experiences its pu ngen t taste (rasa) and heating energy (virya) , observ ing a burni ng sensation in the faces and urine (v ipaka) . Virya - Heating or Cooling En ergy When any me dicinal herb or f ood substance is put in the mouth, the first experienc e is its taste. Later, and in some c ases i mmediately, you feel its h eating or cooling energy, either in the mouth or stomach. This change is all du e to its actio n or p otent energy called Virya. By experience , one can form general rul es ab out what a taste \"feels like \" in the body. For exam ple, t he sweet taste has a cooling energy, due to its heaviness. This a ction provokes kaph a and is p leasing to pitta and vata. But there are occasi onal exce ptions to this rule. Honey is sweet but have heating en ergy. This u nexp ected effect is termed Prabhav. In this same way , sour t aste is us ually heating expect in the inst ance of lime , which is cooling.Vipak - Post-Digesti ve Effect The final post-diges tive effect of the taste on the body, mind and conscious ness is called Vipak. While sweet and salty taste h ave a sweet vipak, sour taste has a sour vipak, but that of pungent , bitter an d astringent tastes ar e all p unge nt. Knowledge o f the energy and post- digesti ve effect of food or m edicin al her bs m akes underst anding of its actio n on bodily system easy. This knowledge b eing essential f or both healing and cooking. Prabhav - Specific Unexplaine d Action When two substances o f similar taste, energy and post-digestive e ffect show entirely different action, it is called prabhav . There is n o logical expla nation for this . All gem s tones, cry stals and mantras ai d healing du e to their prabhav. Prabhav is therefore the specific, dyna mic, hi dden action of the awaren ess pres ent in the substance. Diet P lanning Choice of Food In planning th e diet it is necessary to know which f ood to have or avoid based on ones personal dosh ic constitutio n or i mbalanc e.

Jeevan am is a synonym for water which me ans life. Life could n ot exist o n this pl anet without water. For an Ayurveda physician water is n ot only an essential nu trient but is o ne among t he five b asic el ements essential f or the cre ation of this u niverse. I t is Jala mahabhoot i. e water el ement. Accor ding to charak a liquid, unctuous, cold, soft, sticky & sweet t aste are the attribut es of the substances pr edomin anted by water . Moiste ning, un ctuous, binding, oozing, softening and exhilarating are the effects of water y edible su bstances on the human body. Taste is als o an attribut e of jalamhabhoot. Accordi ng to caraka water is t he basis o f taste. Water is b asically tasteless but as soon as it falls from the sky gets endowed with th e properties o f the five e lements, or c omes in contact with other subs tances & taste appears in wate r. Classification of W ater: Charak a whi le describing t he various types of water mentioned that, entire water is only one which falls down a s rain f rom the sky , that while f alling or h aving fallen down depend on place and time. He further says that water while f alling down from sky & comi ng in contact with the moon the air & the sun which f ollows time, gets impregn ated with the pro perties of cold, hot, unctuous, non unctuous etc. & so on, as it rests o n the ground. Soil & The W ater : Accor ding to Ch araka the pur e rain water has by nature six qualities namely cold, pure, wholeso me, palatable, cle an & light. B ut whe n water f alls o n earth its pro perties change according to the soil on which it has fallen. In white s oil it becomes a stringent , in p ale it becomes bi tter, in br own a lkaline , in u sara i. e red salin e, in hilly area pungent , & in black soil it becomes sweet. The water from rain, h ailsto ne and snow is ta steless . The S eason & The W ater : Accor ding to charak a- (1) The fresh rain water o f the rainy season is heavy, cas es bl ockage t o the channels & sweet. That of autumn is thi n, light, a nd which does not block t he channels in the body. (2) In early winter water is un ctuous, aphrodisiac, stre ngth pr omoting & heavy. (3) In later winter it is light a nd alleviates kapha & vata. (4) The water of spring seas on is a stringent , sweet & rough. (5) In summer it is no n blocking for channels. The Riv er & Th e Water : Charak acharya ha s describe d the properti es of water from different rivers. It' s a a huge ecological o bservatio n. It shows th e wisdom & the ext ent of eco-friendly nature of orien tal thinking. The river originating from Himalayas , c onstantly used by th e sages having water th at is obstruct ed, agit ated & beaten is wholes ome & vi rtuous , says Charak a. (Acc ording to modern scienc e the water agita ted & b eaten by the big sto nes in the bed of the river co ntains mor e oxygen). Those orig inating fr om Himalaya, carrying stones & sand have clean water wh ich is like ne ctar. This rive rs flowin g towards west h ave cle an water & are wholes ome whi le those joining th e eastern se a are mo stly mild flowing & do not have clean water . Good W ater The water which f alls from the sky is called as Aindrya Jal a. It is th e princi pal drinking water . Best water is sli ghtly astringent , sweet, thin, non slimy , light, n on rough & does not block the channels o f the body says Ch araka . Jala Mahaboot & Human Bod y : While describing the predomina nce o f Mahabhootaas in human body in Charak s amhita Charak acharya cle ared s tated that, the liquid, m obile, d ull, u nctuous , soft & slimy , plasma, blood, fat, kapha, pitta, urine , sweat etc. along wi th the taste & gust atory sense are predomina ntly ma de up to Jal a Mah abhoot. These ar e the watery ingredi ents of the body. Udak avaha Srota s : Strotas ar e defined as transporting passages of dhatus un dergoing tra nsformation. For ud akavaha sro tas, t he orign is palate & pancreas. The symp toms of their affliction are dryness o f tongue, palate, lips, t hroat, pancre as & excessi ve thirst. The signs mentioned above are the early signs o f dehydratio n irrespective o f the cause . It is clear f rom the description m entioned above th at the udakavah a stro tas is m ent for maintaining the water balance of the body. *Rules for water intak e: Water should not be taken before food as it d iminis hes t he digesti ve fire in the stomach & hampers digestio n. Water with food( advise d in c ases o f regular s tones in t he excre tory syst em) causes weight gain & postpones digestion . Water after food hampers diges tion & aggravates kapha, because o f which on e feels d rowsy. Cold water t aken in n ormal & c old clim ates causes c onstip ation, bowel syndrom e,& weight gain. It should alwa ys be taken in hot temperatures . Hot / lukewarm water is goo d for digestio n, alleviates vata & kapha & is fat - cutting. Thus should b e used in o besity. This should b e avoi ded in hot temperatures , pitta dis eases & persons o f pitta cons titutio n. An ideal time for drinking water a fter meals is a t least h alf an hour after you h ave had food . Drinking a glass of luke-wa rm water helps flush out all t oxins accu mulated overnight in t he body, is hel pful in co nstip ation & relieves o ne of gas es. *lukewarm water s hould be avoide d by pitta body types in s ummers, o r if a person is s uffering from gastric acidity.

Cow Milk & Buffalo Mi lk - An Ayurvedic View Point : Charak samhita is the oldest one in a ll Ayurvedic t ests. In the Ch arak S amhita the pro perties & the usage of cow & buffalo milk are described . The description is based on the panchamahabhautic theory. Cow Milk Buffalo Milk Properties - Best among the Properties - Enhances Rejuvena tor to nics . Sleep & decreas es excessi ve appetite. In the description from Char ak Sa mhita the properties o f cow's milk & buffalo's milk ar e compared. So the buffalo's milk is cold er, more unctuous, heavier t han the cow milk. It means though t he G unas (pro perties) ar e same in both the milk b ut their perce ntage & proportio n with each other varies in t he two typ es. This di fference in the proportio n of Mahabhuta influences th e properties o f the milk. More o f Pruthvi & Jala Mahabhuta are the causative factors o f 'Kapha dosha' and hence buffalo's milk increas e the 'ka pha dosha' in the body. Becaus e of this increas e in k apha dosha it enhances t he sleep & c ontrols excessi ve appetite. On the other h and because o f the proportio nate composition of gunas & the balance of Panchamahadhutas the cow milk is de scribed as the best rejuven ator & also it d elights the mind. Charak acharya st ated that, becaus e the properties o f cow's milk & 'Oja' are the same, the cow's milk is t he best among t he rejuv inater t onics.
