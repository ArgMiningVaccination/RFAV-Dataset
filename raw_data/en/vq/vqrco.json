Overview The Visual Analytics for Command, Control, and Interoperability Environments Center (VACCINE) was established on July 1, 2009 to co-lead, with Rutg ers University, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Ce nter of Excellence in Command, Control and Interoperability. VACCINE's mission is dedicate d to creating methods and tools to analyze and manage vast amounts of information for all mission areas of homeland security. VACCINE accomplishes its mission through an inte grated program of research, education and outreach, spanning the discip lines of visualization and co mputer graphics, engineering, computer science, geographic information systems, cognitive psychology, information technology, and emergency management and pub lic safety. VACCINE is an international center with overall management and the lead research component handled by Purdue University and the education lead directed by the Georgia Institute of Technology. The original VACCINE team consisted of 16 schools. Since July 1, 2009, the Justice Institute of British Columbia, Navajo Technical College, and Swansea University have been incorporated into the program. The VACCINE team is currently comprised of the following 19 universities with the associated Pr incipal Investigator at each school: University PI Purdue University Dr. David Ebert Georgia Institute of Technology Dr. John Stasko Pennsylvania State University Dr. Alan MacEachren Stanford University Dr. Pat Hanrahan University of North Carolina at Charlotte Dr. William Ribarsky University of Washington Dr. Mark Haselkorn Florida International University Dr. Shu-Ching Chen Indiana University Dr. Maureen Biggers Jackson State University Dr. Loretta Moore North Carolina A & T State University Dr. Gerry Dozier University of Texas at Austin Dr. Kelly Gaither Virginia Tech Dr. Chris Barrett University of Houston, Downtown Dr. Richard Alo Simon Fraser University, CA Dr. Brian Fisher University of British Columbia, CA Dr. John Dill University of Stuttgart, Germany Dr. Tom Ertl Justice Institute of British Columbia, CA Mr. Jack McGee Navajo Technical College Prof. Mark Trebian Swansea University, Wales Dr. Min Chen Figure 1 4VACCINE is strategically positioned to support the Department of Homeland Security in confronting the challenges of safeguardi ng our nation in preventing, responding to, and recovering from events in appli cations including criminal inves tigation, health surveillance, fraud detection, emergency response, natural disasters, and borde r and infrastructure security. VACCINE focuses on th e research, development, and deployment of interactive visual analytic environments for communica ting and disseminating information and deriving insight from the massive homeland security da ta deluge. VACCINE is developing tools to help homeland security personnel, responders, a nd decision makers make sense of the sea of text, sensor, audio, a nd video data by developing powerful analytical tools and interactive visual decision making environments that enab le quick, effective decisions as well as effective action and response based on availabl e resources. VACCINE integrates data and analysis into interactive visual displays to enable users to make discoveries, decisions, and plan action. Applications include public health, animal health, public safety and emergency response. Turning massive data into actionabl e knowledge through visual analytic techniques is vital to the mission of the Command, Control, and Interoperabi lity (CCI) Division of The Department of Homeland Security, as we ll as all of the mi ssion areas of DHS. VACCINE is addressing the following four of the five homeland security missions outlined in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review: Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security Mission 2: Securing and Managing Our Borders Mission 3: Safeguarding and Secu ring Cyberspace Mission Mission 4: Ensuring Resiliency to Disasters B. Global Accomplishments Since the VACCINE Center officially bega n on July 1, 2009, these accomplishments reflect a nine month period of performance. Nevertheless, the VACCINE team worked diligently to create a robust portfolio of rese arch and academic projects as well as make significant progress in our outreach activities. Highlights of our team's efforts include the data in Figure 3 as well as these activities: VACCINE reviewed and advi sed the Meadowlands Stadium Authority (NFL Giants & Jets) on security, networking, comm unications interoperability, and video surveillance plans for the ne w Meadowlands stadium. VACCINE formed a multi-agenc y public safety c onsortium in Indiana to develop tools for crime analysis, law enforcemen t planning, and decision making. We have embedded a graduate student within the law enforcement community to work directly with these agencies to u nderstand their requirements. VACCINE has been working to create a uni que corporate affiliate program in the form of a non-profit Limited Liability Co rporation. Membership will be by invitation 5only. Corporations will be complementary rather than competitive. Several companies are already in lin e to become founding members. We have formed a partnership with the Ha rrisburg, PA, Police Department to develop an extensible web-based map applica tion that supports exploration of and sensemaking about criminal activity in space and time. VACCINE developed an interactive pand emic preparedness, surveillance, and training tool for the Indiana St ate Department of Health and adapted this tool for use by the State of Washington, New Jersey, and New York. This has been used for all health districts in Indiana and at leas t two county exercises in the state of Washington. VACCINE and CCICADA have been collab oratively working on four research projects and four educati on projects. This equates to 36% of the total VACCINE portfolio. We are developing law enforcement tool s and evacuation pla nning tools for the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Departments. We are developing an interactive intelligence visual analytics tool for use by law enforcement and intelligence an alysts in the Atlanta area. The VACCINE team developed an interactiv e visual analytics dashboard with the FAZD center that was used in a DNDO nuclear detection full-scale exercise in Seattle in September 2009, working with USCG, Seattle Sector. We developed visual analytic s course modules that were used in middle school and high schools in Indiana in 2009 and 2010. We are working with the START Center to develop visual anal ytics tools for the Global Terrorism Database and Minorities at Risk databases for the START Center. We are developing visual analytics fl ooding and preparedness tools for the DHS Natural Disasters, Coastal Infrastructure and Emergency Management Center of Excellence at the University of North Carolina. VACCINE has been researching novel visual analyt ics tools for Rift Valley Fever for the FAZD Center, incorporating epidemio logical modeling as well as economic modeling and analysis. We have developed a network of Hispanic Serving Institutions and Tribal Colleges and Universities for engaging in visual an alytics and network s ecurity research and education. We are in the process of incor porating the Navajo Te chnical College into VACCINE. We have developed cybersecurity visuali zation and analysis tools for US CERT. 6 VACCINE is developing visual analytic s tools for U.S. Customs and Borders Security to analyze their gigabytes of data. We have brought the Justice Institute of British Columbia on as a VACCINE School. Planning is underway to have a Visual Analytics for Public Safety workshop in September, 2010, in Vancouver, CA. VACCINE is finalizing plans for a joint Un ited States-Germany research project to apply visual analytics to disaster preven tion and crisis response, with a focus on critical infrastructures in l ogistics, transportation, food safety, digital networks and power grids at the national levels. This project is in collaboration with several international partners, NVAC, and NCFPD. We have expanded our network of universit ies to include three new schools: Justice Institute of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC, Canada), Navajo Technical College (Navajo Nation, Arizona), and Swansea Un iversity (Swansea, Wales, United Kingdom). A map of our current members a nd our partners can be seen below in Figure 2.

Framework, Vision, Mission, and Strategy The Visual Analytics for Command, Control and Interoperability Environments Centers' overarching goal is to establish itself as the pree minent asset to the myriad homeland security and public safety agencies who are our customer s. In this context, we are developing novel tools to help the homeland secu rity community make sense of and support decision making with the massive sea of text, geospatial, transa ction, sensor, audio, vi deo and all other data sources they have to deal with on a daily basis. A. Framework The VACCINE framework (Figure 4) is based on two key components: 1. Three foundational research areas that form our basis for addressing the seven DHS Command, Control and Interoperability mission directives: Interactive Visual Analytic Foundations Visually-Adapted Analytical Techniques Investigative Analysis and Decision Making Environments 82. Mission-Driven Research, Educa tion, and Seed Projects: Integration and participati on in important homeland secu rity projects to provide real-world validation, testing, evaluation a nd a clear technology transition plan for our overall agenda. Figure 4: The VACCINE Framework These two key components provide a tightly inte grated short-term and long-term plan from theoretical foundations to vali dation and technology tr ansfer to real-world DHS mission problems. Abstracting the key elements, ge neric problems, and common challenges across these projects provides focus and guarantees long -term success to our pr ogram. We are not just deriving ad-hoc solutions to problems, but a ddressing the fundamental research and academic questions, advancing the science of visual anal ytics, and creating a solid theoretical foundation for both future research and applications of that research to diverse homeland security challenges. The Mission-Driven Research, Education, and Seed Projects are an evolvi ng set of projects to explore and solve targeted, developing DHS missi on needs. We have an annual internal seed project competition to foster the development of new ideas, including education-oriented and engagement-oriented projects. Succ essful seed projects will tr ansition into our research or education portfolio and help evolve research an d academic thrusts within each area as well. We also anticipate that our project portfolio will continue to expand as we provide solutions to other local, regional, and federal partnerships. 9 B. Vision Using the best ideas from the top scientists, the VACCINE Cent er is conducting research that will advance the science of visualization and cont ribute to solving societal global challenges; educate students who are prepared to deliver; and actively engage and support our clients with a robust technology transition program.

Research and Development Scope The overall goal of VACCINE Center research is to create innova tive and effective integrated data and visual analytic environments\u2014frame works, methods, and software\u2014that advance the start-of-the-art in analyzing ma ssive, heterogeneous, incomplete, temporally evolving homeland security data for anticipating, detecting, and responding to hom eland security mission needs. Therefore, VACCINE is devel oping new dynamic visual analyt ics techniques based on cognitive and perceptual principles that increase the effectiveness of the entire analysis process; create precision information environmen ts; create an information disc ourse environment; and enable visual analysis, knowledge synthesis, and extrac tion of insight for actionable decision making, event detection, management, and response. For effective visual an alytics, we are tightly integra ting computational processing, data management and visual representation to effici ently present relevant information and solution alternatives to the user and to improve both data management a nd statistical data modeling. To ensure successful deployment, scalability, and usability of de veloped technologies, we are integrating, evaluating, and contin uously refining our work thr ough collaborative pa rticipation in Mission Driven Research Projects (MDRPs) ra nging from emergency pl anning and response to health care monitoring to inte lligence analysis. All of our MDRPs have the following key pervasive homeland security probl em characteristics: massive, tim e evolving, heterogeneous data of varying quality; multiple-scales of problem solving, planning, management, and action; coordinated information analysis; information security and privacy ch allenges; and a wide variety of needs, skills, and computing resour ces of involved personnel. Each of our Mission Driven Research and Education Projects are report ed in detail in Sections VI and VIII of this document. To achieve our goal of creating this visualization and analytics environment, our research plan is based on three foundational research areas (previously discussed) that form our framework for addressing DHS CCI's homeland security mission directives: Interactive Visual Analytic 23Foundations, Visually-Adapted Analytical Technique s, and Investigative An alysis and Decision Making Environments. The involvement of end-user clients from the begi nning in these research pr ojects is critical to ensure real-world applicabil ity, scalability, usability, and evaluation. VACCINE acknowledges that in order to build a \"soluti on,\" it is imperative to begin w ith a \"problem.\" That \"problem\" must start with our customers. In light of th is, VACCINE has an active campaign to engage the end-user in the requirements process from the beginning. To date, we have formed five public safety consortiums which will oversee the research and development process to guarantee the usability and utility of our products. 1. Indiana Public Safety Consortium 2. Florida Division of Emergency Ma nagement's Region Seven Consortium 3. UNCC Consortium a. Charlotte Mecklenburg Po lice Department Consortium 4. Washington State Consortium 5. Penn State Law Enforcement Consortium The largest consortium, in Tippecanoe County, IN, represents over 250 law enforcement and emergency management personnel. This particul ar consortium is a VACCINE resource intended to be utilized by all VACCINE partner sc hools and the DHS CCI division of S&T. The Tippecanoe County consortium has embedde d a graduate student within the law enforcement community which gives us direct access to over 10 years of digital data. This data will allow us to conduct projects with the goals to coordinate and to improve evidence-based policing, prospective policing, and results-orien ted policing. In addition, this consortium will work to coordinate and improve emergency ma nagement's planning, response, mitigation, and recovery efforts for any emergency, manmade or natural, in a direct or supporting role. Having our customers directly inte grated with our mission-driven research projects allows them to provide input, project instigation, and rele vant feedback and transition paths for DHS technology transfer. The MDRPs are 18 to 36 mont hs in duration and our initial set includes projects leveraging successful R&D from the fo rmer RVACs and new facult y, as well as several new initiatives. All of these projects are collaborative among the universities and specific personnel initially involved in each project are identified. The MDRPs are intended to be an evolving se t of projects to expl ore and solve targeted, developing DHS mission needs. We are not just deriving ad-hoc solutions to problems, but addressing the fundamental research questions, a dvancing the science of visual analytics, and creating a solid theoretical foundation for both future research and applications of that research to diverse homeland security ch allenges. The research infras tructure and focus on common research challenges and solution te chniques provides a generic, robu st infrastructure, as well as 24tools for rapidly developing solutions for r eal-world, mission-critical homeland security problems. Our research is extending the state of th e art in many areas including the following: Theoretical work in the scie nce of analytical reasoning Fundamentals of visual representations fo r multisource, uncertain, temporally evolving, and conflicting data Data representations, integration, quality as sessment, cleaning, and reduction for massive datasets, streaming data, and multisource data integration Methods and novel visual analytic tools tailo red to user, task, a nd device requirements Mobile visual analytics for real-time applications Novel spatiotemporal modeling, de tection, and prediction techniques New multisource correlation and visual anal ysis techniques (e.g., linked animal and human health surveillance) Novel video analytics for tracking, event detection, and mobile video analytic applications Novel population distribution adaptive clus ter detection and ab erration detection techniques Novel synthetic data generation techniques fo r spatiotemporal data streams that match observed statistical properties of sour ce data but are completely anonymized Adapted presentation methods for actionable d ecision making for a diverse set of users 25V. Research Project Descriptions MDRP 1: Visual Analytics for Invest igative Analysis on Text Documents Team VACCINE: Georgia Tech : John Stasko Pennsylvania State University : Alan MacEachren, Prasenjit Mitra Simon Frasier University : Brian Fisher CCICADA: University of Southern California : Ed Hovy Abstract The goal of Pennsylvania State University with this work was to enable analysts to forage for and make sense of place-relevant information extracted from text documents linked to formal geographic information. The visu al analytic system developed can retrieve and process text documents, identify information of interest, present the information via an interactive visual interface, interactively record analyst-provided information and update the visually presented information to assist the analyst. Applications include monitoring the news media to track mass movement of people in response to events and m onitoring Twitter feeds as input to investigative analysis. One component of the re search has resulted in a prototype web application, SensePlace. The scientific goal of SensePlace is to visually and computationally support analyst sensemaking with text artifacts that have potential place, time, and thematic relevance to an analytical problem through identification and visual highlighting of named entities (people, places, times, and organizations) in documents, automated inference to determine document relevance using stored knowledge, and a visual interface with tightly coupled geographi c map, timeline, and concept graph displays used to contextua lize potentially relevant documents. The team developed techniques and tools for i nvestigative analysis on large collections of documents including both unstructured text and st ructured documents (e.g., spreadsheets). They developed systems that use inte ractive visualizations to help analysts with performing exploration, sense-making, and understanding tasks. If they could help analysts determine which documents to read first and to also find importa nt, connected documents, then they could help them to make timelier and accurate assessments of the situations de scribed within those documents. The project builds upon the Jigsaw system, and explores how new capabilities can be added to it. They also pla nned to disseminate the system for use by real clients, people, and organizations in various domains. Technical Approach Data collection methods used were compiling & sorting DB, data mining, and expert consultation. Analytic methods used were case studies, sampling, and stat istical analysis. The 26nature of research was applied, basic, consul tation, coordination/integr ation, education, hybrid basic-applied, and hybrid applied-consultation.

Other outcomes / impacts The contribution at Penn State to research on visu al analytics for investigative analysis on text documents has focused on geographic components of unstructured text information and the challenges of foraging for and sensemaking with that information. Geographic knowledge building from unstructured web sources starts with web docu ment foraging during which the immense quantity, scope and diversity of web-ba sed information create incredible cognitive burdens on an analyst's or re searcher's ability to judge in formation relevancy. Determining information relevancy is ultimately a process of sensemaking. The first half of the time period was devoted to preliminary research on visually supporting web document foraging and sensemaking and completing the implementation of the initial prototype that began under their Regional Visualization & Analytics Center f unding. More specifically, they implemented the Sense-of-Place (SensePlace) analytic environment. They demonstrated a proof-of- concept by applying the tools to an analysis of using SensePlace to uncover potential population migration, geopolitical, and other infectious disease dynamics drivers (measles epidemics) in Niger. Their analysis allowed them to demonstrate how their approach can support analysis of complex situations along (a) multi- scale geographic dimensions (i.e., vaccine cove rage areas), (b) temporal dimensions (i.e., Figure 1: Screen shot of SensePlace. 28seasonal population movement and migrations), a nd (c) diverse thematic dimensions (effects of political upheaval, food securit y, transient movement, etc.). Figure 1 was a snapshot during a SensePlace anal ysis session. In this figure, the analyst was examining place references and thematic dimensi ons related to a story about a food crisis in Niger. In figure 2 below, the diagram illustrates the process used for foraging and sense making. The tool searched the web for text documents about a particular geog raphic location using the search terms entered by the user. Retrieved documents are displayed in the Results tab and analyzed by the user through the visual interface components (see Figure 1). The user views the articles by (i) viewing the abstract and highlighted keywords to determine relevancy, (ii) viewing where the article is throughout the map, and (iii) viewing the concepts affected and the sequence of events through the timeline. Information from relevant documents can be captured using a browser add-in (Zotero) and transcribed to a spreadsheet for later use. In addition, li nks to the articles and search terms can be saved using the Save Results Option in SensePlace (artifacts are saved to an XML and TXT file, respectively, which can be shared with colleagues or uploaded again if required in the future). Information from the articles/documents highlights new information and prompts new searches using new keywords. The process is repeated again until the user is satisfied that they have gathered sufficient information about the topic of interest. Information gather ed through this tool can then be collated, synthesized and summarized by the user. Featur es/components contained within SensePlace are illustrated within the red box. Following completion of the initial SensePlace app lication, work focused on a second generation version that is more scalable and more adaptable to a range of information sources. In this work during the second half of the time period, they implemented a visual analytic interface that analysts can use to examine place, time, and concept components of information extracted from multiple text sources. As part of a test case study, the team compiled a database of Twitter feeds containing over 1 million Tweets and implemented tools to ingest GeoRSS feeds generated by a variety of sources. They implemented core pa rts of their system architecture including a distributed database, server t echnologies, and an initial user interface. They designed the Figure 2: SensePlace fora ging and sensemakin g process. 29methods for entity and relationship extraction from Twitter feeds and de veloped a strategy for contextualization of the Twitter feeds by fetching feeds posted by the same user. They also did preliminary evaluation and adapta tion of the back-end components. Figure 3 below illustrates the Text Information Channel Backend for the second generation SensePlace that will support a wide variety of in formation feeds such as Tweets, GeoRSS feeds, HTML and plain text. In the milestone chart, th is second generation tool was tentatively called GeoTemTA (for Geo-Temporal Text Analytics). This core architect ure is being leveraged for use in MDRP 13 as well. Figure 3: SensePlace Text Information Channel Backend Architecture The system consists of a central database co ntaining all information such as data tables, associated named entity tables, location tables and text search indices for each information channel which allow the UI and the backend text processing software to run. The architecture was designed such that a wide va riety of information channels ca n be easily integrated and allow the user interface/processing software to quick ly access and process this information. Figure 4 below illustrates the Twitter Information channe l storage and processing backend. Each channel of information currently stored consists of four backend processing daemons. 30 Figure 4: The SensePlace Twitter Informa tion Channel Storage and Processing Backend System components are described below: 1. Channel Search/Data Load Daemon: Each channel has an associated daemon which collects information of interest. For exam ple, the Twitter channel search daemon currently uses a table which contains queries that are passed on to Twitter. Twitter then returns a set of Tweets which are then stored in the channel data tabl e. Each channel data table typically contains single column of text (in this case it contains the text contained within the Tweets returned fr om a Twitter search) which is of interest. This column information is stored in the system informa tion table as shown in Figure 1 is used by the text processing software. 2. Named Entity Extraction Daemon: The name d entity extraction daemon extracts the named-entities contained within the text present for each channel and writes this information to the associated named-entity ta bles in the database. There are four broad categories of named entities that are extrac ted namely people, locations, organizations and others. The current daemon uses the Open Calais named-entity extraction web service. They are working towards integrat ing FactXtractor named-entity extractor as well. The named-entity extraction daemon is wr itten such that it can be run on multiple machines on the same network allowing la rge amounts of text information to be processed in real time. The Twitter channel currently uses 7 machines to perform named 31 Figure 5: The Frontend showing a query interface returned Tweets and a map with Tweet locations.entity extraction. Examples of extracted locations and organi zations are shown in Figures 4 and 5. 3. Geocoding Daemon: Once the named-entity extr action has occurred, a location table is generated which contains text information (e.g. \"Haiti\") regarding locations contained within a channel (e.g. Figure 3) . While this is suitable for text querying, however, such information is not of use when the user might want to perform spa tial querying on this channel. For e.g., a user might want to us e a bounding box in a map interface to restrict the information to that corresponding to the locations within this bounding box. The Geocoding daemon processes the location tabl e (for all channels) and geocodes these locations with the point coordinates of the best matching location returned from Geonames.org web service. These point coordi nates are stored within the location table as shown in Figure 6. 4. Lucene Text Indexer Daemon: As discussed in 1) each channel typically contains a single column of text in the channel data table. For example the Twitter channel data table contains one column which stores all the Tweets that were extracted by the channel search daemon. The Lucene text indexer daemon creates a Lucene text index for the channel text for full text que rying. The index also stores dates where the lexicographic property of the stored string is used to allo w text and date range (for e.g., Tweets about \"swine flu\" between dates \"Jan 2009\" and (for e.g., Tweets about \"swine flu\" on \"Friday\"), text and date (for Tweets about \"swine flu\" on date \"10th Jan 2009\"), text and day + date range t ype querying (for e.g., Tweets about \"swine flu\" between \"Friday\" and \"Saturday\"). 5. Channel Data Middleware: The middleware AP I layer provides an in tegrated access layer that allows all the information stored within the repository to be quickly accessed by the frontend. For example, Figure 7 shows the frontend where an analyst queried for \"Earthquake\". The middleware layer allo ws the frontend to quickly access the information repository and display the inform ation (relevant Tweets, associated persons, organizations, locations and temporal info rmation, etc.) for consumption by a user. 32Figure 5 and 6 show examples of Tweets that were loaded by the Twitter Channel Search daemon and the corresponding entities (Locations , Organizations and Persons) extracted by the Named Entity Extraction daemon. Figure 6 shows th e location table for th e Twitter channel and the spatial coordinates that were assigne d to the locations by the Geocoding daemon. Figure 6: Example Tweets and th e extracted locations and types Figure 7: Example Tweets and extracted organizations and types Figure 7 shows a temporal analysis of Tweets fo r a broad keyword \"earthquake\" that may be of interest to an analyst. Tweet counts can be very useful for discovering events as Figure 8 shows. For example, they found two abnormal spikes in Figure 9 corresponding to the dates 02/10/10 and 03/02/10. On those two dates, earthquakes struck the Northe rn Illinois region and Chile respectively. The current indexing mechanism provide s an easy way to extract and visualize such information, so an analyst may be able to find relevant information within the vast stores of irrelevant information. In addition, a future dire ction for work is an automated event detection mechanism which would essentially discover such abnormal spikes in information related to a broad keyword of interest (for e.g. Earthquake , Hurricane, Tornado, Disease, etc.) followed by automated analysis of information present within these spikes. For e.g., consider the spike in Tweet counts for the \"Chile Earthquake\". A 2-gram analysis of all Tweets in this spike should have a very high frequency of the words \"Chile\" and \"Earthquake\" appearing together in Tweets. 33Based on the high frequency of appearance of \"Chile\" and \"Earthquake\", the system can automatically use these as keywords for a more di rected search of relevant information to the Chile Earthquake. This should provide a better f iltering mechanism so as to remove irrelevant information, as well as provide an automated wa y for alerting an analyst towards an event of interest. They are currently working on an implementation of such a system. Figure 8: Example locations extracted from the Tw eets and their Geonames ids and latitude, longitude coordinates. 34Figure 9: Tweet count as a function of date for the keyword \"Earthquake\". Two earthquakes \"Chile Earthquake\" and \"N. Illinois Earthquakes\" are events that can be statistically detected (spikes) based on daily average Tweet counts The SensePlace application was specifically fo cused on fostering geographically-centered sensemaking through identification and visual hi ghlighting of named enti ties (people, places, times, and organizations) in documents, automated inference to determine document relevance using stored knowledge, and a visu al interface with tightly coupled geographic map, timeline, and concept graph displays. They used a cas e study (focused on uncove ring potential population migration, geopolitical, and othe r drivers for infectious dise ase dynamics in Niger) to demonstrate how our approach can support analys is of complex situations along (a) multi-scale geographic dimensions (i.e., areas where vaccine c overage is non-existent or limited both within Niger and the surrounding countries), (b) temporal dimensions (i.e., popul ation movement within Niger due to seasonal migrations related to food and livelihood), and (c) diverse thematic dimensions (effects of political upheaval, food s ecurity, transient movement, etc.). The current re-designed system increases the scalability of the system by orders of magnitude allowing the analyst to examine a large text corpus. They al so enhanced the system to be able to handle streaming text data with high efficiency. As a case in point, they showed how the system can use Twitter data and RSS feeds to enab le visual analytic exercises. In terms of evaluation, last spring and summer the team at Georgia Institute of Technology performed a study with a simulate d intelligence analysis session and compared the use of Jigsaw to other more traditional techniqu es such as using pen and paper or using desktop search. Jigsaw generally seemed to support more thorough analysis , but most importantly the study helped them identify different investigative strategies that people follow with visual analytics tools and it helped them to derive design principles for visu al analytics tools. They published a paper at VAST 2009 about this study and ar e publishing a journal paper in IEEE Trans. on Visualization and Computer Graphics, as well. In terms of the system, they had goals of doing more with geovisualizati ons, visualizing events, and visualizing uncertainty. As th ey worked more with the system , they decided to instead focus more on the database capabilities, entity identification, implementing new views of the documents and entities, and developing further com putational analysis capabi lities. All of these directions were extremely successful. The system now stores document analysis information in a database on disk, so it can scale to much larger document collections. They added and refined the entity identification capabilitie s. They added new Circular Entity graph and Document Grid views. Finally, they are making excellent progress adding new docum ent analysis capabilities to Jigsaw. They implemented automated document clustering by theme, and they implemented document similarity analysis. They also built do cument summary capabilities, so they can give one sentence from each document that most typifies it. Finally, they began to explore sentiment analysis capabilities. 35They created a new release ( 0.3) of the system and began distributing it to people and organizations who want to use it. They have a growing and wide-ranging client set now and continue to work on expanding it . Articles about Jigsaw have appeared in the DHS R-Tech newsletter and Fraud Magazine, a magazine fo r investigators of money laundering and fraud cases. They are also exploring new document do mains for analysis such as bioinformatics, business markets, on-line reviews, and academic papers. Jigsaw relevant: New views (visualizations) were added to the Ji gsaw system including a WordTree view and a Circular Graph view. A significant amount of time was spen t in creating a distri bution version of the system that could be given to academic colleagues, as well as, various government and corporate interested clients. In order to do so, a major rework of the sy stem architecture was performed, changing how documents are stored during analysis. They move d to a database model of document storage, so they could interface with much larger document collections. In January, the 0.3 version of the system wa s created including documentation, tutorials, example data, etc. Articles about the system appeared in newsle tters and magazines, and they helped bring additional interested parties to VACCINE. In the third quarter, the research focused on adding further computational anal ysis capabilities to the system including document clustering. Thes e algorithms provide more analytic power to Jigsaw and, from the initial use of the algorithms, appear to enable many new types of analyses. A paper was submitted to the VAST C onference about these aspects. 36MDRP 2: Integrate Automated Anal ytical Reasoning into Jigsaw Team VACCINE: Georgia Institute of Technology: John Stasko, Ashok Goel Abstract The objective of this project is to develop and integrate more au tomated analysis and reasoning capabilities into the Jigsaw syst em. Presently, as a visual analytics system, Jigsaw is heavy on the visualization aspect and the analyst expl ores the document collection manually. While VACCINE believes there is much value in this, th e team would like to integrate more automated reasoning and analysis capabilities into the system as well. So, for instance, the system might suggest hypotheses about the documents, it might help the analysts confirm/refute hypotheses they have developed, or it might simply suggest avenues to explore more. The team will explore how Jigsaw can be combined with the STAB sy stem also created at Georgia Institute of Technology, which provides these types of automate d analysis capabilities. Such a task will be challenging, because the two systems were implemented in completely different environments and with very different data models. Here, the te am plans to see if these two approaches can be combined, and then will use an example document collection as a case study. Technical Approach Data collection method used was case studies, a nd the nature of the res earch was the analytic method and the basic method.

They presently have a working ve rsion of a system that integrates Jigsaw with STAB. On the one hand, an an alyst can have automated reasoni ng performed in STAB and the results can be examined (item by item) in Jigsaw . On the other hand, Jigsaw explorations can 37lead to hypotheses that can be entered into STAB for automa ted checking and analysis. The team made a video of the combined systems in Ma rch. They have not aut hored any publications about this project yet, but are working on a draft of one now. Many internal changes to the data structures and models within STAB were necessary to accomplish the integrated changes between STAB and Jigsaw. In the resulting system, analysis can proceed in different fashions. In one, the an alysts can run STAB's co re automated reasoning capabilities. Its output and results are now presented in a ma nner that coordinates with Jigsaw. So, for instance, the analyst can select an individual mentioned in one of the hypotheses developed by STAB, and explore that individual's information within Jigsaw. This acts as a kind of sanity check for what STAB produces. In another fashion, an analyst can explore documents as they usually would in Jigsaw, but they can use a new interface to send hypotheses to STAB for its automated analysis on those hypotheses (e.g., STAB might find evidence that confirms or contra dicts the hypothesis). To demonstrate these capabilities , the team created a case study of the combined system running on the VAST Conference Contest dataset from 2006. Events within the documents were manually coded, because they do not have any software that does automatic event identification reliably. The team created a video of this system integration in June for Jo e Kielman's request for videos. They outlined a paper about this project, but have not yet begun writing the paper. As for the evidence marshalling capabilities within Jigsaw, that project is in progress. In the final quarter, the team continued with the design of this component and began implementing it. Some initial usage of the component and feedback was gathered from that and sent back to redesign some of the pieces. Further devel opment of this compone nt is still underway. 38MDRP 3: Situational Surveil lance & In-field Criminal Investigative Analytics Team VACCINE: Pennsylvania State University : Alan MacEachren, Frank Hardisty Purdue University: David Ebert, Mimi Boutin, Ed Delp, Bill Cleveland Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University: Chris Barrett, Stephen Eubank, Madhav Marathe CCICADA: Rutgers University: Fred Roberts Abstract The over-arching goal for the first year was to develop methods for combining syndromic surveillance data with detailed synthetic social network based epidemic simulations for improved state assessment, support of in sight building and consequence an alysis for decision makers. VACCINE developed novel methods for enabling event animation in \"map mashups\" and for more efficient web-map client server interact ion. In addition, advances in spatio-temporal analysis methods have been achie ved and integrated into the GeoV iz Toolkit. Discussions have been initiated with the Harrisburg Department of Police about transitioning our CrimeViz web- mapping tool for representation and tracking of crime incidents. Work in this project focused on development and application of new explor atory visual analytic (EVA) mapping methods to support criminal i nvestigative analytics. The team developed situational surveillance visual analytics tool s to process large volumes of geographically referenced data searching for events of intere st. This work will integrate the Visualization Sciences team's work into the Data Analytic team's work for the Port Authority of New York/New Jersey (PA NY/NJ). Emphasis was on methods and tools for making sense of and analyzing numerical and categorical data that c ontain geographic and temporal references, thus on understanding and visualizing the space-time dyna mics on the phenomena investigated and on identifying and tracking change over time. Methods developed will be implemented in component-based software that support the mixi ng and matching of the team's advances with those of the other COE teams working on this t opic. Both web-based and desktop tools will be implemented and tested, in support of a range of potential applications. Technical Approach The team used bench tests, bioassay, compiling & sorting DB, data mining, expert consultation, field monitors, sampling (tissue), and survey to co llection data. They also used Biometrics, case studies, econometrics, genomic testing, modeling, molecular biology/genomi cs, risk assessment, sampling, and statistical analytics as their analytic methods. Las tly, for the nature of research they used applied, basic, consultation, coordina tion/integration, education, hybrid basic-applied, and hybrid applied-consultation. 39Milestones Milestones for VACCINE Period 1 07/01/09 - 03/31/10 Quarterly Initial development of spatiotempor al visual analytic methods for scaling to large datasets X X Evaluation of spatiotemporal visual analytic methods on health surveillance and crime surveillance data X X Development and integration plan for deployment of tools in PA NY/NJ complete X X Submit paper on design and implementation of web-map tools for crime data analysis X Submit paper on efficient web-map client-server interaction involving large volumes of spatiotemporal incident data X Generalize the system reported on above thro ugh a more robust system architecture to support more flexible web-map client-server interaction involving large volumes of spatiotemporal incident data - produce demonstration of this extension X Release version of GeoViz Toolkit with new ESDA methods for investigating spatial patterns and events in crime data X Work with colleagues at Data Science team at Rutgers to produce cr oss-site work plan detailing coordination/collaboration & coordinate with potential users X The team's current progress has included in teracting with the Tippecanoe County Police Department and obtaining workspace for VACCINE re searchers to directly interact with officers in the field. This will allow the team to improve technology transition and aid in tool development. The results for the first year in clude the release of two software packages, the GeoViz Toolkit, GeoVISTA, CrimeViz, which will enable better understanding of phenomena relevant to crime investigation, and VALET. The team has also imple mented a tool that s upports scaling of web mapping tools to relatively large event data sets. This tool, HerbariaViz, has been tested with data from a herbaria collection (because the data were available and repr esentative of the kinds of data of interest). Developments with each are outlined briefly. GeoViz Toolkit VACCINE researchers at Penn State's GeoVISTA Cent er developed novel methods for discovering spatial and spatio-t emporal patterns in crime a nd related demographic phenomena using the GeoViz Toolkit as a pl atform. The GeoViz Toolkit is an open-source set of geographic visualization and analysis com ponents. The advances made for analyzing crime data involved developing methods for interactiv e exploration of spatial struct ure in crime and demographic data, and their implementation as interactive tool s that take advantage of previously developed components. In particular, the team developed spatio-tempor al versions of the Lo cal Moran's I spatial statistic, and they incorporated that statistic into an interactive tool within the GeoViz Toolkit. They applied these methods to national crime trends, and were able to both identify known 40patterns of crime and uncover some unexpected tre nds that bear further analysis. These ESDA advances were incorporated into a newly released version of the GeoViz Toolkit. GeoVISTA CrimeViz The contribution of CrimeViz is that it is an ea sy-to-use tool for police officers and other crime analysts to understand both spatial and temporal trends in crime data. This tool is being transitioned into use by the Harrisburg Police Department. The contribution of the GeoViz Toolkit is that it implements a number of multiv ariate data analysis tools, which will enable better understanding of both crime in cidence and the socio-political factors which relate to crime incidence. CrimeViz is an extensible web-based map a pplication that supports exploration of and sensemaking about criminal activity in space and time. The current prototype illu strates the potential of the tool by vi sualizing a rich dataset of violent crimes published to the web in near real-time by the District of Columbia Data Catalog (http://data.octo.dc.gov/ ). Utilizing a suite of geovisual analytics tools, analysts can identify 41complex spatio-temporal patterns of crime in th e District of Columbia , allowing analysts to unlock important insights about th e crime incident dataset. The current implementation of CrimeViz includ es a central interactive map (using the Google Maps service), interactive filtering by crime type , linear and composite animations, an interactive temporal legend that doubles as a frequency hi stogram, and a set of togglable map layers. The team is employing a user-centered design ap proach to guide develo pment of the GeoVISTA CrimeViz concept. An initial usability assessmen t of version one of the applications revealed interface and mapping problems, as well as other bugs. The results were used to revise the CrimeViz prototype substantiall y. A typical screen in an anal ysis session that highlights key features is shown below. Our next step in the pr ocess (year two) is to gather more information about the current practic e of crime mapping and analysis thro ugh interviews, surveys, and hands- on interactive sessions with law enforcement personnel. Feedback from these activities will allow us to identify core features currently availa ble in other tools that must be implemented in GeoVISTA CrimeViz, as well as tasks that current tools do not support. 42 The research thus far indicates that most medi um to small municipal police departments lack analytical tools and training to explore and make sense of thei r crime incident datasets. The GeoVISTA CrimeViz concept provides these crime an alysts with an extensible, easy-to-use tool to support spatiotemporal crime analysis and mapping. As a component of the effort to develop Crim eViz, we have developed a set of methods to support event animation in web-based \"map mashups\". This has produced a code library that extends the Google Maps API to support well-desi gned interactive cartogra phic applications (see the two publications in Cartographic Perspectives below for details). VALET: Visual Analytics Law Enforcement Technology We have developed VALET, a Visual Analy tics Law Enforcement Toolkit for analyzing spatiotemporal law enforcement data. VALET provides users with a suite of analytical tools coupled with an interactive visu al interface for data explorati on and analysis. This system includes linked views and interactiv e displays that spatiotemporally model criminal, traffic and civil (CTC) incidents and allow officials to obse rve patterns and quickly identify regions with higher probabilities of activity. Our toolkit provides analysts with the ability to visualize different types of data sets (census data, daily weather reports, zoning tracts, prominent calendar dates, etc.) that provide an insight into correlations among CTC incidents and spatial 43demographics. In the spatial domain, we have implemented a kernel density estimation mapping technique that creates a color map of spatially distributed CTC events that allow analysts to quickly find and identify areas with unusually la rge activity levels. In the temporal domain, reports can be aggregated by day, week, month or year, allowing the analysts to visualize the CTC activities spatially over a period of time. Coupled with the spatial mapping view, our system provides analysts with a time series view of the data. Furthermore, we have incorporated spatiotemporal prediction algorithms to forecast future CTC incident levels within a 95\\% confidence interval. Such pred ictions aid law enforcement officials in understanding how hotspots may grow in the future in order to ju diciously allocate resources and take preventive measures. Our system has been developed usi ng actual law enforcement data and is currently being evaluated and refined by a consortium of law enforcement agencies. Visual Analytics for Syndromic Surveillance Recently, the detection of adverse health events has focused on pre-diagnosis information to improve response time. This type of detection is more largely termed \\emph{syndromic surveillance} and involves the co llection and analysis of statistical health trend data, most notably symptoms reported by individuals seeki ng care in emergency departments. Currently, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) employs a state syndromic surveillance system called PHESS (Public Health Emergency Surveill ance System), which receives electronically transmitted patient data (in the form of emergency department chief complaints from 73 hospitals around the state at an average rate of 7000 records per day. To help in analyzing this data, we have created a visual analytics system to provide users with the means to explore trends 44in their data. In spatiotemporal data (such as syndromic surveillance data), analysts are searching for regions of space and time with unusually high incidences of events (hotspots). In the cases where hotspots are found, analysts would like to predict how these regions may grow in order to plan resource allocation and preventati ve measures, and predict where future hotspots may occur. To facilitate such forecasting, we ha ve created a predictive vi sual analytics toolkit that provides analysts with linked spatiotemporal and statistical analy tic views. Our system models spatiotemporal events through the comb ination of kernel density estimation for event distribution and seasonal trend decomposition by loess smoothing for temporal predictions. We provide analysts with estimates of error in our mo deling, along with spatial and temporal alerts to indicate the occurrence of statistically significant hotspots. Spatial data are distributed based on a modeling of previous event loca tions, thereby maintaining a te mporal coherence with past events. Such tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis tes ting, plan intervention strategies, and allocate resources to correspond to perceived threats. HerbariaViz In addition to CrimeViz, we have carried out related research jo intly with MDRP 12 to develop a method for efficient web-map client-server interac tion and data aggregati on involving relatively large volumes of spatiotemporal point data and a symbology and sym bol scaling method for representing those data in a web client map appli cation. As a test applicat ion, the team used a set of non-crime \"incident\" data ava ilable to us. Specifically, the data consisted of 377,000 spatially- referenced plant samples collected in Calif ornia between 1860 and 2007. Each record included species information along with the data and pla ce of collection plus most identified the person doing the collection. Thus, while not about crime, these data are analogous to data on crime, terrorism, and similar incidents. 45 Three research objectives were addressed in the component of the research: (1) develop a method for efficient web-map client-server interac tion involving relatively large volumes of spatiotemporal point data, (2) develop a symbology and symbol scaling method for representing those data in the client, and (3) develop an in terface for client-server interactions and data exploration. The figure above illustrates the in terface to the methods and tools developed and implemented in a tool called HerbariaViz . TOPIC 1: Structural feature ex traction of relational networ ks to support computational epidemiology It is now well established that social contact networks play a critical role in the progression of epidemics in urban regions. The team analyzed th e graphical and relational properties of large, realistic urban social contact networks. These networks ar e dynamic, labeled and pose new computational challenges. In our study, we focuse d on two representative s ynthetic social contact networks -- Miami and Seattle. The rese arch focused on two fundamental issues: First, focus on a central question in Network Science - relationship between contact network structure and spread of diseases over these networks. Then, identify new structural measures that pr ovide qualitatively different in sights about epidemics. Second, we focus on mining interesting subgr aphs in dendrograms - a dendrogram is a random subgraph of a social contact network, containing the edges that are used for 46disease transmission. Many questions in epidem iological analysis - such as \"on average, who is most likely to infect seniors?\" or \"are there disease transmission pathways involving children?\" can be formulated as subgraph mining questions. These questions can be viewed as problems about the occurren ce of labeled subgraphs in dendrograms. There is a lot of work on extracting important features in complex networks. In biological networks, this approach has been used to iden tify motifs, which may have important structural and functional implications. However, it turns out that because of the stochastic disease transmission models, the above questions cannot be formulated and solved using standard techniques. The subgraphs in question are associ ated with some probability, which depends not only on the probabilities of the edge s in the subgraphs, but also wh ere the subgraph is located, in relation to the initia lly infected node. The team's contribution is two-fold: 1. Formulating the epidemiological questions in terms of probabilistic subgraph counting problems. 2. Developing efficient computational methods for solving the resulting subgraph counting problems. In general, counting fixed sized subgraphs in a given graph is a well-known \"hard problem\" (formally speaking it is #P-h ard). Thus the work focused on developing fast heuristics: these heuristics have cont rolled trade-offs between solution quality and running time. Reasoning about interesting relationa l patterns can lead to important insights about the spread of epidemics, and these insights can be used for de veloping novel intervention strategies and public health policies. This forms the ba sis of the ongoing and year 2 work. The resulting solutions can also be used as a part of visual analytic tool s for public health policy planners and researchers. For example: i) the most frequent disease transmission pathways can be overlaid on a geographic map when the coor dinates of each pers on is known and such information can help the policy planners; ii) gra phical representations (e.g., a bar chart) of the counts of the various important (and frequent) subgraph patterns in the dendrogram can help intervention designers. TOPIC 2: Visual Analyt ics for Epidemiology VACCINE developed an automated process for generating movies of the geographic spread of contagion over time through a network of interacti ng agent. The movies show the prevalence of the contagion over time in small blocks covering the region of interest. Curre ntly, the data can be based on where the infected agents live, or where the agents contracted th e contagion, and can show either new infections, the agents who are curre ntly infected, or the total infections since the beginning of the epidemic, although any geo-lo cation tied to the agent can be used. While currently aimed at epidemics, the system is ge neral and can be used for any geo-located, time 47varying data. The movies can either show a si ngle dataset, or 2 or 4 datasets, which are synchronized in time. This tool is useful in several di fferent ways. First, as a model check, it is useful for developers and modelers to be able to visualize the geograp hic component of a models output. It serves as a basic check that the software is acting as e xpected, and provides a starting point for tracking down mistakes in either the software itself, or the model's specification. Second, it provides a useful way to compare the outcomes of different in terventions on the spatial spread of contagion, which are not apparent in plots of prevalence by day. For instance, it is easy to see the difference between a high-localized prevalence and a lower, more geographically di stributed prevalence, even though the total prevalence in the population may be the same.

A key feature of our work is its generality - indeed the me thods are not just restricted to 48public health epidemiology and social contact ne tworks, but generalizes well to other diffusion processes and other classes of socio-technical networks. Virginia Polytechnic University participated in collaborations with other Homeland Security Centers of Excellence. They have initiated collaborations with Dr. Jim Koopman who is a member of the CAMRA team and Dr. Joshua Ep stein who is a member of the PACER team. Both of these collaborations have focused on deve loping agent-based models to study infectious disease spread. Dr. Koopman's intere st is in fomite-based diseases while Dr. Epstein is interested in studying the socio-behavioral adaptations during an epidemic. In addition, the team has recently initiated collaborations with researchers at Chalmers University (Prof. Devdatt Dubhashi) in Sweden to develop synthetic populations and networks for Sweden to support public health epidemiol ogy. They have submitted a proposal to MSB in Sweden that has recently signed a MOU with DHS in the US - they believe that the proposal takes a step towards establishing important research relationships that were called out in the MOU. If funded, this interacti on will provide VACCINE research ers the opportunity to interact with researchers in Sweden and Chalmers in particular on problems of interest to DHS. Pennsylvania State University collaborated with other Homeland Security Centers of Excellence as well. They created a web-delivered versi on of the START Global Terrorism Database (GTD) with geographic data visualization and analysis tools built in; this version saw use in college courses covering Homeland Security. 1.

The adversaries in network security are intelligent and highly-motivated humans who continuously evolve new attack te chniques to avoid any fixed defense. Networ k security analysts play a key role in proactively identifying and designing responses to new attacks or exposed weaknesses. Here, engaging the powerful pattern recognition ab ilities of the human visual system is essential in the analysis of the massive amounts of data involved. Thus, a focus of this project has been on developing tools for the fron tline analysts. However, the complexity and scope of cybersecurity analytics requires the development of tools which move beyond simply visualizing the network traffic data. Successful tools must also provide a framework for developing higher-level semantic models to provide a simplifying level of abstraction, enabling greater analytic sophistication. To that end, VA CCINE is coupling our tools to insights gained from basic research on network traffic data elements. Technical Approach The technical approach used was compiling & so rting DB and field monitors for the data collection. Case studies, modeling, and statistical analysis for analytic methods. For the nature of research, hybrid basic-applied and hybr id applied-consultation were used. Milestones Milestones for VACCINE Period 1 07/01/09 - 03/31/10 Quarterly Report on current network traffic modeling techniques X Visual interface for display of traffic models X X Toolkit for semantic data integration X X Demonstration of prototype supporting visual specification and evaluation of models X Plan and milestones for next phase of project X VACCINE is currently engaged in deploying one of their earlier visual tools, Isis, as part of the daily workflow for analysts at US-CERT Oper ations in Arlington, VA (major support for this work comes via a separate gr ant from DHS S+T in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory). During th is funding year, the team has created user-documentation and conducted preliminary training exercises with anal ysts. In addition, they are providing design 51advice, evaluation criteria and support to US-CER T in the acquisition of an Enhanced Analytic Database Capability (EADC), which will enable th e high-speed data retrieval for interactive use of the tools over dozens of terabytes of data. As part of the evaluation for the EADC, the team has written code for Isis to enable it to connect with 4 additional database systems including a ne w 'sqlsilk' capability being developed for US- CERT data sources by the SEI at Carnegie Mell on. The team has been active participants in creating the specifications and sche ma for all the EADC database systems. The vendor testing is scheduled to run from May-July 2010 with acquisition and installati on projected for 4Q 2010. Project Outcomes (Results, A ccomplishments, Conclusions) Publications 1.

(submitted to UIST 2010) \"Interactive End-user Data Integration for a Geospatial Web\" Other outcomes/impacts There are two major results for this year. Fi rst, VACCINE has made substantial progress in deploying one of their tools, Isis, at US-CERT Operations by convi ncing the group to acquire the necessary database infrastructure for interactive vi sual analytics (details below). The team has acquired independent funding for much of this transfer work, and hopes to have it completed within another year's time. If th is effort is successful, they hope not only to have transferred technology to a DHS frontline unit, but also, and pe rhaps more importantly, to have learned what is involved in making such a transi tion from research to operations. The second result is the first fruit of our effort to understand the fundamentals of network traffic. The team has been able to use visual analyt ics and statistics to develop a principled understanding of SSH traffic. From that unders tanding, they have been able to develop an algorithm, which identifies packets carrying SSH keystrokes even though all SSH traffic is encrypted. This algorithm opera tes on the packet dynamics of any TCP connection. It has been constructed in a streaming fashion in order to make it practical for use on high-speed links. Perceived data sensitivity causes major delays in data acquisition and quality as data must often be anonymized before sharing and the obfuscation pr ocess is problematic as it can easily destroy information critical to analysis. DHS is attemp ting to address this issu e through it's PREDICT data initiative which may be available in 2011. However, th e team has made arrangements through local institutions to collect data for th is project that enables it to proceed relatively unhindered while the larger quest ions are being worked out. 52MDRP 6: Video Surveillance Visual Analytics Team VACCINE: Purdue University: Edward Delp University of North Carolina at Charlotte: Jianping Fan, Bill Ribarsky Abstract The goal of this project is to automatically determ ine the threat behavior exhibited by individuals or groups of people by observing them via su rveillance video. We will accomplish this by extending some of our previous work in real -time object tracking. We will first track the individual(s) and observe how they move in the scene. For exampl e are they walking in patterns such as circling a particular position? Are they trying to minimize their cr oss-sectional area by squatting? Are they turning thei r heads a lot to see if someone is looking at them? We will catalog a group of these types of behavior patterns to be used to analyze the video. One other issue that needs to be addressed is the determ ination of the quality and type of the video surveillance system that is re quired to be able to do this type of analysis Technical Approach This research employs analytic methods, incl uding modeling, sampling, and statistical analysis. The nature of the research is hybrid basic-applied. Milestones Milestones for VACCINE Period 1 07/01/09 - 03/31/10 Quarterly Acquire video sequences and complete one threat behavior X Evaluation of the type/quality of video needed for analysis X X X Complete analysis on 2-4 threat behaviors X X Integrate threat analysis into other projects X X Privacy has been recognized as an important topic in surveilla nce videos, and the technological developments in this area are ongoing. Unfortuna tely, most existing work on privacy protection for the visual information mainly focus on the indi viduals (individual video objects) in the videos and treating them independently. It has become more evident that people may use social network or object co-occurrence associations to infer th e privacy of the privacy-sensitive video objects even if they are blocked from the videos. The obj ective of this project is to contribute to the discussions about multiple types of privacy di sclosures for visual information and providing solutions to contest the context-based inference when the privacy-sensitive individuals are blocked or hidden in the surveillance videos. Cont esting the context-based privacy inference is a topic to be severely under-researched. 53In order to contest the context-dr iven privacy inference, we first partition the privacy disclosures for visual information (i.e., survei llance videos) into two types: (1) identification of individuals in videos and disclosing their privacy ; (2) integration of social cont exts or other contexts to identify the privacy (i .e., hidden information) of individuals (i.e., video objects) even if they are blocked in the surveillance videos . There are some existing work s to handle the first type of visual privacy disclosure by blocking the privac y-sensitive video objects, but there is no existing work to deal with the second type of privacy di sclosure (i.e., context-driven privacy inference). This privacy dependency (i.e., c ontext-based privacy inference) is a problem that may seriously affect the effectiveness of our syst ems for visual privacy protection. To protect the privacy of the individuals in a su rveillance video, the give n surveillance video is first partitioned into multiple objects and background. Obviously, we should realize that supporting such the object-based vi deo content representation is not a trivial task for current computer vision technologies. After the vide o objects are detected automatically, privacy sensitivity of these video objects is usually analy zed, and the video objects are further partitioned into two groups: privacy-sensitive objects versus privacy-insensitive objects . Usually, the privacy-sensitive video objects are blocked from the surveillance video and the privacy- insensitive objects are remained in the survei llance video. The reasons for blocking only the privacy-sensitive video objects is that people believe releasing the privacy-insensitive video objects may not induce privacy disclosure. However, this is not true at all. Because of the associations (i.e., co-occurrence associations and social contexts) be tween the video objects, releasing the privacy-insensitive video objects may allow dishonest users or public to integrate the object co-occurrence associations and other in formation sources to infer the privacy-sensitive objects in the surveillance video ev en they have been blocked. Based on these observations, the research focuses on: (a) after the video objects are detected from the surveillance videos, we further identify their associ ations which may induce privacy disclosure; (b) we generate the object co-occ urrence associations (which may induce privacy disclosure) by using some inform ation sources which are publica lly available; (c) developing new video transformation or blocking algorithms for contesting the privacy disclosure induced by such the context-based privacy inference as shown in Fig. 1. Many objects may appear in the surveillance vi deos simultaneously, but their importance may be different significantly and peopl e may pay different efforts to protect their privacy. Blocking only the privacy-sensitive video objects from th e surveillance videos may be insufficient to protect their privacy effectively because their a ssociations with the privacy-insensitive video objects (which are released in the videos) may be exploited for inferring their privacy. VACCINE's research took account of the association-based priv acy inference to: (a) partition the given surveillance video into multiple object s; (b) analyze the co-occurrence associations between the objects by using other information sour ces such as company organization structure, parent-children relationships , et al.; (c) such the object co-occu rrence associations will be used to analyze the privacy sensitivity of other residue video objects (except the privacy-sensitive video 54objects) in the surveillance video as shown in Fig. 1, and the privacy-ins ensitive objects which have strong co-occurrence associations with th e privacy-sensitive video objects (which have been blocked from the given video) may also b ecome privacy-sensitive and will also be blocked from the given surveillance video. Therefore, th e new definition of visual privacy depends on two issues: (a) privacy of indi vidual video objects; and (b) the strength of their co-occurrence associations with the privacy-sensitive video objects. Figure 1: Privacy-insensitive video objects may become privacy-sensitive when their frequent co-occurrence objects are privacy-sensitive. The team treated the issue (i.e., contesting the priv acy disclosure while maintaining the utility of surveillance videos in certain levels) as an optimization problem by solving the following equation: Where U(video) is the utility of surveillance vide o after the privacy-sensiti ve videos are blocked, R(video) is the privacy disclosure risk when the surveillance vide o with current level of privacy protection is released, T is an acceptable privacy disclosure threshold for a given task. In a certain domain of surveillance videos, we de fine the utility of surveillance video U(video) as: 55Where I(object-remain) is used to define the nu mber of intended objects which remain in the surveillance video, I(object-total) is used to repr esent the total number of objects of interest in the surveillance video. The privacy disclosure risk R(video) consists of three types: (a) id entifying the individuals directly from the surveillance video; (b) identi fying the individuals by integrating the context networks and the blocked video; (c) predicting the appearance of the individuals with certain accuracy bound by integrating the c ontext networks and the blocked video. Thus, the privacy disclosure risk R(video) is defined as: Where a+b+c = 1, R(individual) is used to represen t the privacy disclosure because of identifying the individuals directly, R(context) is used to define the privacy disclosure because of the integration of context networks and the bloc ked video, R(bound) is the privacy disclosure because of the prediction of the appearance of the privacy-sensitive objects in a surveillance video with certain accuracy bound. R( individual) is defined as: R(context) is defined as: Where and are used to represent the privacy-sensi tive objects and the privacy-insensitive objects in the surveillance video, and |X - Z| is used to charact erize the diffirence between the original video object X and the predicted object Z. R(bound) is defined as: Where the bound is used to representation the a ccuracy bound for predicting the appearance of the privacy-sensitive video objects in the surv eillance video. Thus privacy protection for the surveillance videos is finally transf ormed into an optimization problem. Human-Intended Object Detection In this project, the team has developed multiple innovative approaches for intended video object detection for video privacy protection applicati on: (a) integrating camera metadata for intended object detection; (b) integrati ng human attention model for in tended object detection; (c) integrating camera motion and object-camera moti on coordination for intended object detection; 56and (d) integrating the specific task for intende d object detection because the definition of the intended objects largely de pends on the given task. As shown in Fig. 2, digital videos taken by human be ings significantly differ from the videos that are taken by a surveillance camera or a visi on sensor on a robot, e.g., human beings may intentionally capture videos to e xpress his/her feeling or record a memorial video event. Such a creative video capture process is accomplished by adjusting two factors: (1) the parameters setting of a camera; and (2) the pos ition between the camera and the objects of interest or events of interest. To enable automatic understanding and interpretation of the semantics of videos, it is very important to take all thes e factors into account. Unfortunate ly, most existing algorithms for video processing and understanding focus on onl y the video content itself while completely ignoring these two important f actors for video capturing. Photographers may follow the basic rules of esthe tic sentiment that shared among the majority of civilized human beings to make the videos attractive, beautiful or even astonishing in all circumstances even in tragedy. For example, pe ople often save certain amount of space for the sky in outdoor videos to make it look balanced. The interesting subjects are often placed in the middle of the picture and keep it integrated. If e nvironmental luminance is not sufficient to make a clear picture, photographers may use a flash a nd they may make sure that the interesting subjects take proper exposure while the surroundings are neglectable. The human intention is buried unde r the pixels we can see from videos and the camera metadata we can read from head files. In order to enable automatic vi deo understanding (i.e., intended object detection), it is very important to develop new framew orks by integrating the visual content of the videos and the camera metadata. Un fortunately, most existi ng techniques for video processing and understanding have completely i gnored the camera metadata while focusing on only the visual content of the videos. From the above interpretations, one can observe two important issu es: (1) not all pixels are born equal and some of them are more important than the others in a video; and (2) the camera metadata can indicate the photograp her's intention which may help us detect the intended objects of the videos easily. The intended objects (i.e., objects of interest) can be defined as a single semantic object or a group of semantic objects in the videos. Such the intended objects can catch the viewers' interest and represents the semantics of the videos, which is critical for video privacy protection while maintaining the utility of videos at certain leve ls (i.e., ideally the in tended objects are most important for the video). Obvi ously, such the inte nded objects in a video can provide an alternative way to interpret th e semantics of the video more compactly. The supporting intended object detection becomes very attractive and im portant for both automatic video understanding and video privacy protection. 57Based on these observations, the team has done the following research: (a) developing a novel framework by integrating camera metadata and statis tical analysis of video content to detect the intended objects more precisely; (b) develop a new video privacy protection framework which is able to maintain the utility of video at ce rtain levels while prot ecting the video privacy effectively. Camera metadata, including exposure time, flash, object distance and focal length extracted from EXIF format (\\url{http://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF }), as well as the low-level cues. A typical scenario of video/photo capture is illustrated in Fig. 2. A butterfly, which is the object of interest to the photographer, appears in the right season at the right time in the right place (it's unlikely to appear in winter on the snow at night). Th e photographer wears camouflage so that he can approach the object to achieve a better conformation. The parameter of the digital camera is set and the photo is captured intentionally. The camera records: (a) the objects and the scene in pixels that we can see; and (b) the underlying settings and the environment condition (such as GPS value and luminance etc.) in the metadata that can be read from EXIF files. The final photo intensively blurs the foreground and the background by se tting larger apertu re so that the interesting object can vividly stand out. Figure 2: The scenario for video/photo capturing. Through controlling the camera metadata, photogra phers can intensively capture the objects or the scenes into photos/videos, which he /she wants to share with others. Therefore, the camera metadata can somehow refl ect the intentions of the photographers and the focus of the photos. Based on these understandings, camera metadata may play an important role in automatic detection of in tended objects in a video. In this project, the team has developed a new approach to explore the camera metadata for automatic detection of the intended objects in vi deos. They have obtai ned that the following metadata are most helpful for intended object det ection: the exposure valu e (EV), object distance and date/time. Although the GPS can be recorded in the EXIF file and it can provide the information where the video is taken (which is al so critical for video privacy protection because 58location is a privacy-sensitive issue). Because th e object distance parameter is not available for camera metadata in currently available models, the team will focus on exploiting the EV value for intended object detection. Many digital cameras nowadays can select different m ode of focal points such as central, face, or dynamically set anywhere using the touch screen or a joystick like device. With this information, one can know where the intended objects are in the video. Based on th e assumption that the objects in videos have temporal and spatial struct ures, data/time can help to predict the objects that can only be seen at a cert ain time period. For example, the sunset and night scene can be seen at the afternoon and night. The exposure value (EV) that is available in mo st of the camera models on the market today can be useful for intended object detection, such that the exposure value may be directly provided in the metadata or can be calculated from the exposure time t and the aperture f-number N: This value can be set with expos ure prior or aperture prior w ith the other one automatically adjusted by the user or both set automatically in certain mode. The EV value is a function of luminance: Where L x S is the luminance, S is the ISO speed and K is the reflected-light meter calibration both S and K can be treated as constant. Given th e EV, the team can have more accurate measurement of the luminance. The luminance is closely related with the scene and its value is set according to the scene for a traditional camera. Based on these observations , our approach for intended object detection and video understanding is straight forward: (a) given the segmentation of a frame of a video, the team will first integrate the visual features of the image and the camera me tadata to train the classifier for detecting the regular objects and intended objects in an imag e; (b) the detected obj ects and intended objects will be tracked among frames. The algorithm for intended object detection consis ts of the following key steps: (a) images are first segmented into multiple objects of interest; (b ) a number of objects of interest are labeled as the training samples to learn the classifiers for intended object detection; (c) both the visual features of the video objects and the camera metadata are integrated to train a SVM classifier for intended object detection. (d) the detected intended objects are tracked among frames automatically. Duplicate or Near-Duplicate Image Detection 59In this project, the team has developed a mu lti-step approach for image duplication detection, which can significantly speed up duplicate detection from large-scale image collections: (a) large-scale images are first partitioned into multip le clusters according to their visual similarity contexts, where only some global visual features are extracted and used for image clustering; (b) pairwise image matching is further performed for detecting the duplicate or near-duplicate images by using SIFt feature matching as shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3: Pairwise image matching for dupli cate and near-duplicate image detection. Project Outcomes (Results, A ccomplishments, Conclusions) Our research for taking account of the association- based privacy inference is to: (a) partition the given surveillance video into multiple object s; (b) analyze the co-occurrence associations between the objects by using other information sour ces such as company organization structure, parent-children relationships, et al.; (c) the ob ject co-occurrence associations will be used to analyze the privacy sensitivity of other residue video objects (except the privacy-sensitive video objects) in the surveillance vi deo, and the privacy-insensitive objects which have strong co- occurrence associations with the privacy-sensitive video objects (which ha ve been blocked from the given video) may also become privacy-sens itive and will also be blocked from the given surveillance video. Therefore, our new definition of visual privacy depends on two issues: (a) privacy of individual video objects; and (b) the st rength of their co-occurrence associations with the privacy-sensitive video objects. For human-intended object detection, the team has done the following research: (a) developing a novel framework by integrating camera metadata a nd statistical analysis of video content to 60detect the intended objects more precisely; (b) develop a new video privacy protection framework which is able to maintain the utility of video at certain levels while protecting the video privacy effectively.

In their current stages of development, DHS command and control system initiatives such as Virtual USA and Watchkeeper focus primarily on delivering a common operating picture, a common commu nication platform and, occasionally, analytic support for key decisions. MDRP7 develops stra tegies and field demonstrations that extend these evolving capabilities by placing them in the context of tw o additional capabilities: (1) support for the ways the multi-stakeholder security community has chosen to work together (in the case of DHS systems, the NIMS Incident Command System) and (2) the sustainability of these systems based on stakeholder ownership, trust and, most impor tantly, the ability to achieve continuous improvement through actual use. The critical strength of NIMS/ICS is that it supports the integr ated efforts of a community of diverse stakeholders managing a complex, evol ving situation from diverse perspectives involving many different roles, responsibilities, decisions and actions. While NIMS/ICS provides a blueprint, the necessary level of c oordination and communication can be difficult to achieve, especially given the ma ny different agencies , organizations and units involved, each with its own mission, jurisdiction, processes, databases, systems and cultures. MDRP7 is working on next-generation CCI systems (w hat some call \"Precision Information Environments\") that will provide critical info rmation and communication capabilities within an environment that supports the unique, yet coordina ted efforts of the diverse safety and security community. To support the many perspectives and roles w ithin the security community, VACCINE is describing methods and strategies for developing next-generation CCI systems that enable in- field customization of CCI environments. This a llows each user group to further adopt their system perspective and capabilities to their particular roles and re sponsibilities, as well as to the evolving nature of the situation being manage d. To accomplish this, MDRP7 is developing an \"adaptive development\" strategy that increases stakeholder ownership an d trust by giving user groups the capability of guiding and achieving continuous system improvement even after the environment has been fielded. One key result is a more sustainable system that does not have to be replaced as evolving requirements emerge over time. 62Technical Approach The data collection methods used included expert consultation, field mon itors, and survey. The analytic methods used were case studies an d modeling. The nature of research was coordination/integration and hybrid basic-applied. 1.

Other outcomes / impacts Teaming with FAZD (Texas A&M) and VACCINE (Purdue), developed a demonstration of a next-generation CCI system. The team delivered th at demonstration as part of a regional field exercise involving numerous stak eholder agencies, over 300 personne l, on water assets, and the 63regional command center. From this experience, as well as literature analysis and discussions with key government personnel involved in CCI de velopment, the team has drawn a number of conclusions as to how next generation CCI syst ems can be better designed, developed, fielded, and maintained. Additional details of the resu lts, accomplishments and conclusions are provided below. Development of the PSICOE The Puget Sound Interagency Common Operating E nvironment (PSICOE) was adapted from the Dynamic Preparedness System (DPS\u2014developed by FAZD at the Texas Center for Applied Technology), which is an internet -based, adaptive software fr amework. Working with FAZD, VACCINE and regional security stakeholders led by the Coas t Guard, the team populated the framework with relevant informational components. To do this, they considered the nature of the decisions being supported, the roles of the pe ople making those decisions, and the tradeoff between simplicity of data capture versus inte gration with the PSICOE environment and other components. For example, personnel in the ex ercise wanted a compon ent to provide weather information, but this component did not need to be integrated with other information sources. Providing this component in an independent window that opened a local internet weather service was extremely simple. On the other hand, work ing with Purdue and VACCINE, they provided a Plume model that was fully integrated into the PSICOE interface and GI S map layer. This proved extremely powerful to decisi on makers, but also involved a great deal more effort than the independent weather component. They also provided pre-set configur ations of components and interface settings tailored to va rious communities of practive, called profiles . The four profiles created for the AMSC exercise were: (1) field, (2) planning, (3) unified command and 4) media/public information. The transformation of DPS to PSICOE was accomplished in six weeks, and demonstrated a set of basic information, analytic and communication capabilities for an on-water exercise involving small vesse ls with potential ra dioactive threats. The COE was further tailored to regional conditions through an analysis of key decision making communities and the decisions to be supported duri ng the target exercise. An analysis of the information environment and needs was conducte d with the Area Maritime Security Committee (AMSC) and five key decision making questions were identified to drive the development of components of the PSICOE. These five questions/d ecisions were: (1) Where are the threatening vessels and what is their status? (2) What is the na ture of the threat? Is th ere a dispersal device? (3) What should we do with the identified threat? Is there a place and/or condition (e.g. scuttled) that would lower the threat risk? (4) How are we managing the commercial and pleasure vessel traffic? (5) What are we telling the public? Th e pre-configured user profiles were used to support the stakeholder roles in answering these questions. Demonstration of the PSICOE during a Regional Exercise A regional scenario was designed to exercise the Coast Guard's implementation of NIMS/ICS in the detection of and res ponse to small vessels transporting ra dioactive material , possibly with a detonation device, in the Puget Sound maritime ar ena. Three choke points were established at 64inlets to the Sound and each was monitored by a br anch of field operations units. Blue force units were tracked using a tr ansponder data stream which wa s displayed on the PSICOE. Participating Coast Guard vessels designated pot entially threatening \"Red force\" units as triangular entities on the GIS display. Commerci al shipping traffic was monitored through the NAIS open-source tracking system. These and many other data components from a wide range of disparate sources were accommod ated within the COE framework. A screen capture of the PSICOE Unified Co mmand profile during the AMSC exercise The PSICOE was an adjunct experiment to the fi eld exercise and not intended to be a primary communication system, nor was it incorporated into the interagency action pl an. It was included in the exercise as a demonstration and presentati on of the COE, rather than as a fully functional information and communication system. For this reason, participants received minimal training in using the PSICOE prior to the exercise. The university teams trained the Coast Guard participants in how to use the PSICOE for approxi mately 2 hours, 2 days prior to the exercise. Participants were taught only those features that were anticipated to be of use for the various command roles. For example, training of on-wate r field participants focused on how to place a shape representing a potentially threatening vessel on the map co mponent, mark that entity as unknown/cleared/threatening, and shar e that component and inform ation with other selected units. Other training covered selecting a profile , entering event log en tries, using the plume model component, broadcasting data to other units, sharing files with other units, and using the resource/entity status component. The entity stat us component was intended to track vessels and report the current stat us of that entity. 65During the exercise, a university team member wa s stationed with each of the participating units in the command center. The units in the field were able to request assistance in using the PSICOE through cell phone contact with the univers ity teams. For several of the participating units, such as Unified Command, the university t eam representative became a dedicated PSICOE operator throughout the exercise. In other units, such as the public medi a joint information center (JIC), participants operated the PSICOE themselves. A pivotal moment during the exercise occurred when the covered communications radio channel became unavailable to Coast Guard units on the wa ter. The exercise was nearly cut short; however, the Unified Command decided to con tinue when field units began improvising by using the PSICOE event log and entity status components as a communications workaround for the remainder of the exercise. The PSICOE abr uptly became a focal point of the exercise, because units relied upon it for information and communication. Because no procedure for using the PSICOE co mmunication components had been established prior to the exercise, the field units began impr ovising ways to use the PSICOE as their primary communications channel. Two field units used th e event log to report which vessels they had boarded and what the subsequent vessel status was. The other field unit reported this information using the entity status component. In terestingly, without specific training and using the flexible COE with different strategies, the units were able to successfully complete the exercise. This demonstrated a proof-of-concept fo r the COE's flexibility, effectiveness, and ease of use. Once the simulated nuclear material had been discovered during the exercise, the Unified Command used the PSICOE to brainstorm and vi sualize possible courses of action to mitigate the threat. The plume model became a primary visual analytics tool for this effort. The UC used the PSICOE as a decision-support tool while de vising plans which would minimize projected deaths and illnesses if the nuclear device detonated. In this manne r, the UC decided on a plan to move the vessel in question into open water, where a crane and barg e could be used to raise the vessel for inspection and neutralize the simulated radioactive threat. While creative and successful, th is operation of the Unified Co mmand was outside of regular ICS procedures. In their ad hoc communicati ons solution, field units provided all available information to the UC, whereas under usual conditions the Situation Unit, Planning, and Operations teams gather and sift informati on before presenting to UC. Under normal ICS conditions, these groups periodical ly report the situation on the ground and suggest plans for the next operational period to the UC, which is res ponsible for vetting and eventually approving a suggested plan. As a spur-of-the-moment wo rkaround, PSICOE upset this procedure during the exercise by allowing field units to provide all in formation to all units within the command center. Lessons from the Exercise One lesson learned from the exercise is that an initial set of procedures should be developed jointly between the client and development or ganizations during the preliminary development 66period of the COE. Ideally, the COE should be introduced to the client organization in tandem with training on procedures to use the environm ent. In addition, a set of guidelines should be introduced at the same time for developing furthe r applications and making interface changes. This is intended to preserve the common opera ting picture of the system while allowing flexibility for individual user groups to develop the COE to their needs. Second, introducing the PSICOE independent of the incident action plan upset the established ICS information gathering, processing and sharing procedures. Unintentionally as part of the improvised communications workaround, the PSICOE sh ared all available in formation with the Unified Command, circumvented the Situation Un it, Planning and Opera tions sections to evaluate information and formulate plans. Uninte nded consequences, such as this disturbance in the procedures of the client or ganization, should be explored w ith an eye towards understanding how the power of a next-generation informati on and communication environment can affect, for good or bad, existing organizati onal processes an d strategies. This issue of information sharing also illustra ted the complexity of the regional information system as a whole. The ICS structure and proce dures currently in place are meant to provide the Unified Command with regular information feeds which have been filter ed for relevance and distilled by the other ICS units . However, given the access to all information (through an environment such as the PSICOE), the members of the UC, who are genera lly also the decision making bodies of the Sector and other participa ting agencies, may not relinquish this complete view in favor of the distilled information pi cture prescribed by ICS procedures. System developers and planners must work as facilitators to help resolve these kinds of tensions and to align new capabilities with the ove rall strategy of the organization. Challenges Several prerequisites exist for a pplying a new, more participator y design approach in a crisis response management organization. First, the organization's lead ership must support the system development and foster ownership of the CO E within the organization. Success depends upon how much the user groups take ow nership of the system and conti nue to cultivate the COE. The client organizations must lead in guiding the evolution of the system to meet their needs while using the expertise of the development organization to facilitate that progress. Second, the system development organization and the client organization must establish a long- term, trusted relationship to successfully cultiv ate the COE. This service business model for technology development is already being adopted in other contexts, such as internet services, but has yet to be fully recognized as a superior method for creating sustainable CCI systems. Third, to successfully implement a new development paradigm, usability experts, designers and system analysts must relinquish some of their ro les as creators and owners of systems and take up the challenge of facilitating design and deve lopment of systems owned by users. Such professionals will be required to augment their sk ill sets to accommodate this change in roles. 67Conclusions VACCINE proposes adaptive development (AD) as a unique and superior development paradigm for COEs in the context of mission-driven or ganizations. AD does not address development methods directly, but instead presents a holistic design an d development model based on ongoing and contextual development of the system. AD maintain s a two-level developm ent process driven by the community of practice: macro-level system definition and micro-level system development . AD is based on two principles of pr actice: (1) the bulk of system de velopment occurs \"live\" within the client organization after a ba se architecture and capability ha s been introduced to the target environment, and (2) system analysts facilitate user-driven development of the COE application layer according to the client's overall information strategy and constraints. Adaptive development process model AD addresses the deficiency in current developm ent processes for creating sustainable COEs. The greatest opportunity AD presents is that it may allow us to cr eate and manage systems which last 10, 15 or more years while becoming more us eful over time. This presents clear incentives based on costs of creating new sy stems from scratch every few y ears, retraining, mistakes and inefficiencies due to technology turnover. AD also presents the opportunity to create mo re useful and successful COEs. Through a two- tiered development process, one level focusing on aligning the COE with the information strategy of the organization and the other level focusing on developing flavors of the system for individual user groups, AD provi des a more holistic and comprehensive development process than preceding models. 68Interagency collaboration is another area where AD is likely to provide greater benefits than other system development models. This is becau se AD classifies changes in trusted partners, selective information sharing, and rapid a pplication development as routine systems development. The process's continuous development strategy is geared to accommodate rapid changes in relationship and information sharing within and among organizations. Further study is needed to develop the concept of AD for mission-driven security communities. The PSICOE project is an ongoing effort which can continue to reveal the challenges and successes of using an AD development approach w ithin the United States Coast Guard and other DHS agencies. Finally, it should be noted that the AD approach to COEs presented here represents a future direction that builds on the important current situational awareness/information sharing effort known as Virtual USA. Most impo rtantly, the team adds the s upport of an inter-agency ICS management strategy and a framework for future Precision Information Environments (PIE). The PIE concept, introduced by the DHS Basic/Futures Research thrust area (under Dr. Joe Kielman), will combine an overwhelming number of diverse data sources and advanced visual analytic tools with information tailored to the us ers' roles, needs and cognitive capacities. 69MDRP 9: Mobile Imaging, Rosetta Phone, and Light-Weight Visual Analytics for in-Field Analytics Team VACCINE: Purdue University: Ed Delp, Mimi Boutin Abstract The Rosetta Phone is a hand-held translation device for foreign text currently being developed by Purdue in collaboration with Next Wave Systems, LLC. The goal of this device is to enable an individual with little or no prior knowledge of foreign language s to recognize and translate foreign text in real time and without the use of a network connection. Th is particular project focuses on developing the methodology and software needed to enable the Rosetta Phone to automatically read and translate Spanish documents. Technical Approach The data collection method used was data mining. The analytic methods used were case studies and statistical analysis. The nature of research used was hybrid basic-applied. Milestones Milestones for VACCINE Period 1 07/01/09 - 03/31/10 Quarterly Identification of representative document type for development and testing purposes X Picture database acquisition X X Development of reading software X X Development of translation software X X Deployment of reading and translation software on portable device X Testing and performance evaluation X Project Outcomes (Results, A ccomplishments, Conclusions) We have developed and deployed a Spanish language translator on a mobile phone that can read and translate a limited set of Spanish language image documents. Other outcomes/impacts The team decided to focus their efforts on Spanish magazines and newspapers. For development and testing, th ey acquired 10 pictures of a Spanish magazine and a Spanish newspaper (both from Spain) us ing a 6 Mpx digital camera (Casio EXZ110). All pictures were acquired indoors and without flas h. The articles they chose in cluded single columns and double column articles, as well different font styles, sizes and colors. 70Different open source OCR software tools were tested, including OCRpus, Tesseract, OCRad, GOCR. The most accurate one was fo und to be Tesseract. The next most accurate tool is OCRad. OCRad also has faster speed and lower memory requirements than Tesseract. However, the team decided to use Tesseract, as the accuracy of OCRad was very poor on some of the test pictures. There are two main classes of machine translation software: rule-based and statistics-based. After surveying the available existing open source translation tools, the team chose to test Apertium, a rule-based translati on engine using markov models, as well as Moses, a statistics- based translation software. Both types of soft ware were found to be adequate. But overall, Apertium seems to be best candidate, as it combines lightness, a wide range of topics, and can be used to translate between similar language s and dialects, such as Spanish-Catalan. Using Tesseract and Apertium, they implemente d a command-line-based system to read and translate Spanish articles on the Nokia N900. Note: A commercial software for translation of text found on pictures for the Nokia N900 was recently released. The software is called Photo Translator and uses a network connection to translate the text. The team installed this soft ware on one of our Nokia N900 and tested it. For the moment, the function \"capture a picture\" is not enabled. Unfortunately, all the images they tried gave them lecture errors. It thus appears that the software is not quite ready for prime time. 71MDRP 11: Financial Fraud Visual Analytics Team VACCINE: University of North Carolina at Charlotte: William Ribarsky, Robert Kosara Purdue University: Niklas Elmqvist Abstract This project's goal is to develop and evaluate ne w visual analytics tools to explore and discover behaviors (suspicious behavior, em erging risk behavior) in financ ial transaction data. To uncover suspicious behavior, we are developing a set of tools based on a hierarchical data model for interactive exploration ev en with millions of transactions ov er up to a year's time period. This approach uses multiple views of the transactional da ta to pinpoint suspicious behavior that would not be apparent with just one view. The analyst can then drill down to the partic ular account or related accounts (having the same keyword signatur es) for detailed inves tigation. Emerging risk analysis is a much broader area that seeks to uncover emerging risk in the bank's transactional, credit card, and loan portfolios that may not be adequately accounted for. The effect of the economic downturn and job losses in specific in dustries on unsecured loans for specific groups of customers is an example of such emerging risk s. Tools such as those used for fraud analysis, geographic analysis tools, and tools to include and correlate multiple dimensions of behaviors and ratings are being developed or applied to th is analysis. Emerging risks are important factors for resilience of financial inst itutions and the financial system. Technical Approach This research employs analytic methods, including modeling, sampling, case studies, econometrics, risk assessment, and st atistical analysis. The nature of the research is hybrid basic- applied and applied. Data collection methods include compiling & sorting DB, data mining, expert consultation, and field monitors.

Other outcomes/impacts: Based on VACCINE's previously developed Wi reVis tools, the team is developing the FraudWatch tools and methods. Although Wire Vis focused on money laundering in wire transactions, FraudWatch has a larger purview , applying visual analytics to explore large amounts of financial transactional data over a ra nge of types and discover suspicious activity. The tools then permit detailed analysis of the suspicious activity and enable automated search (through the signatur es and keywords of the target transa ctions) for other tr ansactions with similar properties. Working with Agus Sudjianto, Senior Vice Presiden t and head of the analytics groups at Bank of America (BoA), the team has begun a project that i nvolves predictive risk an alytics, especially of emerging risks. The BoA approach is heavy on au tomated methods and statistical techniques, but due to the very large data and complex analyses they realize that humans must be involved in attaching meaning to the results, discovering in sights, and drawing conc lusions. This is where interactive visualization and visual analytics co mes in. In addition to bank transaction data, the team is looking at new data, such as credit card transactions. There will be a period of months where they will jointly deve lop ideas and methods followed by presentation to senior management. After that the project coul d get a lot bigger on the bank's side. This work ties in with the financial analytics wo rk in the DHS project, but it is broader. The VACCINE team is bringing the FraudWatch tools into this arena, where the tools will be augmented for predictive risk analytics. In addition, the team is developing a new set of complementary tools and methods, with BoA hel p, that will look at credit ratings, amount of secured and unsecured loan activity, types of lo ans, geographic distribution to bring out the economic climate and health of a region, and othe r factors to determine detailed, time-dependent risk profiles that are flexible enough to accoun t for unforeseen factors revealed in the data analysis. These factors can th en be inserted for more r obust predictive risk analysis. The team should also be able to build off of the knowledge gained and methods developed here in establishing relationships with other banks an d financial services companies. Finally, BoA has 73developed a rather rigorous curriculum for training new employees from non-financial backgrounds in what they need to know in financial anal ytics. This can be qu ite useful input for their educational programs; in particular, they plan to develop a financial informatics and analytics Professional Science Masters that can be a significant part of the VACCINE educational offerings. As planned and in addition to the team's work with Bank of America, they have had further discussions with Wells Fargo/Wachovia and with TIAA-CREF. They are planning a Financial Analytics Workshop with Agus Sudjianto of Bank of America. This will probably be in Winter, 2011. Invitees will include banks and insurance companies (inc luding BoA, Wells Fargo, and TIAA-CREF), leading university re searchers, and significant re presentatives from government agencies. During the workshop they will establish a research agenda in fi nancial analytics that will correlate with the VACCINE agenda, and will also encompass broader needs in risk analytics for government and the financial industry and customer analytics for the banks. In addition, the workshop will provi de an opportunity to present th e latest relevant tools and methods from visual analytics a nd other relevant fields that can serve as a foundation for new research. The partnership with Bank of America is giving the team access to analysis, customer data, and business approaches that is unprecedented for a university. They are working with the BoA analytics group, which has access to all BoA transact ional, corporate, credit card, and other data for its worldwide operations. The an alytics group uses a combination of advanced statistical and database techniques. The analyt ic group also appreciates the va lue of visualization for the complex reasoning problems they face based on expl oration of large scale multivariate data. This is a perfect partnership for the deve lopment of visual analytics tools. They have placed a Ph.D. student as a full-time employee of the bank and a faculty member of the VACCINE team as a consultant. With this arrangement, they are getting access to bank data and analytic tools. Although the Ph.D. student is a bank employee, his R&D activities are supervised by the UNCC team and the head of the BoA analytics group. Thus the team has full access to the tools and analyses the student develops and will use them for the tools developed in this project. As initial results from the project are presented to BoA management, they expect it to grow substantially. A graduate research assistant has also been hired and is developing simulated financial transaction data. BoA is helping the team on this task, and they have also formed a partnership with Mark Whiting and his group at PNNL to use thei r threat generato r to simulate large sets of financial transactions. Some of this data will have suspicio us activity inserted in them. Highlight: Working with Agus Sudjianto, Senior Vice Presiden t and head of the analytics groups at Bank of America (BoA), we have begun a project that invol ves predictive risk anal ytics, especially of emerging risks. The BoA approach is heavy on au tomated methods and statistical techniques, but due to the very large data and complex analyses they realize that humans must be involved in 74attaching meaning to the results, discovering in sights, and drawing conc lusions. This is where interactive visualization and visual analytics co mes in. In addition to bank transaction data, we are looking at new data, such as credit card tran sactions. There will be a period of months where we will jointly develop ideas and methods follo wed by presentation to senior management. After that the project could get a lot bigger on the bank's side. We are planning a fellowship program that could support several Ph.D. st udents in visualization and/or analytics. These students will work intimately with developers in the BoA an alytics group and with their thesis advisors, developing and pursuing re levant thesis topics. This work ties in with the financ ial analytics work in the DHS proj ect, but it is broader. We are bringing the FraudWatch tools into this arena, where they will be augmented for predictive risk analytics. In addition, we are developing a new set of complementary tools and methods, with BoA help, that will look at credit ratings, amount of secured and unsecured loan activity, types of loans, geographic distribution to bring out the ec onomic climate and health of a region, and other factors to determine detailed, time-dependent risk profiles that are flexible enough to account for unforeseen factors revealed in the data analysis . These factors can then be inserted for more robust predictive risk analysis. This visual analy tics-based analysis will address resiliency in the financial system, providing a new di mension of interest to DHS. Finally, BoA has developed a rather rigorous curriculum for training new employees from non- financial backgrounds in what they need to know in financial analytics. Th is can be quite useful input for our education programs; in particular, we plan to deve lop a financial informatics and analytics Professional Science Masters that can be a significant part of the VACCINE educational offerings. 75MDRP 12: Foreign Animal and Zoon otic Disease Visual Analytics Team VACCINE: Purdue University: David Ebert, William (Bill) Cleveland Pennsylvania State University: Alan MacEachren, Frank Hardisty FAZD: Texas A&M (FAZD) : Newville Clark, David Hartley Abstract This work focuses on developing and applying new exploratory visual analytics (EVA) methods for spatial and space-time forei gn animal and zoonotic disease data (e.g., data related to avian influenza, rift valley fever, swine flu, West N ile virus). The VACCINE team will extend their methods for spatial cluster and pattern analysis and their implementation. A key goal is to provide tools that help analysts clarify the spatial (and spatio -temporal) structure of foreign animal and zoonotic disease phenomena, thus l eading to better disease outbreak prediction. In complementary work they will explore use of ge ographic information systems (GIS) to integrate disease, environmental, demographic, and ot her geographic data necessary to understand disease-environment and disease-human relationships. Initial work will focus on creating an initial prototype visual analytic system for Rift Valley Fever (R VF) tailored to two user groups: epidemiological modelers and decision makers. VACCINE efforts resulted in a suite of spatia l analysis methods implemented in the GeoViz Toolkit that will lead to better understanding of diseases of zoonotic origin. These methods include interactive cluster detection, interactive spatial structure exploration (using Moran's I), and space-time spatial structure exploration (usi ng LISTA-Viz). These methods will be applied against the West Nile virus dataset to inve stigate virus distribution over space and time. Grant activities also included sorting and aggrega ting Pennsylvania mosquito data to allow for efficient data viewing through web- based application at weekly/mont hly/yearly intervals. This has also been done for daily climate inform ation. The year with the worst WNV-positive mosquitoes as well as the most number of repo rted human cases was used for preliminary testing of a web application. Technical Approach The data collection methods used were comp iling & sorting DB, and expert consultation. Statistical analysis and modeling were used for analytic methods. The nature of research was hybrid basic-applied. 76Milestones Milestones for VACCINE Period 1 07/01/09 - 03/31/10 Quarterly Development of epidemiological visual analytic environment prototype for RVF X X Development of linked epi-economic visual analytic prototype X X Design of decision maker interface and decision factors for RVF planning and response X Prepare plan outlining approach to GIS-based analysis of PA West Nile Virus data X Prepare plan for interface enhancements to support usability and utility of the integration of Proclude into the GeoViz Toolkit X Release version of GeoViz Toolkit with enhanced Proclude usability.

The GeoViz Toolkit was introduced to public health practitioners in a Tutorial given at the URISA GIS in Public Health Conf erence. Providence, RI, June 5-8, 2009. Other outcomes/impacts Development of extensions to the GeoViz Toolki t to support spatial an d space-time analysis In VACCINE's work on component-oriented c oordination methods to support geovisual (and more generally visual) analysis, the team ha s developed a new stra tegy for visualization coordination through the combination of several recent advances in software engineering: automatic introspection of objects, software design patterns, and reflective invocation of methods. This strategy is called Introspective Ob server Coordination and demonstrates how this method can allow end users to create their own vi sualization toolkits on the fly, solve challenges associated with coupling spa tial analysis methods to geovi sualization methods, and make geovisualization applications sharable between users. In order to identify autocorrela tion in space and time simultaneous ly, the team has implemented a spatio-temporal version of the Local Moran's I statistic, and claim two advances. First, they exploit the fact that there are a limited number of topological relationships present in the data to make Monte Carlo simulation computationally tractable, and thereb y bypass the \"curse of dimensionality\" which has prevented widespread a pplication of this method in the past. Second, the team developed a tool (LISTA-Viz) for in teracting with the spa tio-temporal structure uncovered by the statistics. In addition to the above, Hardisty and Robins on developed a plan to iteratively refine the Proclude GeoViz Toolkit interface to enhance its usability and utility, to complete one round of evaluation and inte rface enhancements. Visual analytics, GIS, and spatial anal ysis applied to West Nile Virus Data In addition to the team's core method and tool development research, they have pursued a case study application that supports wo rk of the Pennsylvania West N ile Virus monitoring program. A multi-year data set (of 35,000 insect traps and re sults of testing for WNV) over multiple years has been obtained from the State of Pennsylvania. Analysis of the data revealed that thirteen species contained WNV. Of these, two key species may be involved in the transmission of West Nile virus in Pennsylvania with an additional two competent ve ctors. Distribution of these species varies in space and time within a ye ar and between years with species composition 78changing within a season and between years. Data is in point form and has been aggregated to municipality level to im prove computation time. The data covers 9 years of information with mo squitoes collected at a variety of traps, at different intervals within a single location and at different intervals across the different trap locations. For example, sampling may occur on a weekly basis at a single location during the peak season and less regularly at the start and e nd of the season and/or certain locations once the problem has been reduced. In addition, frequency of sampling at the same location may change. Of the total sampled locations, 1400 have been sampled annually while others have been sampled intermittently. Additional complexities inhe rent in the data are the traps. A number of traps have been used each attracting a specific species and/or a species at a specific life-stage (e.g. host-seeking females seeking their first blood meal versus hos t-seeking females that have already had at least one pr evious blood-meal and may have acquired the virus). Preliminary analyses were performed on the data using the GeoViz Toolkit Proclude module, but it is not yet clear if significant \"hotspots\" were identified. Due to the complexity of the data, the next stage is to run a series of time-series anal yses against species-trap type to determine how species-dominance may change over time. This w ill be run at different aggregated scales and using different time slices. Initial investigatio ns will include the use of the Morans-I statistic time-series analysis described below. Environmental factors such as temperature play a key role in the developm ent of mosquitoes as well as the ability of the mosquito to transm it the virus once it has been acquired. Daily temperature and precipitation data were also obta ined for Pennsylvania for the time-frame of the mosquito data (2001-2009). A degree-day model has been used in Wyom ing and California to predict West Nile virus occurr ence over time. A PhD student has been comparing accuracy of degree models and thresholds in predicting West Nile virus in Pennsylvania at four locations. Preliminary results show that using temperature may be sufficient in predicting the transmission of West Nile virus in one locat ion of Pennsylvania and against one species. Initial results were consistent against 2 years. Based on these resu lts, potential collaborators have been consulted about a possible grant proposal to another funding agency that would leverage our DHS work. Three scenarios were developed to aid in the de velopment of web-based tools for the exploration and communication of data about WNV. These included providing (a) basic information for the general public to view current risk, (b) comprehens ive level of information with some interaction possible, and (c) compre hensive level of information with data interaction and statistical analysis. Medium and comprehensive levels are aimed at researchers and policy makers with a more in depth understanding of the WNV-mosquito system as well as st atistical analysis. The VACCINE team developed a suite of spatial analysis methods in th e GeoViz Toolkit that will lead to better understanding of diseases of zoonotic origin. These methods include 79interactive cluster detection, in teractive spatial structure expl oration (using Moran's I), and space-time spatial structure exploration (using LI STA-Viz). These methods will then be applied against the West Nile virus da taset to investigate virus dist ribution over space and time. In addition, the team has sorted and aggregated the Pennsylvania mosquito data to allow for efficient data viewing through web- based application at weekly/mont hly/yearly intervals. This has also been done for the daily climate info rmation. The year with the worst WNV-positive mosquitoes as well as the most number of repo rted human cases was used for preliminary testing of a web application. Visual analytics and decision making tools applied to pandemic modeling Other scenario analysis tools in clude our work in pandemic mode ling and visualization. PanViz technology provides public health officials with a suite of visual analytic tools for analyzing the spread of a pandemic based on Gaussian mixture m odels. This tool allows officials to analyze various decision points (school closure, media re ports and strategic natio nal stockpile medicinal releases) and their impact on the sp read of the pandemic. In order to help public health officials better understand these charges, we have develope d the PanViz toolkit. Through the application of the Indiana State Pandemic Influenza Planni ng Tool developed by partners at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, we simulate a pandemic outbreak originating in Chicago, IL with attack and mortality rates similar to the 1918 pandemic. Our PanViz tool allows officials to track the spread of influenza acr oss the state of Indiana and imple ment various decision measures at any time during the pandemic. These decision measures can be toggled on and off to allow users to better understand their effects on differe nt county populations. Demographic filtering is also available for various age ranges, and inte ractive manipulation of model parameters allow users to create various le vels of pandemic severity in order to assess various situations. By using this tool, officials can anal yze resources and decision. Visual analytics and decision making t ools applied to Rift Valley Fever modeling Along with modeling pandemics using a Gaussian mixture model, other work has focused on differential equation spread models, particularly focusing on the spread of Rift Valley Fever. Our work in rift valley fever modeling provides a fram ework in which scientists, decision makers and healthcare officials can analyze potential threats to va rious environments. Information about disease transmission and infected areas is displa yed in a linked geo-spatiotemporal environment allowing for the analysis of disease spread over ti me. Users are interactively able to analyze the loss of life, illness and economic impact across affected geogra phic areas. While recent work has focused on accurately modeling disease sprea d, little work has been done in developing interactive decision suppor t tools for analyzing the future co urse of the outbr eak and evaluating potential disease mitigation strategies. The absence of such tools makes it difficult for researchers, analysts and public health official s to evaluate response measures within outbreak scenarios. As such, our resear ch focuses on the development of an interactive decision support environment in which users can explore epidem ic models and their impact. This environment 80provides a spatiotemporal view where users can interactively utilize mitigative response measures and observe the impact of their deci sion over time. The envir onment also provides decision history visualization a nd navigation tools that support the comparison of mortality and infection rates corresponding to di fferent response measures at diffe rent points in time. Our tool provides decision history support visualizations to help anal ysts identify locally optimal combinations of response measures. In this manner, our tool allows for simultaneous decision comparison and minimizes the risk of wasting re sources while supporting an effective mitigative campaign. 81MDRP 13: GeoJunction: Collaborative Visual -Computational Information Foraging and Contextualization to Support Situation Awareness Team VACCINE: Pennsylvania State University: Alan MacEachren, Prasenjit Mitra CCICADA: University of Southern California: Hovy Abstract This project focuses on developing, implem enting, assessing, and transitioning methods and tools to (a) help analysts, crisis managers, an d policy makers find and contextualize relevant multimodal information quickly and (b) to support th e situation awareness (SA) that is required to interpret evidence and make decisions in a continually changing environment. Specifically, GeoJunction is conceived as a knowledge-enabl ed, place-time aware, and computationally enhanced web-based environment that supports vi sually-enabled: (a) docu ment query filtered by place, time, person/organization, and concept; (b) collaborative information foraging, entity and relation extraction, and c ontextualization; (c) exploration of connections between social and geographic networks; and (d) si tuation assessment and monito ring with continually updating information. Technical Approach The data collection methods utilized were compiling & sorting DB, data mining, expert consultation, and survey. Analytic methods utili zed were case studies, sampling, and statistical analysis. The nature of research was consul tation, hybrid basic-applie d, and hybrid applied- consultation.

Environmental Modelling & Software 27 (7 ):1501-1512. {joint Regiona l Observatory project} Follow-on funding/related projects The National Science Foundation invited a proposal for a contract project ($25,000) to adapt methods in our initial Health GeoJunction applica tion for application to an alysis of their grants database. The objective is to demonstrate the pot ential of our place-time-concept filtering and sensemaking support tools to support th e work of program officers at NSF. Other outcomes / impacts Research during the 9 months of year one focuse d on four linked activitie s. First, the VACCINE team completed the development of, as well as a publication and video about, Health GeoJunction (an application that supports quick filtering and place-time-concept sensemaking with research abstracts). The second activity was re search carried out as pa rt of a course project to investigate usability and utility of GeoDeliberator (a web-based collaborative deliberation tool that implements map-based asynchronous strategi es). The third activity involved a Masters degree project that focused on the development of collaborative geographic query tools to support different-place work with maps in contexts such as planning for resilience or crisis 83response. The fourth activity was in coordina tion with the team's work on MDRP #1, they developed a system architecture to support capture, storage, and retrieval of text artifacts to be made accessible to users through different visual interfaces for different application situations. Health GeoJunction The initial prototype tool, H ealth GeoJunction was focused na rrowly on quick filtering and place-time-concept sensemaking with research abstracts. The volume of health science publications was and still is escalating rapi dly. Thus, keeping up with developments was becoming harder as was the task of findi ng important cross-domain connections. When geographic location was a relevant component of research reporte d in publications, these tasks were more difficult because standard search and indexing facilities have limited or no ability to identify geographic foci in documents. To address this need, Health GeoJunction provid es a web application that supports analysts in the task of quickly finding scientific publica tions that are relevant geographically and temporally, as well as thematically. More specifically, Health GeoJunction (Figure 1) is a geovisual analytics-enabled web application pr oviding: (a) web services using computational reasoning methods to extract place-time-concep t information from bibliographic data for documents and (b) visually-enabled place-time -concept query, filteri ng, and contextualizing tools that apply to both the documents and thei r extracted content. The emphasis in this component of the research, specifically, is on strate gies for visually-enable d, iterative, facet-like, place-time-concept filtering that allows analysts to quickly drill down to scientific findings of interest in PubMed abstracts and to explore rela tions among abstracts and extracted concepts in place and time. The approach enab les analysts to: find publications without knowing all relevant query parameters, recognize unanticipated geogr aphic relations within and among documents in multiple health domains, identify the thematic em phasis of research targeting particular places, notice changes in concepts over time, and no tice changes in places where concepts are emphasized. PubMed is a database of over 19 million biomedical abstracts and citations maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Informati on; achieving quick filtering is an important contribution due to the database size. Including geography in filters is important due to rapidly escalating attention to geographic factors in pub lic health. The implementation of mechanisms for iterative place-time-concept filtering makes it possible to narrow searches efficiently and quickly from thousands of documents to a small s ubset that meet place-time-concept constraints. Support for a more-like-this query creates the potential to identify unexpected connections across diverse areas of research. Multi-view visualizat ion methods support unders tanding of the place, time, and concept components of document collec tions and enable compar ison of filtered query results to the full set of publications. 84 Figure 1. Shows the result after the user clicked on the \"about\" side of the Thailand symbol on the map, filtering the result to only those judg ed (based on MeSH or GeoJunction feature extraction tools) to be about Th ailand, and the user clicked on \"disease outbreak\" in the top tag cloud to further filter to the subset of documen ts about Thailand that are also about disease outbreaks. Not surprisingly, H5N1 virus has moved up to be the third most frequent term in this set of documents (now including only 23 of the orig inal set). Then, the user identified two papers of interest. The geographic footprin ts of both are depicted on the map and the abstract for one is highlighted. GeoDeliberator Assessment In a controlled study (conducte d without VACCINE funding as pa rt of a Geovisual Technology Use & Usability course, under its own IRB), the team investigated the extent that a web application, the GeoDeliberat or (Figure 2), facilitated th e construction and use of map annotations as visual artif acts for mediating asynchronous de liberation about a geographic problem. A multi-view interface design provided linked geographic, temporal, and conceptual views of discussion contributi ons made as map annotations, comments georeferencing marks placed on the map. Employing a quasi-asynchronous protocol in a lab environment, the team assessed the usability of the system; while partic ipants performed a number of decision-making activities. During each session the means for re al-time communication was removed and pairs of stakeholders were asked to use a map-based tool to articulate issues and identify the issues most relevant to a geographic problem solving scenario. 85Results of the assessment outlined will be applied to guide the design of follow-up studies assessing the utility of the system for aiding th e process of deliberation. The design decisions assessed in this study are an initial implementati on of approaches that allow group work with relevance to a number of group activities including: visual que ry of geographic information across space-time-conceptual dimensions; co llaborative, geographica lly contextualized information foraging; exploring social network interactions through deliberation artifacts; monitoring activities and situation assessment. Figure 2: The GeoDeliberator interface show s map annotations over a trail network map (middle); a time series view of the discussion (bo ttom); a history of recent activity (lower right); a network view of contributions and responses (right, middle). Collaborative Spatial Query Processes of knowledge-building, situation as sessment, planning and decision-making are frequently accomplished by groups of remotely lo cated people working t ogether. Research in the field of geocollaboration has been aimed at discovering ways to support this type of collaborative work using GIS te chnologies. Past research in geocollaboration has typically started with an assumption that all relevant data have been assembled and represented on a shared map. However, that is often not the case, particularly in domains like crisis response and risk assessment. A key task often faced by collaborat ors is to find the right data to meet the task at hand, thus, there is a need for tools that support synchronous colla borative spatial data queries. The goals of this research were (a) to create the Spatial Quer ies in Synchronous Collaboratories (SQSynC) software to enable remote, collaborati ve spatial query in real-time requiring only an 86internet connection and web browser and (b) to analyze the methods used by geographers to construct the queries in this environment to develop a deeper understa nding of the process. The SQSynC software prototype is a web-base d application implemented using Adobe Flex, Google Maps and PostgreSQL. SQSynC can support both synchronous and asynchronous collaborative interactions between the users and the interface (Figure 3). In synchronous mode, the software behaves as if there is only one inte rface that every user is concurrently interacting with, even though each user is remotely connected through individual computers. For instance, if one person were to pan and zoom the map, ev ery other user would see the map change. In asynchronous mode, the software provides each user with a distinct, priv ate interface that no other users can see or interact with. To enab le more direct collabora tion, a second, public tab exists. Users can move items from their private tab over to the public tab in order to share them with the other users. In both modes, a visual query interface allows users to quickly select categories of information from large and distributed data repositories and to apply filters to the multiple data categories quickly. Figure 3: SQSynC running in synchronous mode, showing three users simultaneously interacting with the query editor to find a specific set of data . Each user's cursor ge ts tracked and as a user interacts with a widget, that widget is lock ed for all other users to prevent conflict. 87Experiments were conducted using the SQS ynC prototype, to expl ore how geographers collaboratively query spatial data. Participants, working in pairs, were asked to collaboratively work through a set of tasks using the synchronous mode of the application, and then another set of tasks using the asynchronous mode (half of the participants starte d with the synchronous mode, the other half started with the asynchronous mode). In the synchronous mode, each user could simultaneously interact with a shared query building interface. In the asynchronous mode users could communicate with each other and share data on the public tab, but there was no shared qu ery building interface with which they could simultaneously interact, only a private interf ace (Figure 4). A total of 16 pa rticipants took part in the experiment, and they each completed a follow-up su rvey that asked questions about which mode they preferred, any critical incidents that occurr ed, features that they liked, and other comments and suggestions. For various given reasons, 56 % of participants preferred the asynchronous mode of collaborative query build ing, while 44% preferred the s ynchronous mode. The results of this experiment ultimately show that in geocollaboration software there is a place for both private and shared query building tools. GeoJunction Software Architecture - adapte d to support NSF grants data analysis With support from the National Science Foundation in the form of a contr act ($25,000), a second generation GeoJunction interface has been developed. As part of th e process, we have begun the process of developing a more robust and extens ible system architecture that shares major components with those developed for our SensePl ace application (discussed within MDRP #1). Figure 4: Part of the SQSynC interface wh en running in asynchronous mode, showing the private and public tabs. 88The GeoJunction-2 system provides capacity for querying documents based on themes, places, and time. Figure 5 shows the user interface that facilitates the query. Specifically, the Tag cloud view and Text Query view allow fuzzy querying on multiple thematic terms. The Time view and Map view restrict the results (a list of documen ts) for specific time periods, with the ability to focus in some geographical regions (e.g., a partic ular country). The documents are displayed in the Table view, allowing users to scan through and select an interesting one to read in the Document view. Related documents can be found fo r the selected one. The system architecture is described next. Figure 5: User interface at client-side: (1) Time vi ew, (2) Tag cloud view, (3) Text Query view, (4) Table view, (5) Map view, (6) Document view. The system was approximately 50% implemented at the close of project year one. It will include the following components: (1) user interface that provides the view s; (2) database that store the data that contain text documents and informa tion of geographical location and time); (3) Lucene indexer that facilitate fast query and relevant ranking on the results; (4) Query worker that perform queries on database and Lucene indexer (5 ) components that provide following services: text processing and extraction, geoc oding, and map services; (6) centr al controller to coordinate client side requests, services, and queries on data base and Lucene indexes. The system has been designed, so it can be easily adapted and merged to SensePlace. It can take advantage of the central database system and Lucene indexer of SensePlace, employing the existing services. Assuming the query requests from the users are sim ilar, the main structure of the user interfaces and controller can be reused for SensePlace. More functions can be added to the user interface to meet the requirement of SensePlace. 89Key objectives addressed during this initial ti me period were: (a) a prototype already in development (based on NEVAC research) was comp leted that implements strategies to support component 'a' of the overall environment; (b) produced a video demo (posted online) and a paper (submitted) documenting the visually-enabled approach to place-time-concept query; (c) designed an architecture for gene ralizing the system to add support for: collaborative information foraging; entity and relation ex traction, and contextualization; and situation assessment and monitoring. In addition two student initiate d projects were carrie d out; one focused on collaborative distributed spatia l query methods and the other on developing tools for distributed, map-based deliberation. 90MDRP 14: Multimedia Visual Analyt ics for Investigative Analysis Team VACCINE: University of North Carolina at Charlotte: William (Bill) Ribarsky, Jianping Fan, Jing Yang Purdue University: Edward Delp Abstract When many online news sources are analyzed simu ltaneously, there can be tens of thousands of stories over a given period of time. The ebb and fl ow of stories on a s ubject can also have a highly dynamic temporal characte r. To handle this, VACCINE is developing a fully integrated and comprehensive multimedia visual analytics syst em that starts with the automated results, and then employs a detailed time-based analysis of related news stories to turn them into \"event streams\" or \"event clusters\". Each event stream or cluster begins with a significant motivating event (an occurrence at a particular time and location), which is then followed by a flow of relevant stories and follow-on ev ents. In addition to temporal vi ews of the narrative structures, the team is developing relational views that make the connections among different clusters of stories clear and concept views that go well be yond usual keyword lists to provide meaningful clustering of stories based on content. This gro up of methods is being applied to online news, blogs, and RSS feeds. The events and concepts a ppear naturally from the news or other data collections. They are not predetermined; thus an an alysis will cover, cate gorize, and structure all the news. Technical Approach This research employs data mining and anal ytic methods, including modeling, sampling, and statistical analysis. The nature of th e research is hybrid basic-applied.

Other outcomes/impacts Click2Annotate and ManyInsights Click2Annotate an insight annota tion that allows semi -automatic insight annotation at the sub-task level, which has higher levels of semantic richness and abstraction than at the action or event level in which the automation of most existing insight externalization approaches are conducted. ManyInsights is a multidimensiona l visualization system with Click2Annotate and other insight management activities implemen ted. The semantically rich annotations semi- automatically generated by Click2Annoate enable a rich set of effective insight management activities. Currently, there are scented insight br owsing and faceted insight search (see Figure 1) implemented. The team is working on mo re insight management activities. Touch2Annotate This approach is an application of Click2Annoa te on multi-touch interfaces. The semi-automated approach greatly reduces the need of typing no tes in multi-touch interfaces where typing is effort-intensive. Figure 2 shows Touch2Annot ate is used on a multi-touch table. 92 Figure 1: Faceted search of semi-automati cally annotated insights in ManyInsights Figure 2: Touch2Annotate 93Pixel-Oriented Graph Visualization The pixel-oriented graph tool relates groups of keywords derived from full text analysis of documents, including multimedia documents, or fr om other content such as analyzed and tagged sets of images. With the tool (Figure 3), one can simultaneously manipulate and understand the conceptual clusters, and the firs t, second, or third n earest-neighbor relations among the keywords in any cluster or set of clusters. Figure 3: Exploring and understanding relationships among concept clusters Cross-Media Alignment for Online Multimedia Analysis As digital images/videos are growing exponentially on the Internet, there is an urgent need to develop new algorithms for web image/video indexing by automatically aligning the web images/videos with their most relevant auxilia ry text terms (which are extracted from the associated text documents). Google Images has achieved big success on supporting keyword- based web image retrieval by loosely indexing the web images with their auxiliary text terms. For one given web image, many of its auxiliary text terms are weakly-related or even irrelevant with its semantics because the relevant web page may consist of rich word vocabulary for web content description rather than only the auxiliary text terms for image semantics description. When all these auxiliary text terms are loosel y used for web image indexing, Google Images may seriously suffer from low precisi on rates and result in large amount s of junk images. To enable more effective web image indexing and retrieval, it is very attractive to develop new algorithms for achieving more precise alignment between the web images and their auxiliary text terms. 94 Figure 4: The illustration of the key components of our image-text alignment scheme: (a) web page crawling; (b) image-block pair generation; (c) image cluster and ranked auxiliary text terms; (d) image cluster and re-ranked auxiliary text terms . In this project, a novel algorithm was develope d for image annotation by automatically aligning the web images with their most relevant auxiliary text terms as shown in Figure 4. First, large- scale web pages (i.e., web images and their auxiliary text documen ts) were crawled and automatic web page segmentation was performed to extract the informa tive images and their most relevant auxiliary text blocks. Second, automatic image clustering was performed to partition the web images into a set of image clusters according to their visual similarity contexts. Such image clustering process, which could gr oup the web images according to their common properties, could significantly reduce the uncerta inty on the relatedness between the web images and their auxiliary text terms. Thus the semantics for the visu ally-similar web images in the same cluster could be described effectively by a same set of auxiliary text te rms which may have co- occurred frequently in their te xt blocks. Finally, a relevance re -ranking algorithm was developed for aligning the web images with their most relevant auxiliary text terms automatically. The 95team's experiments on large-scale web pages (as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6) have provided very positive results. Figure 5: Image clustering results and their auxiliary text terms.

VALET provides users with a suite of analytical tools coupled with an interactive visu al interface for data explorati on and analysis. This system includes linked views and interactiv e displays that spatiotemporally model criminal, traffic and civil (CTC) incidents and allow officials to obse rve patterns and quickly identify regions with higher probabilities of activity. Our toolkit provides analysts with the ability to visualize different types of data sets (census data, daily weather reports, zoning tracts, prominent calendar dates, etc.) that provide an insight into correlations among CTC incidents and spatial demographics. In the spatial domain, we have implemented a kernel density estimation mapping technique that creates a color map of spatially distributed CTC events that allow analysts to quickly find and identify areas with unusually la rge activity levels. In the temporal domain, reports can be aggregated by day, week, month or year, allowing the analysts to visualize the CTC activities spatially over a period of time. Coupled with the spatial mapping view, our system provides analysts with a time series view of the data. Furthermore, we have incorporated spatiotemporal prediction algorithms to forecas t future CTC incident levels within a 95% confidence interval. Such pr edictions aid law enforcement officials in understanding how hotspots may grow in the future in order to ju diciously allocate resources and take preventive measures. Our system has been developed usi ng actual law enforcement data and is currently being evaluated and refined by a consortium of law enforcement agencies. Technical Approach This research employs compiling and sorting da tabases, data mining and expert consultation, including modeling and st atistical analysis. The nature of the research is hybrid applied- consultation.

This complexity and scale pose a barrier when exposing these datasets to the intelligence and defense communities, as well as the general public. In this project, the VACCINE team collaborated with START members in applying visual analytics techniques to their data in a user-centered design methodology intended to elicit their particular needs and require ments for visualizing this data. Particular objectives included entity resolution for detecting duplicates in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), as well as spat iotemporal visualization for the Mi norities at Risk database. Additional research missions remain to be identified. Technical Approach Data collection methods used included bench tests, compiling & sorting DB, data mining, and expert consultation. Analytic methods used were case studies, modeling, and statistical analysis. The nature of research was hybrid basic-applied.

The ability for reflection, analysis, a nd investigation of this material is vital, and may yield both new and old connections, ideas , and thoughts. Furthermore, exposing the material to the scientific community and othe r government agencies, as well as the general public, is an important goal of our Center. Th e VACCINE team will leverage visual analytics methods for interacting and explor ing this large knowledge resource in an interactive visual form that is easy to access for quick browsing, yet powerful enough to support advanced analysis and review. This project will develop table-based, graph-based, and timeline-based visualizations of the DHS Centers of Excellence program in an easily accessible format, but which also supports faceted browsing and querying on the multiple dimensions associated with the data. These visualizations will be easy to expand with future data without requiring redesign or rebuilding. Technical Approach Data collection methods used were compiling & sorting DB and data mining.

This data was derived fr om sources such as shipping ma nifests and United States Coast Guard Notice of Arrival documents , which contain details on the who, what, when , and where of shipments and are stored in a large Oracle data base. This database was and is used by intelligence analysts to detect suspicious cargoes. As the size of the database continues to grow rapidly, the queries which are used to extract th e data have slowed down. Since the analysts need timely responses in order to be effective, our project's goal is to improve this query performance by applying visual analytic techniques to illuminate its causes and then developing remedies. Technical Approach Data collection methods used were compiling & sorting DB and expert consultation. The analytic method used was case studies. The nature of research was hybrid applied-consultation. Milestones The deliverables are all in the form of technical reports delivered to customer. Project Outcomes (Results, A ccomplishments, Conclusions) Other outcomes/impacts The VACCINE team conducted an in itial survey of the sample da ta and database descriptions provided to them in April 2010. So far they ha ve identified several st ructural areas, which appear to be causing problems and need to be inve stigated in detail to determine their impact on performance. 104Seed Project Competition VACCINE has dedicated approxima tely 9% of our annual funds to competitively award peer- reviewed seed project proposals to foster the development of new MDRPs, including education- oriented MDRPs. Successful seed projects will transition into our MDRP portfolio and help evolve research thrusts within each pillar as well. The VACCINE 2010 Seed Project competition identified innovative research a nd educational needs in the follo wing visual analytic areas of homeland security: Video Surveillance Visual Analytics Introducing Sustainable Visual Analy tics into Command Center Environments Mobile Imaging and Light-Weight Visu al Analytics for In-Field Analytics Context-aware Mobile Visual Analytics for Emergency Response MSI Education and Programs of Study Visual Analytics for the DHS Centers of Excellence Cognitive Science Applied to Visual Analytics Four seed projects were selected from an appl icant pool of 25 proposals.

Budget and Productive Use of Federal Resources 5. Minority Serving Instit ution Engagement 6. Results Transition (10%) The Seed project competition was held in year 1. However, funds were di stributed to begin the seed projects in year 2. 105SEED 1: Investigation of the Impacts of Visualization Litera cy on the Performances of Visual Analysis Team VACCINE: Purdue University: Ji Soo Yi, Sung-Hee Kim Simon Fraser University: Brian Fisher University of British Columbia: Linda Kaastra Abstract The rapid evolution of visual analytics ( VA) has created many innovative visualization techniques. These novel visualizations provide some visual analysts with additional capabilities and insights, but others perceive them unfamilia r and difficult to use due to their novelty. One factor that could explain indi vidual differences would be the level of prior knowledge about visualizations, which we called \"visualization literacy.\" For example, one who knows parallel coordinates may easily find an interesting multidim ensional pattern from a parallel coordinate view, but others without the knowledge will fail to gain the same insight. In spite of this obviousness, visualization literacy re mains as one of uncharted areas in visual analytics research. We have not clearly understood how low or high visualization literacy impact on visualization performance, in what situations low visualiza tion literacy becomes a more limiting factor than other innate individual differen ces (e.g., cognitive style and persona l traits), and how to measure visualization literacy. This lack of understa nding of visualization literacy increases the unidentifiable variances in ev aluation studies and slows down development of systematic methods to educate visual analytics users. Thus, the aim of this proposed study is to be tter understand the influences of visualization literacy on the performance of visual analysts (visualization performance, henceforth) and develop initial cognitive model to predict the performance of vi sual analysts. Eventually, the results of the current project could be incorporated into a comprehensive mathematical/computational cognitive model and a measurement tool of visualization literacy. This is a collaborative project between two institutes: Purdue University and Simon Fraser University. The former will contribute the experi ences in creating taxonomy of visualizations, development workforce for interactive visualiz ation systems, and infrastructure to conduct a controlled lab experiment. The latter will cont ribute its expertise in cognitive science and experiences in conducting field studie s in a more realistic environment. 106Milestones Comprehensive literature review. IRB approval. A field study to understand the imp acts of visualiz ation literacy. Develop a cognitive model to predict the visualization performances. Final report. 107SEED 2: Gang Graffiti Recognition and Analysis Using a Mobile Telephone Team VACCINE: Purdue University: Mireille Boutin, Ed Delp Abstract The United States Department of Justice estimates there ar e approximately 30,000 gangs, with 800,000 members, impacting 2,500 communities acro ss the United States. Our goal in this project is to provide the police and other agencies with a tool to allow them to monitor gang activity by collecting images of gang graffiti for real-time interpretation and archiving. Graffiti is a form of expression used by many subcultures and groups in the US. There are different types of graffitis whic h are associated with different groups or cultures. For example, \"tagging\" is a graffiti type consisting of a stylized signature and is associated with youths. It is an important component of the Hip Hop culture and is very widespread today, so much so that it is considered an epidemic in many urban areas. \"Gang Graffiti\" is another type of graffiti. A typical gang graffiti image is shown below. Graffiti is often perceived as a form of vandalism. However, for law enforcement agencies, it is a valuable source of information. Gangs, for example, use graffiti as part of their fight for dominance. They use it to mark their territory as well as challenge rival gang's territories. Thus knowing the location of the graffiti of the different gang present in a city enables one to estimate the exte nt of their respective territories. Gangs also use graffiti to express their individua lities, associations, and enemies. Thus tracking the evolution of gang graffitis over time can be used to understand gang's dynamics and social changes. Graffiti is also an important means of communication used by gangs, for example to make threats against the state or some other group; understanding this communication can be vital in some cases. However, the symbols used in graffiti are diffi cult to interpret by outsiders. For example, a chicken and a slice of bread is a sign of disrespe ct used to challenge another gang. To assist law enforcement officers in making sense of the diffe rent graffitis they en counter, taxonomies have been developed. For example, a type of letters called \"placas\" is known to be associated with Hispanic gangs while the pitbull is a symbol associated with bloo d gangs. Unfortunately, 108because of the changing nature of the symbolism used in this media as well as its high complexity, taxonomies often do not convey the fu ll extent of a graffiti's message. Moreover, browsing a graffiti's taxonomy is made difficu lt by the graphical nature of its elements. The long term goal of this project is to de velop and implement a method for recognizing and analyzing gang graffitis using a commercially available mobile telephone. This will be accomplished by taking a color picture of the gra ffiti using the camera embedded in the device. The user will then be able to select either the full graffiti or a specific element of a graffiti and search for similar graffitis in a database. The most similar matches will be displayed and the user will be able to browse the information relating to each match using a simple graphical user interface. The system will also propose categories for the given graffiti/element along with the meaning of these categories. For example, identif ying a graffiti as a \"tagging\" will enable a law enforcement officer interested in gang activities to be able to dismiss the graffiti as irrelevant. When appropriate (e.g., for the spatial distributi on of a given gang graffiti), the information will be provided graphically and the navigati on will be driven by touch and gestures. We use as a starting point our experience in deve loping a language translat ion system that uses mobile telephones for re al-time translational of signs from various languages (e.g. Spanish and Arabic) into English. This system has been deploy ed on an Apple iPhone. In this one year effort, we will develop a proof of concept for this sy stem, which will consist of a small graffiti dictionary along with a first version of our proposed recognition and analysis software. Milestones Develop methods for graffiti shape recognition. Develop graffiti dictionary. Initial hardware deployment. Delivery of working prototype. 109SEED 3: Uncertainty Visualizatio n in Video Visual Analytics Team VACCINE: Swansea University: Min Chen Purdue University: David Ebert Abstract This seed project addresses the problem of uncertainty visualization in Video Visual Analysis (VVA). A VVA pipeline differs from a traditional automated video analysis (AVA) pipeline in several ways: (i) VVA focuses on the depiction of important information in the videos, whilst AVA focuses on making analytical decisions using machine inte lligence; (ii) VVA provides an integrated analysis and visualization pipeline with feedback loops; whilst AVA usually does not rely on visualizati on, or provides only prim itive visual annotation of videos. In both VVA and AVA pipelines, there are a large number of vide o processing components, such as filters for morphological operations, convolution, segmentati on and recognition. In addition to typical imagery, geometrical and annotative results, thes e filters also result in a huge amount of information about the uncertainty levels (and processing errors). While some of such information may be part of the decision mechan ism (typically through coarse quantization), most information would be discarded at various stages of the pipeline. Without such information, adjusting various parameters for video proces sing components is almost a black art. Raw uncertainty information can be pixel-based, object based and frame-based, and typically of a time-varying nature. It is thus desirable to make the uncertainty information available to the viewers visually. However, vi deo visualization components in a VVA pipeline usually lack in both information bandwidth and distinguishable visu al channels. The former refers to the limited screen resolution to handle a large amount of tempor al data. The latter refers to the factor that most effective visual channels usually have already been used by the traditional video visualization without uncertainty information. For example, the VideoPerpetuoGram (VPG) proposed by Botchen et al. [TVCG, 2008] uses the texture channel for keyframes, and streamlines for object tracking, maki ng uncertainty visualization a cha llenging issue. In this seed project, we will build upon the expertise in our partner universities in video visual analytics, non- photorealistic and illustrative visualization, and pe rception in visualization. We will investigate into the following aspects of uncertainty visualization in vide o visual analytics: (a) Efficient uncertainty representation, com putation, and storage in the VVA pipeline. (b) Visual channels for integrated VVA and uncertainty visualization. (c) Bandwidth for multiple-view VVA and uncertainty visualization. (d) The role of uncertainty visualization in the feedback loop of the VVA pipeline. (e) Evaluation of the usefulness and effectiveness of uncer tainty visualization in VVA. 110 Milestones Literature review and mapping out re search scope (a technical report).

Th is data is being collected, but is not integrated in the incidence command systems where situation reports, incidence action plans, etc. are being held. When these materials are entered into such systems, it's done so in a manual way which is time consuming and requires careful human review and management. The team proposes to use advance data integration and visual analytics tec hniques to analyze (1) situation reports, incident acti on plans, and other types of res ponder reports and (2) pictures and video clips captured in the field and automatically augment/link the reports directly to relevant multimedia content obtained in the field. Sim ilarly, such multimedia content is not linked to situation reports which can help to better communicate the interpretation of the multimedia content in the context of the latest situation re ports. Data mining techni ques will be used to identify specific disaster keywords and will be used to identify the documents. Milestones Development of novel techniques for integrating clustering and dimensionality reduction for visualization. Development of outlier removal and principal component subspace projections algorithms. Development of Multiple Kernel Learning (M KL) methods for multi-source data fusion. Automatic selection of represen tative principal components. Development of a prototype system with applications to emergency response. Development of techniques for incorporat ing domain knowledge and user interaction. Development of disaster-situa tion detection classifiers. Coupling with Translated Learning. 112VI. Education Scope During year one, VACCINE's educational in itiatives have spanned the entire career development pipeline ranging from K-12 progr ams through undergraduate and graduate level work, to professional educati on and training programs. The mission is to educate current Homeland Security stakeholders and the next ge neration of talent and enable them to make effective decisions from the mass of multisource, multimedia data they will face in their careers. VACCINE educational efforts have targeted four main areas: K-12 projects, undergraduate and graduate programs, professional training and minority serving inst itution (MSI) colla boration. In addition to the established programs, VACCINE has focused on many outreach activities such as attendance at conferences and presentations to groups in order to prom ote VACCINE efforts and get support and particip ation for VACCINE year two and be yond. The education group has also submitted several proposals to further increa se funding opportunities and future program development. Throughout all of these efforts, VACCINE a nd CCICADA have maintained a collaborative relationship with monthly conference calls, joint at tendance and presentations at conferences and shared developm ent of material and content. K-12 Programs Middle School/High School Teacher Workshops Teacher workshop development and planning has taken place during VACCINE year one. These workshops will be held in June 2010. The works hops will focus on introducing visualization and data analysis to middle school and high school teachers thr ough homeland security examples, curriculum development and hands-on learning modules. The goals of the workshop include: 1. Define visual analytics (VA) and teach participants how they can incorporate VA into their curriculum to enhance learning. 2. Explain how to identify misinf ormation within graphics, g ood & bad visualizations and good & bad data. 3. Show participants how to find online resources for further explorations. High School Elective A three class period module on visualization and analytics has been developed for high school juniors and seniors. The module was taught in September 2009 and again in February 2010 as part of an emergency management/homeland secu rity elective course at Triton Central High School in Fairland, IN. The high school module is being modified for use during summer 2010 teacher workshops and then as part of an on line teacher tutorial for middle school and high school teachers. This teacher tutorial will be available during the summer 2010. University of Houston Downtown and CCICADA partners are in line to use the materials once they are available. 113 Middle School Modules Two middle school teachers from Granger, IN worked with VACCINE on the teacher workshop materials and presented tools they have used in their classrooms. VACCINE has also worked on the development of mini classroom modules that focus on use of visual analytics within existing curriculum. The most recent module uses vi sual analytics tools within a middle school classroom to study the spread of religion. It ties in the current media attitudes and religious perceptions that relate to terro rism and homeland security. Downloadable modules can be found under the K-12 education tab on the VACCINE website. www.visualanalytics-cci.org Undergraduate/Graduate Studies VACCINE is developing a course catalog fo r our partner schools and will expand upon this diverse set of visual analytic curricula, refining and integr ating our existing efforts and identifying niche opportunities where future visual analytic and master's degree courses can be developed and offered. Planning is also underw ay for a one-day workshop on visual analytic courses and curricula in conjunction with th e NVAC Consortium meeting on August 30, 2010. HS-STEM Career Development With Dr. David Ebert as the PI, a competiti ve Homeland Security - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (HS-STEM) Career Development program has been established at Purdue to support students in terested in pursuing homeland secu rity related ca reers. Eleven students have been funded through the HS-STEM Career Development program. These students meet monthly for networking lunches where stude nts share their research. HS-STEM students have also had the opportunity to present research topi cs in high school clas srooms. Five high school classroom presentations have been done during the 2009/2010 school year. Three HS- STEM students have graduated during the 2009/ 2010 school year with PhDs and gone on to continue work in homeland security fiel ds. VACCINE hopes to expand this program by obtaining an HS-STEM 2010 award. Visual Analytic Summer Program (VASP) VASP is a hands-on, 10-week summer learning pr ogram that introduces st udents to visual and data analytics projects. The VASP program is part of the long time established Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) pr ogram at Purdue. VASP students participate along with SURF students in a va riety of activities that include seminars and workshops on graduate school, current events, and social activities . All students present a research poster at the end of the summer with awards given to the best presentations. Four students participated in VASP during summer 2009. Two of these students ha d their posters finish in the top 10 out of all 115 SURF poster presentations. VACCINE welcomes undergraduate students from all universities who are intere sted in visual analytics topics to apply for this program. Eleven students will be chosen to work w ith VACCINE during th e summer of 2010. 114Professional Training VACCINE and CCICADA will co-host RECONNECT faculty workshops during the summer 2010 at University of Southern California. Th ese workshops offer the opportunity for junior faculty as well as mid-level and senior faculty, and Homeland Security Professionals to consider research questions in a new area of the mathem atical/computer sciences . The topic for the USC will focus on 'Text Extraction. Planning is underway for a September works hop on visual analytics for public safety professionals. The workshop will be held at the Justice Institute of British Columbia. Participants will include first responders from Ca nada and the US as well as VACCINE partners. The purpose of the workshop is to define the requ irements that will lead to developing academic programs and relevant technology utilizing visual analytics in the public safety environment. VACCINE has met with FLETC, the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy, and the Justice Institute of British Columbia to discuss tr aining needs and ways that VACCINE and the practitioners can work together . Some initial discussions in clude: faculty partnering with VACCINE faculty for research, de veloping a basic course on visu al analytics and how it can be an essential tool for law enforcement, and c ontinuing development of mobile applications. Visual Analytics Di gital Library (VADL) Georgia Tech has been maintaining VADL, an on line resource center and leading international repository for visual analytics educational and training material, as well as practical lessons- learned and best practices for Command, Control and Interoperability (CCI) material. VACCINE would like to expand these materials and have th em available for all VACCINE partner faculty and students as well as those interest ed in visual analytic studies. http://vadl.cc.gatech.edu MSI Collaboration VACCINE began to raise awareness at Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) about its mission by offering research talks at conferences such as Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), Grace Hopper Women in Computing, Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Conference (HENAA C), TeraGrid, Students and Technology in Academia, Research and Service (STARS Allia nce), Association of Computer/Information Sciences and Engineering Depa rtments at Minority Institutions (ADMI) /African-American Researchers in Computing Sciences (AARCS). In addition, VACCINE and CCICADA co- facilitated a workshop on MSI and Centers of Excellence (COE) relationships during the Education Day at the DHS University Summit in March 2010. COE education reps learned basic facts about MSIs as well as ways to successfully work with and integrat e educational programs. VACCINE has collaborated with Jackson State Univ ersity to develop an affinity research pod. These research pods foster an innovative educational a nd research partnershi p between Research 1(R1) Universities and the minority -serving institutions and target visual analytics and homeland 115security applications. Dr. David Ebert traveled to JSU in January to meet with Drs. Loretta Moore and Jacqueline Jackson to kick off th e research pod.

Education Programs and Outcomes EP 1: Leadership and Coordination Team VACCINE: Purdue University: Marti Burns Georgia Institute of Technology: John Stasko University of Houston-Downtown: Richard Alo, Ping Chen, Erin Hodgess Indiana University: Maureen Biggers Jackson State University: Loretta Moore, Jacqueline Jackson CCICADA: Rutgers University: Midge Cozzens Abstract The main objective during the init ial period was to develop an i nnovative and coherent education plan that spans across the indivi dual members' schools of the VACCI NE center that also work in coordination with the Rutgers-led Data Analysis Center. The team sought to develop curricula and courses for visual analytics that could be used as examples and templates at different schools. Working together with colleagues at Purdue, Dr. Stasko oversaw the strategic mission and efforts in the educational programs of the VACCINE Center. He was involved with all of the educational programs and mi ssions, and represents the Center at various activities. His particular responsibilities dur ing the period included partic ipating and teaching in the RECONNECT summer school session led by the CICCADA Center, oversaw the Affinity Education Research Groups, maintained the Visual Analytics Digital Library, and participated at the education meeting of the DHS University Summit. 117 Milestones Milestones for VACCINE Period 1- Leadership and Coordination 07/01/09 - 03/31/10 Quarterly Teaching in RECONNECT seminar X Monthly conference calls X X X Visit Purdue to work on education plan X Develop education brochure X Development of education program document X Plan for AERG research pod initiation X Presented at DHS Summit X Helped develop HUB zero concept paper X Helped develop/submit HUB zero proposal X Developed / submitted Scholarship Proposal X Collaboration calls with Rutgers X X X 118Program Outcomes (Results, A ccomplishments, Conclusions) Other outcomes/impacts Dr. Stasko led the strategic edu cational initiatives of VACCINE working closely with Marti Burns of Purdue, the Assistant Director fo r Engagement and Education. They produced overview materials for the educational aspects of the center such as brochures and posters. In August, the Rutgers component of the CCI Center held a weekl ong RECONNECT summer school session for professors and re searchers, who may be from othe r areas but that want to learn more about data analysis and visual analytics. Dr. Stasko represented the VACCINE Center at the session and taught two days ab out visual analytics and inform ation visualization. He also introduced and described the Jigsaw system and ga ve each of the attendees a copy of the system to use in an example analytic exercise. Dr. Stasko also coordinated edu cational efforts for the CCI Center with colleagues in the Rutgers-led data analysis component, specific ally Dr. Midge Cozzens of Rutgers. The two groups held monthly conference calls to discuss plans and jo int activities. Dr. Stasko worked with Maureen Biggers and Richard Al\u00f3 to develop educational activities in coordination with minority-serving schools in our component of the center. They created two instances of the Affinity Education Research Pod concept, one jointly between Jackson State University and Purdue University, and one join tly between University of Houston-Downtown and Penn State University. In March, the VACCINE and CICCADA groups collabor ated to jointly plan and run the morning sessions of the Education meeting at the DHS University Summit. The focus of the meeting was on MSI partnership and collabora tion within the Centers. The VACCINE CCI group conducted a series of panels and activitie s to heighten awareness and know ledge about MSI universities and programs. Dr. Stasko spoke on one of the panels. Additionally, the Center for Computational Sc ience and Advanced Distributed Simulation (CCSDS) at the UHD initiated VACCINE research during the past year with faculty members Richard A. Al\u00f3 (lead), Ping Chen and Erin Hodge ss (all of UHD) and Mohsen Beheshti (Chair of Computer Science at California State University Dominguez Hills) . The team created four Affinity Research Groups at UHD and one at CSUDH each c onsisted of 3 students and one faculty lead chosen from the faculty listed here. Students and faculty submitted their joint research papers and posters to international and nati onal conferences as li sted. International acceptance is in Beijing, China (2 papers), Upps ala, Sweden (1 paper) and Cambridge England (1 paper) and National SIGSCE Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 119EP 2: MSI Collaboration Team VACCINE: Purdue University: David Ebert, Marti Burns Georgia Institute of Technology: John Stasko University of Houston-Downtown: Richard Alo Florida International University: Shu-Ching Chen Jackson State University: Loretta Moore, Jacqueline Jackson CCICADA: Rutgers University: Midge Cozzens Abstract The Center for and nced Distributed Simulation (CCSDS) at UHD, Richard A.

Th e first lecture was an open forum attended by undergraduate students, graduate students, a nd faculty from a number of di sciplines. The second lecture was a presentation and round table discussion with the JSU Pod members (Dr. Loretta Moore, Dr. Jacqueline Jackson, Chicora Chandler, Jotham Greer, and Ashley Rhodes) . The third lecture was given to the Visual Analytics class an d guests. Dr. Ebert also visited and held discussions with other DHS Cent er Directors and Project PIs. During the Project Kickoff, each student identified a specific research focus. 2010 ADMI/A4RC Conference: The 2010 ADMI/A4RC conference was held on April 8-11, 2010 in Jackson, MS. VACCINE was spotlight ed in two conference sessions and the evening Social Networking Event. Undergradu ate students Chicora Chandler and Jotham Greer participated in the conference session that spotlighted VACCINE's research opportunities for students. Maureen Biggers, from Indiana University, was involved in the SACNAS conference poster/brochures, affinity pod training and th e monthly teleconference coaching sessions, STARS conference poster, ADMI/AARCS confer ence in April 2010, and the selection of student participants. She flew to Jackson Stat e University and met face to face with each student in the pod to talk about how thing were evolving as th ey got ready to move to Purdue for a summer of research. The Pennsylvania State University, Jackson St ate University, Indiana University, Purdue University, Oak Ridge, Northeastern Universit y, and Rutgers teamed to establish Affinity Research Pods/Groups and to provide faculty candidates for DHS summer faculty /student development. Jackson State University conducte d a special topics visual anal ytics course. The course was offered during the Spring semester of 2010 for gra duate special topics in Visual Analytics. Eight Computer Science students registered for the course. Dr. Ebert taught the first lecture and gave an introduction to Visual Analyt ics. The book used for the course was \"Illuminating the Path: The Research and De velopment Agenda for Visual Analytics\". Students reviewed papers and ga ve oral presentations on vari ous topics from the book. For the term project, students downloaded/evaluate d a visual analytics application, presented their findings and created a t echnical report of the work. 122 VACCINE has been working to add the Nava jo Technical College as a funded partner beginning in Year 2. Th e strategy is to help NTC transiti on to a 4-year degree program with an emphasis in visual analytics. The fo llowing objectives will aid this effort: o Promote 'best practices' to assist in NT C retention, recruitment and motivational activities for their new four y ear computing degree programs. o Assist in further de velopment of Cyber Infrastructur e-enabled distributed research and education network provi ding visualization educati on and research opportunities to NTC faculty and students. o With above, proceed to develop an Affinity Research Pod (ARP) to join the research of the ARPs within the VACCINE group at Center for Computational Science and Advanced Distributed Simulation ( CCSDS / University of Houston Downtown UHD. o Assist to develop and implement curricula and courses for visual analytics that are available through the VACCINE network such as the Vi sual Analytics Digital Library (VADL). 123EP 3: K-12 Programs Team VACCINE: Purdue University: David Ebert, Marti Burns Discovery Middle School: James Howard, Kent Mikel Triton Central High School: Steve Elder CCICADA: Rutgers University: Midge Cozzens Abstract VACCINE's mission is to educate the next gene ration of talent through the VACCINE K-12 programs which include; the deve lopment of middle sc hool and high school teacher workshops, a high school teacher tutorial for the high school vi sual analytic module, and the development of middle school modules.

Planning and development of content for these works hops took place during this first period of VACCINE. A three class period high school module on visual analytics has been developed and taught at Triton Central High School during both the Fall Semester 2009 (9/21-9/24) and the Spring Semester 2010 (2/22-2/24). The module was taught to a class of juniors and seniors enrolled in a Homeland Security /Emergency Management elec tive course developed by Steve Elder. Goals of the module were to introduce the topic of visu al analytics and tie it to examples relevant to their course work, such as use of VA to improve decision making for the emergency management community. Work assignments were tied to their class tabletop exercise scenario that dealt with an Anhydrous Ammo nia explosion at a lo cal food cold storage plant. Materials 125from this high school module were converted into a teacher tutorial that were used during the June workshops and then modified and placed online to be initially shared with Houston Prep. A big piece of the K-12 Education Program include s outreach to various organizations to build relationships and collaboration for future program development. Marti Burns attended several conferences and offered presentations to groups to introduce VACCINE and distribute materials regarding VACCINE education programs.

Education Programs and Outcomes - (5-6 pages) ) Kernel Density EstimationResults Conclusion Ecotopes through Clustering PURVAC In this project an attempt to stratify the state of Indiana into health ecotopes, or regions of similar disease symptom rates, was undertaken. This method uses kernel density estimation to take a number of discrete symptom reports and turn them into a continuous probability density function for each symptom. These symptom PDFs are then placed orthogonally into a data-space and clustered into groups with similar symptom rates using K-Means clustering. Mapping clusters onto geographic space This work has been funded by the US department of Homeland Security.This top portion of the figure shows the data-space where K-means has grouped the data into two clusters. The data points are then mapped onto a matrix according to their original geographic location. Then the cells of the matrix are colored in according to the cluster they belong to and ecotopes form. K-Means Algorithm 1) Randomly pick k cluster centers 2) Assign each point to the nearest cluster center 3) Recalculate cluster centers as the mean of all data members 4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no points switch cluster assignment Because of the geographically discrete nature of disease symptom reports a way to extrapolate the data to the entirety of the state is needed. Kernel density estimation provides a way by estimating the probability density function from a sample of the population. It works by summing an instance of a weighting function kernel, in this case a standard Gaussian distribution, over every discrete sample.The results show that geographic health ecotopes do emerge when clustering over non-geographic symptom data. This suggests a link between symptom rates and geographic locations and shows that the presented method is a viable way to find and delineate these links into health ecotopes. While using K-Means clustering is a viable way to automatically find and delineate Health Ecotopes there are a few problems with the algorithm that must be addressed. Most notable is the fact that the numbers of clusters must be given to the algorithm a priori, a difficult task if one has not seen the data before nor has a good way to intuit the correct number of clusters.

In the current educational climate of limited budgets and ex pansion, the team deci ded not to spend time developing a new visual analytic s course or Masters degree. We created the body-of-knowledge and posted it on a website at Georgia Institute of Technology for members of the visual analytics community to comment on. It is unclear what next steps this project will take. We are planning to hold a one-day workshop on visual analytics cour ses and curricula in conjunction with the NVAC Consortium Meeting on August 30, 2010. 129EP 6: HS-STEM Career Development Program Team VACCINE: Purdue University: David Ebert, Marti Burns Abstract The HS-STEM Career Development program is a competitive program funded through DHS that was established at Purdue in 2007 under David Ebert.

John Stasko participated in t eaching RECONNECT 2009 that was held at Rutgers University. RECONNECT 2010 was held at USC. Midge Co zzens and John Stasko taught at RECONNECT during the summer 2010. Planning is currently underway for a workshop with public safety professionals to be hosted by VACCINE and the Justice Institute of British Columbia in September 2010. Planning is underway for a September works hop on visual analytics for public safety professionals. The workshop will be held at the Justice Institute of British Columbia. Participants will include first responders from Ca nada and the US as well as VACCINE partners. The purpose of the workshop is to define the requ irements that will lead to developing academic programs and relevant technology utilizing visual analytics in the public safety environment. VACCINE has had several meetings with FLETC to discuss training needs and ways that FLETC and VACCINE can work together. Some initial discussions include: FLETC faculty partnering with VACCINE faculty for research, developing a basic course on visual analytics and how it can be an essential tool for law enfo rcement, and continuing development of mobile applications. 134EP 8: Educational Materials Team VACCINE: Georgia Institute of Technology: John Stasko Abstract Georgia Institute of Technology presently main tains the Visual Analytics Digital Library (VADL) for storing and presenting educational materials in visual analytics. The VADL includes a wide variety of mate rials including lectures, lecture notes, lecture slides, related papers, exams, exercises, course outlines, etc. In this project, the team w ill continue to maintain and enhance the VADL and the ma terials contained within. http://vadl.cc.gatech.edu Milestones Milestones for VACCINE Period 1 - Educational Materials 07/01/09 - 03/31/10 Quarterly Maintain and enhance the VADL X X X Program Outcomes (Results, A ccomplishments, Conclusions) Other outcomes/impacts The materials for the VADL are still in place, but the team did not actively work on and enhance the digital library. No funds were included in the firs t year budget to support a student assistant to work on the VADL. 135VIII. Partnerships and Outreach A. List of Partnerships and Major Outcomes VACCINE has been very active in both its domes tic and international outreach efforts. We have built upon our existing relationships and established many new collaborative partners. (a) VACCINE Public Safety Partnerships 1. Indiana Public Safety Consortium a. Tippecanoe County Sheriff's Office b. Tippecanoe County Emergency Management Agency c. Lafayette Police Department d. West Lafayette Police Department e. Purdue University Police Department2. Florida Division of Emergency Management's Region Seven a. Florida International University b. Miami-Dade County c. Broward County d. Palm Beach County e. Monroe County 3. UNCC Consortium a. Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department 4. Washington State Consortium a. Port of Puget Sound b. U.S. Coast Guard, Seattle Sector 5. Penn State Law Enforcement Consortium a. Harrisburg Police Department In 2010, VACCINE created the Indiana Public Sa fety Consortium which is comprised of local Indiana law enforcement and emergenc y management agencies. This Consortium was established with the goal of connec ting researchers with first responders. Memorandums of Understanding have been established with all agencies which will permit the sharing of data, information and ma terials needed to conduct projects with the goals to coordinate and to improve public safe ty's analysis of data to promote improved operations in the law enforcement, fire, a nd emergency management and EMS fields. The group meets monthly to discuss tool s that are available, as well as to brainstorm tools that are needed. VACCINE envisions the Consortium as a resource th at can be utilized by not only VACCINE but also DHS S&T. (b) VACCINE's State and Federal Partnerships VACCINE works closely with state and federal agencies to receive da ta relevant to our projects. VACCINE has a well-established process for entering into Memorandums of Understanding to ensure protection of the parties and data involved. Army Research Lab CERDEC U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Defence Research & Development Canada National Institute of Justice Army Research Office National Institutes of Health 136 Department of Health and Human Services U.S. Coast Guard Oak Ridge National Laboratories U.S. Department of State, Office of the Geographer Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Foreign Broadcast Information Service Department of Defense National Science Foundation Argonne National Laboratory National Maritime Intelligence Center Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) Indiana Board of Animal Health (IBOAH) Georgia Department of Health (GaDH) Renaissance Computing Initiative (RENCI) (c) VACCINE Corporate Involvement Purdue is in the process of establishing of a unique VACCINE Corporate Affiliate Program (VCAP) to promote VACCINE's goals. In broad outline, Purdue intends for this program to provide a framework to en able corporations to make tax deductible gifts to support research, e ducation, and training activit ies for all VACCINE member institutions. The basic struct ure of VCAP would be through the establishment of a non-profit Limited Liability Corporation to be managed by the Purdue Research Foundation and overseen by VACCINE's Leadership Board. The VACCINE Leadership Board would advise the LLC on how to distribute donated funds to support VACCINE's goals. The corporate dona tions would be true gifts, with no strings attached. However, there would be some prac tical benefits to donors, including: Membership in the VCAP would be by invitation only. Member companies would be complementary as opposed to competitive in nature. Corporate affiliates would be in a position to enter into separate research agreements directly with member institutions to develop proprietary technologies, contractually ob ligated deliverables, etc. Corporate affiliates would be in a position to gain early information about ongoing basic research projects at memb er institutions before publication. Corporate affiliates would have oppor tunities to identify and recruit students at member institutions. The Corporate Affiliates program w ould provide a forum for donors to explore research collabora tions and sponsorships. Corporate donors would have opportunities for employed scientists to take sabbaticals to participate in releva nt research projects at member institutions. 137The VCAP Program is anticipated to be in place by the fall semester of 2010. Until then, VACCINE's team has been engaged with a number of companies including: Harris Corporation The Boeing Company VIN Raytheon Oculus Info, Inc. ArgonST General Dynamics Hallmark Charles F. Day & Associates NextWave Systems, LLC BanField, the Pet Hospital MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Kx Systems Motorola Kimberly Clark NVIDIA (d) In addition to the 19 schools comprising VACCINE, other academic partners include : Regenstrief Institute Mississippi Valley State University Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Penn State San Diego Supercomputer Center West Houston Center for Science and Engineering Central Washington University SUNY Albany START DIEM Purdue Veterinary Hospital University of Colorado Penn State Institute for Cyberscience Houston Community College California State University Dominguez Hills University of Maryland FAZD NCFPD CCICADA VACCINE's first seed project request fo r proposals generated twenty-five exciting project submissions from all over the world an d gave us the opportunity to confer with researchers outside of our existing partners. We were able to provide funding to Swansea University, Florida International University and Navajo Technical College. VACCINE partner universities have generated over twenty-one million dollars in follow- on funding from additional government sources. (e) VACCINE International Partnerships: VACCINE's international outreach efforts have resulted in a strong relationship with the Justice Institute of British Columbia (JI BC). Utilizing additional funding by DHS and DRDC, VACCINE and JIBC have planned an invitational workshop entitled, \"Visual Analytics for Public Safety Professionals\". The workshop will take place in Canada on 138September 20-21, 2010. This corrob oration will join public safe ty professionals from the U.S. and Canada to provide opportunities to network and discover the value that visual analytics can bring to their de cision-making and daily lives.

D. Center Publicity/Marketing Efforts VACCINE takes pride in our ability to educate the public about the innovative research we perform through a variety of media outlets and marketing tools. Our website ( www.VisualAnalytics-CCI.org ) is an informational tool that provides an in- depth overview of our Center. Our website contains details of our research and educational programs, in addition to our featured projects, publ ications and current events. Many of VACCINE's activities an d research have been featured in the following media outlets: Journal & Courier SuperComputingOnline EurekAlert! Science Blog MedGadget Swine Pandemic KEPR TV Magazine UPI.com Adobe.com Purdue University News Service WLFI TV Security Director News Indiana Business HPC Wire Indy Star Laboratory Equipment VizWorld.com Homeland Security Today Purdue University Research Review Copies of the referenced articles can be found in Appendix B - VACCINE News Releases. E. Other Outreach Activities 145In addition to presenting at many conferen ces and workshops, VACCINE researchers are frequently asked to present their work at spec ial events. These events include presentations to the first responder community, public and pr ivate corporations, and government agencies. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: Argonne National Laboratories Chicago Office of Emergency Management National Maritime Intelligence Center Motorola Raytheon Technologies for Critical Prep aredness Conference (TCIP) American Society for Industrial Security International Indiana Association of Emergency Management and Public Safety Army Research and Development Cent er, Picatinny Arsenal 146IX. Integration 1. CCICADA Research and Education VACCINE and CCICADA, as co-leads for the Command, Control and Interoperability Center of Excellence, are working together to identify high-impact areas for bringing combined data and visual analytic capabilities to bear on problems that are critical to the homeland security research and education mission. VACCINE and CCICADA are collaborat ing to create a seamless; integrated \"center\" that is much more than a collection of partnering instit utions. The ultimate aim is to become the leader in the field of Data Analytics and Visu alization Sciences that addresses the knowledge gap and serves society through creativity, expanded research, and state-of-the-art innovations. Toward the achievement of such go als, the CCI Center of Excellence has been using its very unique and robust resources to undertake the challenge of critical DHS and societal needs. Both VACCINE and CCICADA leverage existing e xpertise within their networks of partner schools for program development and disseminati on, thereby reducing duplic ation of effort. VACCINE has aligned its research into the ne twork of DHS Centers of Excellence as it continuously develops and engages partners to provide real-world validation of its work. In parallel with the research, VACCINE and CCICADA have maintained a collaborative education relationship with monthly conference calls, joint attendance and presentations at conferences and shared development of materi al and content. In f act, fully 45% of our research and education portfolio is in collaboration with either CCICADA or another Center of Excellence.
