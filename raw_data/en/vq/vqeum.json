There are evidence-based dietary supplements and herbal remedies you can take to bring you relief. These supplements work best when combined with lifestyle choices, such as practicing good posture and staying active. Here are some of the most effective supplements for back pain, according to experts: MSM MSM has [been found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4502733/) to lessen pain, swelling, and joint discomfort. People who took it also reported improved quality of life. MSM can also serve as a more natural option for those with arthritis. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3141601/) found that patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, after taking MSM for 12 weeks, showed an improvement in pain and physical function. Co-Q10 (Coenzyme Q10) Taking an additional dosage of CoQ10 can be useful in pain management. Studies have shown Co-Q10 to be helpful for patients with fibromyalgia. Taking Co-Q10 supplements helps with tiredness, pain, and sleep problems associated with [ fibromyalgia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27974102). Precautions:Those with problems with low blood pressure should take caution. Co-Q10 may lower blood pressure levels. Magnesium You can find magnesium in many [foods](http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/humannutrition/chapter/magnesium/), including beef, yogurt, rice, and spinach. Pumpkin seeds, in particular, have a very high concentration of magnesium. One ounce of pumpkin seeds has approximately 168 mg of magnesium. For context, the [recommended](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/) daily intake for adults is between approximately 310-420 mg. Magnesium is used to help painful chronic conditions like low back pain. It may [also](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507245/) reduce the need for pain medication post-surgery. Precautions:If you have any underlying conditions associated with your: blood pressure heart liver kidneys Talk to your doctor before use as it may cause some problems. Turmeric Turmeric contains curcumin and other chemicals that lessen swelling or inflammation. As a nutritional supplement, it may be available in soft gels or capsules. A recent review and analysis of dietary supplements found curcumin to significantly reduce short-term pain in people with osteoarthritis of the hands, hips, or [knees](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/3/167.long). [Turmeric](https://www.goodpath.com/learn/which-turmeric-supplement-goodpath-selection-process) is most effective when taken with fat-containing food or oil. Precautions:Those with: Diabetes Gallbladder disease Bleeding problems Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) Female hormone conditions Low iron levels Talk to your doctor before using turmeric. Devil's Claw [NSAIDs](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/40/12/1388/1787928). This makes it a popular solution for pain for those who prefer complementary medicine. You can take devil's claw alone. It may also be an ingredient in other products, such as herbal teas. Precautions:If you have heart or blood pressure problems, use devil's claw with caution as it may affect your heart rate or blood pressure. Willow Bark The active ingredient in willow bark is salicin, which is like aspirin. Like aspirin, willow bark may reduce fever, swelling, or inflammation. It can also be used for headaches, muscle pain, and menstrual cramps. Three separate trials [found](https://www.cochrane.org/CD004504/BACK_herbal-medicine-for-low-back-pain) (though the studies were low quality) that daily doses of 120-240 mg of salicin improve short-term pain when compared to a placebo group.
