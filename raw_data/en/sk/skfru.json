This standard is in keeping with the posit ion taken by Health Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. See the full standard for complete details. The intent of this standard is to provide guidance to Registrants and the public about the expectations of the CHO when the issue of vaccination is raised. The best inter- ests of the patient must be paramount. A treatment plan and any professional opinion must be deliver ed in a manner that does not confuse the patient or co mpromise the patient's care. Policy Vaccination is not within t he homeopathic scope of practice. A nosode is not a vaccination. Cu rrently there is no homeopathic rem edy which may be considered a substitution for vaccination. A Registrant shall not advise his or her patient against vaccination. A Registr ant shall, in his or her professional judgment, provide care which is in the best interest of the patient and shall not intent ionally put the patient in harm's way. Questions & Answers Here are some frequently asked questions and answers to help Registrants understand how to deal with the issue of vac- cination when it arises in a practice setting. Q1. Annually, I hold a flu clinic at my office. How does this standard affect this event? Answer: This answer depends on the activities carried out duri ng the event. Homeopaths may not offer vaccinations or suggest to a patient that a remedy or ge neral course of treatment is a substitution for vaccination. If you have specific questions about activities in your clinic, contact the College to find out if the services you o ffer fall in or outside of the ho- meopathic scope of practice. Q2. Can I provide my patients with remedies that act prophylactically or as a preventative for the flu? Answer: If the patient consultation, case taking, and repertorization points to t he selection of a particular homeopathic remedy, as the most appropriate remedy fo r that individual patient, it is proper to prescribe such a remedy. This remedy can be any appropriately selected remedy including a nosode. T he prescribed remedy is not an alternative to vaccination, and at no time may the homeopath imply that he or she is giving an alternative to vaccination. The best interests of the patient must always be paramount. Communica tion with patients and treatment of a pat ient must be delivered in a manner that does not confuse the patient or compromise the patient's care. Q3. How should I deal with questions related to vaccination? Answer: In responding to general health-relat ed questions by patients that relate to issues outside the homeopathic scope of practice such as administeri ng vaccinations, a Registrant shall: 1. Advise the patient that vaccination is outside the homeopathic scope of practice and the patient should consult with a health-care professional who has vaccinati on within his/her scope of practice; 2. Respond in a professional, accurate and balanced manner in the context of providing primary health-care to the pa- tient consistent with the homeopathic sc ope of practice (see question 2 above); and 3. Encourage the patient to be an active participant in his/ her own health-care and to make fully informed decisions con- cerning his/her health-care1. Footnotes 1.

What information can I provide to my patients about their choice to vaccinate? Answer: 1. Inform the patient that the matter of vaccination is outside of the homeopathic scope of practice. 2. You are unable to provide an opinion as to whether t he patient should or should not choose to be vaccinated. 3. See answers to Q3 above 4.

Explain to the patient that you respect their decision and w hatever choice they make you will provide ongoing or sup- portive care within the homeopathic scope of practice. Q5. What happens if I do not comply with Standard 19? Answer: Registrants are reminded that they may be the subject of an inquiry, complaint or report concerning their provid- ing of homeopathic services or discussions related to general health-related questions from patients. The Inquiries, Com- plaints and Reports Committee (ICRC), composed of both elected (homeopath) and appointed (public) members of Council will review any inquiry, complaint or report to determine the Registrant's compliance with all relevant standards of practice. In exercising its discretion, the ICRC may consider whether the discussi ons with the patient related to general health questions and were consistent with this standard of practice2. If warranted, the outcome of review by the ICRC may lead to actions such as a Specified Continuing Educati on or Remediation Program, oral caution before a panel of the ICRC, or referral to the Discipline Committee.
