Mao, MD, MSCE Integrative Medicine Specialist We post reviews for MSK healthcare providers who have at least 30 patient experience surveys completed. If you do not see reviews for a provider, it may be because they do not yet have enough survey responses, or the provider may not be part of the group of healthcare providers included in the survey. Only outpatient providers are included in the survey. Healthcare providers who only work in the hospital or in urgent care are not included in the survey. Pathologists or researchers who do not provide direct care to patients do not have reviews.

Rockefeller Chair in Integrative Medicine I am an integrative medicine specialist, board-certified family physician, and licensed acupuncturist who is dedicated to the health and well-being of people with cancer.

Read more As Chief of the [Integrative Medicine Service](/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine) at Memorial Sloan Kettering, I work with a team of extremely talented and dedicated integrative medicine physicians and integrative health experts, including massage therapists, acupuncturists, mind-body specialists, and music and dance therapists. Together, we address the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of our patients, survivors, and their families. We strive to help them develop holistic treatment plans that incorporate [evidence-based complementary therapies](/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/therapies/individual-therapies) with conventional cancer treatment to improve their experiences and outcomes. In addition to our clinical work, we collaborate with scientists and clinicians at MSK. We aim to lead the world in the discovery, translation, and dissemination of integrative health therapies, with the ultimate goal of developing evidence-based integrative oncology as part of standard care. My research centers on investigating the mechanisms, effects, and integration of complementary and integrative health therapies such as acupuncture, yoga, tai chi, massage, and herbs for symptom management among cancer patients and survivors. I have received funding from the National Cancer Institute, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the American Cancer Society, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and the Department of Defense. As President of the Society for Integrative Oncology, I work with 458 members from 19 countries to advance evidence-based, comprehensive, integrative healthcare to improve the lives of people affected by cancer.
