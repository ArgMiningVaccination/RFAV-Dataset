Among 82 antibodies isolated from peripheral blood B cells, almost half neutralized GP pseudotyped influenza virus. The antibodyresponse was diverse in gene usage and epitoperecognition. Although close to germline in sequence,neutralizing antibodies with binding afnities inthe nano- range, similar to ''afnitymatured'' antibodies convalescent donors,were found. They recognized the mucin-like domain, glycan cap, receptor binding region, and the base of the glycoprotein. A cross-reactive cocktail of fourantibodies, targeting the latter three non-overlappingepitopes, given on day 3 of EBOV infection,completely protected guinea pigs. This study high-lights the value of experimental vaccine trials as arich source of therapeutic human monoclonal anti-bodies. INTRODUCTION The Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in 2013-2016 in West Africa re- sulted cases and 11,310 deaths ( https://www.who.int/ csr/disease/ebola/en/ ). A new outbreak in 2018 is in progress in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has claimed 528 livesto date ( https://www.who.int/ebola/situation-reports/drc-2018/ en/). During the 2013-2016 outbreak, there were no approved vaccines or therapeutics, only experimental ones. ZMapp anti-bodies were tested in human trials during the outbreak in West Africa. Although the ZMapp cocktail was not proven statistically to be protective because of the small number of participants,there was a trend in the direction of improved survival ( Davey et al., 2016 ). The antibodies c4G7), one targeting the glycan cap andtwo to the base of the glycoprotein, was successful in protecting 100% of non-human primates as late as 5 days post infection (Qiu et al., 2014 ). Mixtures of monoclonal antibodies to the EBOV glycoprotein convalescent humans 2018 ), hyper-immunized Keck al., wild-type et et al., Wilson 2000; Qiu et al., 2012; Pettitt et al.,2013; Takada et al., 2007 ) have been shown to be therapeutic in various animal models. The antibodies of human origin, 114 (to the receptor binding region) and 100 (to the base), showed asimilarly profound therapeutic effect ( Corti et al., 2016 ). Another new cocktail from Regeneron, derived from humanized mice, con- taining one antibody to the fusion loop, one to the head, and one tothe glycan cap was also protective in primates at a dose of 150 mg/Kg ( Pascal et al., 2018 ) and has recently been approved for emergency experimental use during the 2018 outbreak in theDemocratic Republic of Congo. This cocktail was intentionallychosen to combine antibodies to independent epitopes with neutralization and immune effector functions, thought to be com- plementary. However, none of these therapeutic cocktails arecross-protective to the other species of Ebola that can cause hu- man disease. These results encourage the development of opti- mized cocktails of antibodies for use against human diseasecaused by the complete range of Ebola virus species.

(legend continued on next page) Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019 173Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium (VIC) emphasized the variety of independent epitopes on the viral glycoprotein that can be bound by protective antibodies and the range of antibody-dependent mechanisms that cancontribute to protection in vivo (Saphire et al., 2018 ). The VIC study established that neutralization in vitro was a strong indica- tor of the protective potential of an antibody but in addition, re-vealed that multiple Fc recruited functions also contributed toprotection ( Gunn et al., 2018 ). These results provided the theo- retical background for our investigation. In these examples, the great majority of therapeutic antibodies were isolated from animals or humans after multiple or prolonged exposures to the EBOV glycoprotein. These levels of exposure are thought to select for high-afnity antibodies through the acquisi-tion of multiple adaptive somatic mutations after repeated rounds of competitive selection of B cells in the germinal centers of lymph nodes during afnity hu- man monoclonal antibodies to influenza hemagglutinin, isolated from each stage of this process, suggests that the useful muta- tions pre-congure the tertiary structure of the binding loops ofthe antibody to minimize the energy cost of binding. This can in- crease both the on-rate, and reduce the off-rate of the antibody to achieve afnities in the nano- to picomolar range associatedwith virus neutralization ( Schmidt et al., 2013 ). This explanatory framework suggests that antibodies with the required specicity and kinetics for neutralization may be pre-sent early in an immune response, but at a lower frequency than after full afnity maturation has taken place. If an efcient screening system is applied to nding them, antibodies withthe required properties for therapy should be available from do-nors responding to an antigen for the rst time. Human volun- teers in experimental vaccine trials offer a convenient source of such antibodies without the difculties of sample availability orconcerns about persistent virus or other pathogens in venous samples from convalescent donors. Here, we show that despite minimal afnity maturation, anti- bodies isolated from donors vaccinated with Ebola virus GP are as protective as antibodies from other sources in a rigorous test of therapy at day 3 of a lethal EBOV infection in the guineapig model. RESULTS Isolation and Expression of Monoclonal Antibodies from Vaccinated Donors Volunteers were vaccinated with ChAD3 EBOV (chimpanzeeadenovirus 3 encoding EBOV TAFV by Bavarian Nordic ( Ewer et al., 2016 ). A total of 82 antibodies were isolated from plasmablasts or memory B cells isolated at day 7 and day 28, respectively (Table S1 ), following booster vaccination with the MVA-BN-Filo from 11 vaccinated volunteers ( Figure 1 A,Table S5 )a s described in the STAR Methods . Screening of Monoclonal Antibodies for Binding and Neutralization MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transduced to express the glycoprotein from Zaire ebolavirus (H-sapiens-wt/GIN/2014/Kissidougou- C15) as described ( Xiao et al., 2018 ). MDCK-SIAT1 cells were used in these experiments because, unlike other cell lines, they tolerate high levels of stable expression of EBOV GP, can pseu-dotype an influenza core, and are readily infected by our EBOVsurrogate E-S-FLU ( Xiao et al., 2018 ). Initial screening of anti- bodies was by detection of binding by indirect immunofluores- cence to EBOV GP transduced cells. GP-binding antibodies were then tested for blockade of infec- tion of MDCK-SIAT1 cells by our Ebola surrogate E-S-FLU, which contains a disabled influenza core coated with EbolaGP. E-S-FLU encodes a fluorescent protein eGFP that replaces the hemagglutinin coding sequence so that infected cells fluo- resce green. Thirty-eight of 82 antibodies inhibited infection byE-S-FLU as dened by loss of eGFP fluorescence after overnight infection by at least 50% ( Figure 1 D). We next distinguished ''partially'' neutralizing of infection) as shown in Figure 1 C.Figure 1 D shows a summary of the 38 neutralizing antibodies compared to a set of control antibodiesdescribed in the literature including KZ52 ( Maruyama et al., Lee et al., 114 Corti et al., al., 6D6 ( Furuyama et al., 2016 ). The Relationship between In Vitro Neutralization and Protection In Vivo in Mice A set of the rst 24 antibodies isolated (14 showing >50% neutralization and 10 non-neutralizing) were tested for protec-tion of mice (single dose of 100 mg at day 2 of infection with a mouse-adapted Ebola virus in groups of 10) as part of the work of the VIC ( Saphire et al., 2018 ). This revealed that the 14 antibodies showing >50% neutralization in our assay pro-vided overall 65.7% survival (range, 10%-100%), whereas the (C) Microscopic images showing virus neutralization by different antibodies at 5 mg/mL concentration. (D)In vitro neutralizing concentration of mAbs shown as IC 50and IC 90. Neutralization IC 50ranges from 0.1 to 10 mg/mL. Partially neutralizing antibodies have no IC90values. Almost half of the antibodies have titers comparable to that of the antibodies published in the literature. Measurements were taken as an aver age of duplicates and experiments were repeated at least twice. The percentage (%) value in brackets on the x axis is the survival of mice treated at day 2 of inf ection with 100mg of antibody in the VIC study ( Saphire et al., 2018 ). (E) Association between treatment at day 2 of infection with human mAbs that neutralize R50% E-S-FLU and survival p < 0.0001 (2-tailed Fisher's exact test). (F) Range of afnity constants for mAbs isolated from vaccinated donors compared to established therapeutic mAbs: 114, 100, 6D6, The measurements were repeated at least twice.See also Tables S3 andS4. 174 Cell Reports 27, A B D C (legend on next page) Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019 17510 non-neutralizing antibodies provided 31% overall survival (range, 10%-50%); two tailed p < 0.0001 by Fisher's exact test ( Figure 1 E). These results conrmed that neutralization de- tected in our assay was associated with a therapeutic effect inmice, but also emphasized that some neutralizing antibodies fail to protect, and some non-neutralizing antibodies can pro- tect, at least partially. Diversity of Epitopes Recognized We dened the epitopes recognized by antibodies with four as- says. First, we measured competitive inhibition of binding by an-tibodies with dened designated as the GC by alanine scanning and electron microscopy in the VIC study ( Sa- phire et al., 2018 ) where P6 = VIC 82, c13C6 (GC or receptor binding region [RBR]), 114 (RBR), KZ52 (base), c2G4 and c4G7 (base), 100 (base), and 6D6 (fusion loop) as guide antibodies(Figure 2 A). Second, a sub-group of antibodies were mapped for binding to a yeast surface display antigenic library expressing GP fragments ( Figures 2 B and S1;Table S2 ). Third, binding to thermolysin digested GP to cathepsin removal of glycancap and mucin-like domain (MLD) ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and S2). Fourth, binding to MDCK-SIAT1 cells transduced to express MLD-deleted GP (amino acids 313-463 deleted) ( Figure S3 ). With this combination of tests, we could distinguish seven clus- ters of antibody binding sites: three clusters in the glycan cap, one in the RBR, two in the base or fusion loop, and one in theMLD (summarized in Figure 2 D). Antibodies to Glycan Cap mAbs to the GC could be divided into three overlapping groups.In the rst group (exemplied by P6 = VIC 82 and 040 = VIC 91)the antibodies cross-inhibited the binding only of other GC-spe- cic antibodies ( Figure 2 A). P6 was dened GC-specic by electron microscopy and alanine ( Saphire et al., 2018 ), and both P6 and 040 were dened by sequencing of a protein fragment consisting of amino acids 228-281 of GP1 ex- pressed in yeast that was bound by these antibodies ( Figures 2 B andS1;Table S2 ). The epitopes bound by antibodies to the GC were removed by thermolysin cleavage of GP expressed on MDCK-SIAT1 cells (GPcl) ( Figures 2 C and S2). In the second group, the antibodies inhibited the binding of both GC-specicantibodies and RBR-specic antibodies, as exemplied by 66-3-2C ( Figure 2 A), which suggests they bind to an epitope that overlaps these two regions. The third group was dened by antibody 66-3-9C that bound to a small conserved peptide within the b17-18 loop of the glycan cap (amino acids 286-293 GEWAFWET) expressed in yeast ( Fig- ure 2 B, iii). 66-3-9C recognizes a similar epitope to that bound by the macaque-derived mAb FVM09 ( Keck et al., 2015 ). The disor- dered loop is juxtaposed to the surface footprint bound by the base antibody KZ52 ( Keck et al., 2015 ), which may explain why KZ52 blocked the binding of biotinylated 66-3-9C ( Figure 2 A). FVM09 was found to synergize with certain other mAbs to the GC and base for in vitro neutralization and protection in vivo (Ho- well et al., 2017 ). We noted mutually enhanced binding between the base antibodies c2G4 and c4G7 and 66-3-9C ( Figure 2 A). However, this mutually enhanced binding did not translate to enhanced neutralization by mixtures of these antibodies in ourin vitro assay (data not shown). The GC-specic antibodies dened by the competition assay lost binding to thermolysin-treated GP expressed on MDCK- SIAT1 cells ( Figures 2 C and S2). Antibodies to the Receptor Binding Region The RBR is highly conserved in species of Ebolavirus and Mar- burgvirus and therefore offers an attractive target for therapeutic antibodies ( Murin et al., 2014; Hashiguchi et al., 2016 ). We dened mAbs to the RBR by competition for binding to GP with humanmAb 114. We showed that 114 bound the GP1 core fragment 102-230 in the yeast expression assay ( Figure 2 B). mAb 114 competed for binding with a subset of neighboring GC-specicantibodies ( Figure 2 A) but not with P6 and 040. However, in contrast to the GC-specic antibodies, mAb 114 and similar an- tibodies retain binding after release of the GC and MLD following exposure of E-SIAT cells to thermolysin digestion as expected(Corti et al., 2016; Misasi et al., 2016 )(Figures 2 C and S2). Ten mAbs showed this pattern and were placed into the RBR binding group ( Figure 2 ). Antibodies to the Base or Fusion Loop These antibodies were dened by competition for binding with the published antibodies KZ52 (base), c2G4 and c4G7 (base),100 (base), and 6D6 (fusion loop). Many of these antibodies Figure 2. Identication of Epitopes (A) Antibody epitopes dened by 114, ZMapp (c13C6, c2G4, c4G7), 100, and KZ52 were used as guide mAbs t o group other antibodies.

Results are the average of repeated experiments and 4-8 replicates were included in each measurement. (B) A selection of mAbs 040 (i), 114 (ii), and 66-3-9C (iii) was screened for binding a yeast display library of fragments of EBOV GP. The fragments recog nized are represented on the structure of the KZ52-GP complex PDB: 3CSY.(C) Binding of mAbs to Ebola GP on transduced MDCK-SIAT1 cells (E-SIAT) after thermolysin digestion, analyzed by flow cytometry.

An arb itrary value of 0.2 is used as a cut-off to dene mAbs affected by thermolysin digestion, with reference to mAb 114, which is known to be resistant to thermolysin dige stion. The measurements were repeated at least twice.(D) Assignment of neutralizing or protective antibodies to their epitopes based on cross-inhibition assays. (i) Mucin-like domain-dependent. Six binding MLD deleted GP. 66-3-9C (specic for the b17-18 loop) and the base antibody 66-4-C12 also showed reduced binding. (ii) Glycan cap and receptor binding region. P6-like (GC), 114-like (RBR), and others in-between these epitopes. P6-like and 114-like are independent epitopes and do not block each othe r. Anti- bodies on the left (P6-like and neighbors) are sensitive to thermolysin cleavage. Antibodies on the right (114-like) are resistant to thermolysin cl eavage or have enhanced binding after cleavage. (iii) Antibodies to base are blocked by dened base antibodies and are resistant to thermolysin digestion.See also Figures S1 ,S2, and S3andTable Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019cross-inhibited each other, but sub-groups were discernible. For instance, biotinylated 6541 and 66-4-C12 were both inhibited bythe characterized base antibodies KZ52 and 100, but 6541 and 66-4-C12 failed to inhibit each other, suggesting that they bound to non-overlapping sites in the base region ( Figures 2 A and 2D). Antibodies 6541, 66-4-C12, and 66-6-3 competed for binding with the fusion loop-specic murine mAb 6D6, which suggested their binding footprints may overlap with the fusion peptide.Binding of base region-specic antibodies to thermolysin-treated cells was typically either unaffected or enhanced ( Figures 2C and S2). Mucin-like Domain-Dependent AntibodiesThe binding of 6/82 antibodies to MDCK-SIAT1 cells expressing GP lacking the MLD (amino acids 313-463) was reduced by comparison with cells expressing full-length GP ( Figure S3 ). Control antibodies to GP1 head (c13C6) and base (KZ52 and c4G7) bound the MLD deleted and full-length GP equally. None of the six MLD-dependent antibodies were neutralizing.We found that the antibodies 66-3-9C (specic for the b17-18 loop sequence [GEWAFWET]) also lost binding to the MLD- deleted GP, and the binding of one antibody to the base, 66-4-C12, was reduced (although was not affected by thermoly-sin cleavage). Antibodies to the Glycan Cap and Thermolysin Cleavage Treatment with thermolysin mimics the effect of cathepsin and results in removal of the GC and MLD ( Chandran et 2006; ^ote\u00b4et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2012 ).A BFigure 3. Effect of Glycan Cap-Specic Anti- bodies on Cleavage by Thermolysin (GPcl) (A) by glycan cap antibodies is sensitive to thermolysin cleavage, but binding by antibodies tothe RBR and base virus Binding by some glycan cap antibodies survivestreatment by thermolysin if present during digestion.Experiments were reproduced at least three times.See also Figure S2 . This is reflected in the loss of binding by an- tibodies to the glycan cap and MLD to E-SIAT cells after exposure to thermolysin (Figures 2 ,3, and S2). We noticed that some antibodies to the glycan cap, if bound before exposure of E-SIAT cells to thermolysin treatment, remained boundafter thermolysin treatment ( Figures 3 B andS2C). Figure 3 A shows binding of selected GC-, RBR-, and base-specic antibodiesafter cleavage by thermolysin. The to the glycan cap (P6, 040, and 66-3-9C) lose binding after thermolysintreatment, whereas the epitopes bound by RBR (114)- and base (66-4-C12)-spe- cic antibodies were not affected ( Figures 3 A and S2). We conrmed this result for seven additional GC-specic antibodies (Figure S2 ). Thermolysin digestion achieved complete removal of these epitopes as shown by (1) the reduction of binding by theseantibodies to the level of a negative control specic for influenza (Figure S2 ), (2) the appearance of the epitope recognized by MR78 that binds to EBOV GP only after removal of the glycancap ( Flyak et al., 2015; Bornholdt et al., 2016; Hashiguchi et al., 2015 ), and (3) loss of detection in western blots of the GP1 fragment bound by P6 ( Figure S2 D). We next noted the effect of allowing the GC-specic anti- bodies to bind, followed by treatment with thermolysin. We found that the mAbs P6 and 040 remained bound despite thermolysin treatment ( Figure 3 B). This effect was conrmed (Figure S2 ) for ve additional neutralizing antibodies to the GC (66-3-7C, 66-3-2C, 141, 66-3-4A, and 125). The effect was glycan cap-specic antibodies and not seenfor antibody 66-3-9C specic for the b17-18 loop (GEWAFWET) (Figure 3 B). In these experiments, the E-SIAT cells were rst trypsinized to detach them from plastic before exposure to thermolysin.We repeated the experiment without the use of trypsin, where the cells were exposed only to thermolysin in plastic plates. Thermolysin treatment resulted in the loss of binding sites forthe nine GC-specic antibodies tested. Evidence for cleavage in these conditions was provided by the appearance of the epitope in RBR bound by MR78 that only binds to EBOV GP af-ter removal of the glycan cap ( Figure S2 B). When E-SIAT cells Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019 177were treated with thermolysin in the presence of GC-specic antibodies, these antibodies retained their binding, with the exception of 66-3-9C to the b17-18 loop ( Figure S2 C). A western blot in Figure S2 D shows that immunoprecipitation by the P6 (GC) antibody of the bands representing GP1 de- tected after blotting by a mAb to the sequence GEWAFWET (286-293) is lost after thermolysin treatment. This indicatesthe completeness of digestion in these conditions and corre-lates with the loss of binding of P6 and other GC antibodies in the indirect immunofluorescence assays in Figure S2 B. These results suggested that the P6, 040, and other neutral- izing GC-specic antibodies may have either inhibited cleavage of GP by thermolysin or stabilized the glycan cap in the bound state despite cleavage. A related observation has been maderecently with the EBOV-442 ( Antibodies SUDV Gulu and MARV GP proteins were expressed by the booster MVA vaccine, which may have stimulated cross-reactiveclones. We looked for cross-reactivity of our collection of anti- bodies to glycoproteins of EBOV Mayinga 1976 Gulu Although sequences ( Figure S4 ), it is notable that of 82 antibodies selected for binding to EBOV glycoprotein, 20 were cross-reactive in binding to some level on the glycoproteins of Bundibugyo and Sudan species expressed in MDCK-SIAT1 cell ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Of the subset of neutralizing or protective antibodies(Figure 6 F), we identied examples that were cross-reactive in binding to BDBV the 286-293 (66-3-9C), and the RBR (6662) ( Figure 4 C). It is evident that pan-Ebolavirus antibodies to the fusion loop can also be isolated ( Zhao et al., 2017; Furuyama et al., 2016; Wec et al., 2017 ), however, we have not delineated this epitope in our study. Diversity in Gene Usage and Afnity Maturation Twenty-three V Hgenes encoded the 82 antibodies from 11 do- nors, making the V Hgene use very diverse within the collection and within the individual donors ( Figure 5 A). Almost equal numbers of antibodies possessed the Kappa (n = 39) or Lambda (n = 43) light chain. V H3-15 was the most commonly used germ- line gene and it encoded 20 antibodies in 10 donors ( Figure 5 A; Table S1 ). Most of the antibody sequences have high identity to their germline genes with an average of ve somatic mutations giving rise to amino acid changes ( Figures 5 B and 5C). This is expected for antibodies that have been recently stimulated with minimalengagement in the germinal center reaction, as previouslyreported in the response to vaccination or infection with H7 hem- agglutinin ( Thornburg et al., 2016; 2019 ). The num- ber of somatic mutations in these Ebola antibodies is lower thanthat of antibodies to seasonal influenza derived from individuals that are likely to have been repeatedly exposed ( Huang et al., 2015; Pappas et al., 2014; Wrammert et al., 2011 ).V H3-15 and V l1-40 Antibodies to the Receptor Binding Region Overall, there was no particular favored V Hgene identied among neutralizing antibodies, which can be seen in theresponse to some viruses such as pdmH1N1 influenza ( Jackson et al., 2014 ) and dengue ( Parameswaran et al., 2013 ) for which signature V Hgenes were identied. Interestingly, however, out of a total of 39 mAbs for which we have identied the epitopes(6 to MLD, 14 to glycan cap, 10 to RBR, and 9 to base), all ten mAbs that competed with the RBR-specic antibody 114 (V H3-13/V k1-27) are encoded by V H3-15 and V l1-40 genes and none by other V Hgenes. These ten V H3-15 RBR mAbs come from six donors ( Figures 2 D and 5A). One out of ten, 6662, cross-reacted in binding on SUDV, and BDBVGPs ( Figures 4 and6G). Binding Kinetics Compared to Established Therapeutic Antibodies In view of the relative temporal immaturity of our collection of an- tibodies, we measured the binding kinetics and calculated thebinding afnity constants ( Figure 1 F;Table S3 ) for a selection of antibodies and compared these to established therapeutic an- tibodies: 114 (RBR) and 100 (base), 6D6 (fusion loop), and c13C6(RBR or GP1 core). The kinetics of the antibodies were similar in range to the control antibodies ( Table S4 ). Our measurements for 114, 100, and c13C6 gave very similar association rates butsomewhat faster dissociation rates (for 114 and 100) to those previously reported ( Misasi et al., 2016 ). This may be related to the use of MLD-deleted molecules compared to complete GPin our measurements. Selection of Antibody Cocktails for Protection in Guinea Pigs We selected seven antibodies ( Figures 6 A and 6F) to test for ther- apeutic protection in guinea pigs against the EBOV Mayinga vi-rus as described ( Dowall et al., 2016 ). We formed three antibody cocktails from these antibodies\u2014two EBOV-specic cocktails and one containing antibodies that cross-reacted in binding toBDBV and SUDV GPs. The selection of the antibodies was basedon four characteristics: (1) neutralization in our E-S-FLU assay, because this correlated with protection of mice in the VIC study, (2) binding independently to non-overlapping epitopes in GC,RBR, and base, because we wished to reduce the likelihood of selecting antibody resistant variants during treatment in vivo (Kugelman et al., 2015 ), (3) protection in mice where this informa- tion was available from the VIC study, and (4) cross-reactivity for Bundibugyo and Sudan GPs ( Figures 6 F and 6G) for the group 3 cocktail, because the long term goal is to nd a single treatmentthat will work for these three species that cause the majority of infections in humans. The three cocktails were tested at a dose of 10 mg/Kg of each antibody (groups 1-3). This dose was selected partly onour experience with protective antibodies in influenza infection, and also because the afnities of the antibodies, and binding assays in vitro , suggested that 10 mg/Kg ( /C2410mg/mL) should be close to saturation. The rst cocktail, which we expected to be the most potent from the evidence available, was also tested at 5 mg/Kg total (equivalent to 1.67 mg/Kg of each 178 Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019antibody) (group 4) for comparison to ZMapp given at the same dose. This dose was not expected to be 100% curative andshould furnish an opportunity to test for equivalence to ZMapp. The rst and second cocktails differed in the RBR mAb, where 6662 (that was highly protective in the murine challenge) re-placed 6660. The third cocktail (group 3) was composed offour mAbs that cross-react in binding to to mAbs specic in RBR, and base, it included 66-3-9C specic for theb17-18 loop because of its similarity to FMV09 ( Howell et al., 2017 ) that provided a synergistic therapeutic effect. Controls were ZMapp at a dose of 5 mg/Kg (kindly supplied by LarryZeitlin) and PBS. When tested as cocktails in the neutralization assay, groups 1 and 2 were EBOV-specic, and group 3 showed additionalpartial neutralization of S-FLU coated in BDBV and SUDV GPs (Figure 6 B-6E).

The group 1 cocktail (125 + 6660 + 66-6-3) resulted in 4 out of 6 guinea pigs surviving ( Figure 7 ). The same cocktail given at lower dose (1.67 mg/Kg each) in group 4 resulted in 3 out of 6animals surviving, which was the same as ZMapp at the same dose. In previous studies, a higher dose of ZMapp (5 mg/ani- mal) resulted in complete survival in this model when givenby the intravenous route ( Dowall et al., 2016 ).

In group 3, treat- ment with the cross-reactive cocktail comprised of four independently bindingantibodies (040 + 66-3-9C + 6662 + 6541) resulted in 100% survival without weight loss or clinical signs ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Animals that met humane endpoints all had high levels of detectable EBOV RNA in blood, liver, and spleen. Animals thatsurvived until the end of the study (21 days post-challenge) had no detect- able viral RNA ( Figure S5 ). These results were conrmed by in situ hybridization analysis of samples and the absence of Ebola virus-induced lesions and histologi-cal changes in surviving animals compared to those in non-survivors ( Supplemental Pathology Report ). DISCUSSION The antibody response to EBOV GP in vaccinated donors was very diverse both in terms of the range of the >23 V Hgenes used to generate the 82 antibodies andthe diversity of epitopes detected. Anti- bodies to the glycan cap were most abun- dant ( Flyak et al., 2016 ), but antibodies to the RBR, base, and mucin-like domain were also common.The diversity in the epitopes recognized in the response of vac- cinees to EBOV GP contrasts with the response to seasonal influenza hemagglutinin, where in some individuals afterrepeated exposures over years, the response can be focused onto a localized patch of the HA molecular surface ( Huang et al., 2015; Linderman et al., 2014 ). The range of specicities, cross-reactivity with other Ebolavi- russpecies, and binding kinetics of a subset of the antibodies from vaccinees, despite being relatively immature with few so-matic mutations, were comparable to antibodies isolated from 180 Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019AF B C G D E Figure 6. Selection of Antibody Cocktails (A) Neutralization of pseudotyped virus by seven mAbs selected for inclusion in three antibody cocktails. Antibodies were selected on four criteria : (1) neutral- ization, (2) ability to protect mice from EBOV infection (as part of the VIC collaboration), (3) mutually exclusive binding to separate epitopes on GP , and (4) cross- reactivity with BDBV and SUDV GPs.(B-E) Mayinga (B), EBOV Makona (C), BDBV (D), and SUDV (E).

Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019 181(legend on next page) 182 Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019convalescent humans, or multiply immunized mice or macaques (Saphire and Aman, 2016; Zhao et al., 2017; Pascal et al., 2018; Misasi et al., 2016 ). A similar phenomenon was seen in the hu- man immune response to avian H7 influenza hemagglutinin afterprimary natural infection or vaccination, where a subset of anti- bodies close to germline in sequence was powerfully neutralizing in vitro and protective in vivo (Thornburg et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019 ). Earlier work had also emphasised that high-afnity pro- tective antibodies appeared early in the murine response to VSV (reviewed by Zinkernagel, 2002 ). We developed an assay to screen the antibodies for neutrali- zation. This uses a single-cycle influenza core with the hemag- glutinin coding sequence replaced with eGFP for detection of infected cells and coated in the EBOV GP by pseudotyping(Xiao et al., 2018 ). As this virus can replicate only for a single cy- cle, and contains no genetic information from Ebola, it can be handled in more convenient containment conditions than Ebolavirus. In collaboration with the VIC, we established that ourneutralization assay correlated reasonably with therapeutic ac- tivity in mice ( Saphire et al., 2018 ). We used the assay to narrow the choice of antibodies to combine in therapeutic cocktails. The mechanisms by which antibodies protect against Ebola virus in vivo are not fully understood. Antibodies to epitopes in the glycan cap, RBR, and base or fusion loop can allneutralize in vitro and protect in vivo (Saphire et al., 2018 ). Sug- gested mechanisms of NPC1 binding, pre- vention of cathepsin cleavage, interference with fusion, andFc-dependent interactions with host cells (reviewed in Saphire et al., 2018; Gunn et al., 2018 ). Certain base binding antibodies have been shown to prevent cathepsin cleavage ( Shedlock et 2017 ), and the epi- topes bound by base antibodies are usually retained after cleavage by thermolysin (as a cathepsin surrogate) ( Figure 2 C). Antibodies that bind the glycan cap can neutralize in vitro and provide protection in vivo , but it is not clear how this can occur if the epitope is removed by cathepsin cleavage before GPcl binds to NPC1. We found that neutralizing and protective anti-bodies to the glycan cap including P6 (VIC 82) and 040 (VIC 91), had the property that once bound to GP expressed on the membrane of transduced cells, they remained bound afterexposure to thermolysin. This effect was specic, becausebinding of the antibody 66-3-9C that binds the b17-18 loop on the glycan cap did not survive exposure to thermolysin treatment ( Figure 3 ). If the GP was treated with thermolysin rst, all nine GC-specic antibodies showed greatly reduced binding ( Figures 2 C and S2). A similar observation was made recently for the GC-specic mAb EBOV-442 ( Gilchuk et al., 2018 ). Although not denitive, these results suggest that some antibodies bound to the glycan cap may neutralize either through interference with cathepsin cleavage or by stabilizingthe glycan cap in the bound state despite thermolysin cleavage.Due to the high mutation frequency of Ebola virus ( Carroll et al., 2015; Alfson et al., 2015 ), mAbs, even when given in combina- tion, can select escape mutants during treatment of non-human primates ( Kugelman et al., 2015 ). Therefore, we aimed to nd sets of neutralizing antibodies that bound independently to sites in the glycan cap, receptor binding region, and base of GP, to limit the selection of resistant mutants and maximize the likeli-hood of combining several mechanisms of protection. From 82antibodies isolated from 11 vaccinated donors, we formed three antibody cocktails. Groups 1 and 2 were selected for their apparent strength of neutralization in vitro and protection in the mouse infection assay performed within the VIC study ( Saphire et al., 2018 ). Neither of these cocktails provided complete pro- tection, and therefore it is possible they selected resistantescape viruses. We intend to sequence the viral RNA from the tissues of these animals in a follow up study. Group 3 was selected rst on the level of cross-reactivity in binding between the GPs from the three Ebola virus speciesZaire, Bundibugyo, and Sudan and second on their neutraliza- tion and mouse protection. It is notable that cross-reactive anti- bodies can be found that bind glycan cap, RBR, and base orfusion loop. Treatment of guinea pigs at day 3 of infection with the cross-reactive cocktail of four antibodies that included 040 to glycan cap, 6662 to the RBR, 6541 to the base, and66-3-9C to the b17-18 loop, resulted in 100% protection from a lethal EBOV infection, without weight loss or clinical signs. Viral RNA was not detected in the tissues of these animals at postmortem on day 21 post infection, which implies that selection of resistant virus variants did not occur. We plan to test the group 3 cocktail for efcacy in the ferret model against EBOV, SUDV,and BDBV virus species ( Kroeker et al., 2017; Kozak et al., 2016 ). The effectiveness of this combination could not have been predicted from the in vitro neutralization or murine protection results with individual antibodies. The b17-18 Loop-specic anti- body 66-3-9C is closely related to the FVM09 antibody ( Keck et al., 2015; Howell et ) from is specic for the conserved exposed loopbetween beta strands 17 and 18 with the sequence GEWAFWET and by itself is not neutralizing in vitro and was only weakly protective in vivo . However, FVM09 in mixtures enhanced the binding and neutralization by base antibody 2G4, and the GC-specic antibody m8C4 ( Holtsberg Howell et 2017 FVM09 enhanced protection by the GC-specic antibody m8C4 ( Howell et al., 2017 ) and a fusion loop-binding antibody FVM02p ( Keck et al., 2015 ). A structural analysis of the synergistic effect of FVM09 with a base-binding antibody ADI-15946 suggests that FVM09 peels the GEWAFWET loopaway from the binding site for ADI-15946 and thus enhances its capacity to bind and neutralize ( West et al., 2018 ). 66-3-9C is specic for the same sequence as FVM09 ( Figure 2 B), does not neutralize in vitro , and provides only modest protection in vivo in the mouse (4 out of 10 survivors). We also saw reciprocal Figure 7. Therapy of Guinea Pigs Infected with Ebola VIRUS with Mixtures of Antibodies (A) Survival curves for the guinea pigs (n = 6) treated with the antibody cocktails on day 3 of infection. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed wi th the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.(B) Body weight (column 1), body temperature (column 2), and clinical scores (column 3).See also Figure S5 . Cell Reports 27, 172-186, April 2, 2019 183enhanced binding between 66-3-9C and the base antibodies c2G4 and c4G7, but this did not extend to enhanced neutraliza- tion in our assay. However, the profound therapeutic effect of the mixture of antibodies containing 66-3-9C suggests it may havehad a synergistic effect in vivo . Antibodies to the conserved loop between the b17-18 strands may be a generally useful addi- tion to therapeutic mixtures of antibodies. In summary, we have shown that an experimental Ebola virus vaccine trial offers a valuable opportunity for the isolation of potentially therapeutic human mAbs. We suggest that isolation of mAbs should accompany all experimental vaccine trials foremerging pathogens, for which specic therapies are lacking.

The study received ethical approval from the United Kingdom National Research Ethics Service, the Committee South Central-Oxford A (reference 14/SC/1256), Committee South Central - Oxford A (OXREC A; Ref: 14/SC/1256), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA; Ref: 21584/0334/001-0001) and the Oxford University Clinical Trials and Research Governance team, who moni-tored GCP compliance. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) provided safety oversight. The volunteers signed writ-ten consent forms and consent was veried before each vaccination. Animal studies were performed under Containment Level 4 conditions with all procedures being undertaken according the United Kingdom Animals (Scientic Procedures) Act 1986. Studies were conducted under Establishment License reference PEL PCD70/1707 with Project License PPL 30/3247. Studies were approved by the Public Health England ethics committee and the Project License approved by a UK Home Ofce inspector. Human PBMC PBMC samples were obtained from the human vaccinees who received ChAd3 EBOZ vaccine and booster dose of MVA-BN Filo (Table ), as a part of EBL01 trial ( Ewer et al., 2016 ). The vaccine components are included in Key Resources table. Participants were healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 50 years. The study included approximately equal numbers of male and female par-ticipants. However, our study was blinded to age and gender of the 11 volunteers who donated samples for isolation of antibodies. Guinea Pigs challenge studies Thirty-six female Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs (HsdDhl) weighing between 220-300 g (3-5 weeks old), were purchased from a UK home ofce approved breeder and supplier (Marshall BioResources). Guinea pigs were cared for and handled in the category 4 lab at Public Health England, Porton Down, according to the guidelines for the species. Animals were monitored at least once a day for food andwater consumption and given environmental enrichment relevant to the species. Cages were cleaned out completely at least once a week with a complete bedding material change. Animals were kept in pairs and were randomly assigned to experimental groups prior to the start of the study. The guinea pigs were implanted with a temperature and identity chip during a ve-day acclimatization period. All guinea pigs were challenged with 10 3TCID 50of guinea pig adapted Ebola virus in a volume of 200 mL via the subcutaneous route. During the course of the study, weights and temperatures were collected at least once daily and clinical scores assessed at least twice a day. Animals which met predened endpoints (20% weight loss; 10% weight and moderate clinical signs; or immo-bility) were culled by a Schedule 1 approved method. Antibody cocktails were prepared a day before administration. Antibodies weredelivered 3 days post-challenge via the intraperitoneal route in a volume of 2 mL (n = 6/group). As a positive control, ZMapp was given in a dose of 5 mg/Kg per animal. Untreated animals were given 2 mL PBS. Cell Lines HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) was obtained from the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, and MDCK-SIAT1 (Madin Darby Canine kidney - sialltransferase) cells were obtained from ATCC. Both the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's Modied EagleMedium (DMEM) supplemented I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. They were incubated at 37 /C14C with 5% CO 2. Expi293F cells were purchased from Life Technologies and used according to manufac- turer's protocol. Viruses were expanded in MDCK-SIAT1 cells transduced to express various Ebola GPs in Virus Growth Medium(VGM; DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA, streptomycin, and 10mm HEPES buffer). MDCK-SIAT cells expressing Ebola GP and MLD-deleted GP The codon optimized GP gene sequences were ordered from Geneart. The GP genes were cloned in to a Lenti virus vector pHR-SIN (Demaison et al., 2002 ). MDCK-SIAT1 lines ( et al., 2003 ) were transduced with disabled Lenti virus produced in HEK293T cells to express the glycoprotein. Transduced cells were stained specic mAbs and FACS for maximal surfaceexpression. MLD-deleted GP had amino acids 313-463 removed. Viruses Ebola pseudotyped influenza viruses (S-FLU) were generated as previously described in detail ( Xiao et al., 2018 ). Human codon optimized cDNA encoding Ebola virus glycoproteins (mentioned in Key Resources Table ) were synthesized by Geneart, Life Tech- nologies. Influenza pseudotyped viruses were propagated and grown in MDCK-SIAT1 cell lines transduced with disabled lentivirus toexpress the surface Ebola virus glycoprotein. These viruses were titrated using the expression of eGFP as a reporter. The virus wastitrated to give at least a 4 fold difference between infected and uninfected cells. Ebola virus (strain Yambuku-Ecran, previously known as ME718 ( Kuhn et al., 2014 ) adapted to cause lethal disease in guinea pigs through sequential passage. The virus was passaged ve times to achieve lethality in guinea pigs ( Dowall et al., 2014 ). Cell Reports 27, 172-186.e1-e7, April 2, 2019 e3METHOD DETAILS Isolation of mAbs from plasmablasts Antibodies were isolated by FACS sorting, PCR and antibody variable gene cloning of a single B cell plasmablast from eight vacci-nated human individuals using the previously described methods ( Tiller et al., 2008; Wrammert et al., 2008 ), with a few modications. Briefly, PBMC were incubated with few sorts, Ebola GP protein (10 mg/mL) and a known biotin- labeled anti-MLD antibody (10 mg/mL) were used to sort antigen specic B cell plasmablasts. Single cells (BD Biosciences). Single cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing lysis buffer followed by single cell RT-PCR. Nested PCR was slightly modied to existing methods.Overlapping bases (approx. 20 nucleotides) were added on to existing 5 0and 30primers without interfering the restriction sites, which could be used as a back-up, to enable digestion free Gibson cloning. PCR products were puried in a QIAGEN 96-well system and the inserts were assembled with cut plasmid in the Gibson mix (NEB). Two mL of assembled product was used to transform 10 mL DH5aE. Coli (NEB, C2987) in 96-well plates. Three colonies for each heavy and light chain were grown in a 96-well plate format and puried using QIAGEN Turbo 96 miniprep kit. Plasmids were eluted using 100 mL TE buffer. Transfection of 293T cells with heavy and light plasmids ( /C24200 ng of each with 120 mg/mL linear PEI, in 250 mL total volume) and immunofluorescence assays were also performed in a 96-well tissue culture plate. Isolation of mAbs from memory B cells PBMCs harvested 28 days after vaccination boost from three volunteers was collected. B cell culture screening was performed usinga method similar to that described by Tickle et al. (2015) . Human B cell cultures were prepared using 132 396-well plates at a cell density of approximately 5000 cells per well. After 7-days culture, screening was performed. Briefly, the presence of Ebola glycopro- tein-binding antibodies in B cell culture supernatants was determined using a homogeneous fluorescence-based binding assayperformed on a Applied Biosystems 8200 cellular detection system device using MDCK cells stably transfected to express surface Ebola glycoprotein. Binding was revealed goat anti-human IgG Fc Dylight containing reactive antibody were consolidated on 96-well bar-coded master plates andB cells in cell culture plates frozen at /C080 /C14C. Master plates were then screened in a further homogeneous fluorescence binding assay to conrm that the antibodies bound the Ebola glycoprotein-expressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells and not the parental MDCK-SIAT1 cells. The Foci method (US Patent 7993864/ Europe ( al., 2014 ) utilizing Ebola glycoprotein-ex- pressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells was used to identify and isolate antigen-specic B cells from positive wells, and specic antibodyvariable region genes were recovered from single cells by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using heavy and light chain variable region-specic primers. PCR primers contained restriction sites at the 3 0and 50ends allowing cloning of the variable region into a human IgG1 (V H), human kappa (V k) or human lambda (V l) mammalian expression vector. Heavy and light chain constructs were co-transfected into Expi293F cells using Expifectamine 293 (Thermo Fisher) and recombinant antibody expressed. After 6 days expression, supernatants were harvested, and antibody rescreened for selectivity using the specicity assays described above. Anti- body was puried from conditioned media using afnity chromatography and characterized further. Immunofluorescence Binding Assays Immunofluorescence assay was done to screen the binding of antibodies in culture supernatant to Ebola glycoprotein. A 96-well platewas coated overnight with stable transduced MDCK-SIAT1 expressing Ebola glycoprotein (E-SIAT cells). Antibody supernatant(50mL) was incubated with a monolayer of E-SIAT cells. After 1 h incubation at RT, plates were washed with PBS. A secondary anti- body goat anti-human IgG was added to wells and let incubate for 1 h in dark. Plated were then washed with PBS and xed with 1% formalin. Fluorescence wasobserved under the fluorescence the Clariostar plate reader (BMG Labtech). GP binding antibodies and influenza antibodies were used as positive and negative controls respectively. Expression and Purication of Antibody Antibodies were expressed in HEK293 or Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher) by co-transfection with heavy and light plasmids. Antibodies were puried from harvested cell supernatant using protein A Sepharose (P3391; Sigma) or MabSelect SuRe (GE Healthcare,17-5438-01). The column was washed with Tris buffered saline (TBS) and eluted with sodium citrate buffer pH 3.0 - 3.4. Elution pools were neutralised with 2 M Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and absorbance read at 280 nm. Samples were then buffer exchanged into PBS pH 7.4 using Amicon Ultra Spin columns with a 30K cut off membrane (Millipore, UFC903096) and centrifugation at 4000 g. mAbs used for guinea pig protection were expressed in 293T cells and afnity puried by the Absolute Antibody Ltd. and provided at 15 mg/mL which were aliquoted and kept at /C080 /C14C until used. e4Cell Reports 27, 172-186.e1-e7, April glycoproteins EBOV four amino C-tag (EPEA) at C terminus was expressed in HEK293E cells using PEI transfection. Cells were incubated at 37/C14C, 8.6% CO 2, 130 rpm for 6 days in Expi293 expression media (GIBCO). Supernatant was concentrated by tangential flow 2 M MgCl 2, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4; followed by size exclusion chromatography in tris-buffered saline using a HiLoad Superdex16/600 (GE Healthcare). Virus Neutralisation Assays Neutralisation assays were done as previously described ( Xiao et al., 2018 ). Ebola pseudotyped influenza virus (E-S-FLU) diluted in virus growth medium (VGM) was incubated with mAbs in serial dilution in PBS for 2 h at 37/C14C. Antibodies and virus both were in 50mL volume. After 2 hours, 100 mL of MDCK-SIAT1 cells (3x104) diluted in VGM were then added to each well. Cells were incubated for 20-24 h at 37/C14C, 5% CO 2. Next day, the medium was removed from the well and the cells were xed with 10% formalin for at least 30 min after which the wells were washed with PBS and stored in 100 mL PBS at 4/C14C. Once xed, the plates can be read anytime. The eGFP signal was found to be stable up to six months as long as the plate has not dried. The eGFP fluorescence was read using theClariostar plate reader (BMG settings in at 483 8 nm) with a 499-nm dichroic lter. Each well had 50 flashes at a 4-mm diameter and fluo- rescence readout from the top optic, giving the orbital averaging value. The gain was xed to 2000 and the focal-length was adjustedfor every experiment, which was between 4.5 - 5.5. Virus only and medium only controls for maximum and minimum signals wereincluded. Percent infection was calculated based on the wells containing virus only and medium only. Inhibitory concentration at 50% and 90% was derived by linear interpolation. Epitope Mapping using Competitive Binding Assays Competition binding assay was performed to nd out if a known/reference antibody with a dened binding site is blocked by the testing antibody and vice versa. Antibody was biotinylated using EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (21327; Life Technologies). Biotin-labeled antibody and competing mAb (in 10-fold excess over biotin-mAb) were mixed and transferred to a monolayer of E-SIAT cells. After 1 h incubation, cells were washed. A second layer 1:400) was then added for 1 hour. Cells werewashed three times and then binding was detected. When using a fluorescent second layer, cells were xed in 1% formalin and fluorescence was quantied on the Clariostar Plate reader. When Extravidin-Peroxidase was used, signal was developed by adding OPD substrate (P9187; Sigma) and the reaction stopped with 50 ml1MH 2SO4. We found Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 647 preferable because it gave a better signal to background ratio in the plate reader. Mean and 90% condence interval of eightreplicate measurements were calculated. Self-blocking (minimum signal), PBS (background fluorescence) and a non-competing antibody (influenza mAb or a mAb to the mucin-like domain; maximum signal) were used as controls. The competition was measured as: (X- Min binding)/(Maximum binding - Minimum binding), where X = Binding of the biotinylated mAb in presenceof competing mAb, Minimum binding = Blocking of the biotinylated mAb by self or background binding, Maximum binding = Bind- ing of biotinylated mAb in Assays Epitope mapping of the mAbs was carried out based on the yeast surface display (YSD) library as previously described ( Zuo et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2015 ). Briefly, the combinatorial fragment library of Zaire Ebola GP was constructed and displayed on the surface of yeast for antibody staining and Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Specically, the full-length GP gene was digested andPCR-reassembled into a range of 100-900 bp fragments, the reassembled fragments were gel puried and cloned into yeast surface display vector. The cloned products were then transformed into competent yeast cell line EBY100 using electroporation. The yeast library was induced and incubated with each of the Ebola mAbs and positive sorted by FACS using Aria III (BD, USA). The sortedpositive yeast clones displaying the respective antigenic fragments were harvested and the plasmids encoding the corresponding fragments were extracted and subjected to sequencing and sequence analysis. Binding Kinetics using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Binding kinetics of antibodies to both monomeric and trimeric Ebola virus glycoprotein ectodomain was assessed by SPR using a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare), whereby antibody was captured on a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare) via immobilized anti-hu-man IgG Fc specic antibody, followed by successive titration of glycoprotein. Resulting sensorgrams were analyzed to determine association and dissociation rate constants over a range of GP concentrations. polyclonal goat F(ab) 2anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson, 109-006-098) was immobilized following activation of test and reference flow cells by injection of 50 mL of a fresh mixture of 50 mM N-hydroxysuccimide and 200 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino- propyl)-carbodiimide at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. Polyclonal at 50 mg/mL in 10 mM acetate pH 5.0 buffer was injected (50 mL) over the test flow cell and both test and reference flow cell surfaces were then deactivated with a 50 mL pulse of 1 M ethanolamine.HCl pH 8.5. Binding assays were carried out at 25/C14C in HBS-EP running buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20, GE Healthcare). Antibodies were diluted to 10 nM in HBS-EP and concentrations of monomeric and trimeric Cell Reports 27, 172-186.e1-e7, April 2, 2019 e5GP were prepared in HBS-EP between 5 and 500 nM. The latter were tested separately for each antibody in a series of sensorgram cycles, where 10 mL of antibody was injected at 10 mL/min followed by 90 mL of GP at a flow rate of 30 mL/min to generate an asso- ciation phase of 180 s. After monitoring a dissociation phase of 300 s the chip was regenerated at the end of each cycle by successive injections of 10 mL 40 mM HCl, 5 mL 5 mM NaOH and 10 mL 40 mM HCl. Sensorgrams provided a record of response unit difference between the test and reference flow cells. For each antibody buffer control cycles were interspersed between GP cycles to allow for drift correction; also, antibody blank cycles were run at each GP concentration to allow correction for any non-specic binding of glycoprotein Sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAevaluation Software (version 4.1.1, GE Healthcare). After subtraction of respective buffer control and antibody blank cycles, kinetic parameters describing association and dissociation rate constants were determined using the Langmuir binding model. Afnity constants were calculated from the mean log K Dvalues determined over 5 concentrations of glycoprotein. Thermolysin Digestion It is known that GP proteolysis by cathepsins removes the mucin-like domain and glycan cap, and is essential for binding of GP toNPC1 receptor ( Chandran et al., 2005; Schornberg et al., 2011; Miller al., 2012 ). Thermolysin mimics cathepsins and the proteolytic activity is active at physiological pH whereas cathepsins require strongly acidic pH, which is toxic to living cells. Thermolysin (P1512; Sigma) was dissolved in HM buffer (20 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl and 20 mM MES and pH adjusted to 7.5).EBOV glycoprotein expressing cells (E-SIAT) were trypsinised from the flask and treated with 0.25 mg/mL thermolysin diluted inHM buffer containing 2 mM CaCl 2for 1 hour at 37/C14C. Then cells were washed with PBS and passed through a cell strainer as cells tend to form clumps after thermolysin treatment. To analyze antibody binding to thermolysin treated GP, 25 mg/mL antibody was incubated with cells for 1 h. Alexa fluor 647 conjugated anti-human IgG (A21445; in FACS (Attune; Life Technologies). Antibody binding to untreated GP expressing cells handled in similar manner was done in parallel for binding comparison. Log difference of binding geometric mean fluorescence intensity was calculated. Thermo- lysin treatment, without prior use of trypsin, was also performed in triplicate in 96 well plates. To conrm the complete digestion of GP by thermolysin, immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by western blot. Using the same above conditions, MDCK-SIAT1 or E-SIAT cells were treated with thermolysin. The cells were lysed for 20 min in NP40 lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated using antibody P6 (15 mg/ml) and 100 mL Protein A Sepharose (Sigma, P3391). After wash, the protein A Sepharose beads were eluted in sample loading buffer and run on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. This was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, probed 66-3-9C antibody and developed with Extravidin-HRP (Sigma, E2886). PCR of guinea pig tissues Blood samples were taken in RNAprotect animal blood tubes (QIAGEN, UK) and samples of spleen and liver collected in RNAlater tubes (QIAGEN, UK) and stored at /C080 /C14C until processing. For processing of tissue samples, samples were thawed and homoge- nized through a 500 mm mesh in a Netwell plate (Corning, UK). Tissue homogenate and blood tubes were centrifuged at 500 gto remove cellular debris. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, UK) and eluted in 50 mL RNase-free water. An Ebola Zaire strain specic real-time RT-PCR assay was utilized for the detection of viral RNA with primer and probe sequences adopted from a published method ( Trombley et al., 2010 ); with in-house optimization and validation performed to provide optimal mastermix and cycling conditions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-step qRT-PCR kit (Life Technologies, UK). The nal mastermix (15 mL) comprised 10 mL of 2x Reaction Mix, 1.2 mL of PCR-grade water, 1 mLo f each primer (EBOV F565 and EBOV R640 both at 18 mM working concentration), 1 mL of probe (at 4 mM working concentration) and 0.8 mL of SSIII enzyme mix. Five mL of template RNA was added to the mastermix in order to give a nal reaction volume of 20mL. The cycling conditions used were 50/C14C for 15 minutes, 95/C14C for 5 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95/C14C for 10 s and 60/C14C for 40 s with a nal cooling step of 40/C14C for 30 s. Quantication analysis using fluorescence was performed at the end of each 60/C14C step. Reactions were run and analyzed on the QuantStudio Real-Time Platform (Life Technologies, UK) using software version 1.2. Quantication of viral load in samples was performed using a dilution series of quantied RNA oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies). Histological analysis of guinea pig samples Samples of liver and spleen were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 21 days and processed routinely to parafn wax. Sections were cut at 3-5 mm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and examined microscopically. For immunohistochemistry, sections were stained for EBOV antigen using the Leica BondMax (Leica Biosystems) and the Leica Bond Polymer Rene Detection kit (Leica Biosystems). An antigen retrieval step was included for 10 minutes using the Bond Enzyme Pretreatment kit, enzyme 3 (3 DAB chromogen and hematoxylin counterstains were used to visualize the slides. Gene family usage of IgG genes The gene family usage of the variable region of the human IgG heavy- and light-chains was analyzed using IMGT/V-Quest. Phylogenytree was drawn based on MUSCLE alignment and Neighbor joining settings using MEGA version 7. e6Cell Reports 27, 172-186.e1-e7, April 2, 2019QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For animal studies, Kaplan Meier survival curves were analyzed with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using Prism 7 software (GraphPad). P values of less than 0.05 were considered signicant. For neutralization, each data point is an average of duplicatesfrom one experiment. Several data points from many experimental repeats are shown in the graph. MN titers were expressed as 50% or 90% maximal effective concentrations derived by linear interpolation from neighboring points in the titration curve. Geometric Mean Fluorescence Intensity (GMI) was quantied for FACS binding using FlowJo (Treestar). DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY The sequence of some mAbs have been deposited at GenBank (GenBank: MK552329 - MK552374). "}
