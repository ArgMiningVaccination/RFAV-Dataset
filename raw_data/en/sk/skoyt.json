Our team is committed to offering a wide range of opportunities to access support, clinical resources, education, and practical tools to meaningfully engage with one's health and wellbeing. Our vision is simple: we want to create a campus experience that integrates the science, theory, and practice of wellness. We will accomplish this by infusing wellness across its eight domains throughout the Penn experience through inclusive, innovative, and impactful initiatives. The eight domains of Wellness include: physical, emotional, social, intellectual, environmental, financial, occupational, and spiritual wellness. All of our initiatives are grounded in collaboration and fueled by CARE: compassion, accessibility, respect, and empowerment. Our organization is built upon two pillars ( [Student Health and Counseling](/student-health-and-counseling) and [Public Health and Wellbeing](/public-health-and-wellbeing)) that operate collaboratively to create a campus community centered on wellness. i share Watch i share, a video created by Wellness at Penn and student leaders to promote sharing with others and getting support in times of stress, distress, and crisis.
