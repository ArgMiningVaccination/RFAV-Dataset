We zig zag through the tunnels and byways of learning, finding our true selves, rejecting parts and then reconnecting again. I began my little girl life in love with the sparkly beauty of rubies, diamonds, emeralds. I asked for a new ring or piece of jewelry every birthday or Christmas. Then I rebelled. I left home and studied feminism, became aware of materialism, and the political economics of gemstone extraction. I went to law school and later represented, pro bono, a very young man who escaped an extremely violent rebel group by the skin of his teeth to seek asylum. He had been working in a diamond mine. I stopped buying jewelry. I rejected stones. I was politically correct and pious about all jewelry and didn't need or want it. Then I crashed from my divorce. And, my Dad passed away suddenly. In healing, I practiced yoga and began to study Ayurveda, which taught me so much more about the true and powerful radiance of gemstones. I was able to look at diamonds not as an evil into themselves, but as victims of human greed. I began to reconnect with myself, nature, and be consciously connected to gems again. And, although I buy consciously and conflict-free, I do it. I fell in love with stones, crystals, the Earth. There is a sacred, powerful energy present when we connect with gems. Gem therapy is considered by some Ayurvedic practitioners to be the most important remedial measure to alleviate or help with negative conditions found in the Jyotish astrological chart, which is said to calculate the number of breaths we are allotted in this incarnation. Formed by the cosmic rays transmitted through the planets, gemstones serve as a conduit of the planets' energy. Below is a chart of the major gems by planet. To find out your dosha, go [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/47693962/finding%20out%20what%20you%20need%20quiz.pdf). To use the stones to help with your own energy, keep in mind that the stones always amplify the corresponding planet in the chart. To select the gemstones that will most help you to gain balance and access their healing properties: 1 . Identify your dosha. 2. Identify the gemstones that will help you to balance that dosha. 3. Wear them, and if possible, wear them so that the gem touches your skin. As life takes us in our different directions, gemstones connect us to our universe, ground us in the planetary energies, and heal us with their light.
