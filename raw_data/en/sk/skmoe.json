Chronic health conditions in children can continue throughout adulthood if not properly addressed. Some common conditions affecting children include - As the 21st century dawned, parents began to realize that conventional medicine did not address all of the health needs of their children. Rather than conventional medicine's disease centered focus, parents began to realize that a patient centered focus was best for their children. Functional medicine addresses the underlying causes of chronic illness and disease, rather than just treating the symptoms. Ensuring that your child is healthy is the first step towards decreasing the risk of chronic diseases and protecting their health into adulthood. Integrative children's medicine involves taking a holistic look at the child's environment, [genetics](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/about-genetics.html), diet and allergies. Integrative medicine includes both conventional medical therapies and testing along with holistic approaches to develop therapies to heal the mind, body, and soul. During the initial assessment, our functional medicine practitioner will spend time with you and your child and conduct a comprehensive evaluation. This may include - Once this evaluation is completed, our functional medicine practitioner will address nutritional deficiencies and other issues that can result in health issues. The physician may recommend a combination of dietary changes and exercise recommendations to help treat and prevent illnesses. In addition to this, the child may be advised a variety of holistic treatments to help balance the body and promote healing and wellbeing of the mind and body. Functional medicine focuses on providing patient centered care using the best practices in medicine. This technique helps to maximize the health of the child by supporting their unique biochemistry through [detoxification](https://rosewellness.com/detoxification-therapy/) and nutrition to restore the function and balance of the body.
