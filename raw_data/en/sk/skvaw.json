Cancer and Aids Texte int\u00e9gral [1. Cancer Past and Present](#tocfrom1n1) [Hippocrates and liberation from divine fiat](#tocfrom2n1) 1ikeda Cancer and aids are undoubtedly the illnesses that cause the most concern these days, as they continue to stymie treatments and medical research alike. At the same time, cloning is seen as a harbinger of promising progress by some, and as a great danger by others. I thought we could begin our discussions by speaking of cancer, aids and cloning. 2Dr. Simard, as a world-renowned specialist in cancer research, you surely agree that one of the dearest wishes of humankind is a cure for cancer. I once participated in a discussion on the life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) with a group of French historians, and we debated the theory that he died of stomach cancer. 3simard Yes, that is what some experts say. Researching the distant past, scientists have found traces of cancer as far back as the Egyptian mummies. We tend to think of cancer as a modern disease, but it seems to have come into the world at the same time as the emergence of our species. It was definitely present in ancient, even prehistoric, times. 4ikeda I suppose there must be all kinds of evidence and documentation on the subject. Do you know when human beings first recognized the existence of cancer? 5simard The ancient Greeks at the time of the great physician Hippocrates (ca. 460-ca. 375 bce) had already identified it. Hippocrates referred to cancer as karkinos, or crab, from which we get our word carcinoma for malignant tumours. Ignorant of the cause of cancer, the Greeks aptly imagined it as an evil crab burrowing deeper and deeper into its victim, devouring the flesh along its way until nothing was left to consume. 6ikeda. Just like medical scientists today who are still searching for the causes of cancer, the ancient Greeks did not know how or why cancers grew. Even so, they left very precise descriptions of its symptoms and the course of its progress. 7simard Before the time of Hippocrates, human destiny was believed to be in the hands of the gods. Since disease, too, was believed to be destined by fate, the best people could do was to try to find out\u2014through oracles, mediums, fortune-tellers, and the like\u2014what fate held in store for them. Sometimes people offered sacrifices to deities to appease their anger. 8ikeda At about the same time as Hippocrates, in India, too, religious rites assumed great importance. At the peak of its authoritarianism and corruption, the priestly Brahman caste threatened the ordinary people with hell and damnation for refusing to perform certain religious rites. Apparently, conditions were similar in the East and the West in the fifth century bce. 9Shakyamuni began a religious movement to liberate people from the corrupt clergy. Jivaka, one of Shakyamuni's followers and a physician comparable to Hippocrates, laid the foundations for the Buddhist art of healing. 10simard In Hellenic Greece, Hippocrates was the first to establish a clear distinction between medicine and prayer. He theorized that disease was a natural rather than supernatural phenomenon, unrelated to religion or magic. He applied all his knowledge and experience to objectively defining symptoms of illnesses and explaining them in terms of the well-known notion of the four bodily humours\u2014blood, phlegm, black bile, and choler (yellow bile). He claimed that black bile, thought to be produced by the spleen and the stomach, was the etiologie agent of cancer. 11Hippocrates set medicine on its proper course by distancing it from mystical healing and orienting it toward the formation of a diagnostic method centred on observation and comparison of symptoms, analysis of causes, and\u2014on the bases of these\u2014prognosis of a diseases progression. 12ikeda Speaking of Hippocrates, in my discussions with Arnold Toynbee, he strongly suggested that people training for any profession, not just medicine, should take a kind of Hippocratic Oath. 13simard As you know, everyone training to be a physician must take the Hippocratic Oath before being officially recognized as a medical doctor. Considering how much all humanity owes to Hippocrates, this is not surprising. Taking the meaning of the oath to heart, new doctors learn to respect patients and recognize the importance of clinical observation. They become aware of the absolute necessity of reflecting on the ethical aspects of the medical profession. 14ikeda That makes very good sense. The ethical dimension is extremely important. [Age and geography as factors in the incidence of cancer](#tocfrom2n2) 15ikeda As people live longer, the incidence of cancer naturally increases correspondingly. Do you think that increasing longevity will lead to overall cancer rates even higher than those recently predicted? 16simard Well, as you say, the incidence of cancer rises as a population ages. Statistics on rates of sickness and death from cancer must be adjusted to reflect this reality. 17Nonetheless, if we are to trust the statistics\u2014available back to the 1930s\u2014and make adjustments in the numerical values for certain types of cancer, the mortality rate seems not to have changed appreciably. Lung cancer is the big exception. In its case, the mortality rate has risen considerably in the last forty years. 18ikeda How many types of cancer are known so far? Are there regional differences in the incidence of cancer? 19simard There are about 250 types of cancer, all with differing incidences. Some types are known to be more prevalent in certain regions or among certain age groups. 20Cancer of the liver, for example, occurs with greater frequency in Africa and Southeast Asia than elsewhere. Among industrialized countries, Japan is the only one with a high rate of stomach cancer. Elsewhere, this kind of cancer is decreasing. Cancer of the esophagus is comparatively widespread in South China, Iran, and Normandy. Developing countries generally have fairly high rates of cervical cancer; but, as if it were an economic indicator, the rate begins to drop as soon as development picks up. Among Australians of British extraction melanoma is much more common than in other populations. On the other hand, the incidence of prostate cancer is linked to age. 21ikeda In Japan, stomach cancer is still the most prevalent type, although deaths from it are on the decline. Liver and pancreatic cancers are also frequent. All told, cancer of the digestive system accounts for 70% of the total. Breast cancer, too, has been rising rapidly in recent years. 22simard Statistics show no less than 125,000 new cancer cases diagnosed in Canada in 1995 and more than 60,000 cancer-related deaths. More than half the newly diagnosed cases fell into three categories. In women, the most common types were breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. In men, prostate cancer, lung cancer, rectal cancer and colon cancer. Breast cancer remained the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women, and prostate cancer among men. Lung cancer, however, was once again the principal cause of death. 23The probabilities of contracting or dying of cancer in Canada are as follows. For women, breast cancer will strike one in nine, rectal or colon cancer one in sixteen, and lung cancer one in twenty-two. Prostate cancer will strike more than one man in ten\u2014especially men over seventy. One man in eleven will sulfer from lung cancer. [Cancer in children and adults](#tocfrom2n3) 24ikeda In Japan, the most common cancer among children is leukemia. Juvenile cancer is the source of intense suffering for the stricken children themselves and unfathomable anguish for parents and families. 25simard Thirty years ago, a diagnosis of juvenile leukemia was received as almost a death sentence. The child was usually expected to die in less than two years. Today half of children with cancer or leukemia recover completely. The frequency of recovery varies with the type of the disease. Even when cures are incomplete, a great many children can hope to live longer thanks to continuous treatments that combat and reduce symptoms. 26The process is long and slow, but a perceptible increase in successful treatments can be discerned in the growing number of children who are, sooner or later, completely cured by therapy. Nothing can give greater pleasure to pediatricians, parents, families, and nurses who have seen so many young lives sacrificed on the altar of cancer and who, at each death, have felt as if a part of themselves died as well. 27ikeda Is there a difference between the cancer that strikes children and the cancer that develops in adults? 28simard Most of the recent medical breakthroughs in the study and treatment of cancer concern the illness in children and young adults. Since the end of the 1960s, the number of total remissions has steadily increased. This success has encouraged further research, giving all children and young people who suffer from cancer new reasons to hope. 29I think we can conclude, on a relatively conjectural basis, that juvenile and adult cancers are generally not the same disease. The types of cancer diagnosed in children usually are infrequent tumours accompanied by scattered symptoms. In almost all cases of complete remission, total cure comes within two years after the first manifestation of the illness. When cancer strikes an adult, on the other hand, the sickness does not progress particularly fast. As a general rule, no long-term-survival prognosis for an adult cancer patient can be made with certainty until five years after diagnosis. 30Both death and remission occur more quickly in juvenile and early-adulthood cancer than in patients of advanced age. In fact, the characteristics of cancer in children and young adults are closely related to the classic characteristics of contagious sicknesses observed since the time of Louis Pasteur (1822-95). [Oncogenes in normal cells](#tocfrom2n4) 31ikeda Tell me candidly, in the twenty-first century, will cancer cease being the disease that universally evokes the fear of death? 32simard In all parts of the world, cancer has become the second most common cause of death, after cardiovascular disease. Many of the contagious and endemic diseases of the past have been virtually eradicated from the face of the Earth. But cancer has taken their place, rapidly acquiring a fearsome reputation and becoming a formidable foe. Unfortunately, the battle to overcome it promises to be long. 33ikeda The presence of carcinogens and oncogenes in the cells is thought to be one cause of cancer. How much do scientists understand about the process that transforms normal cells into cancerous cells? 34simard We still have a long way to go before we can explain the mechanism that initially induces cancer in a healthy cell. For example, about twenty-five years ago chemical substances\u2014carcinogens\u2014were thought to cause cancer. 35ikeda I believe your mentor, Dr. Bernhard, energetically advocated the theory of viral carcinogenesis. 36simard Yes, that is right. Soon after people began looking into carcinogens, interest in the theory of viral carcinogenesis increased. Some researchers showed that certain viral genes cause cancer. They called them oncogenes. Later normal human cells were discovered to contain genes identical to these viral genes. To distinguish them from viral oncogenes, they were called proto-oncogenes. 37ikeda The discovery of proto-oncogenes in normal human cells was big news. 38simard It really was. But we still do not know what activates oncogenes or how they are controlled. The prevailing assumption is that other genes (anti-oncogenes) control oncogenes and suppress the onset of the abnormal cell proliferation we call cancer. But the details of the mechanism at play escape us. 39Interestingly, scientists have now begun returning to chemical substances\u2014carcinogens\u2014in their search for the causes of cancer. In other words, theories about how cancer arises have come full circle without yet leading to any definitive answers. Perhaps the sphinx of cancer has not yet met her Oedipus, but sooner or later the day will come. What we will be in a position to do once we possess the secret is another story. 40ikeda I suppose the confusion of the current state of affairs makes forecasts impossible. 41simard Exactly. That is why my first lecture of each semester is always called \"Harmony and Chaos.\" Normally, nine months after conception, a human life comes into the world endowed with an enormous range of possibilities. As the individual person grows, however, the harmonious condition of the cells can be transformed into a state of chaos. Such chaotic cells are thought to have the potential for carcinogenesis. 42ikeda This idea contains deep insight into the essence of life itself. Buddhists emphasize harmony as the healthy life state. When it resonates in dynamic harmony, life radiates creativity. 43Like ancient Greek, Indian, and Chinese healing arts, Buddhist medicine teaches that the body is composed of four elements: earth, fire, water, and wind. When the four are provisionally brought together in dynamic harmony, there is life. Various sicknesses occur when the harmony is disrupted. Death ensues when the harmony is irrevocably broken. 44Though Buddhist and Western medical systems differ, they both interpret life phenomena in terms of harmony and dissonance. [2. Prevention and Treatment](#tocfrom1n2) [The two most important factors: Poor diet and smoking](#tocfrom2n5) 45ikeda We are told that the recovery rate from many types of cancer rises sharply when the disease is detected at an early stage. What methods are used nowadays to detect and diagnose cancer? Generally the very mention of medical examinations gives people pause. A clear understanding of the nature and purpose of the examinations, however, might make them less hesitant. 46simard Prevention is divided into primary and secondary modes. Early detection and diagnosis are part of secondary prevention. 47The aim of primary prevention is to eliminate causative factors or circumstances before the disease actually develops. Since some factors that lead to cancer are already well known, primary prevention focuses on trying to neutralize these factors and avoid creating or stimulating conditions in which cancer is likely to occur. 48In order of importance, these factors are carcinogens (including cigarettes and cigars); industrial chemicals; ultraviolet rays and in rare cases radiation and x-rays; papilloma, herpes, and aids viruses; such (eb) virus; diet; and heredity. 49ikeda In Japan, the relationship between smoking and cancer is most frequently cited. 50simard Today we thoroughly understand the causal connection between smoking and cancer, and smoking and cardiovascular disease. I would say that almost all citizens in the industrialized world are aware of the connection by now. The trouble is that, while perfectly aware of the risk they are taking, many people either choose to continue smoking or are too dependent to break the habit. We have been simply unable to intervene effectively. More and more young people are smoking, particularly adolescents and young women. 51People in less developed countries lack ready access to reports, information, or articles about life style. It is hard to know to what extent they are informed\u2014if at all\u2014about the dangers of smoking. 52Concrete information is now available to help formulate preventative measures against skin cancer resulting from overexposure to the sun. The frequency of skin cancer is growing, and we are seeing more cases of highly malignant melanoma. A large number of cases of less serious skin cancer, too, are being cited. So far, the best primary prevention for these types of cancer is education that presents convincing evidence and easy-to-understand explanations. 53ikeda In a report on the relations between cancer deaths among Americans and various risk factors, the epidemiologist Dr. Richard Doll of Oxford University stated that diet is involved in 35% and smoking in 30%. The two together account for 65%\u2014well over half\u2014of all cases of cancer leading to death in the United States. 54This prompted Takeshi Hirayama, director of the Japanese National Cancer Centre Research Institute, to say that modification of life style and habits\u2014eating and smoking\u2014makes it possible to keep cancer in check. The most commonly consulted cancer prevention guide in Japan, issued by the Japanese National Cancer Centre, is called \"Twelve Measures for Cancer Prevention\" (see Chart 1). 55The American Association for Cancer Research published a similar guide entitled \"Nutrition and Cancer.\" Explaining the importance of diet and eating habits in cancer prevention, the American report recommends controlling obesity, reducing overall fat intake, and eating large quantities of fibrous foods. Many of these recommendations are identical to the guidelines advocated in Japan as well. [Green and yellow vegetables, no tobacco, a balanced and regular life style](#tocfrom2n6) 56simard As I said earlier, certain organic substances are believed to be possible causes of cancer. Primary prevention consists in applying measures to counteract their action. The Japanese National Cancer Centre's \"Twelve Measures for Cancer Prevention\" covers all the important steps to be taken within the framework of primary prevention. It correctly emphasizes the influence of diet and smoking\u2014both the effects of smoking on smokers and second-hand smoke on others. 57The first epidemiological studies showing that the dietary regimen can play a role in cancer began appearing in the sixties, and their numbers have grown rapidly ever since. There are now many well-documented studies dealing with the effects of diet on breast cancer; cancer of the digestive tract, the endometrium, and the prostate gland; and laryngeal, pharyngeal, and many other types of cancer. Nonetheless, even though some studies suggest that certain kinds of diet or certain consumer products either reduce or increase the risk of cancer, the evidence is still contradictory, and viewpoints continue to diverge sharply about conclusions that can be drawn. 58Many of these studies deal with food additives. It is estimated that about 2,500 substances are added to foods, by chance or deliberately, to improve flavour, colour, or appearance. This opens an enormous field for research since it takes years of study to prove that a substance is harmless. CHART 1 Twelve Measures for Cancer Prevention 1. Eat a varied and balanced diet. 2. Do not eat the same foods too frequently. 3. Avoid overeating. 4. Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol. 5. Reduce tobacco consumption. 6. Eat a variety of foods containing sufficient amounts of vitamins A. C, and E and fibre. 7. Limit salty foods and avoid very hot foods. 8. Avoid charred or burnt food. 9. Never eat food that has been exposed to mould. 10. Avoid excessive exposure to direct sunlight. 11. Avoid overwork. 12. Maintain good personal cleanliness habits. 59Powerful communications media like the press, radio, and television inform the public of the existence of these problems. Consumer associations popping up practically everywhere demand product quality guarantees. The public now knows that foods may contain toxic substances and that food additives may have carcinogenic properties. Still, little is known about these properties, because new substances are continually appearing on the market and because experimentation on each new product is time-consuming and expensive. 60ikeda Yes, I can see how difficult that must be. 61simard As well as leading to obesity, arteriosclerosis, and cardiac infarction, a high-fat diet is conducive to cancer of the digestive tract. People would be well-advised to follow the recommendations of nutritionists, who suggest that fats should constitute no more than 30% of the daily food ration. We must get used to eating much less fat. In Western countries, fats account for more than 40% of caloric intake. 62Finally, Dr. Dennis P. Burkitt, a noted British physician, has recendy drawn our attention to the importance of a greater dietary intake of cellulose as a good means of defence against colon and rectal cancer. In spite of the absence of conclusive proof, increased intake of raw vegetables and raw fruit is generally recommended for the same reason. [Early detection and overcoming fear of death](#tocfrom2n7) 63ikeda In terms of early detection, the Japanese system of cancer examination is said to be the best in the world. In particular, examinations for early detection of stomach and uterine cancer produce reliable results. The Japanese Cancer Association's \"Ten Warning Signs\" are a good example of the kind of efforts being expended (see Chart 2). CHART 2 Ten Warning Signs 1. Has the patient lost weight, become wan or pale in appearance, or developed anemia without apparent cause or specific particular discomfort? (all types of cancer) 2. Are there persistent sores or ulcers in the mouth or on the skin that do not heal normally? (cancer of the tongue, skin cancer) 3. Is the voice hoarse for prolonged periods? (laryngeal cancer) 4. Does the patient have a persistent cough and bloody phlegm? (lung cancer) 5. Does food seems to stay in the throat when it is swallowed? (cancer of the esophagus) 6. Does the patient suffer from persistent stomach pain or loss of appetite? (stomach cancer) 7. Are bowel movements and stool normal? Is there blood in the stool? (cancer of the large intestine) 8. Are there one or more persistent lumps in the breast? (breast cancer) 9. Is there unusual or increased vagina! discharge, possibly containing blood? Is there unusual or bloody discharge upon physical contact? (uterine cancer) 10. Is it difficult to urinate? Does the urine contain blood? (prostate and liver cancer) 64simard I agree that, as guidelines for early detection and diagnosis (secondary prevention) of cancer, the \"Ten Warning Signs\" cover the essentials. The Canadian Cancer Society makes similar recommendations. The fact that both organizations see things the same way reinforces the theory that early detection reduces the sickness and mortality rates of all kinds of cancer. 65I personally think that programmes aimed at cancer prevention should be more broadly applied. Primary prevention is far preferable to diagnosis\u2014even early diagnosis. Still, early diagnosis makes it possible to avoid therapeutic methods that are costly and invasive, as well as physically debilitating. 66ikeda The Japanese physician Hiro'omi Kono has published data on the main reasons that cancer often progresses to the point where it is difficult or impossible to treat before patients consult physicians. Some of the results of his work are included in Chart 3. 67His survey of 50 patients with terminal gastric cancer showed that patients did not delay diagnosis because they were too busy at work, although I suspect that they may have waited until their jobs started to suffer, but because\u2014and this is the crux of the matter\u2014they were overconfident in their own good health. They chose to ignore the signals their own bodies were sending them. Furthermore, because of poor communication, family members paid little attention to each other's health and overlooked physical warning signs that seemed only minor. CHART 3 Reasons for Delayed Cancer Diagnosis Though aware of cancer-like symptoms, the patient chooses to interpret them on his or her own and fails to seek medical examination. (70%) The members of the family communicate poorly. fad to suggest a medical examination and contribute to the patient's procrastination. (50%) The patient is too busy at work to take the time to see a doctor. (30%) 68Psychologists describe a situation in which subconscious fear of death from cancer causes people to dull their sensibility to their own mental and physical abnormalities. Early and effective diagnosis and treatment depend on the way people perceive and react to cancer. Individuals must realize that cancer is not always fatal, and they must cultivate the life-force needed to overcome a groundless fear of dying. At the same time, people must learn about their bodies, observe them scrupulously and develop the determination to react quickly to problems. Another vital point, to my mind, is that family members sincerely care for each other and reinforce mutual bonds of affection and trust. 69simard I must agree. Psychological factors play a terribly important role in cancer. This is true for healthy people as well as for cancer patients. The mere word cancer immediately evokes images of death, incurable disease, solitude, abandonment, and powerlessness. 70Throughout the history of our species, all kinds of diseases thought to be incurable have threatened human life. Down the ages, leprosy (Hansens disease), the plague, tuberculosis, and many other sicknesses have endangered populations large and small. Until very recently, no one\u2014including scientists\u2014understood their causes, much less their treatment. No one had the least idea of how to limit the ravages they caused. 71Although aids currently rivals cancer as a medical scourge, combining the same connotation of incurability with that of a just chastisement for a reprehensible life style, cancer\u2014with its adjective malignant\u2014still has the monopoly on being associated with infernal images. As a metaphor of evil, cancer is now used in economic and political language: unemployment is described as a cancer of society, and terrorism as a cancer of democracy. [Chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation](#tocfrom2n8) 72ikeda Though once thought hopeless, today pulmonary tuberculosis is almost entirely curable. Do you believe that one day we will find a medicine that can completely cure cancer? 73simard Cancer has long been regarded as incurable. As long as its cause is unknown, any disease remains sinister and mysterious and generates physical and psychological dread of contagion. I have heard of hospitals in some parts of the world that, blinded by such fears, refuse to admit cancer patients. 74For viral infections, effective drugs can be developed by studying the virus itself. But we are still in the dark on cancer. We cannot develop drugs to counteract the disease at its source simply because we do not know what the source is. The unfortunate reality is that right now effective medicines and therapies to cure cancer are still a long way off. 75As I said earlier, however, chemotherapy has proven very effective in treating juvenile cancer. Today, 90 to 95% of all childhood leukemia (blood cancer) can be cured. 76ikeda That is certainly very encouraging. 77simard Chemotherapy is still new. It was born of pharmacological research on poison gases produced during World War II. Another noteworthy advance, also dating from the early 1940s, was the discovery by a Canadian named Huggins (1901-97) that estrogen can be used to treat prostate cancer. Huggins received a Nobel Prize for this discovery. 78ikeda What is your specialty, Dr. Simard? Could you describe your own research for us in concrete terms that we non-specialists can understand? 79simard That is relatively easy. My research concentrates on how to use anticancer agents to fight cancer cells. I am also trying to discover how viruses create cancer in animals and humans. 80ikeda The side effect of anticancer drugs is that they cause suffering by destroying not only cancerous cells, but normal cells as well. Your research, I believe, aims to overcome this drawback. 81simard Yes. Certain antibodies, called monoclonal antibodies, recognize cancer cells exclusively. If these antibodies can be administered in association with an anticancer drug, the drug acts only on cancer cells, with no effect on normal cells. 82There is still a lot of work remaining to make cancer drugs more effective, that is, to ensure that the vector\u2014the monoclonal antibody, in this case\u2014selects only cancer cells with consistency and precision. Advances in this area hold incalculable potential for cancer therapy. 83ikeda I gather that radiation therapy, too, is making rapid strides. How effective are such treatments as cobalt 60? 84simard Radiation therapies have proven effective against some types of cancer, but they can only reduce the volume of cancerous cells; they are still unable to eliminate them entirely. 85To treat some kinds of cancer, it is necessary to prescribe radiotherapy and medicinal therapy in addition to surgery. This method of associative therapy translates into a constant increase in survival rates. Cases of permanent remission, too, occur, especially in patients 30 and over. 86Using two or three therapies together makes great progress possible in the battle against this illness. But because of the high level of technology, skill, and expertise such treatment requires and the inevitable recourse to expensive drugs not always readily available, it is hard to determine whether the new therapeutic methods can be used successfully on a worldwide scale. [Effects of the emotional state on immunity](#tocfrom2n9) 87ikeda I understand that immunotherapy is being studied as a way of inhibiting cancer. Naturally, this would involve the body's natural defences against illness, of which the immune system is the most important. What exactly is the role of white blood cells and lymphocytes within the immune system? 88simard All vertebrates are equipped with defensive capacities\u2014immune response\u2014to protect them from micro-organisms and other pathogenic agents that cause diseases of various kinds. Because of these defences, we are able to withstand and recover from a vast assortment of infectious diseases. The body's natural defence capability is an important topic in medical science. Physicians and scientists in cancer research believe it offers a valid defence against the disease. According to their line of reasoning, if the human body cannot avoid cancer, perhaps there is a way to limit its consequences by taking advantage of natural immunity. 89Essentially, the immune system is based on two types of cells found in lymphoid tissue and disseminated throughout the human body. B cells, the first type, manufacture antibodies. Antibodies are clusters of proteins in the blood. There are several thousand different kinds, each one programmed to attach to an antigen. Antigens, for their part, stimulate the formation of antibodies. 90The T cell, or T lymphocyte, is the second type. These white blood cells, formed in lymphoid tissue, make certain that the immune defence system functions as planned. They circulate through the bloodstream on constant patrol for antigens. 91Whenever antigens are spotted, the immune system stores the information in its data bank. As soon as the same antigens reappear, the immune system identifies them and launches a counterattack. Once they have detected antigens, sensitized lymphocytes can transmit that information to other cells. Thus, when the right conditions conjoin, lymphocytes can mobilize a massive immune response. 92ikeda Would you say, then, that by energizing the action of lymphocytes, we could control the proliferation of cancerous cells? 93simard If, indeed, the immune system can eliminate cancerous cells, then the key to preventing the development of cancerous tumours would be to stimulate an immune-system reaction. Inversely, it could be that cancerous cells develop and cancer progresses precisely when the immune system is not working correctly. 94ikeda How far has research advanced in this area? 95simard So far, progress has been a bit slow, and we are not certain precisely which directions will be most productive and beneficial. But there can be no doubt that stimulating the immune response is a valid therapeutic avenue. In cases of aids, the immune system has broken down, aids patients are very vulnerable to infectious diseases and often develop cancer. It may be concluded, therefore, that strengthening immunity prevents the emergence of cancer. 96ikeda Where is the most advanced research in immunology going on now? 97simard In the United States probably, but nobody can predict where a major breakthrough will occur. 98ikeda Reports in the field of psychosomatic medicine about strengthening immunity claim that emotions like happiness, gratitude, hope, and satisfaction enliven lymphocytic action, whereas suffering, anger, resentment, sadness, and so on dampen it. - 1 The Lancet. New York. October 1989. 99A very interesting article called \"Does Spiritual Healing in Cancer Prolong Life?\" by Dr. David Spiegel [1](#ftn1) describes an investigation conducted on 109 breast cancer patients. The subjects were divided into two groups, only one of which received spiritual therapy. Results showed that patients who received spiritual therapy regained emotional and psychological stability. The length of time before death and the survival rates were twice as great in the spiritual-therapy group. In other words, the report acknowledged the effect of spiritual healing on longevity. Although its mechanism is a topic for future research, surely this indicates that spiritual condition affects the immune system. 100According to the Buddhist principle of \"oneness of body and mind,\" the physical aspect and the mental or spiritual aspect are two facets of a single entity\u2014literally \"two but not two.\" At the same time, although these two aspects are united and inseparable on the most basic level, they fall into two different spheres of phenomena. 101So if, as I believe, the body and the spirit influence each other so extensively, it follows that joy, hope and other positive sentiments activate physiological mechanisms and reinforce the body's immune powers, whereas despair and other negative sentiments weaken them. 102simard From a strictly scientific point of view, I must say that it is exceedingly difficult to design and carry out psychosomatic laboratory tests to establish a clear correlation between human psychology and disease. I would hasten to add, however, that in the case of cardiovascular diseases, evidence shows that emotions like joy and anguish are definitely related to health and sickness. 103Cancer, too, can be brought on by stress, as the term \"stress cancer\" indicates. Specialists in cancer research should remain broadminded enough to entertain all these theories and possibilities. [Signs of correlation between cancer and emotions](#tocfrom2n10) 104ikeda Josei Toda, my mentor, used to tell us that the human body is like a compact pharmaceutical plant. The endocrine glands secrete all kinds of hormones, while endorphins in the brain act as natural painkillers. The body produces white blood cells that combat disease-causing bacteria and enzymes that affect chemical reactions. If we look at the body in this light, there is a lot of truth in Toda's metaphor. 105simard The idea of the body as a pharmaceutical plant is very unusual. The brain is known to secrete endorphins, sometimes called internal morphine. Acupuncture, the fulcrum of oriental medicine, is presumed to accelerate endorphin secretion. 106Joggers, for instance, sometimes feel buoyantly invigorated and fatigue-free. Very probably this sensation can be attributed to endorphins. Anger, on the other hand, has the effect of increasing adrenaline secretion, with a corresponding rise in blood-pressure and bronchial dilation. 107ikeda According to the ideas of psychosomatic medicine, people without hope or a reason to live and people who torment themselves with insecurity and repressed anger are susceptible to cancer. In contrast, people who can discover fresh reasons for living and people who are strong-willed and goal-oriented have the strength to resist cancer. What do you think of such opinions? 108simard It is very interesting to consider the genesis of cancer from a psychological standpoint. Patients are always concerned by the diagnosis, and they may be anxious about the gravity of their condition, but reactions vary widely from person to person. The possibility of an amputation\u2014of a leg or a breast for instance\u2014causes much anxiety. People also worry about being saddled with a permanent surgical orifice. Many fear that their lives will change radically after treatment. When no therapy succeeds, they imagine an endless struggle made still more unbearable by the emotional burden which inevitably grows heavier with time. 109Depending on the gravity of the illness, the patient may be forced to give up work for a long time or, in certain cases, never really return to normal life, even after rehabilitation. Some people end up withdrawing from active social involvement and live out their lives in profound depression. 110ikeda In connection with this topic, too, Dr. Hiro'omi Kono's data are relevant (see Chart 4). 111According to his report, drawn-out depression or the loss of the will to live causes cancer cells to increase and spread faster, retarding convalescence. But a strong will that discovers new reasons to live and moves forward optimistically causes cancer cells to degenerate. All over the world, the relationship between cancer and the mental state is being pathologically and statistically researched. CHART 4 Psychological/Emotional Factors and Cancer Patients 1. People who have a very unhappy childhood may be more susceptible to cancer. 2. People who experience serious stress before the onset of illness, such as personal bereavement (death of a spouse or a child), experience shock and grief followed by despair and loss of the will to live. 3. Cancer patients generally appear to be well adapted socially, but in fact they are inwardly maladjusted and tend to be self-repressive. 4. Cancer patients have a strong tendency to inflict on themselves the tensions, anxiety, anger and other emotions they have trouble expressing. 112simard Suggestions that some people are at higher risk for cancer or that mental stress and overwork encourage cancer could be important clues for future research to follow. The possibility was entertained in the distant past. Almost two millennia ago, the second-century Greek physician Galen (ca. 129-ca. 200 bce) observed that melancholy or depressed women were more prone to breast cancer. But to tell the truth, research in this area has made little progress over the centuries. It is very difficult to produce hard evidence of a clear relationship between psychological states and cancer. 113Still, although there is no irrefutable proof of the psychological effect, it is useful to include a psychiatrist or a psychologist in the therapeutic group to prevent certain psychological drifts that cancer can cause. Doctors and nurses try hard to pay special attention to the psychological difficulties associated with cancer, but they are still unable to handle these problems completely. Eager for training in this area, they are doing their best to learn about the psychological aspects of cancer therapy. [The body's constant countermeasures](#tocfrom2n11) 114ikeda Dr. Kono's data make it clear that a large number of cancer patients (about one-third) have experienced the loneliness and unhappiness of losing one or both parents or some other loved one during childhood, suggesting that this experience becomes a psychological stressor that later triggers the onset of cancer. This makes me think that of all kinds of stress, the loss of a loved one has the greatest impact. 115It seems to me, however, that a child orphaned at an early age but surrounded by people embodying unshakeable motherly and fatherly support and care could be free of psychological stress and able to rally the internal powers needed to combat cancer cells. 116The idea of such an \"unshakeable\" presence, with its inherent fatherly and motherly overtones, is reminiscent of the role of philosophy or, even more so, religion. Is it possible that, through religion, an individual could undergo an existential conversion and draw from this experience the vibrant life force needed to successfully combat cancer? It seems perfectly fitting to me that philosophy and religion should play a vital role in fighting cancer. 117simard If we study a group of cancer patients and observe that they have personality problems, it becomes impossible to overlook the influence somatic sickness\u2014cancer in this case\u2014has exerted on their mental behaviour. Furthermore, because no personality analysis was performed before the onset of sickness, it is impossible to eliminate the inverse proposition. 118It is often possible to identify in a patient's personal history a stressful event shortly before the first symptoms of illness. But can we attribute a triggering nature to such stress? Personally, I am not ready to take that step. Many stresses do not translate into serious illness\u2014cancer. Moreover, the evaluation of stress is highly subjective. 119ikeda I see what you mean. People may experience the same kind of stress, but their organism's response will differ according to how that stress is overcome. 120A person may be defeated by stress or use it as a life-reinforcing power. In the latter case, I think an existential conversion occurs. 121simard Of course, this is one track to explore. Owing to the difficulties of differing interpretations and the absence of evidence and experimental models, however, we are still a long way from any kind of certitude. - 2 Sekai Shimin no Taiwa - A Dialogue Toward Global Harmonization. Tokyo: The Mainichi Newspapers, 19 [(...)](#ftn2) 122ikeda In a dialogue I conducted some years ago with Norman Cousins (1915-90), [2](#ftn2) who was called the \"conscience of America,\" he expressed the view that the human being is endowed with a healing system and a system of convictions. Mr. Cousins believed that the two work together to cure illness. I, too, believe that human life has an innate capacity to overcome disease. 123simard Frankly, I also think that the body is constantly manufacturing something new to fight against malignant growths that affect it internally. 124ikeda Coming from someone with many years' experience in cancer research, your words carry a great weight of hope and courage for many people. [3. Cancer and Disclosure: The Doctor-Patient Bond](#tocfrom1n3) [Human dignity and disclosure](#tocfrom2n12) 125ikeda Let's turn now to informing the patient of the diagnosis. Should doctors inform patients of cancer diagnoses? Since the kind of treatment depends in part on whether the doctor chooses to tell the patient, this is an extremely important decision. Specialist groups in Japan have been adopting an increasingly positive attitude toward disclosure, which seems to be becoming the prevailing trend. 126The sufferings caused by cancer fall into three main categories. First is physical pain. Particularly in advanced and terminal cases, severe, continuous pain can result in the loss of human dignity. Second is the anxiety and fear associated with the disruption or breakdown of social and personal life related to family, work, position, and property. Third is anxiety about and fear of death itself. 127In the Buddhist view, there are three dimensions of human suffering: physical pain, spiritual, mental and social anguish related to family and society, and existential agony or fear of death. Overcoming these sufferings is the focus of debate on whether and how to inform cancer patients of their condition. 128In many instances in Japan, cancer patients are still not informed. In Europe and the United States, on the other hand, disclosure is made in almost all instances. A survey conducted in 1973 by the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that 98% of physicians in the United States inform patients when they have cancer. Conceivably these divergent approaches reflect differences between Japanese and Western views of life and death. 129Protection of patients' rights accounts for the prevalence of disclosure in the West. The principle of informed consent means that patients have the right to know and select their own therapy. 130Quality of life is another consideration. It is believed that merely extending life is insufficient. To enable patients to live their remaining lives in as fulfilled a way as possible by giving them care that respects their humanity, disclosure of the nature of their condition is essential. In addition, in places like the United States, where medical malpractice suits are frequent, disclosure may help provide verifying evidence in the event of court battles. 131Japanese doctors, however, are concerned that the shock of disclosure could plunge their patient into a profound depression and accelerate death. They believe that they can help patients die in peace by leaving them uninformed. More recently, however, attitudes have been changing, and apparently more and more doctors are opting for disclosure. 132simard You have brought up some crucial points about disclosure in the case of cancer patients. And clearly Buddhism makes a valuable contribution to the debate. In my opinion, patients have the right to know everything about the state of their health. Besides, when they are well informed, they are generally more co-operative and amenable to the treatments judged most advisable. My own experience and that of my colleagues confirm this. 133For personal reasons, some patients do not wish to know the truth about the state of their health. They are ill-inclined to ask questions about the diagnosis, and doctors should respect their feelings. Often their initial resistance weakens, though, and they come to want to know about their condition. Personally, if I had cancer, I would want to know. 134ikeda As a scientist, you are prepared to observe your own condition coolly and objectively. Actually, with the side effects of modern radiation treatment and anticancer drugs, the truth would be hard to conceal. 135simard Patients know more about their own physical condition than others think. 136ikeda As you say, knowing the truth about their illness may make patients more receptive to treatment and it probably deepens the patient-doctor bond. Another advantage is that knowing that their days are numbered may stimulate people to complete unfinished tasks and life-long undertakings. It may give them the impetus to spend time with their family and friends. Most of all, confrontation with one's own death can inspire awareness of the limits of life and turn the mind toward eternal things. 137When it comes to disclosure of cancer diagnoses, I think the following things should be carefully considered. First, the need for mutual trust between the doctors and medical-care staff, and between the doctor and the patient. Second, the need to establish a highly qualified medical team. Third, the importance of encouraging the patient to really want to combat the disease. Fourth, the importance of support from family and friends. Fifth, the importance, for the patient, of adopting a vision of mortal life and a philosophy of life and death. 138Carelessly performed, disclosure can generate severe anxiety and depression, even leading to suicide. It can deprive the patient of the will to continue treatment, thus causing further physical weakening. In some cases, it may bring a halt to all the patient's social activities. [Hope and the innate capacity to defeat illness](#tocfrom2n13) 139simard Once we recognize the patient's right to be informed and the doctor's duty to transmit this information, the thorny question of how to communicate the nature and severity of the sickness remains. It is important not only to reveal the diagnosis to the patient, but also to explain it to family and friends. This assumes the doctor knows the family, who will provide indispensable psychological support to the patient and help him or her cope with the sickness. The number of meetings needed and the suitability of allowing others to be present at the disclosure must be determined on the basis of the patient's age and personality, and the availability of family members. 140ikeda That is extremely valuable and practical advice. The final chapter of life is subject to various kinds of suffering\u2014called the sufferings of death in Buddhist terms. The heart of the disclosure problem is whether people can overcome these sufferings and attain tranquility. We must strive to make our virtues exceed our faults, so that suffering can be eliminated and replaced by consolation. Because illness and condition vary from patient to patient, decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. 141simard No matter what doctors say to their patients, they must always take the patients' age and intellectual and cultural background into consideration when deciding the best way to communicate the information. They must use simple language without the gobbledygook of medical jargon. They would be well advised to ask the patients and their families to repeat back to them what they have just explained, to prevent unjustified fears and misinterpretations. 142ikeda Yes. Explaining the disease in a way the patient can fully understand is essential. One Buddhist sutra uses an expression that means \"pleasing words\" or \"love words,\" where the word love means altruistic, philanthropic compassion. The passage in the Recitations of the Teaching Sutra reads, \"What are these love words like? They give pleasure, they are pleasant and moving. They are pronounced with tenderness and soft glances.\" The same passage exhorts people not to use \"words that make people frown.\" I think that patients find what they are told easier to accept when the message is couched in such \"love words.\" 143simard I can only agree with you. As you said earlier, Mr. Ikeda, in communicating with people committed to their care, doctors must seize every occasion to encourage them and reinforce their hope of survival. Trust in the doctor and faith in the treatment greatly enhance chances of triumphing over the suffering caused by the sickness. The patient who entertains firm hope bears up better under anxiety and pain. 144ikeda Very aptly put. Hope provides the driving force to challenge the diverse hardships of life, including the suffering of disease. 145During our discussions together, Dr. Martin Seligman (1942- ), president of the American Psychological Association, called hope the key to overcoming suffering and living optimistically. 146In Mans Search for Meaning: Experiences in the Concentration Camp (1946), the Austrian psychoanalyst Dr. Viktor E. Frankl (1905-97) wrote that he survived a Nazi concentration camp not because he was in good health, but because he consistently believed in the future and went on hoping. He said that those who abandoned hope soon collapsed inwardly and died. He attributed to hope the power to strengthen the body and prolong life. In a similar vein, the Buddhist scripture known as A Treasury of Analyses of the Law says \"Hope nurtures the body and prolongs life.\" 147simard That is absolutely true. 148ikeda To achieve good results in cancer disclosure, tests and examinations or treatment, strong bonds of trust between physicians and medical staff and patients and families are essential. [The urgency of restoring human bonds](#tocfrom2n14) 149simard The intrusion of anonymous \"invaders\" between doctor and patient constitutes a relatively new medical problem. By invaders I mean devices, instruments, and an ever-increasing battery of tests and equipment. Nowadays, before they ever see the face of a doctor, outpatients see a multitude of machines. 150ikeda How right you are! 151simard You are ushered into an examination room where blood samples are taken and x-ray, chemical, and other tests performed. Of course all these tests are valuable\u2014they provide the doctor with the data needed to make the diagnosis. But being satisfied with tests hinders the formation of necessary bonds between doctor and patient. 152ikeda The very thought of medical examinations is enough to keep many people away from hospitals. 153simard Yet these invaders are the fruit of the very technological breakthroughs that now make it possible to cure patients who, only yesterday, were considered hopeless. Nonetheless, they threaten the close, privileged bond that is so vital between physician and patient. Precisely because this bond has become so fragile, we must work all the harder to avoid neglecting the human factor in the healing process. 154ikeda That is a very important point. As medicine advances, we must strive to ensure that it becomes, not more mechanical, but more humane. After all, medicine exists for the sake of humanity. Its goal is to serve people, not machines and not technology. 155simard True. And doctors themselves certainly have no easy role. They must earn a living, and at the same time enormous social pressure compels them to call upon the newest medical technology. Still, this cannot justify neglecting to build a sound rapport with their patients. 156No device\u2014no machine, no high-tech tools\u2014should intervene in a way that excludes the human factor. I firmly believe that medical-school curricula must be revised to provide theoretical and practical training in doctor-patient relations. 157ikeda Hippocrates envisioned the physician as a treasury of useful suggestions. He said that physicians should learn to communicate a lively and comforting feeling, because a solemn and severe face distances the healthy and the ill alike. There is no question that meeting with an aloof, self-important, punctilious doctor can be upsetting. Hippocrates advised making the doctor's and the patient's chairs the same height. Don't look down on people in distress, he warned. Regard them as your equals, and regard them with compassion. 158simard The doctor-patient relationship must be thoroughly reviewed and restructured. This is an issue that concerns all members of the medical profession. 159ikeda Yes, I can understand why. We must restore the humane bond. Like Hippocrates, Shakyamuni described the ideal physician as brimming with true humanity. For instance, a passage in the Sovereign Kings of the Golden Light Sutra instructs physicians to approach ill people with compassion and without greedy thoughts of personal profit. 160One especially interesting aspect of Buddhist ideas on medicine is the emphasis laid on the patient's wisdom. The Great Canon of Monastic Rules urges people to learn and to expand their knowledge, to think independently and to use their wisdom and their knowledge for the sake of their own health. 161simard All of us must think seriously about ways of informing and educating the public. In all countries, a gap separates the informed from the uninformed\u2014those who can read and judge with a critical eye news of scientific discoveries and those who lack the basic knowledge to understand and assess what is happening in science and technology. As a result of this ignorance, many are led to blindly accept the effectiveness of any old treatment or find themselves refusing chances to receive a treatment that might help them. The outcome is too many unfortunate victims of unscrupulous charlatans. 162ikeda No one should be victimized by greedy frauds. People need wisdom and common sense to avoid being taken advantage of. 163simard In this day and age, if we want to preserve the human element in life, we must make certain that more people can analyse and discuss scientific and social problems. 164ikeda It certainly appears that the virtue of humanity is no longer a prized value. Success has taken its place. In this highly materialist era, most people seem almost wholly bent on profiting from others. In the midst of so many grabbing hands, the single, giving hand is all the more radiant. [4. aids\u2014Menace and Countermeasures](#tocfrom1n4) [The origins of aids](#tocfrom2n15) 165ikeda Following your suggestion, Dr. Simard, we will now take up the vital issue of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or aids. During the late twentieth century, aids became an inimical enemy to humanity and in all likelihood it will continue to threaten lives well into the twenty-first century. 166simard Yes, you are right, aids may prove to be the greatest calamity of the new century. 167ikeda When were the first occurrences of aids reported? 168simard In the early 1980s, aids first appeared as an infectious disease previously unknown in the United States. 169In the winter of 1981, doctors in California and New York were surprised to observe occurrences of such relatively uncommon ailments as pneumonia caused by a protozoan organism (pneumocystis carinii) and Kaposi's sarcoma, an infrequently occurring skin cancer. Strangely enough, in all cases, the patients were men in their thirties, formerly in excellent health, with only one thing in common: homosexuality. From that time on, however, they shared another characteristic: the collapse of their immune system. Incidentally, these rare ailments can also be associated with an immune-system deficiency imputable to, for instance, certain genetic diseases or the immunosuppressive treatments that inevitably accompany organ transplants or chemotherapy. 170Upon learning of these findings in 1981, the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, published a report constituting the first alarm signal. Within three months, some hundred analogous cases had been reported, mostly in New York and San Francisco. When their immune systems collapsed, the relatively young patients, almost all homosexuals, were stricken with such so-called opportunistic infections as mycoses of the oral cavity or esophagus, or even aggressive, ulcerous forms of herpes. The conclusion was self-evident: we were dealing with an epidemic of a type totally unknown till then. It was dubbed acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids. 171ikeda At first, because homosexuals were the only people infected, the sickness was thought to be a rare disease limited to them. We shall deal with prejudice and discrimination against aids patients later, but the appearance of any disease of unknown origin can trigger extreme reactions of social panic. 172Was it in 1983 that the aids virus was first identified? 173simard That year, the laboratories of and Robert Gallo (1937- ) identified a retrovirus as the cause of aids. This virus is now known as the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). Two years later, a test was developed to detect the presence of the virus in blood. 174I should add that one of the characteristics of the aids epidemic is our current knowledge of two types or strains of hiv with different epidemiological profiles. Whereas hiv\u20141 is the principal cause of the epidemic in America and the Caribbean, two strains\u2014hiv\u20141 and hiv\u20142\u2014are prevalent in different parts of Africa. 175ikeda What about the origin of the aids virus? Did it exist before it manifested itself in humans? Do you espouse the theory that aids is indigenous to Africa? 176simard As for the origin of the disease, we believe that it appeared at about the same time in Africa and the United States. The precise origin of hiv is unknown. Rumours claimed that it was the product of a laboratory experiment as part of the development of some sort of genetic therapy, but that hypothesis has been abandoned. It now seems most probable that hiv emerged during the last few decades somewhere in Central Africa. Actually, hiv contamination has been traced back to serum collected from Ugandan children in 1972 and 1973. This indicates that the virus existed in an endemic state in a rural population in Central Africa at that time. 177Retroviruses very similar to hiv have also been isolated in African green monkeys. This is why the virus is thought to have mutated suddenly to become pathogenic in human beings. It could therefore have been present in humans for years without causing aids. Or it could have caused many cases of aids that went unrecognized because the syndrome was still undefined. [Opportunistic infection and modes of transmission](#tocfrom2n16) 178ikeda How exactly is the disease transmitted? 179simard The currently proven ways aids is transmitted are sexual transmission (homosexual or heterosexual), which is the most common; transmission through hiv-contaminated syringes; transmission from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding; and transmission through blood transfusions of hiv-contaminated blood or blood products. 180ikeda In Japan, a few years ago, several heads of pharmaceutical companies and medical research firms were sued for malpractice for selling hiv-contaminated blood products that had been imported to treat hemophilia. A great many hemophiliacs were infected. 181simard Of the four major ways the disease can be transmitted, the most common, worldwide, is sexual intercourse. Research to date indicates that contagion through air, water, or food is virtually nil. The disease is transmitted only when the virus enters the body through a contaminated needle or blood product or through direct exchange of bodily fluids with an hiv carrier. 182ikeda In other words, ordinary contact with hiv carriers or aids patients in daily life entails absolutely no risk of infection? 183simard None at all. It is eminently important to understand this. 184ikeda Accurate information can prevent the spread of contamination and eliminate groundless fears, enabling people to live confidently with hiv carriers and aids patients. 185simard Without a doubt. Public ignorance about aids is a more serious menace than the disease itself. 186ikeda What kinds of symptoms develop from hiv infection? Are there symptoms peculiar to aids? 187simard hiv almost exclusively attacks the t4 lymphocytes, which play an essential role in the immune system specific to the organism. These lymphocytes carry on their surfaces a protein called cd4, a kind of cell keyhole to which hiv has the key. Once inside the cell, the virus can remain quiet for several months, during which sero-conversion takes place. This process generally takes from six to eight weeks after introduction of hiv into the organism. Most of the time, this initial phase of infection is free of symptoms, but routine blood tests can detect it. In some cases, however, infected persons demonstrate flu-like symptoms, including fever, headaches, muscular pain, and glandular disorders. 188ikeda How long does it take for the hiv-infected patient to develop aids symptoms? 189simard There is a second phase which may last up to five years and during which a variety of things may occur. Sometimes we observe asymptomatic forms that evolve over a long period. With more than ten years of hindsight, we now know that all infected individuals eventually contract aids and that, even though they may remain free of symptoms themselves for years, they are nonetheless capable of transmitting the virus. 190We may also see minor forms of infection, depending on the extent of multiplication and dissemination of the virus, that manifest themselves by general signs: high fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal troubles, and skin conditions. Strictly speaking, however, none of these signs is specific to aids. 191ikeda What symptoms occur when aids has fully developed? 192simard From the moment the infection leads to a serious immune deficiency, we witness a group of grave symptoms associated with either very particular infections or the development of cancerous tumours, of which Kaposi's sarcoma is the most widely known. The infections and tumours are not directly related to hiv\u2014hiv is simply responsible for creating a favourable terrain for their development. 193ikeda And this is why they are called opportunistic infections? 194simard Yes. Normally many microbes\u2014viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa\u2014inhabit our organism without creating problems, since our immune defence limits their numbers and prevents the full-scale invasions that are the source of illness. 195As soon as our immune defences weaken, these micro-organisms seize the opportunity to multiply actively. The numerous opportunistic infections associated with aids affect, above all, the lungs, the digestive tract, the nervous system and, less frequently, the skin. Often, these infections constitute the first pathological and revelatory expression of hiv infection. Among the most frequent and indicative infections brought on by aids are a form of pneumonia caused by a protozoan organism, pneumocystis carinii; a cytomegalovirus poly-visceral infection that can manifest itself as pneumonia, hepatitis, or encephalitis; and a herpes-simplex infection that provokes lesions of the skin or the mucous membranes. 196These few examples of opportunistic infection illustrate the great complexity of symptoms that confront the doctor in the second phase of hiv infection. Still other equally serious symptoms that develop in the wake of hiv infection are called opportunistic cancers. 197ikeda What are some of the main opportunistic cancers? 198simard The most frequent is Kaposi's sarcoma, caused by the development of endothelial cells in the blood vessels of the skin, muscles, viscera, or ganglions. Other tumours composed of lymphoid tissue can develop after a serious breakdown of the immune system. These are malignant lymphomas originating in the lymphatic nodes, hiv does not cause these malignant tumours directly. By causing an immune deficiency, it simply opens the door for them. [Estimated hiv carriers and aids patients in 2000](#tocfrom2n17) 199ikeda In 1995, the number of hiv-infected people in the United States was reported to have reached one million. Today numbers of carriers in Africa and Southeast Asia are growing at an explosive rate. By some predictions, the number will reach forty million worldwide in the twenty-first century. What do you think, Dr. Simard? 200simard When people talk of the galloping spread of hiv infection, they mean the exponential growth in the number of reported cases. The nature of aids and hiv infection makes statistics outmoded the moment they are published. From current observations, we estimate that, at the turn of the century, about 38 million people had been infected with hiv. Others think that a figure of 110 million constitutes a more realistic evaluation of the situation as it was in the year 2000. 201ikeda Those are frightening figures. Do you think aids will continue to spread? 202simard Clearly hiv-infection and the aids syndrome have reached pandemic proportions over the past decade. It is uncertain whether we can rapidly control or neutralize the pandemic because hiv is now endemic in the human population. 203ikeda What can we do to check the spread of aids? 204simard hiv is not highly contagious. Adequate preventive measures minimize its spread. 205ikeda So prevention is the key to controlling this disease? 206simard Exactly. Epidemiological data show that some people demonstrate a higher risk of hiv infection than the general population. For the moment, these people are essentially homosexuals and bisexuals; drug addicts using injectable substances; people with numerous sexual partners; people born or living in countries where infection is common and frequent; sexual partners of all these groups; and, of course, children born to infected mothers. 207ikeda I know that drug addicts are a high-risk group. Their extreme poverty obliges them to share needles. 208simard True. It is critically important to introduce preventive measures that, among other things, address problems of poverty and drug addiction. Educating high-risk groups is vital to checking the future spread of aids. [Variable virus: An obstacle to vaccine development](#tocfrom2n18) 209ikeda I understand just how crucial education can be when it comes to aids. Now I should like to discuss the different types of therapy currently being used to treat aids patients. 210simard Treatment for aids is based on two totally different therapeutic methods, according to how far the syndrome has advanced. The first approach fights the virus and the infected cells to impede viral reproduction and eventually re-establish immunity. The second treats ailments promoted by immune deficiency\u2014primarily opportunistic infections and cancers. 211ikeda Can we look forward to the development of effective anti- aids medication? 212simard One constraint is the scarcity of products that check the multiplication of viruses in general. We have at our disposal an arsenal of antibiotics and other drugs capable of dealing with bacterial infection, but viruses act differently. Viruses are, in effect, parasites that use cell metabolism to multiply. We can fight them only by considerably disturbing cellular metabolism, with the death of the host cell as a consequence. Clearly, that is not the desired goal. Antiviral treatment itself targets different phases of virus replication. The substances that have produced the best results to date call upon chemical structures that inhibit an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) responsible for viral reproduction. 213ikeda Recently in Japan much attention has been devoted to Azidothymidine (azt). 214simard azt treatment has demonstrated the ability to retard the reproduction of the virus considerably and, consequently, the manifestation of the sickness. Unfortunately, azt becomes less effective after about one year of treatment. Its fairly serious side effects\u2014nausea, headache, dizziness, and leucopoenia\u2014require repeated control measures. This means frequent visits to enable the doctor in charge of treatment to closely observe the effects of the drug on the patient. Promising clinical trials are now being conducted to develop other drugs that inhibit the proteins the virus needs to multiply. 215ikeda I understand that attempts are being made to develop a preventative vaccine. 216simard In trying to develop a vaccine, we run up against numerous problems connected with the very nature and habits of this virus. 217ikeda I know it is difficult, but could you explain simply what makes the aids virus so peculiar? 218simard For one thing, the efficacy of a vaccine is directly proportional to the constancy of the virus. The aids virus varies greatly in terms of protein content and genome from patient to patient. The development of a vaccine to deal with one given viral structure runs the risk of failing to protect against other, slightly different structures. 219ikeda I see. That must be a major obstacle to aids -vaccine development. 220simard It is. For another thing, the virus can remain silent in the form of a provirus or can literally hide inside the central nervous system or in macrophages. Until now, this capability has prevented our finding a way to parry the viral strategy. Still, research in this area is very active and is oriented particularly toward using genetic engineering to manufacture a vaccine. 221In any case, the development of an aids vaccine will undoubtedly be long and arduous. In the meantime, efforts are being made to find new methods of treatment like the so-called cocktail therapy, which uses a number of therapies simultaneously. I think we can expect progress in therapeutic techniques, even though we may have to wait. [5. aids and Human Rights](#tocfrom1n5) [Prejudice based on misconceptions](#tocfrom2n19) 222ikeda Up to now we've been talking about the pathological nature of the threat aids poses to human life, but aids has other effects that are intimately involved with ethics and human rights. I should now like to call on Dr. Bourgeault to join us in broaching the topic of aids and human rights. 223bourgeault As you say, aids raises questions of ethics and human rights that are today universal topics of debate. 224ikeda The whole of society must be prepared to support hiv-infected people. The dissemination of accurate information about the disease, research, the development of effective therapies and medicines, and respect for patients' rights are all very important. If we succeed at this, we will have created what I would call a human-rights society, where the sacred nature of life is a basic and well-established fact. 225First of all, we must break down barriers of prejudice and discrimination against hiv carriers. 226bourgeault The stigmatization and discrimination of aids patients arise partly from the nature of the sickness, but even more from people's perceptions of it. When I think about the nature of the disease, I think of the apparently irreversible dynamic of its development, leading inescapably to death. We try all ways to avoid or at least retard the illness and death and, when that proves impossible, we gloss over the reality, aids patients\u2014less so hiv-carriers than the physically afflicted\u2014display the signs of sickness and of what I would call the universal human condemnation to death. I think that the mechanisms of aids transmission and latency make us fear\u2014often mistakenly\u2014being accidentally infected, perhaps without even knowing it. - 3 Manon Jourdenais, in collaboration with Jean-Guy Nadeau. vais plus mourir: L' [(...)](#ftn3) 227Fortunately, as the apt title of the recent book Maintenant que je ne vais plus mourir (Now that I'm no longer going to die) [3](#ftn3) gives us to understand, new treatments are providing hope to the men and women who do daily battle against hiv within their own bodies. 228ikeda Despite therapeutic advances being made, aids is still a scourge of illness and death that inflicts terrible suffering on an unprecedented scale. I admire all the noble efforts made to afford hope to people living with aids. 229bourgeault The prejudice against aids patients is nourished by erroneous perceptions and ideas about the sickness. People afflicted with aids and hiv carriers are victims twice over: they suffer physically from the disease and psychologically from social discrimination. 230ikeda This makes it all the more urgent that accurate information about aids be disseminated. This is true in cases not only of sickness, but also of prejudices involving religion, philosophy, human rights, and many other issues. In this sense, dialogues such as the one we are conducting now are especially precious as a means of educating the public. 231bourgeault In a sense, bias against aids patients is the product of prejudices and discriminatory attitudes. Even though the transmission mechanisms are well known\u2014as Dr. Simard just explained\u2014irrational fears persist. As if touching an infected person or even breathing the same air could cause contamination! 232It is not entirely coincidental that people have called aids a modern plague. The irrational fear, which leads to stigmatization and sometimes discrimination, arises because of the way the disease has been presented to the public. In Canada, associating the spread of the sickness with the arrival of immigrants, more specifically of Blacks, has awakened the old demons of racism. The sickness is also associated with sexual behaviour that some consider reprehensible, even unnatural. These things partly explain why people do not always feel the kind of compassion toward aids patients that they otherwise spontaneously entertain for the sick. They also explain\u2014once again in part\u2014the stigmatization of aids patients. 233ikeda Reports claim that in Japan some medical personnel often or even systematically refuse to treat people infected with hiv. 234simard Attitudes toward people infected with hiv and aids vary considerably, ranging from disgust and fear to compassion and solidarity. This includes health professionals like doctors, dentists, and surgeons, who must treat or have contact with patients. Some refuse to treat any hiv patients, for fear of becoming infected themselves and infecting their families. They worry about their careers and the future of their loved ones, should they become infected. Other doctors fear losing some of their clientele if they treat aids patients. Still others have a phobia about even the least contact with homosexuals and narcotics addicts. It is not surprising that such cases have been reported in Japan. In Canada and the United States, too, many similar situations have occurred. 235bourgeault Prejudices aside, aids patients are victims of discrimination. But I make a distinction between calculated discrimination\u2014from insurance companies, for example, or employers wishing to avoid hiring the wrong kind of people\u2014and discrimination arising more from collective hysteria. In the first case\u2014thanks to charters of human rights, for instance\u2014laws can help, and if not halt, at least curb discriminatory practices in connection with insurance and employment. 236ikeda Discrimination against patients not only violates medical ethics, but also tramples on human dignity. Surely a sense of human rights must be based on a compassionate, emotionally impartial understanding of others' sufferings. 237At an international conference on aids held in Vancouver some time ago, a representative of Japanese hemophiliacs spoke of the fact that many Japanese hemophiliacs contracted aids from contaminated blood products, aids from contaminated blood is currently the number one cause of death among hemophiliacs in Japan. In other words, these people are dying because of the medical products that were supposed to treat their illness. 238I believe that the headquarters of the World Hemophiliac Association is in Canada. Have there been similar situations in Canada? What can be done to prevent them? 239simard In retrospect, it is clear that people who need blood transfusions and blood products, like hemophiliacs and patients of major surgery, constitute a group at risk of contamination by blood from an infected donor. Since blood transfusions are easier to control than people's sexual behaviour, we could have taken more effective preventative action in dealing with this mode of transmission. 240Blood-screening tests have already radically altered the situation. The risk of this kind of transmission in many countries has been practically eliminated by the implementation of very strict public-health measures. Unfortunately, people infected before the development of those blood tests\u2014that is, before 1985\u2014have had, to say the very least, a very painful experience. 241ikeda We must hope that such a tragedy never repeats itself. [Education and human rights](#tocfrom2n20) 242ikeda What methods are now being used in North America to protect the rights of hiv-infected people? 243simard In the United States, it is considered unethical to refuse competent and humane treatment to anyone with aids or other conditions related to hiv infection. In Canada, many provinces now prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Quebec and Ontario have passed human-rights legislation prohibiting discrimination based on the perception of a handicap. aids will probably qualify as a handicap, so the provincial law will effectively protect patients. 244The Royal Society of Canada has recommended that Canadian human-rights laws be amended specifically to ban discrimination based on evidence of or perception of hiv infection or sexual orientation. Incidentally, many institutions of higher learning, including the University of Montreal, have policies condemning discrimination against hiv carriers and people with aids. 245ikeda A very laudable decision. When a leading institution like the University of Montreal takes action to stop discriminatory practices, it is bound to have a major impact on other medical institutions. Along with official governmental and administrative measures, I think we must also encourage the general public to embrace a view free of discrimination and prejudice. 246bourgeault You are right. As you yourself suggest, we must call for educational activities in the broad sense: widely spreading information, holding events where famous people\u2014actors, for instance\u2014fearlessly demonstrate solidarity and compassion. Every year, in Quebec and all over Canada, large, popular rallies are held\u2014marches in city streets; concerts; shows; and public speeches by politicians, doctors, and so on. Such events help strengthen sympathy for and ties with aids patients. 247ikeda I wish it were the same in Japan. Here people are still tested for aids surreptitiously\u2014the samples are officially taken for some other purpose\u2014and the results, concealed from the testee, are used in employment policies and school entrance decisions. 248bourgeault Canada has no systematic aids screening programmes; but tests are made and testees informed of results when, for instance, a blood donation is made. Information campaigns are conducted to encourage target groups to consult specialists and voluntarily submit to testing. Some clinics, like the one in Central-South Montreal, do really remarkable work in this regard. 249There are people who would like to have systematic screening put in place for certain groups. Many experts, however, point out that such programmes\u2014aside from being likely to encourage stigmatization and discrimination\u2014could represent a double risk to public health. For one thing, people who voluntarily take tests today would henceforth either refuse or at least try to get out of them. For another, screening programmes could dull the vigilance of people who don't belong to target groups. Although these programmes would be intended to stem the spread of the scourge, they could in fact become its instruments. 250ikeda As a basic premise, any group testing must respect the human rights of aids patients and hiv carriers. Moreover, we must be prudent and circumspect in choosing how to inform patients of their test results. The help of a psychological counsellor should be sought and all the issues connected with informed consent should be taken into consideration. 251Speaking of human rights reminds me of Dr. John Humphrey (1905-1995), whom I esteem as a great Canadian. 252bourgeault I believe he was one of the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 253ikeda Yes, he was. I met him for the first time in 1993. He not only helped draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also served for twenty years as the first director of the human rights office at the United Nations Secretariat. I remember that he felt that in building a society dedicated to human rights, education was more important and more effective than legal or organizational coercion. 254bourgeault I imagine he meant human-rights education. 255ikeda Yes. Now the whole world is calling for organizational human-rights protection to be combined with human-rights education. Dr. Humphrey said that we should make people understand the shame of violating or oppressing others' human rights. We should use education to strengthen public opinion in connection with human rights. Essentially, although the words may sound abstruse, safeguarding human rights actually means protecting human dignity and prizing each human individual, here and now. Buddhists use the term \"humiliation\" in this context. The Japanese word means both remorse for one's wrongdoing and shame at one's own misconduct toward others. I believe that developing a sense of remorse for discrimination and prejudice is basic to human-rights education. 256bourgeault I think I understand what you are saying, and I agree. I would add to your approach the positive, future-oriented aspect of responsibility. I will come back to that later. 257ikeda The aids problem requires us to hone our sense of the importance of human rights and to combat unacceptable prejudices and false images. The sacred nature of life is more than an abstract concept: it demands that we empathize with sick people and victims of social discrimination and join them in their struggle. [Dr. Lucille Teasdale](#tocfrom2n21) 258bourgeault That said, I should like, personally, to avoid all reference to the sacred nature of life. Instead, I should like to recall the tremendous admiration generated by the illness and recent death of Lucille Teasdale (1929-96), a Quebecer who, with her husband, built and directed for many years a hospital in Uganda, one of the poorest African nations. 259During a complete medical examination in 1985, hiv was detected in her blood. Knowing she was a virus carrier, she mustered her courage and went on with her humanitarian work in Central Africa. She was always on the go, collecting donations for her hospital. In passing, it should be said that she was one of the first women ever to receive an advanced degree from the University of Montreal. 260ikeda She represents a splendid flowering of the noble educational spirit of your university. Serving others is the kind of human rights struggle that protects human dignity. She risked her life to serve others. Not only the people of Uganda, but all humanity as well will long remember and praise her self-sacrifice. 261In one of the sutras, a certain Lady Shrimala makes a sacred vow to Shakyamuni Buddha to protect human rights: \"Looking upon them, I cannot forsake the lonely, the unjustly confined and deprived of freedom, sufferers of illness, sufferers of calamity, and the poor. Without fail, I will make their lives tranquil and abundant.\" 262Never forsaking the suffering but risking one's own life to save others\u2014this is true altruism. In Buddhism, we call this the Bodhisattva Way. 263bourgeault Even after contracting aids, Lucille Teasdale refused to allow people to pity her fate, remembering the many people around who, in their more painful difficulties, still needed her considerate aid. Until the very end, she was devoted to what she considered her mission. 264ikeda Through martyrdom to a truly noble cause, she triumphed over her fatal illness and made a victory of her life. 265The aids issue is likely to have a seismic effect on religious ethics and the way religions regard morality and sexuality. It is going to stimulate profound reflection on the social mission of religions and what they ought to do for aids patients and hiv carriers. The aids problem has many facets, hiv infection is deeply related to many such negative aspects of modern civilization as drug abuse, moral and ethical decline, the break-up of the family, and poverty. Religion ought to play a positive role in coping with all of these problems. It must come to head-on grips especially with the spiritual desolation caused by moral and ethical decline and drug addiction. 266bourgeault Religion can and actually does play an ambiguous role. For one thing, the Christian faiths dominant in Canada and Quebec\u2014particularly Roman Catholicism\u2014severely condemn certain sexual practices\u2014homosexuality or extramarital relations, for instance\u2014some of which are not unrelated to the risk of aids. Most of them also condemn with equal vehemence the means of avoiding or reducing that risk, particularly condoms. Religious authorities in Quebec have objected to information campaigns in schools and the media promoting condom use. 267On the other hand, various groups, some of religious persuasion, others resolutely secular, engage in helping people stricken with aids. They have created treatment centres and companion services working either in institutions or in the home. But there is still much to be done. Undeniably, solidarity and compassion are no longer strictly manifested by groups that share the same religious faith. In Quebec and throughout Canada, they transcend former frontiers between religions, as well as between believers and non-believers. [6. Cloning and the Value of Life](#tocfrom1n6) [Technological feasibility of cloning humans](#tocfrom2n22) 268ikeda Now I should like to turn to the topic of cloning. 269simard We can be certain that, in the years to come, cloning is going to be an issue of primary importance to the life sciences. 270ikeda First, Dr. Simard, just what does cloning mean? 271simard The word comes from the Greek klon or twig. Briefly, a clone is a group of molecules or cells of the same genetic structure that is descended from one common ancestor. Cloning technology, designed to produce many clones by asexual reproduction\u2014grafting or cuttings, for instance\u2014has proven very useful in animal husbandry, marine biology, and plant and fruit culture. 272ikeda Given the implications of its application to human beings, how far has cloning advanced? In February 1997, the announcement that the English Dr. Ian Wilmut (1944-) and his colleagues had succeeded for the first time in cloning a sheep from mammary cells obtained from an adult ewe became big news. - 4 It was recently revealed that Dolly is aging faster than a normal sheep. In fact, her age should e [(...)](#ftn4) 273simard \u00abJudging from Dr. Wilmut's report on the experiment, I think a human fetus produced by the method he used has a slim chance of developing normally. Dolly, the sheep clone, has now grown up, but no one knows how long she will live [4](#ftn4) or whether she will encounter special problems. We have learned recently that she is fertile, but we do not know what fate awaits her offspring. From a purely scientific standpoint, however, Dr. Wilmut's achievement was a major breakthrough. He and his colleagues claim that it is now technically possible to clone a human being. 274ikeda But, even if technically possible, is cloning human beings necessary? 275simard Some people assert that a self-clone could be kept as a kind of spare tire to be used at will for organ transplants or other ends. Since the organs themselves would be clones, the original organism would not reject them after transplantation. Research into stem cells\u2014embryonic or fetal cells that have preserved their properties of differentiation into various tissues\u2014has a similar goal. 276ikeda How revolting! This would reduce a human life to nothing more than a bank of spare parts. A mere means to an end. - 5 Aldous Huxley. Brave New World. London: Chatto and Windus Ed. 1934. 277simard Exactly. It is the kind of abominable scenario we find in Aldous Huxleys (1894-1963) Brave New World. [5](#ftn5) We must not be misled by the title, for the tale Huxley tells is of a hell of human alienation created by mass-producing human clones in a government attempt to establish a perfect social order. 278ikeda It suggests a nightmarish world devoid of freedom and human rights. 279simard Cloning humans is forbidden in Canada and the United States. Canada does not, however, regulate research on stem cells. 280bourgeault I agree with the principles behind President Clinton and unesco's opposition to human cloning. 281ikeda Article 11 of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, adopted by the General Conference of unesco (November 11, 1997), states, \"Practices which are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not be permitted.\" 282bourgeault The unesco declaration carries great weight because it represents the fruit of intensive discussions among scientists, jurists, and political planners. [Negation of human autonomy and diversity](#tocfrom2n23) 283ikeda As a Buddhist, I oppose human cloning as an act that tramples on human dignity. The Buddhist concept of human dignity is grounded on the doctrine of dependent origination (or dependent causation) and the conviction that Buddha nature is inherent in all human beings. The first refers to the interdependence of all phenomena. All beings, including humans, exist or appear through relationships with other beings or phenomena. This means people must live in mutual interdependence and mutual assistance and not seek to satisfy their own desires by sacrificing others. Human cloning treats life as a means to personal benefit. This should be condemned outright. 284bourgeault I agree entirely. Here I refer to the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), who has profoundly influenced the tradition of Western thinkers in such matters: an action is morally acceptable only if it is applicable everywhere, with anyone, including oneself. This idea tallies with the golden rule of the ancient Judeo-Christian tradition: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" 285ikeda The idea of self-reflective caring for others is a Buddhist golden rule as well. \"Do not give others what you yourself do not want\" is a universal ethic throughout Eastern thought, including Buddhism. 286bourgeault If we allow the human being to become a means or instrument to the attainment of some objective\u2014no matter what\u2014we incur the potential danger of reducing all humans to the status of resources. 287ikeda Human existence is in itself a source of dignity. Human beings must never become mere resources, because this would risk ruining what makes humanity noble. As I mentioned earlier, the Buddhist concept of human dignity also comes from the idea that Buddha nature is inherent in all human beings. Buddha nature, with its infinite potentialities and intrinsic autonomy, manifests itself in diverse forms. The cloning of human beings for reproductive purposes violates human dignity by negating human autonomy and diversity and, by extension, making a mockery of human dignity. 288bourgeault On this point, too, I am in total agreement. Biologically, human beings are created through sexual reproduction, which sets in play a whole gamut of gene combinations. The uniqueness of every individual is a result of this biological process. - 6 Fran\u00e7ois Jacob. The Logic of Life: A History of Heredity. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton Univers [(...)](#ftn6) 289In The Logic of Life, [6](#ftn6) Fran\u00e7ois Jacob clearly shows how humanity's increasing diversity results from the combination of sexuality and death: eros and thanatos. According to him, reproduction by sexual encounter permits the emergence of new living beings and teeming diversity, thanks to the play of genetic combinations. Death makes possible the continuation of that play, of that logic of renewal and diversification. 290ikeda As you say, Dr. Bourgeault, by stemming diversity, human cloning could suspend or limit human evolution. At the same time, it would raise the question of the nature and meaning of death. 291bourgeault Still, time and again in history, human beings have belied prognoses of catastrophe by surviving apparently insurmountable crises. 292ikeda I, too, am optimistic about humankind's ability to successfully deal with the technological advances that make human cloning possible. I am convinced that people will resist any impulse to diminish human dignity and flout human rights. The unesco declaration is one expression of that ability. Notes [1](#bodyftn1) The Lancet.
