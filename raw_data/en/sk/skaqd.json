We've all seen this popular buzzword thrown about! It's much trendier than a diet and promises to rid all your body's toxins following a specific program. A full-body cleanse detox can help you feel lighter, more energized and kickstart your healthy living - so what's not to love?! However, not all full-body cleanse detox diets are created equal, and some can even be bad for you. Whilst some health advocates proclaim that cleanses will rid you of heavy toxins, there's certainly [more research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jhn.12286) needed! So where do you start? Read through our guide on what detoxing is and the best detox cleanse methods to follow. We suggest some [detox cleanse drinks](/collections/juice-cleanses-kits) and what to avoid. Let us guide you through the research we've done to help you decide what's best for you! You don't want to miss this! What Is a Detox Cleanse? [Detoxes, also known as cleanses, have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. Thanks to celebrities promoting their 'quick fixes', many people detox in the hope of ridding their bodies of toxins and losing weight. Some can come in the form of full-body cleanse detox diets, whereas some target specific organs - such as the liver and kidneys.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y9kxrtpw8stkrzh/shutterstock_109561043.jpg?dl=0) So what exactly is it? A detox diet is generally a short-term dietary solution, designed to flush out toxins from your body. Usually, it involves a period of fasting and going on a clean diet. You'll often see people drinking lots of fresh yummy juices, lots of water and possibly taking supplements. Detox diets [claim](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/detox-diets-101#what-they-are) to help: - Stimulate your liver to get rid of toxins - Give your organs a break by fasting - Promote toxin elimination - Improve circulation - Give your body some well-needed nutrients. Whilst detoxing and full-body cleanse detox diets can certainly benefit from [more research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25522674/), there are plenty of options for you to choose from. After all, with all the artificial additives, pollutants, fertilizers, and heavy metals we're exposed to, sometimes a [full-body cleanse detox](/products/deep-detox-juice-cleanse-kit-14-juices) is exactly what we need! Juice Cleansing: The Best Detox cleanse (We Believe!) A [juice cleanse](/collections/juice-cleanses-kits), as you may have guessed, is a diet that involves consuming juices made purely from fruits and veggies. Depending on the cleanse you choose, [some can last from 2 days](/products/classic-2-3-day-juice-cleanse) up to a whole 2 weeks. They're typically packed with specific ingredients such as kale, parsley, and celery to aid your body and stimulate a full-body cleanse detox. Juice cleansing can help you feel rejuvenated, get extra nutrients, and shed a few extra pounds. It tastes good and makes you feel good, plus it's easy to follow. If you're not a fan of your fruit and veggies ( [like a lot of people in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1116-fruit-vegetable-consumption.html)!), this can be the best detox cleanse to help you get some extra natural nutrients. Here at Little West, all of our juices are unpasteurized and suitable for pregnant women. How? [Find out here](/blogs/posts/what-is-high-pressure-processing-hpp-and-why-is-it-better-than-pasteurization)! Why do we think juicing is the best detox cleanse? Firstly, it can be a great way to flush your system with lots of nutritional goodness. Studies [have shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15190044/) that fruit and vegetable juices can boost levels of important vitamins and antioxidants. These include nutrients such as folate, vitamin E, and beta carotene. Juicing is great for giving your body lots of nutrients, but be careful not to overdo it! Going too long without many calories, protein and fiber can do the opposite intended effect. If you're doing it for allergy purposes, doing a full body cleanse detox is great for a week. After that, you can start introducing other food groups, such as avocados, seeds, and nuts to get essential fats. Incorporating some delicious soups can also be great! Check Out - [Juice Cleanse For Beginner](/blogs/posts/beginners-guide-of-juice-cleanse) Juicing At home When it comes to a full-body cleanse detox with juicing, you can either make it at home or buy it premade. Typically, the most nutritious juices are cold-pressed, as cold-pressing preserves all of the important enzymes and nutrients. If you want to find out the difference between [cold-pressed juices](/collections/cold-pressed-juices) and normal juices, read our blog [here](/blogs/posts/what-s-the-difference-between-cold-pressed-juice-and-normal-juice)! Want to try a juice cleanse, but can't find the time? Choose our brand new favorite detox cleansing kit to get started. These drinks are more vegetable-heavy, so they're less sweet and contain less sugar. To find out more, read our blog [Introducing our new Deep Detox Cleanse Kit](/blogs/posts/introducing-our-new-deep-detox-cleanse-kit). Let's dive a little deeper: If you're brand new to juicing and want to dip your toes into the juice detox world, our [two-day juice cleanse kit](/products/classic-2-3-day-juice-cleanse) is just the thing for you. This cleanse is more 'fruit forward', meaning the juices contain more fruit than veggies. They're sweeter and help you curb solid food cravings a little easier. Feeling a little run down? Take a delve into our [immunity boost juice](/products/immunity-boost-kit) collection. With immune-boosting fruit and veg.

Composed of 12 juices, this kit is packed with anti-inflammatory ingredients such as [ginger](/products/gingersnap-apple-lemon-ginger-juice), [kale](/products/clover-kale-cucumber-pear-juice), and [turmeric](/products/sunrise-carrot-orange-ginger-juice). This kit combines the perfect selection of fruit and veg heavy juices, perfect for when you're craving something sweeter or savory. With the right combo of fruit and veg, juices can support your body in its natural ability to pass toxins. Liver Cleanses You've had a heavy night and are feeling a little worse for wear. Whilst drinking plenty of water and eating nutritional foods typically does the trick, some look for other solutions, such as detox liver cleanses. This can come in the shape of supplements, fasting, or following a strict detox plan. But is it the best detox cleanse for your body? Currently, there [isn't a lot of research](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/liver-detox#:~:text=Limit%20the%20amount%20of%20alcohol,help%20your%20body%20detox%20naturally.) on how liver cleanses can remove toxins from your body. The best way to help your liver keep doing its job is to avoid regular and excessive alcohol consumption, saturated fats, and processed foods. Supplementing your diet with healthy, nutritional foods and juices also goes a long way! Little West Tip: For natural liver cleanses, look out for ingredients such as milk thistle and turmeric. These are well-known liver cleansing supplements and are known to help with liver inflammation illnesses. Both herbs are packed with antioxidants and are said to have anti-inflammatory properties, plus they're natural! Colon Cleanses On the other end of detoxing, some methods focus on cleansing your body through bowel movements. This method typically includes taking laxatives, either natural or artificial, and foods that help clear your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Some colon cleanses also include enemas. However, these sorts of cleansing typically do [more bad than good for your body](https://e-lactancia.org/media/papers/ColonLimpieza-FamPrac2011.pdf). Not only do they get rid of beneficial bacteria in your GI tract, but they have also been documented to cause [dehydration, cramping, bloating, and nausea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19724266/). Because of this, we typically think these aren't the best detox cleanses. Fasting Fasting is one of the most ancient and spiritual methods of a full-body cleanse detox. It involves going a period of time without food, drinking solely water. Many religions follow fasting rituals, such as Lent, Ramadan, and Yom Kippur. Hindus and Buddhists fast, too. Fasting has been associated with [many health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fasting-benefits#TOC_TITLE_HDR_8). This includes blood sugar control, boosting brain function, improving blood pressure, and even helping prevent certain illnesses. Although more research needs to be done, [studies suggest](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/fasting-while-sick#why-it-may) fasting can be an effective way to get over some illnesses. However, it's suggested that fasting [isn't necessary for most people](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jhn.12286), and it's recommended that you don't do it too often. Natural Ways To Support Your Body's Detox System Your body comes equipped with its own highly efficient detoxifying mechanisms, such as the liver, kidneys, and sweat. However, there are certain things you can do to promote its effectiveness and improve your overall wellbeing. Drinking lots of water helps flush out unwanted toxins, as well as exercising, drinking less alcohol, and getting plenty of sleep. Whilst these may seem obvious, it's good to be mindful! The Key Takeaways Whilst specific full-body cleanse detox diets can be a great way to aid toxin removal, they should never be a long-term solution. Especially if they require you to cut out food! After all, a healthy diet is a balanced diet where you consume protein, fiber, fats, and calories. Going on a restricted cleanse can lead to fatigue and hunger, and you can also miss out on some important nutrients. [Detox juices](/collections/juice-cleanses-kits) and blends packed with beneficial fruit and vegetables, however, can be an excellent addition to your already healthy diet. We consider them as one of the best detox cleanses, especially when it comes to nutrient exposure. The key to health and maintaining an effective self-cleansing body is to stay fit, healthy, well-nourished, and well-rested. It's important to bear in mind that our bodies are highly effective at removing toxins on their own! Healthy eating and living habits both have a play in increasing the effectiveness of our body's detoxifying mechanisms, as does consuming plenty of delicious detox cleanse drinks through our [juice subscription](/pages/juice-subscription)!
