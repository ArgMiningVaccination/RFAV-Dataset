[React19](https://www.react19.org/) is a research-focused grassroots organization made up of patients, scientists, and physicians. React19 is working to increase understanding of the role of Covid-19 in those who experience systemic and prolonged symptoms after acute infection or after vaccination. Shaun is a Research Nurse Practitioner. He was extremely healthy until his Pfizer injection in December of 2020 that resulted in a constellation of severe adverse events. He is an integral part of React19. Brianne is a mother of two and was a healthy preschool teacher. She participated in the Astra Zeneca trial in 2020 and suffered an adverse event before being removed from the trial. She is a co-founder of React19. This is an edited segment from the weekly live General Assembly meeting on March 7, 2022. The full General Assembly Meeting is available [in our multimedia library](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/multimedia/general-assembly-meeting-march-7-2022/). This presentation is also available on [Rumble](https://rumble.com/vx2z7c-shaun-barcavage-and-brianne-dressen-about-react19.html) and [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@WorldCouncilForHealth:3/shaun-barcavage-brianne-dressen-about-React19:5). Here's what WCH members, staff, and coalition partners are saying about Shaun and Brianne's presentation: \"Such hard but important work you are doing Shaun\u2014so important to unite to become even stronger...Thank you..\" -Christof Plothe \"What amazing work Shaun and Brianne - thank you. There has to be a coordinated collective representation of the injured. All the best.\" and they're from React19 in the US, you're very warmly welcome to the World Council for Health General Assembly, you have about 10 to 15 minutes to present, and then we'll take a couple of questions. The mic is yours. Brianne Dressen: Hi, thanks for having us. Sean [00:01:00] Barcavage. I'm not sure if he is on, he's actually admitted to the hospital right now, so we'll see if he pops on. Um, so we'll see if he chimes in. Shaun Barcavage: I'm here. Brianne Dressen: Oh, you are, okay. Yeah. Sean, do you want to go first since you can? Shaun Barcavage: Sure. Sure. I'll go first. So my name is Sean Barcavage. I'm a nurse practitioner and a researcher based in New York City. And I'm also an active board member of React 19. I'm just going to speak briefly today about our methods to establish international cooperation. Uh, this sort of stemmed out of a haphazard, uh, kind of messy process, uh, where, uh, the injured are seeking the injured. Um, and like most of us, we found each other on, uh, social media platforms. And through there, we started to network around the world and share our stories and our struggle, um, myself being a vaccine injured [00:02:00] since December of 2020 in January of 2021, after two doses of one of the COVID 19 vaccines. Um, so in finding others around the world, uh, we started chatting, uh, in a group and sharing our stories and our struggles, um, finding a common ground, uh, sharing information about research, um, medical treatments. Um, that people are undergoing in different, uh, alternative non-conventional medicines that people are trying. And as, uh, we grew in the United States, um, under the umbrella of React19, we more formalized, uh, our structures and we're close to being a fully, uh, recognized nonprofit organization here. So as one of the more organized and advanced structures, um, we took it upon ourselves to reach out to all the international, [00:03:00] uh, injured that we've been talking with about ways to, uh, strengthen our collaboration and cooperation and solidify that so that we are speaking globally in a unified voice around a common mesh, um, mission message. Um, and, uh, for action. Uh, currently we had our first zoom meeting, um, and we have, uh, partners, uh, right now in Italy, Spain, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Egypt, Canada, Israel, and, uh, Japan. We're hoping through speaking to the World Council for Health, that we can also extend our network wider to find the injured in other locations, um, where it's sometimes often more difficult. Um, our first steps that we've undertaken is, uh, drafting an international declaration, uh, so that everyone who is working [00:04:00] under the same umbrella is coalesced around the same message and mission. And our really our ultimate goal is to heal the injured, which is a big undertaking and a big task and fraught with all kinds of complications. As you can imagine, as we're often dismissed or denied or labeled as misinformation or anti-vaccine, um, which none of us are because we've all taken the vaccine, obviously. Um, our primary goal beside, from, uh, our ultimate goal of helping, uh, to heal the injured is really working together. Um, in patient advocacy to conduct and encourage research, um, to on unveil treat possible treatments or therapies to get us well. Um, and to coordinate presentations of those findings more easily, um, through an international umbrella, um, we're nonpolitical, we're pro science. We're not [00:05:00] anti-vaccine in any way, but we do, uh, express our concerns about the lack of full informed consent around the vaccines and people having a choice. Um, so that is kind of the basis of what we're doing. We're in the preliminary stages of identifying our partners, trying to help strengthen their efforts in their country as we are, um, more, uh, as we strengthen ourselves here in the United States. Brianne Dressen: And thanks, Sean, if it's okay with you. Um, we, we have, uh, our current membership because as Sean introduced, we are, you know, uh, a organization 501 C3 here set up in the United States, uh, set up by the vaccine, injured for the COVID vaccine injured. Um, and our goals are very simple. We do however, have a current membership about 12,700 COVID vaccine injured [00:06:00] individuals. And if they need anything from medical support, financial support, to even just advocacy on their part, sometimes they just need a listening ear and we do have a short presentation. I'm not sure if you have those slides. There we go. So part of what we've done through React19 is we've tried to understand what's actually happening with these, um, with these individuals. Uh, and of course, you know, that starts with asking questions to the patient population. Uh, we finished up a survey with 508 patients, and now we currently are going through another data set with another 1000 patients, um, to further understand what's going on. As you can see through, um, our research, we understand that the vast majority of the individuals that are harmed are female, um, and the age is not an older population and it's generally not the youngest it's, it's, uh, people that are usually about 35 and next slide. So as far as [00:07:00] doses received, the majority get a reaction from the first dose, but we do have a few that do have their severe reaction from the second dose. And as far as the brand, the survey pool was the people here in the United States and a couple of international, but the vast majority was here in the US uh, because of that, the, the myriad of reactions was proportionate to basically the distribution of the vaccine brand, uh, here in the United States. And medical history. We wanted to see if there's any kind of pre-existing condition that may have set this off to these individuals. 71% of these individuals had no preexisting health condition, 94% of us, uh, have not had any reaction to any previous vaccine. We wanted to see if there is anything like EBV or high cholesterol, or even the MTHFR gene and all of that, um, came back as proportionate to the general population. And so we couldn't figure any pre-existing conditions so far. And as far as symptoms, timeline and the overview, the most, the vast majority of the [00:08:00] individuals had the reaction within the first, uh, two days, um, some more, you know, between two and five, but as far as, uh, those individuals that had symptoms pop up after two weeks, we really don't have very many. We went down through a list. We have a list of, um, I think it's like over a hundred symptoms, but of course, obviously the top symptoms are always fatigue, brain fog, parasthesias, dizziness, heart issues, muscle twitching, joint pain, nerve pain, um, persisting headaches. These are all things that, um, I'm sure that you guys are cognizant, cognizant of, uh, being in this space for a very long time. And we really wanted to see if there was a difference with, um, you know, who, uh, is, is getting better. If the symptoms are leveling off and in the, in the survey pool that we just finished, it does appear that about 50% of the people never had their symptoms level off. Uh, but the majority of the individuals have had a little bit of a tapering at about month three and four. But unfortunately [00:09:00] those that are having severe reactions, um, the majority of them were bed bound. At some point in those ones are much more chronic, which is unfortunate. And so of course we wanted to see, okay, is there something that, um, that will make this? So, uh, if you got rid of one symptom, what could it be? Uh, because this is something that plagues people to where we can't work, we can't eat. And for a lot of people, they can't even sleep. And as you know, uh, Sean, um, he's in the hospital today and there's no, there's no stopping a disease when it's plaguing your body. There's, you know, you can't switch it off and then just, you know, wait for later for your, you know, um, for a better day, we have to dig through the information and we have to, um, really push through this and, um, and see if we can figure this out because no matter what, we're still sick and suffering. And, um, we need this help to be, you know, to come together. Uh, as far as the, the most significant thing that people are having a problem with is the painful, like nerve pain. Head pressure, [00:10:00] brain fog, internal vibrations, and muscle twitching. Those are all really close, um, seconds and thirds. So as far as ideology goes, we've basically classified this as allergic, auto-immune and inflammatory. And allergic, you know, there's mass cells and everyone understands the, um, histamine response that's happening, um, uh, with the vaccines and people have talked about anaphylaxis, but we can also trigger a persistent allergic response with the mass cell activation syndrome. There's also something else called, um, the IgE level, which is another indicator of persistent inflammation that we've been monitoring. And it's been coming back positive and quite a few people. And auto-immunity, there's an, a fantastic lab out of Germany. It's called cell trend. And they have a full auto- auto antibody panel that we've been using. It's been very accurate, uh, high quality. And, uh, it's really helping to open the doors for individuals, with their physicians, uh, to get, you know, necessary treatments, [00:11:00] which we, you know, those doors are closed until we actually get a positive lab test and inflammation. There's cardiovascular inflammation, which, you know, many people know about because of micro clotting um, and vascular, um, inflammation. That way and also just full on thrombolytic events, but then there's also a central nervous system inflammation. So you have Ms and, and other things. Um, the German lab is cell Celltrend, C E L L T R E N D. But as we've learned through this experience, um, not any three of these syndromes are separate or exclusive to each other. They actually all play off of one another. And so for us, our job and what we've kind of figured, what we need to start doing is figuring out where on the spectrum people lie, because someone might have the vast majority of their symptoms be allergic, but they still have an auto-immunity hyper-immune or inflammation component. But lucky for us, um, a lot of these mechanisms are also at play with long COVID and there's a lot of research in [00:12:00] long COVID that, um, has already been done. And we've been able to really glean a lot of data out of, uh, the long COVID research. And so of course, you know, post COVID vaccine syndrome versus post acute sequela of COVID, we've really been able to kind of start drawing those connections. Uh, we were successful in getting a science magazine to run an article on this, and we're starting to get the conversation going in the medical community. And I think this is really crucial, crucial, next step for us to be able to make. And as far as symptomology, symptomology, as far as clinical presentation, if you go to an allergic or allergist, you're going to get a workup for MCAs. But if you have pots and immune dysfunction neuropathy, and some other symptoms, those aren't necessarily going to be addressed. So this approach for clinical care, for those that are suffering from these complex syndromes, we do need to start looking at this as a, more of a cluster, so we can kind of combine, um, this to have a whole patient approach. And so of course, we're looking through all of the [00:13:00] labs that are going to be able to help people get better, um, to kind of pave the way for testing. We have a full slide deck. Um, that's available, it's actually 37 slides long. We go in depth into the different syndromes, um, and also the possible, um, labs. There's a lot of different labs that are necessary. Um, and unfortunately it's not the standard that is being given through allopathic medicine currently. So if we're able to shift our perspective behind medical care, then we're going to be able to kind of help, uh, open the doors for these individuals to get the care that they need. And the typical access to medical care, you might just have to hit the right arrow many times. Um, but you can go to a doctor and then if you hit the arrow again. Yeah. And so that you can get a, a prescription or some hope, and whether it helps you or not, that's a different story, but at least you can get somewhere. Um, of course the vaccine injuries are denied by regulatory agencies in the media. And so we can't get that access to medical [00:14:00] care and the doctors don't believe, believe us. Um, there's no treatment information and symptoms to look for, and there's no funded research, which we were appealing with the FDA just this week to see if they could open that door, uh, for funding, for research. And so I am encouraged by, um, what we were able to, uh, discuss with them. And I'm hoping that that continues next slide. And so obviously because of this inability to get medical care, you might have to hit the right arrow many times. Um, there's a backlog of vaccine injured patients. And so this is where our organization really needs the support of our global community. Is because we, we need the support of those that do see and understand what this is. We're a grassroots, nonpolitical organization. Uh, we need physical support through position referrals and research. We need financial support for those in greatest need, and we all should need emotional support, you know, basically by growing this community, uh, that's focused on compassionate advocacy and fellowship. [00:15:00] And through the United States, if you feel so inclined, you can text 5, 0, 1, 5, 5, um, React ,the word, React to 5, 0, 1, 5, 5 to donate. And that's the last slide that we have. Dr. Tess Lawrie: Wow. Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you very much. Uh, Brianna, I think that's been just a brilliant presentation. We've learned so much watching it and just appreciate all of the consistent work it takes to be involved in data and advocacy back to your Tess for Q&A. Dr. Tess Lawrie: Yeah, I just, I'm just so amazed at how much you've done in such a short time. It's just, uh, you know, collating all that information. Um, it's really what we've been really craving wanting to see the, you know, a picture of, of, um, of what, of what's happening, of what, of what people are experiencing. And, uh, and you've done the work. Are you going to be able to, uh, are you going to try and publish it?[00:16:00] And if so, where? Brianne Dressen: Um, I think we would love to publish, yes, we would love to publish a, it's just a matter of finding, you know, um, the right people to kind of help make that happen. We have this data set and then we also have another data set that we're putting together. Now that's kind of like the times two for this, um, this. This data set currently that we presented actually is on the desks at the FDA and the NIH, and they ask them subsequent questions. Uh, but of course, if we provide the answers, they may or may not listen. So I do think that it needs to get into the literature. Yeah. Dr. Tess Lawrie: Yeah. There might be, um, people in our science and medical committee who could support you in that. So please do we must connect you up somehow. Um, the other thing I wanted to say, what was striking and what really confirmed what I had found on a UK yellow card reporting system was the high number of, amount of pain. You know, um, pain seems to be such a [00:17:00] common symptom. And way back in, in, in may last year, when I was looking at the UK yellow cloud system, it struck me just how much pain and suffering that is, uh, being experienced by people after, you know, suffering from Jab injuries. So, um, I think, um, you know, when I think of all those people experiencing pain every day, you know, and as you say, many, a symptom of their symptoms have not cleared up. Um, I feel enormously, uh, sorry. And I just hope that we can, um, help and find solutions to at the very least mitigate the pain, um, and, and suffering. Uh, um, and I just heard from, from one of my colleagues that we will help you, uh, with your, with your work and your papers. And get to get into a journal and get it published. Um, so yeah, we will definitely connect with that. I just wanted to see what other questions are in the chat because I have, um, been, uh, [00:18:00] taking up all the time. Um, so there's a question from Christophe Plothe, did you establish blood parameters to associate with the vaccine? Brianne Dressen: We're working on it. They're actually, there's a couple of different blood panels. Um, that should be published in the next couple of weeks by other independent organizations. Um, that kind of identify like a bio-signature that specific for the COVID vaccine reactions. Uh, so that is going to be forthcoming in the next couple of weeks. Dr. Tess Lawrie: Okay. Um, uh, and then there was a question from Karen EG. I hear that you talk about healing, the injured and vaxx choice. Do you also talk about the harm as a means of ensuring that I was, do not partake in the, um, biomedical experiment, meaning it's not a vaccine. Brianne Dressen: Right. Yeah, we do. Uh, we do make sure that our number one priority as people that are sick and our energy is incredibly limited as you know, because pain [00:19:00] actually, it takes a lot of energy to be in pain all the time. Uh, so our number one focus is to make sure that we are advocating for those that are currently harmed. And then in addition to that, we have been, uh, spreading awareness through podcasts, um, through news articles, uh, social media, we have a whole, um, arena of awareness, but because we are sick, um, it has been extremely challenging for us to, uh, make sure that we are using our time in a way that's going to benefit us as well as benefit the world through sharing our stories. But we have been actively, you know, trying to get the word out, yeah. Dr. Tess Lawrie: Well you're doing an amazing job and there's just so much, so, so much appreciation for you in the chat. Um, and, uh, and, uh, you know, we will support you at World Council for Health in, in any way we can. Brianne Dressen: Thank you so much. We appreciate it. Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you very much, uh, Tess and of course, also to Sean and [00:20:00] Brianne for that amazing work. "}
