If an application is ineligible for expedited credentialing, it must go to the full Board for app roval. C. Leave of Absence A member of the medical staff or privileged AHP may request a leave of absence by submitting a written request to the Medical Staff Services. Except in extraordinary circumstances, this request will be submitted at least 30 days prior to the anticipated start of the leave, unless the leave is precipitated by urgent circumstances, in order to ensure adequate coverage of clinical and/or administrative acti vities. The request must state the beginning and ending dates of the leave, which shall not exceed one year, and the reasons for the leave. Except for uncomplicated family medical leaves, members of the medical staff and privileged AHP must report to the Medical Staff Services any time they are away from patient care responsibilities for longer than 30 days for reasons related to their physical or mental health or related matter that would affect their ability to care for 26 4816 -2392 -3064v.16 0038180 -000519 patients safely and competently. Under such circumstances, the Chief of Staff, in consultation with the Department Chief, may trigger an automatic medical leave of absence. The Medical Staff Services will forward any request for leave of absence to the Department Chief and Chief of Staff who will determine whether a request for a leave of absence shall be granted. Granting of leave of absence shall be forwarded to the Credentials Committee and Medical Executive Committee as informational. During the leave of absence, the individual shall not exercise any clinical privileges. In addition, the individual shall be excused from all Medical Staff responsibilities (e.g., meeting attendance, committee service, emergency service call obligations) during this period. Individuals requesting reinst atement shall submit a written summary of their professional activities during the leave, and any other information that may be requested by the Hospital. Requests for reinstatement shall then be reviewed by the Department Chief, Chair of the Credentials Committee, and the Chief of Staff. If it is a consensus of these individuals to recommend favorably on reinstatement, the Medical Staff member may immediately resume clinical practice at the Hospital. This determination shall then be forwarded to the Cre dentials Committee and the Medical Executive Committee for ratification. If, however, any of the individuals reviewing the request have any questions or concerns, those questions shall be noted and the reinstatement request shall be forwarded to the full Credentials Committee and Medical Executive Committee for review and recommendation. If a request for reinstatement is not granted, for reasons related to clinical competence or professional conduct, the individual shall be entitled to request a hearing a nd appeal. If the leave of absence was for health reasons (except for uncomplicated family medical leave), the request for reinstatement must be accompanied by a report from the individual's physician indicating that the individual is physically and/or mentally capable of resuming clinical practice and safely exercising the clinical privileges requested. Absence for longer than one year shall result in automatic relinquishment of Medical Staff appointment and clinical privileges unless extension is granted by the Chief of Staff in consultation with the Department Chief. Extensions shall be considered only in extraordinary cases where the extension of a leave is in the best interest of the Hospital. If an individual's current appointment is due to expire dur ing the leave, the individual must apply for reappointment, or appointment and clinical privileges shall lapse at the end of the appointment period. 27 4816 -2392 -3064v.16 0038180 -000519 Failure to request reinstatement from a leave of absence in a timely manner shall be deemed a voluntary res ignation of Medical Staff appointment and clinical privileges. In the event it is determined that an individual has not demonstrated good cause for a leave, or where a request for extension is not granted, the determination shall be final, with no recourse to a hearing and appeal. D. Matters Governed by Employment Agreement or Other Express Written Contract These Bylaws apply specifically to a Practitioner's membership on the Medical Staff, and do not govern the Practitioner's employment or contractual relatio nship with the Hospital or any other entity. A Practitioner's employment or independent contractor agreement with the Hospital may, by its terms, indicate that such agreement shall supersede these Bylaws, and that an administrative relinquishment of member ship and/or Clinical Privileges will take place when the contract or agreement ends. In such a case , the termination of membership and/or Clinical Privileges shall not entitle the Practitioner to the Hearing and Review procedures set forth in Appendix 1 t o these Bylaws, unless such hearing or review is required by law or regulation. XI. CORRECTIVE ACTION A. Pre-Corrective Action Measures In some circumstances, appropriate measures may be taken prior to corrective action including, without limitation, collegial intervention, focused or routine monitoring and education, referral for specific education or evaluation, implementation of a behavioral agreement, and/or a letter of instruction, admonition, or warning, in accordance with these Bylaws and the Medical Staf f Rules. B. Investigations 1. Criteria for Initiation; Initiation . A request for an investigation may be submitted to the Medical Executive Committee by the Chief of Staff, any Department Chief, a standing committee of the Medical Staff, the Hospital President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President, the Chief Clinical Officer, the Chief Medical Officer or the Board whenever a Practitioner allegedly has engaged in conduct that is, or is reasonably likely to be: (a) detrimental to the quality o f healthcare , patient safety or to the professional standards of the Hospital Medical Staff; (b) disruptive to Hospital operations; (c) inconsistent with the professional standards of the Hospital Medical Staff; (d) unethical or in violation of any state o r federal law, regulation, or billing guidelines; (e) in violation of any state or federal law or regulation relating to the confidentiality and privacy of healthcare information; or (f) in violation of Medical Staff Bylaws, Medical Staff 28 4816 -2392 -3064v.16 0038180 -000519 Rules, or polici es and procedures of the Hospital and its Medical Staff. All requests for investigation shall be in writing, submitted to the Medical Executive Committee, and supported by reference to the specific activities or conduct that constitute the grounds or reaso n for the request. If the Medical Executive Committee initiates the request, it shall make an appropriate recordation of the reasons. 2. Consideration by MEC . Upon receiving a request for investigation, the Medical Executive Committee shall meet as soon as practicable to consider the matter and may, in its discretion, take such action as it deems appropriate including, without limitation, any one or a combination of the following actions: a.

Summarily suspend all or part of the Practitioner's Clinical Privileges. d. Determine that the allegations are sufficiently explained, no further investigation is needed, and take action as set forth at Section X.B.7. 3. If the Medical Executive Committee concludes an investigation is warranted, it shall direct an investigation to be undertaken. The Medical Executive Committee may conduct the investigation itself or may assign the task to an appropriate Medical Staff officer or standing or ad hoc investigating committee of the Medical Staff. In the event the Board believes the Medical Executive Committee has incorrectly determined that an inve stigation is unnecessary, it may direct the Medical Executive Committee to proceed with an investigation. 4. Ad hoc Investigating Committee . If the investigation is assigned to an ad hoc investigating committee, such committee shall consist of at least three (3) members of the Department(s) to which the involved Practitioner(s) is/are assigned. One or more non -physician members of the committee also may be appointed, as appropriate. The Medical Staff officers shall appoint the ad hoc investigating committ ee, and may consult with the Chief of the relevant Department(s) in making such appointments. 5. Investigation . The Practitioner shall be notified within three (3) working days of the Medical Executive Committee's decision and that the investigation is bei ng conducted, and shall be given an opportunity to provide information in the manner determined by the Medical Staff officer or ad hoc investigating committee conducting the investigation. The investigation may, but is not required to, include one or more conferences with the Practitioner to ascertain the pertinent facts relevant to the request 29 4816 -2392 -3064v.16 0038180 -000519 and/or to discuss possible disposition of the matter. Such conferences between the Practitioner and the person or committee conducting the investigation, and the int erview(s) of any other individual by such person or committee, shall not constitute a formal proceeding as described in the Hearing and Review Procedures set forth in Appendix 1 to these Bylaws, and shall not be subject to the procedural rules set forth th erein. Accordingly, the Practitioner may not have counsel in attendance at such a conference without consent of the Chief of Staff. 6. Investigative Report . The person or committee conducting the investigation shall provide a signed, written report of its f indings to the Medical Executive Committee within forty -five (45) working days of the Medical Executive Committee's decision to conduct an investigation. Such a report shall include a description of the process that was followed, the pertinent facts ascer tained, any conclusions drawn, and a recommended disposition of the matter. If the person or committee has reached any consensus with the affected Practitioner as to a satisfactory result, such potential resolution should be described. 7. Medical Executive Committee Action . As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the investigation, the Medical Executive Committee shall take action, which may include, without limitation: a. Determining no corrective action will be taken and, if the Medical Executive Comm ittee determines there was no credible evidence for the complaint in the first instance, removing any adverse information from the Practitioner's file. b. Deferring action for a reasonable time where circumstances warrant. c. Issuing letters of admonition, censu re, reprimand or warning, or directing the Practitioner's Department Chief to do so, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the appropriate physician leadership from issuing informal written or oral warnings outside of the mechanism for c orrective action. In the event a formal letter is issued, the affected Practitioner may make a written response which shall be placed in the Practitioner's file. d. Summarily suspending all or part of the Practitioner's Clinical Privileges as set forth below . e. Recommending the imposition of terms of probation or special limitation upon continued Medical Staff membership or exercise of Clinical Privileges, including, without limitation, requirements for co-admission, mandatory consultation, or monitoring. f.

Recommending reductions of membership status or limitation of any prerogatives directly related to the Practitioner's delivery of patient care. h. Recommending suspension, revoc ation or probation of Medical Staff membership. i. Taking other actions deemed appropriate under the circumstances. 8. Subsequent Action . If corrective action constituting an Adverse Recommendation, as defined in the Hearing and Review Procedures set forth in Appendix 1 to these Bylaws, is taken or recommended against a Physician or Dentist, such individual may request a hearing review as provided therein. The affected Practitioners may not request a review of the recommended disposition by the person or commi ttee conducting the investigation, but only the Adverse Recommendation made by the Medical Executive Committee. 9. No Investigation Required . Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to require that an investigation be conducted before the Medical Executive Committee may take or recommend a corrective action constituting an Adverse Recommendation, or to otherwise limit the authority of the Medical Executive Committee, Chief of Staff or Medical Staff Officers or Department Chiefs to perform their duties as set forth herein and in the Medical Staff Rules. C. Summary Suspension, Reduction, or Restriction of Clinical Privileges; Further Action 1. Imposition; Notice . Whenever a Practitioner's conduct appears to require that immediate action be taken to protect the life or well -being of any individual, or to reduce a substantial and imminent likelihood of significant impairment of the life, health or safety of any individual, then the Chief of Staff, the Medical Executive Committee, any Department Chief, the Chief Clinica l Officer, the Hospital President, or the Board may summarily suspend, reduce, or restrict the Practitioner's Clinical Privileges (collectively, a \"summary suspension\"). Unless otherwise stated, such an action shall become effective immediately upon imposi tion, and the person or body responsible shall promptly give written notice to the Medical Executive Committee, the Chief of Staff, and the Hospital President. The Hospital President or their designee shall inform the Admitting Office, the Medical Staff O ffice, and other pertinent service areas of any such summary suspension as soon as reasonably possible. In addition, within one (1) working day of imposition of the summary suspension, the affected Practitioner shall be provided with a written notice of t he action that: (a) includes sufficient information to demonstrate the necessity of the summary suspension; (b) informs the Practitioner of the right to an informal interview 31 4816 -2392 -3064v.16 0038180 -000519 upon a written request for such an interview; and (c) if applicable, indicates that the suspension could become reportable to the national Practitioner Data Bank. 2. At any time, the summary suspension may be revoked by the same individual or body that initially imposed it upon a determination that the suspension is no longer needed to pr otect the best interests or safety of any individual. 3. If not first revoked, the summary suspension shall be reviewed by the Medical Executive Committee within fifteen (15) working days. If the Practitioner requests an interview, he or she shall be afford ed an opportunity to appear and be heard. Any such interview shall be informal and not in the nature of a hearing, and the Practitioner may not have counsel present without the consent of the Chief of Staff. After duly considering the matter, the Medical Executive Committee may, without limitation: (a) recommend that the summary suspension be modified, continued, or terminated; (b) initiate an investigation under Section X.B; and/or (c) take action in accordance with Section X.B.7. 4. If the Medical Executiv e Committee does not revoke the summary suspension following this review, the affected Practitioner may request a hearing in accordance with the Hearing and Review Procedures set forth in Appendix 1 to these Bylaws.

Should the Physician, Dentist or Podia trist involved elect not to be represented by an attorney at the hearing, the Medical Executive Committee shall also not be represented by an attorney at the hearing. Nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed to deprive either party of the right to advice of legal counsel in connection with preparation for the hearing. 6. In consultation with the Chair of the Hearing Committee, the Hearing Officer may recess and reconvene the hearing at such time and intervals as may be reasonable and warranted, with due consi deration for the importance of reaching an expeditious conclusion.

If the Physician, Dentist or Podiatrist is unable to rebut the Medical Executive Committee's case in this manner, the Hearing Committee shall find in favor of the Medical Executive Committee. 8. After the evidentiary presentations have been completed and any closing written statements have been submitted, the hearing shall be concluded. 9.

Whenever an appellate review is requested, the Board of Directors may sit as the Appeal Board or the Chair of the Board may appoint an Appeal Board which will be composed of at least three (3) members of the Board of Directors. Knowledge of the matter involved will not preclude any person from serving as a member of the Appeal Board, so long as that person did not take part in a prior hearing on the same matter. APP-9 4816 -2392 -3064v.16 0038180 -000519 5. Appeal Procedure . The proceedings on appeal will be based upon the Hearing Committee record. When requested by either party, the Appeal Board may, in its discretion, accept additional oral or written evidence subject to the same rights of cross -examinatio n provided at the Hearing Panel proceedings.

Each party will have the right to present a written statement in support of its position on appeal. The party requesting the appeal will submit a statement first and the other party will then have ten (10) working days to respond. In its sole discretion, the Appeal Board may allow each party or its representative to appear personally and make oral argument not to exceed thirty (30) minutes. 6. At the conclusion of oral argument, if allowed, the Appeal Board will conduct, at a time conv enient to itself, deliberations outside the presence of the appellant and respondent and their representatives.

The Board may review any informat ion that it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the findings and recommendations of the Medical Executive Committee, Hearing Committee, and Appeal Board (if applicable). 3. Consistent with its ultimate legal authority for the operation of the Hospi tal and the quality of care provided, the Board may adopt, modify, or reverse any recommendation that it receives or refer the matter for further review. 4.
