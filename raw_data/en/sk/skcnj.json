The combination of 400 mg of dietary riboflavin supplements, along with 15-30 minutes of walking briskly (increases oxygenation of the cornea) facing toward the sun between 10 am and 2pm, has shown equivalent results to commercial AVEDRO cornea cross-linking in multiple patients who were suffering from keratoconus [ [1](https://www.scientificarchives.com/article/mega-dose-dietary-riboflavin-in-treatment-in-keratoconus-post-refractive-cornea-ectasia-and-migraine-has-its-time-arrived#1)]. This treatment appears equally effective compared with the more expensive traditional commercial cornea crosslinking but requires a 3 to 6 month course of treatment - as opposed to the immediate results of Avedro crosslinking [ [2](https://www.scientificarchives.com/article/mega-dose-dietary-riboflavin-in-treatment-in-keratoconus-post-refractive-cornea-ectasia-and-migraine-has-its-time-arrived#2)]. We also recommend the same treatment as adjunctive therapy for younger patients and pregnant women who are prone to regression after commercial Avedro cornea cross-linking. We discovered the migraine curing side effect of our cornea treatment protocol when patients taking 400 mg of dietary riboflavin for keratoconus began to report that they no longer suffered from migraine symptoms during their 3 month cornea follow up appointments. Now with over 100 study patients noting relief, if not a cure for their migraine headaches, we have adopted this new form of therapy as a treatment option for all our ophthalmic and classic migraine patients. Because of the success in some locations, Riboflavin capsules have been impossible to find over the counter in any pharmacies and patients must order from suppliers such as Nutricost.com where a 120 day supply that is gluten and GMO free can be purchased or from Walmart, Bestville, Nature's Way, Integrated Therapeutics and others at a cost of $2.75 to $5.00 per month. Whilst both keratoconus and migraine have often been unresponsive to prior traditional medical therapies and are often intractable, it is encouraging to find an inexpensive alternative or adjunctive therapy that with further studies may confirm successful relief and improve the lives of our patients with few side effects.
