Naturopathic cleanse and detox programs can help our bodies eliminate potentially harmful chemicals. At Oasis Hormone Therapy and Wellness Center in San Diego, we offer the VegeCleanse Plus Detox Program from Designs for Health. Many people are familiar with metabolic detoxification programs, but there is a lot of conflicting information and myths about them. Our California-licensed Naturopathic Doctors are committed to providing patients with a safe and effective natural detox experience. Why Cleanse and Detox? We are exposed to numerous chemicals in today's environment. Some have been around for centuries, such as smoke from cooking fires. But industrialization since the 1700s has dramatically changed the type of chemicals we are exposed to.1 Chemicals are present in the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe.1 Our bodies today must process gasoline fumes, pesticides, herbicides, cigarette smoke, dry cleaning fluids, heavy metals such as lead and mercury, and much more.1 The liver is the centerpiece of our body's built-in system for processing toxins. But the liver can only do so much. Living in a more polluted world can overburden and strain our body's natural detoxification system.2 Our increasingly toxic environment can result in negative health effects. According to the World Health Organizations, there are many examples of disease outbreaks that are caused by exposure to chemicals or toxins.3 Health conditions linked to environmental toxins include cancer, asthma, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and obesity.4 Who Should Detox? You may want to cleanse and detox if you are concerned about your ongoing exposure to environmental chemicals. Signs and symptoms that your body may be having trouble detoxifying on its own include:2 - Sleep disruption, fatigue and lack of energy - Mood disturbances such as depression and anxiety - Muscle aches and joint pain - Sinus congestion and postnasal drip - Irritable bowel symptoms and digestive discomfort - Heartburn and persistent illnesses - Fluid retention and feeling bloated Benefits of Detoxification A good cleanse and detox program is intended to enhance your body's natural metabolic detoxification process while providing enough fuel for your other daily activities as well, supporting your energy metabolism and overall well-being. The VegeCleanse Plus Detox Program by Designs for Health is a detox program based on researched protocols with actual human subjects. Some research studies on these protocols have been published in the scientific literature. If you think that a detox might be right for you, there's a way to do it correctly and to ensure you are safely achieving the results you are looking for. Cautions about Detoxification Cleansing and detox is not for everyone. Our doctors will not recommend a detox program for you if you are pregnant, undergoing cancer treatment, or have certain health conditions. If you have concerns about completing a detox program, please check with your primary care or schedule an appointment with one of our doctors for a full health assessment and customized treatment plan. Keep in mind that even an appropriate detox may cause some changes in your body that could lead to subtle symptoms, such as feeling tiredness or discomfort from caffeine withdrawal. Our doctors have expertise in monitoring patients during detox to help protect health and well-being throughout. Although research is ongoing, conclusive scientific data supporting detoxification therapies are largely lacking. In general, experts advise avoiding extreme programs in favor of reasonable and safe approaches.2 How to Evaluate a Metabolic Detox Program Not all detox programs are equal. Some may not be properly and scientifically formulated to provide the right nutrition for your body's metabolic detoxification pathways. Some may even be unhealthy and could lead to negative symptoms. One of the myths of a cleanse and detox program is that it must include a strict fasting regimen that will starve your body. However, proper detox is just the opposite, because specific nutrients are needed for your body to effectively eliminate toxins. You may wonder how a detox program compares to a juice cleanse. A juice cleanse can be likened to a cleanup with a paper towel. It can give a good surface cleaning but if you want a deep cleaning, you need more. To get a deep level of health during a metabolic detox, your body needs more energy. So when evaluating a detox program, it's important to consider whether it provides the important macronutrients (quality protein and carbohydrates) plus specific micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to provide targeted nutritional support. Our doctors have evaluated a number of different detox programs for our La Jolla and San Diego area patients and have chosen to offer the Plus Detox Program for Designs for Health. VegeCleanse Plus is a targeted, science-based method to help facilitate the removal of undesirable compounds from the body by enhancing its natural metabolic detoxification process while supporting energy metabolism.
