Our mission is to always find and treat the cause in a safe, sustainable, and empowering way. The vast majority of doctors will affirm that Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease, but they are far from the truth. The reason why a lot of patients experience this progression is that most doctors do not focus on treating the CAUSE of the disease, which is insulin resistance, but they only treat the blood sugar, which is a SYMPTOM of the disease. As part of our holistic approach here in Wenatchee we want to help you to decrease/discontinue your medications and reverse your diabetes by treating the CAUSE of the disease. Using the most updated research and evidence-based medicine. An autoimmune disease is a condition in which your immune system mistakes part of your body, like your joints or skin, as foreign. It releases proteins called autoantibodies that attack healthy cells causing inflammation. Some autoimmune diseases target only one organ. Type 1 diabetes damages the pancreas. Other diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), affect the whole body. Common treatment plans focus on decreasing the symptoms of the disease, but rarely address the question of why the disease began in the first place. If we want to treat and reverse the disease, we must treat the cause. Experts in mucosal biology now believe that intestinal permeability, besides of genetic and environmental factors, is a precondition to developing autoimmunity. This means that the cause of the autoimmune disease is likely not be treated if you are not treating the gut. Without treating the cause, the disease will continue to be chronic and progressive in nature. Conditions we treat: - Inflammatory Bowel Disease - Hypo/hyperthyroidism - Hashimoto's Thyroiditis - Multiple Sclerosis - Psoriasis - Eczema - Rheumatoid Arthritis - Fibromyalgia - and more We know how hard it is to make changes in our daily life, like eat healthy, exercise more, reduce stress.

There are 3 different subtypes of Alzheimer's, and by differentiating between them, we have a way to address and treat the cause of the disease. Genetic testing is also available to determine if you are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's in the future. If you are a carrier of the ApoE4 gene, you may have a 30-50% chance of developing Alzheimer's in your 50's. Due to Alzheimer's and cognitive impairment, timing is important.
