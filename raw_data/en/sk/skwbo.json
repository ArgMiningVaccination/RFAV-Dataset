However, antigens contained in the vaccines do not always match circulating strains. In the present work we aimed to examine the vaccine efficacy (VE) afforded by influenza vaccines when they are not well matched to circulating strains. Methods: We identified randomized clinical trials (RCTs) through MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and references of included RCTs. RCTs reporting laboratory-confirmed influenza among healthy participants vaccinated with antigens of matching and non-matching influenza strains were included. Two independent reviewers screened citations/full-text articles, abstracted data, and appraised risk of bias. Conflicts were resolved by discussion. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted. VE was calculated using the following formula: (1 - relative risk \u00d7 100%). Results: We included 34 RCTs, providing data on 47 influenza seasons and 94,821 participants. The live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) showed significant protection against mismatched (six RCTs, VE 54%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 28% to RCTs, VE 83%, 95% CI 75% to 88%) influenza strains among children aged 6 to 36 months. Differences were observed between the point estimates for mismatched influenza A (five RCTs, VE 75%, 95% CI 41% to 90%) and RCTs, VE 42%, 95% CI 22% to 56%) estimates among children aged 6 to 36 months. The trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) also afforded significant protection against mismatched (nine RCTs, VE 52%, 95% CI 37% to 65%, 95% CI 54% to 73%) influenza strains among adults. Numerical differences were observed between the point estimates for mismatched influenza A (five RCTs, VE 64%, 95% CI 23% to 82%) and RCTs, VE 52%, 95% CI 19% to 72%) estimates among adults. Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2<50%) across all meta-analyses, except for (I2= 79%). Conclusions: The TIV and LAIV vaccines can provide cross protection against non-matching circulating strains. The point estimates for VE were different for matching versus non-matching strains, with overlapping CIs.

BMC Medicine 2013, 11:153 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/153Background Influenza is a major public health threat. It is widely ac- cepted that an annual influenza vaccination is the mosteffective way to prevent influenza [1]. Among adults, for example, the inactivated influenza vaccine was reported to have a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 59% (95% confidenceinterval (CI) 51 to 67) [2]. Recommendations for influenza vaccine composition currently include two type A influenza strains (A-H3N2and A-H1N1) and one type B influenza strain, which are updated annually. Strains are selected by scientists con- vened by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3] inthe months before the next epidemic season is expec- ted. This procedure includes consideration of antigenic mismatch between vaccine strains and actual epidemicstrains. Although it is accepted that matched strains provide the best protection, data on the protective efficacy of un-matched strains, or cross protection, are sparse. These data are of particular importance, given that influenza B vaccine strains did not match circulating strains in sixinfluenza seasons between 2000 and 2011 in the USA [4]. Mismatched seasons may lead to reduced uptake of influenza vaccination, reduced VE, and more severe in-fluenza epidemics. Therefore, estimating prevention that can be achieved during mismatched influenza seasons is of prime public health importance. This informationcannot be gleaned from previous reviews on the efficacy of the influenza vaccines because they did not specific- ally examine vaccine efficacy for mismatched seasons[5-7]. As such, in the present work we aimed to deter- mine the cross protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza through vaccination. Methods Protocol The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement was used to guide the reporting and conduct of this review [8]. A systematicreview protocol was compiled and circulated to experts in influenza, systematic reviews, and statistics. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO, an international registryfor systematic reviews (CRD42012001926) and published in an open-access journal [9]. Eligibility criteria Studies reporting the incidence of influenza infection after vaccination among healthy individuals were included.The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory- confirmed influenza verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral culture. The secondary outcome was the in-cidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza verified by at least a fourfold rise in hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) an- tibody titers at the end assay) or serologic assay in combin- ation with detection method (for example, viral culture or PCR). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) andquasi-RCTs (that is, use of non-random methods to allo- cate patients to the treatment and control groups, such as consecutive enrolment or the last digit of a health cardnumber) comparing any influenza vaccine versus placebo and disseminated in the English language were included. Study selection process The eligibility criteria were pilot tested on a random sample of 50 citations and clarified, as needed. Tworeviewers subsequently screened titles and abstracts (citations) from the literature search in duplicate. Conflicts were resolved through team discussion. A similar processwas followed for screening potentially relevant full-text ar- ticles identified through citation screening. Information sources and search The full search strategy is reported elsewhere [9]. Briefly, RCTs were identified by searching three Cochrane re-views on influenza vaccines [5-7], MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, meta - Register (a clinical trials registry), and the references ofincluded trials. The literature searches were conducted by an experienced librarian on 31 January 2012. Data items and collection process The data abstracted included study characteristics, par- ticipant characteristics, and number of influenza casesper treatment group, confirmed by viral culture, PCR or serologic assay. A data abstraction form was developed and pilot tested. Two reviewers subsequently abstractedall of the data in duplicate. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Trial authors were contacted for data clar- ifications and additional unpublished data was receivedfrom six included published RCTs [10-15]. Risk of bias appraisal The Cochrane Risk of Bias seven-item tool was used to appraise the likelihood that the RCT results were af- fected by bias [16]. For the selective outcome reportingcriterion, trial protocols were obtained and the outcomes reported in the protocol were compared to those repor- ted in the final trial publication. For the other sourcesof bias criterion, industry-funded RCTs were scored as 'unclear ', due to the potential for funding bias [17]. Methodological issues We also assessed other methodological issues identified a priori that are related to influenza and may have influenced the RCT results. These included case defini- tions used by health care workers to identify influenza- like illness (ILI), use of a surveillance system to monitorTricco et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:153 Page 2 of 19 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/153influenza cases, and randomization scheme across mul- tisite trials. Case definition of influenza-like illness was defined according to the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC) as fever >37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) with cough and/or sore throat [18]. Surveillance system was defined as a system to track ILI in the population andconsisted of health care workers contacting participants to monitor ILI symptoms. Randomization scheme re- ferred to the consistent use of an allocation scheduleacross trial study sites for multisite trials. Characterization of matched or mismatched vaccine strains The process of characterizing matched versus mismat- ched strains was determined a priori and involved the two steps outlined below. Step 1 Viral strains from influenza cases in the included RCTs were characterized through HI assays using vaccinestrains as the reference. Influenza A strains from infec- ted trial participants were matched with the strain in the vaccine if they belonged to the same A subtype (that is,H1N1 or H3N2) and were antigenically similar in the HI assay (that is, if they showed sufficient crossreaction in a HI chessboard table using ferret antisera; for example,with a HI typing quotient <fourfold titer). Influenza A viral strains were considered mismatched by antigenic drift if they were antigenically distinct from influenza Astrains contained in the vaccine as per HI typing (for example, HI titer quotient fourfold) or the characte- rization did not belong to a similar influenza A subtypecontained in the vaccine (for example, H1N1 strains cir- culating but only H3N2 strains contained in the vaccine for bivalent vaccines with one H subtype). For influenza B, the epidemiological situation is more complex. In recent years, there have been two coexisting phylogenetic influenza B lineages: B/Victoria and B/Yamagata [19,20]. Influenza B strains from infected trial participants were considered matched if the strain belonged to the same lineage and were antigenicallysimilar to the vaccine strain as per HI typing (for ex- ample, HI typing quotient <fourfold titer). For influenza B mismatches, two different forms were considered.Mismatch by antigenic drift refers to strains of the same lineage that were antigenically distinct from influenza B strains contained in the vaccine as per HI typing (for ex-ample, HI quotient fourfold titer), whereas mismatch by lineage refers to influenza B strains of different line- ages. Whenever the influenza B lineage was not pre-sented in the trial report, categorization was based on the influenza phylogenetic tree and verified by influenza experts on the team.Step 2 When antigenic characterization of viral strains of infec-ted participants was not reported, data from surveillancesystems were used to determine circulating strains that occurred during the time and location of the trial conduct. These included WHO weekly epidemiological records,Mortality and Morbidity R eports Weekly (MMRW), Chinese National Influenza Center, and CDC influenza summary reports. These data were sometimes capturedthrough correspondence with trial authors. Synthesis of included studies The relative risk (RR) was calculated for the number of influenza cases per treatment group for included RCTs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived basedon a normal approximation. Meta-analysis was conduc- ted using a random effects model [21] for the live at- tenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV), trivalent inactivatedvaccines (TIV), and other vaccines, separately. A post hocsensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine the influence of categorizing the vaccines as being eitheran inactivated influenza vaccine or a live influenza vaccine. VE was derived based on pooled RRs using the following formula: (1 - RR) \u00d7 100%. Only influenza in-fections due to mismatched strains were included in the mismatched analysis, while only influenza infections due to matched strains were included in the matchedanalysis. To assess for clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we examined the forest plots from the meta-analysis. Thesimilarity between studies regarding participant and study characteristics was considered and subgroup analysis was conducted. Subgroup analyses determined a priori in- cluded age group (children <18 years of age, adults 18 years of age, older patients 65 years of age) and type of influenza (A versus B). Statistical heterogeneity was exa-mined using the I 2statistic [22]. Funnel plots were per- formed to identify potential publication bias [23]. All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Inc.,Cary, NC, USA). Results Literature search The literature search resulted in a total of 1,356 cita-tions, of which 308 were deemed potentially relevant(Figure 1). Reasons for exclusion at the full-text level of screening included not laboratory-confirmed influenza (108/273), no comparison to placebo (82/273), not aRCT (68/273), not a healthy population (11/273), not vaccinated against influenza A or B (3/273), and not disseminated in English (1/273). A total of 34 trials ful-filled the inclusion criteria [10-15,24-51] plus 1 com- panion report [52], which was used for supplementary data only (hence a total of 35 RCTs). In all, 32 RCTsTricco et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:153 Page 3 of 19 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/153[10-15,25-27,29-51] and 2 quasi-RCTs [24,28] provided data on 47 influenza seasons including 94,821 healthy participants. Trial characteristics The trials were conducted between 1970 and 2009 (Table 1) in North America (22/34), Europe (3/34), Australia (1/34), Asia (3/34), and a mixture of multisite trials in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, and South Africa (4/34; Additional file 1). A total of 11 trials examined the TIV versus placebo [15,28,30,34,38, 39,44-46,49,50], 7 examined the LAIV versus placebo [10,35,37,40-43] and 6 examined both TIV and LAIV vaccines versus placebo [11,13,14,31,36,47]. Other vac- cine types were trivalent re- combinant HI protein vaccine [48]. One RCT examined both a TIV and bivalent vaccine compared to placebo [32]. In all, 22 RCTs (including information on 34 influenza seasons) provided data on matched influenza strains [10,11,13-15,24,29,31,35,37,39-43,45-51], while 20 RCTs (including data from 33 influenza seasons) provided data on mismatched influenza strains [10-15,26,29,31,37, 40-47,49,50] (Table 1). Influenza infection was confir- med by culture in 20 RCTs [10-12,15,24,26,29,31,35, 37,39-48], PCR in 3 RCTs RCTs included serologic assays to determine influenza infection; these were included in the secondary analysis only [25,27,28,30,32-34,36,38].Participant characteristics The RCTs included data on a total of 94,821 participants (Table 2). A total of 13 of the RCTs were conducted among children [10,25,30,32,35,37,39-43,49,50], and 2 were conducted among seniors [33,36]. One RCT in- cluded children (15%) and adults (85%) [31], and another included adults and seniors [51]; the remaining RCTs were conducted among adults only. The percentage of female participants ranged from 22% [38] to 100% [26]. Risk of bias Of the included trials, only 26% adequately reported se- quence generation and 29% adequately reported alloca- tion concealment (Figure 2). The majority of the RCTs blinded participants and physicians (65%) and addressed incomplete data (62%). Only half of the RCTs were deemed to be free from other sources of bias (44%; 56% scored unclear because they were industry funded) and 23% were free from selective outcome reporting (Table 3). The trials were conducted over 40 years and the risk of bias for older studies was compared to newer studies, using 1991 as the midpoint. No trends were observed for sequence generation or allocation sequence and dif- ferences between groups were minimal. Blinding of out- come assessors and the reporting of incomplete data improved in recent studies by 17%. Furthermore, select- ive outcome reporting in recent studies showed an im- provement of 42% in the risk of bias. There was also an increase in the proportion of RCTs scoring 'unclear 'on other risk of bias criterion, as more trials were funded by private industry in recent years. Methodological issues Only 15% of trials were free of other methodological issues, which included adequate information on case definition of ILI and surveillance of influenza, as well as details regarding randomization across multiple sites [12,38,44,48,50] (Additional file 2). Almost half of trials (16 of 34) did not adequately report a case definition of ILI and the remaining studies were unclear in at least 1 of the domains for other methodological concerns. LAIV versus placebo The results from all LAIV versus placebo meta-analyses are presented in Additional file 3. For simplicity, we have focused on the results specific to children aged <18 years for the primary outcome. The LAIV was protective against mismatched strains overall (11 RCTs, VE 60%, 95% CI 44% to 71%; Figure 3; Additional file 3) [10,11,13,14,31,37,40-43,47], as well as among children aged 6 to 36 months (6 RCTs, VE 54%, 95% CI 28% to 71%) [10,37,40-43] when strains were mismatched. Similarly, the LAIV was effective in Figure 1 Study flow. This figure displays the flow of titles/abstracts and full-text studies through the systematic review.Tricco et al.

Circulating v iral strains were crossreferenced with WHO weekly epidemiological records, Chinese National Influenza Centre CDC influenza summary reports, Mortality and Mo rbidity Reports Weekly (MMRW, published by CDC), where applicable. In all cases circulating strains matched influenza documentation as noted above. Antigenic characterization as per author refers to how the author determined and classified influenza strains in participants with laborato ry-confirmed influenza. Immunogenicity to vaccine and non-vaccine strains conducted using cut-off values to determine match or mismatch between strains contained in the vaccine and those that were circulating. Classificat ion of laboratory-confirmed influenza viral strains as being matched refers to the categorization of influenza strains that are antigenically similar or well matched to vaccine strains. Strains listed in the column represent break through strains that despite being well matched to vaccine caused influenza infections in the study population. In some cases, antigenically similar or well matched strains were presented in the study and are listed in the table as 'reported '. In other cases, antigenically similar or well matched strains was determined by surveillance data as documented above, in these cases the strains are listed as 'classified as '. Classification of laboratory-confirmed influenza viral strains as being mismatched refers to the categorization of influenza strains that are antigenically distinct or mismatched to vaccine strains. Strains listed in the column represent break through strains that were not protected through vaccination. In some cases, antigenically distinct or mismatched strains were presented in the study by authors and are listed in the table as 'reported '. In other cases, antigenically distinct or mismatched strains was determined by subtracting well matched strains from any strains reported in the publications, these strains are listed as 'classified as 'by authors of this review. Influenza B mismatched strains are further classified as antigenic drifts or lineage drifts. Antigenic drift represents viral strains that have mutated but are still classified within the same lineage. Lineage drifts refer to the distinction between Ya magata and Victoria lineages of influenza B. Classification of lineage was either reported by author (denoted in table as 'reported ') or categorized based on phylogenic tree of lineages (denoted as 'classified '). aMain publication. bUnpublished data was obtained from the author.

Furthermore, LAIV was more protective against drifted B strains (two RCTs, VE 62%,95% CI 21% to 81%) [40,41] than lineage mismatch for influenza B (five RCTs, VE 34%, 95% CI 4 %t o 59%) [10,40-43] in children. Similarly, LAIV was effectiveagainst influenza B when circulating strains matched vac- cine strains in children (four 58% to 90%) [10,35,41,43].

The TIV also afforded protection against mismatched influenza B strains (eight RCTs, VE 52%, 95% CI 19% to 72%) [11,13-15,45-47,49], 77%, 95% CI 18% to 94%) [11,15,47,49] among adults. Other vaccines compared to placebo In all, 3 RCTs including 5 influenza seasons and 1,578 participants provided efficacy estimates against mismat- ched strains for other vaccines [12,26,29,31]. Protection against mismatched strains was statistically significant(three RCTs, VE 56%, 95% CI 23% to 75%) [12,26,29]. Other vaccines contributed data on 5 influenza sea- sons from 4 RCTs including 15,592 participants formatched strains. Other vaccines provided a VE of 54% (four RCTs, 95% CI 5% to 78%) [24,29,48,51]. Post hoc subgroup analysis Our results did not change after a post hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the influence of ca-tegorizing the vaccines as being either an inactivated influenza vaccine or a live influenza vaccine versus ca- tegorizing the vaccines as LAIV, TIV, and other.Discussion In the present work, we conducted a systematic review to estimate the protection afforded by mismatched influ- enza vaccines. Our results show that mismatched vac-cines can reduce the risk of PCR or culture-confirmed influenza by 60% for LAIV CI 43% to 66%). These results suggesta benefit of vaccines in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza even when there is a mismatch between vac- cine composition and circulating strains. For matchedinfluenza, point estimates for VE were slightly higher for both the LAIV (77%, 95% CI 57% to 72%), versus mismatched point es- timates. However, there was substantial overlap in the CIs for matched and mismatched estimates in some in-stances; the impact of this overlap could not be formally tested via meta-analyses techniques. A previous systematic review on a similar topic did not report the results separately for matched or mis- matched strains [2]. A Cochrane review among healthy adults found a VE for TIV non-WHO matching strains(including when the specific strains are unknown) of 44% (95% CI 23% to 59%) [6]. This result was based on six influenza seasons from four RCTs.

Our review is based on an additional 13 RCTsand we have included more than double the data for both LAIV and TIV compared to the Cochrane review. Furthermore, here we have followed a rigorous processof identifying matched and mismatched data, which has not been attempted in previous reviews. Our results are consistent with those found in a pooled observationalstudy including 5 years of data [53]. We found that the LAIV was more efficacious among children versus adults, which is likely a reflection of the difference in previously acquired influenza infections be- tween age groups and the consequently larger amount ofpre-vaccination antibody, which affects the live vaccine. However, we found higher point estimates for adults versus children for mismatched LAIV estimates. Thisfinding might suggest that there might be a possible dis- crepancy in the degree of matching, which may have im- pacted our results. Specifically, trials conducted amongchildren may have had a greater degree of mismatch than those conducted among adults. Unfortunately, the current analysis does not allow the degree of mismatchto be examined. For the purposes of our analysis, wedichotomized cross protection but in reality, the degree of mismatch is a continuum. The cross protection in- ferred by mismatch strains should be analyzed as a con-tinuum in the future. The results from our secondary outcome analysis were often inconsistent with our primary outcome results.This inconsistency is likely due to differences in sensitiv- ity and specificity of different laboratory tests over time. Indeed, the most reliable diagnostic test for clinical prac-tice is PCR so the results from our primary outcome should be considered the most valid [54,55]. Our results are generalizable to seasonal influenza, as most of the included studies reported on this type of in- fluenza. Only one of the included RCTs occurred duringthe influenza pandemic [51]. When this study was re- moved via sensitivity analysis, we did not observe any differences on our meta-analysis results. We identified three RCTs reporting data among se- niors [33,36,51], yet none reported our primary outcome of interest or provided data on mismatched influenza.This finding is consistent with previous influenza re- views, for which few RCTs were identified among this age group [2,5].

There are a few limitations in the evidence base summa- rized for this review. Many of the trials had an unclear risk of bias because of poor reporting. However, we did noteimprovements in risk of bias over time that may be because of uptake of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT Statement), providing guid-ance on what should be reported in RCTs [56]. Enhanced reporting of outcome definitions might be due to clinical trial registry requirements for trials. We also noted thatmore trials in this area were funded by industry over time. Another potential limitation is that although unpub- lished data was only obtained from six RCTs (Additionalfile 4), no data were obtained from unpublished RCTs. This finding suggests that we might be missing data from unpublished trials. However, we contacted manytrial authors for unpublished data and searched trial registries (for example, meta -Register) to identify poten- tially relevant unpublished RCTs. Furthermore, our fun-nel plots did not suggest that publication bias influenced our results [23]. A critical limitation, which may have influenced our re- sults, is the determination of mismatch between circulat- ing strains and those found in the vaccine. Characterizing strains as antigenically similar or distinct using HI assayor ferret antisera might be insensitive, leading to mis- classification of strains [57]. Residual misclassification of matching due to the limited discriminatory ability of H1assays may have also explained some of our findings, and is a limitation of the inferences that can be made. Further- more, the cut-off values recommended by the CDC to dis-tinguish between match and mismatch strains using the HI assay changed during the study period across the in- cluded RCTs, although most of the studies included hereused a fourfold quotient HI cut-off (Table 1). As such, some of the data from trials labeled as matched might ac- tually have been mismatched [58], and vice versa. Conclusions By summarizing the point estimates and confidence in- tervals for cross protection, these data can help public health officials anticipate the possible infection and com-plications during mismatched years. Estimates of protec- tion for mismatched influenza seasons can be used by patients who are contemplating immunization, since theLAIV and TIV have been shown to offer benefit during matched seasons, as well as mismatched seasons.
