[Application available](https://coronavirus.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-for-Mobile-Offsite-Special-COVID-19-Vaccination-Clinics-Updated-FINAL-002.pdf) for organizations to apply for funds to establish and operate mobile, offsite, and special COVID-19 vaccination clinics; the focus being to target communities of high-disparity, high social vulnerabilities, underserved populations including racial and ethnic minority populations, rural communities, and those disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Phone number verification is required. The app displays vaccination history to anyone with a record in IRIS whose identity has been verified through the Docket\u00ae app. This application is not a vaccine passport. The Docket\u00ae app currently supports a QR code for COVID-19 vaccinations. Providing Idahoans digital access to their IRIS records will reduce the number of requests coming into your office and should reduce staff time spent generating records for patients. Docket\u00ae will be particularly helpful during back-to-school and kindergarten registration when immunization record requests increase. When Docket\u00ae is launched, your office should anticipate an increased volume of calls and requests from patients to have immunization information updated or verified in IRIS. The Idaho Immunization Program maintains IRIS; but does not provide medical care, including vaccine administration, and cannot alter a patient's medical record. Because of this, patients will be directed to their healthcare or vaccine provider when there appears to be a discrepancy or missing information when the patient uses Docket\u00ae.
