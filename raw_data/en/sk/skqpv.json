Although we may use a variety of treatment approaches, we primarily perform adjustments (manipulations) to the spine or other parts of the body with the goal of correcting alignment problems, alleviating pain, improving function, and supporting the body's natural ability to heal itself. Overview and History The term \"chiropractic\" combines the Greek words cheir (hand) and praxis (practice) to describe a treatment done by hand. Hands-on therapy\u2014especially adjustment of the spine\u2014is central to chiropractic care. Chiropractic is based on the notion that the relationship between the body's structure (primarily that of the spine) and its function (as coordinated by the nervous system) affects health. Spinal adjustment/manipulation is a core treatment in chiropractic care, but it is not synonymous with chiropractic. Chiropractors commonly use other treatments in addition to spinal manipulation, and other health care providers (e.g., physical therapists or some osteopathic physicians) may use spinal manipulation. Treatment During the initial visit, we take a health history and perform a physical examination, with a special emphasis on the spine. Other examinations or tests such as x-rays may also be performed. If chiropractic treatment is considered appropriate, a treatment plan will be developed. During follow up visits, we may perform one or more of the many different types of adjustments and other manual therapies used in chiropractic care. Given mainly to the spine, a chiropractic adjustment involves using the hands or a device to apply a controlled, rapid force to a joint. The goal is to increase the range and quality of motion in the area being treated and to aid in restoring health. Joint mobilization is another type of manual therapy that may be used. We may combine the use of spinal adjustments and other manual therapies with several other treatments and approaches such as: - Heat and ice - Electrical stimulation - Relaxation techniques - Rehabilitative and general exercise - Counseling about diet, weight loss, and other lifestyle factors - Dietary supplements The Safety of Manipulations - Side effects from spinal manipulation can include temporary headaches, tiredness, or discomfort in the parts of the body that were treated. - There have been rare reports of serious complications such as stroke, cauda equina syndrome (a condition involving pinched nerves in the lower part of the spinal canal), and worsening of herniated discs, although cause and effect are unclear. - Safety remains an important focus of our care. As such, we regularly participate in continuing education programs to stay up-to-date with the latest techniques and clinical research. If You Are Thinking About Seeking Chiropractic Care - Ask about the chiropractor's education and licensure. - Mention any medical conditions you have, and ask whether the chiropractor has specialized training or experience in the condition for which you are seeking care. - Ask about typical out-of-pocket costs and insurance coverage. (Chiropractic is covered by many health maintenance organizations and private health plans, Medicare, and state workers' compensation systems.) - Tell the chiropractor about any medications (prescription or over-the-counter) and dietary supplements you take. If the chiropractor suggests a dietary supplement, ask about potential interactions with your medications or other supplements. - Tell all of your health care providers about any complementary health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. "}
