Teaching ideas based on New York Times content. Overview of Lesson Plan: This lesson encourages students to evaluate the trend in herbal supplements through first assessing their own beliefs, then reading a related New York Times article, and finally conducting individual research on an herb commonly used in herbal supplements. Author(s): Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning Network Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes Objectives: Students will: 1. Participate in and appraise a survey regarding their beliefs about herbal medicine. 2. Evaluate recent trends in using herbal supplements and recent research findings by reading and discussing the first section of the article \"Americans Gamble On Herbs As Medicine.\" 3. Re-evaluate their survey responses by retaking the survey and then comparing the results of the two surveys; justify their responses. 4. Learn about the reported effects and warnings about a specific herb commonly used in herbal supplements through research and the creation of an informative poster. Resources / Materials: -paper -pens/pencils -classroom blackboard -copies of \"Americans Gamble On Herbs As Medicine\" (one per student) Activities / Procedures: 1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: On a scrap piece of paper, students respond to the following questions (written on the board before class): a. Have you ever taken an herbal remedy? Yes/ No (if No, skip to question c) b. For which of the following health reasons have you used an herbal supplement? (choose as many as etc.) -build immune system -other (describe) c. Do you take \"conventional\" medications on a regular basis? Yes/ No d. With which of these statements do you most agree? -Herbal medicine is an ancient, worthless practice and has no basis in science. -Herbal medicine may work for some, but I prefer taking more conventional medicine. -Herbal medicine may be a viable medical practice, but I need more information. -Herbal medicine is as reliable a medical practice as more conventional medicines. -Herbal medicine is a better way to treat illness than conventional medicine. -I do not believe in taking any type of medicine. e. Are herbal supplements as closely regulated as other drugs? Yes/ No f. Do you believe that herbal supplements are safe? Always Sometimes Never After students have completed the survey, obtain the results from the students and mark totals on the board beside the answer choices. As you obtain responses for each question, ask students to share why they answered as they did for each. Be sure to leave the survey on the board for use later in the class period, and tell students that they will need their survey answers later as well. 2. Read and discuss the first 13 paragraphs of \"Americans Gamble On Herbs As Medicine,\" focusing on the following questions: a. What does the increase in the trend of using herbal supplements rather than more traditional medicines tell one about the views of our society as a whole? b. Why might one choose to use an herbal supplement over a conventional medicine? c. Why are herbal products not as closely regulated as drugs, and how might this endanger consumers? d. What is the significance of the report in the journal Psychosomatics that stated that \"unsuspecting consumers 'have used herbal remedies with good results only to discover that the benefit was actually derived from the presence of undisclosed medicines,' including steroids, anti-inflammatory agents, sedatives and hormones\"? e. Why does Dr. Varro E. Tyler feel that \"the lack of quality standards is the No. 1 problem in the whole (herbal supplement) industry\"? f. How does Annette Dickinson support the \"good manufacturing practices\" doctrine regarding the use of herbs for medicinal purposes? g. If herbal products are not closely regulated, why are consumers buying then at such a high rate? h. How are the natural supplies of some herbs becoming endangered due to the popularity of herbal supplements, and what might this mean for the future of the industry and of the earth? i. What informational goods and services about herbs and their uses are now in existence, and what may they do to forward the trend in herbal supplements? 3. On the back of the paper used for the initial survey exercise, students retake the survey, armed with their new knowledge of herbal supplements. Once again, calculate totals. Then, compare the initial survey results to the results of this survey. Ask students to explain why responses may have changed, as well as to share why they changed (or did not change) specific responses. 4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Each student selects an herb often used in supplements as the focus of brief research. (Suggested herbs: huang [also known as ephedra].) In their research, students should answer the following questions: -What are the reported effects of taking this herbal supplement? -Who might take this herbal supplement, and why? -What is the history behind the use of this herb? (When, where, and why was it first used?) -In what products would one find this herb? -What warnings do some people have regarding this herbal supplement? -Why do conflicting claims about the benefits of this herb exist? Students should then find a picture of the herb in its natural form, and include this, as well as the answers to the research questions, on an informational poster about the herb. Students will be able to find the answers to the research questions most effectively on the Internet, but may also be able to find some information in encyclopedias and health books. In a future class, students should share their research by either presenting their findings orally or by displaying posters in the classroom. Further Questions for Discussion: -How do you feel about the current trend in using herbal remedies, and why? -In what types of products might one find herbs used for medicinal purposes? -How have herbs and other botanicals been used in various civilizations over time? -Do you feel that herbal remedies have as much true medicinal value as more traditional medicines, and why? -What does the increase in the trend of using herbal supplements rather than more conventional medicines tell one about the views of our society as a whole? -Why might one choose to use an herbal supplement over a conventional medicine? -Why are herbal products not as closely regulated as drugs, and how might this endanger consumers? -Do you agree with Dr. Tyler's statement that \"the lack of quality standards is the No. 1 problem in the whole (herbal supplement) industry,\" and why or why not? -How do proponents of herbal medicine support the use of herbs for medicinal purposes? -If herbal products are not closely regulated, why are consumers buying then at such a high rate? -How are the natural supplies of some herbs becoming endangered due to the popularity of herbal supplements, and what might this mean for the future of the industry and of the earth? -What informational goods and services about herbs and their uses are now in existence, and what may they do to forward the trend in herbal supplements? -Why do conflicting claims about the benefits of various herbs exist? -Do you feel that herbal supplements should have to adhere to the same strict standards as drugs, and why? -Do you feel that herbs used as medicine should be considered drugs, and why? Evaluation / Assessment: Students will be evaluated based on participation in survey activities and classroom discussions, and on thoughtful and thorough research and presentation of an herb commonly found in herbal supplements. Vocabulary: therapeutics, purified, relegated, quackery, mainstream, adulterated, tinctures, extracts, alleviate, conventional, supplements, jeopardizing, abnormalities, carcinogens, psychosomatics, doctrine, botanicals, pharmaceutical, calmative, unscrupulous, wary Extension Activities: 1. Analyze the remaining sections of the featured article. What various positions are expressed, and how do they impact your views about herbal remedies? 2. Read and discuss a related New York Times article. What position about herbal supplements does this article seem to take, and why? 3. Interview a doctor and an \"alternative\" practitioner about the issues discussed in the article, and compare their responses. What similarities and differences of opinion exist, and why? 4. Research herbs and other supplements added to foods. Why are these things added, and what are their effects? Would the presence of these supplements encourage or discourage you from purchasing the products, and why? 5. Learn about how different health insurance companies view herbal remedies and other non-traditional forms of medicine as reflected in what their policies will financially cover. 6. Research digitalis (made from the leaves of the purple foxglove plant and used as a cardiac stimulant) and other all-natural medicines that are part of conventional medicine rather than being considered as \"herbal supplements.\" What do you think differentiates these medicines from being considered herbal medicines? 7. Debate or write a persuasive essay analyzing why people may turn to herbal supplements and other alternative medical practices (such as acupuncture and aromatherapy), or the role that medicine plays in our society. 8. Research other ideas regarding healing, such as spiritual healing, music therapy, and ancient practices and remedies. 9. Interview members of your family about healing practices in which they have participated during the course of their lives. Older family members may offer insight into what medicine was like when they were your age. 10. Evaluate various sayings about health, such as \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away.\" How do these sayings reflect the beliefs and practices of the culture in which they are common?
