With the ongoing discussions about the COVID-19 vaccines, I want to share insights an expert in the approval of vaccines at the Austrian Federal Office for Safety in Health Care. She published an excellent blog article on the topic (German only): https://verdareno.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/covid-impfstoffe-und-keine-langzeitdaten/. Vaccines have a completely different mode of action than the so-called \"classic pharmaceuticals\", the summarising term for all drugs not manufactured using biological methods. With a vaccine there are no \"late side effects\" that occur suddenly 5 years after the vaccination. Side effects appear within a few hours to 1 - 2 days after vaccination, with live vaccines after the incubation period of the natural disease. Allergic reactions also occur soon after administration. Various autoimmune reactions are possible as very rare side effects, but even these occur after a few weeks at the latest. There are two advantages for the COVID-19 vaccine: The number of test subjects in the clinical studies prior to approval was strikingly large. Instead of the usual 10'000 and 15'000 test subjects for brand new vaccines, for the first approved COVID vaccine it was approx. 40'000. Due to the mass vaccination campaign, the number of people vaccinated to identify rare side effects was reached very quickly. Since vaccination campaigns are now running worldwide, the number of people for whom data is available very quickly is extremely high. The only thing that could happen now is that a side effect occurs that is very rare and occurs, for example, with a frequency of 1: 100,000, that is, one person per 100,000 vaccinated is affected. That will now show in the surveillance phase. Put into simpler terms: there is an approx. 0.001% personal risk for such a very rare side effect. The mortality of Covid-19 to around 0.3 to 0.7 percent. "}
