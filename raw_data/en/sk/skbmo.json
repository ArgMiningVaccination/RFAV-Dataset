I've had acupuncture a myriad of places, so I can tell you that knowledgeable and warm people in this work are hard to come by. She's passionate about healing and it shines in the way she cared for me. Dr. Monica asked the right questions and truly listened to my drawn out explanation of how I ended up with a potential torn meniscus while healing through postpartum. After a few weeks with her I went from limping on crutches to walking with just a knee brace! The best part was just how much she genuinely wanted me to get better. When she realized that my insurance wasn't going to cover her services, she even encouraged me to find another acupuncturist under my insurance. I didn't even consider it after my experience with her and her lovely staff (Kelly is the sweetest). Who has the time to sift through mediocre experiences when I already found a gem like her! Business owner information Monica M. 9/17/2021 My Dear Sabine! How incredibly lucky and grateful I am to come across a patient like you! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this message, you made my entire month! This is what I live for! I'm always here for you, and honored to have the opportunity to get you to a pain free path (especially as a new mommy)! You're a true sweetheart thank you again Angel!!! - 5/6/2020 Chiropractic, Acupuncture, Massage Therapy and Genuine Good Business. Some of the kindness people work here, the follow up is so good you end up feeling like family the way the Dr. and Therapist check up and look after you making sure healing is a priority, very accommodating. Im always in awe at how the therapist are so knowledgeable about muscles and pain. The atmosphere is also aesthetically pleasing. Business owner information Monica M. 5/13/2020 Markita darling, thank you so much for your kind review! It means the world to us and we are honored to have you as our patient!! Can't wait to see you soon-Dr. M - 4/24/2021 I spent a good amount of time trying to research for a prenatal chiropractor. I went to one a few years ago but she's now out of network for me, so I wanted to find someone who I thought was going to take the time to get to know me and my history, especially since I'm pregnant. The facility is nice, quiet and clean. The receptionist was very kind and helpful. As a new patient coming into a practice, I was hoping to spend some time just talking to my new chiropractor about my history. This was definitely not the case. Dr. Monica just spoke to me about what I was currently feeling as she was trying to adjust me. Which was kind of difficult trying to speak and having her roughly handle my head and neck. She cracked my neck and lower back. And that was it! I was literally in and out of the office in 15 minutes. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in the bedside manner of Dr. Monica. I feel like if she could've spent a little more time with me considering she would've been the chiropractor who I would be seeing in the duration of my pregnancy and thereafter. My neck pain somewhat subsided, I'm still having tension headaches. And my lower back actually felt worse up to two days after my \"adjustment\". I made an appointment to come the week after, because she was standing right there in front office when I was leaving, but I immediately called the next day to cancel. The one star is for the receptionist. Business owner information Monica M. 5/11/2021 Hi Tiffarah! I looked at the schedule, it wasn't Dr. Monica who treated you, we had a substitute doctor filling in that day her name is Dr. B (she had Blonde hair correct?), either way that shouldn't matter, who ever the doctor was should of spent extra TLC with you especially since you're a mommy to be! We truly try our best to strive being extra caring and loving to all our patients, sometimes our humanistic features pop out unfortunately, no body is perfect :( Typically we get really good responses from every one that comes through our door, I'm sorry it wasn't the same experience for you. I would love to offer you a full treatment with the ACTUAL Dr. Monica on the house to make up for your bad experience! If you are open to it, please text our number I will make sure you're extra taken care of. Best wishes -Dr. Monica Mahmoudi D.C., LaC - 3/30/2021 Doctor Monica is the best!! After two back to back pregnancies, my body needed some major work & Dr. Monica went above and beyond. She's attentive, caring, & very knowledgeable. She took her time and made me feel like she genuinely cared about the issues I presented. She loosened me up before my adjustment and then realigned me effortlessly. Before we finished up she taught me a few work outs to help strengthen my back and shoulders to help with my posture. She even gave me some overall health tips to take care of & nourish my postpartum body. Not only did I leave feeling better than ever, I also left with more knowledge about my own body. I can't thank her enough. As far as COVID-19 precautions, her whole staff was masked and they have a full body sanitizing station right at the entrance of the office. I felt safe & protected my entire visit. - 9/2/2020 I got a massage with Cindy after two weeks of being in extreme pain due to my chronic lower back pain/sciatica. Cindy's massage drastically helped my mobility and nearly evaporated my pain! Cant wait to come back and try the other services they offer. Side note: Their Covid precautions were top notch. Temperature check, full body sanitizer station, and limited the waiting room to one person. Business owner information Monica M. 9/7/2020 Dear Summer! Thank you so much for the lovely review! We are so happy to hear Cindy helped you get back to living a pain free life:) We are here for you whenever you need! Hope you had a wonderful Labor Day weekend!-NHC - 3/24/2022 Amazing customer service. Walked in there unable to walk correctly and with an enormous amount of pain, but I walked out feeling really good. It was worth the money. I highly recommend you give them a shot - 2/19/2021 I have known Dr. Monica for years. I have seen several Chiropractors and Dr. Monica is one of the best! Her adjustments are painless and make me feel so much more mobile after. She truly has the healing touch! The massage therapists Cindy and Laura are also amazing. Cindy is a pro at deep tissue massage therapy and Laura I had an amazing lymphatic drainage treatment that made me feel so much better. If you have any body pains or aches I would highly recommend seeing everyone here at Nature Health Chiropractic! You guys are amazing! - 2/17/2021 Great staff, felt like a vip everytime. Dr.Monica is very knowledgeable, she could pinpoint my problem areas. She took care of them with acupuncture and cupping, that was new for me but I felt great after. She's the go to for back aches. - 12/24/2021 Dr Sam got me in on short notice and spent the necessary time to get my \"lower back\" back on track! His staff is second to none! I am a client for life! - 5/4/2020 I have severe neck and lower back pain and have tried EVERYTHING, but nothing has worked. I also have scoliosis so my back muscles get extremely tight. I've been to several chiropractors and none of them have had made my pain go away. I was so thrilled when I found Dr. Monica -- she is the most caring and thorough chiropractor I've ever been to. I've had both chiropractic and acupuncture with her and BOTH of them relieved soooo much of my muscle aches and neck pain. So thankful for her. The facility is incredibly clean and the staff is really friendly. Thank you Dr. Monica! Business owner information Monica M. 5/14/2020 Jade my dear, I don't know how we are so lucky to have an amazing patient like yourself! It's always a pleasure to see you and I'm so happy you feel better!
