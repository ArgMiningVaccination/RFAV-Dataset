More people gather, and the room quiets. Today, the novelist on the faculty reminds them, they are reading \"Aquarium,\" a personal essay written by writer Aleksandar Hemon who has lost his baby daughter to brain cancer. The mood in the room shifts from light camaraderie to an attentive sense of purpose. \"I had such a hard time reading this,\" a seasoned family physician sighs. \"It made me want to run home and pick up my baby,\" offers the hospitalist.

It gives a glimpse into that fishbowl, but also says and then you can write. It opens up a way to talk about and then use the imagination and the power of words.\" [+] [+] [+] WHAT IS NARRATIVE MEDICINE? [+] [+] This session is a typical example of the kind of work this group does every week. They are medical educators, the faculty of Foundations of Clinical Medicine (Columbia's \"doctoring\" course) who employ the techniques of narrative medicine to sharpen their clinical skills, deepen their teaching, and reflect on their work. Narrative medicine developed out of the integration of medicine and literary studies to fortify clinical practice with the narrative competence to recognize, absorb, metabolize, interpret, and be moved by the stories of illness. Its unifying tenet is that the giving and receiving of accounts of self are the central events in health care\u2014whether the account is given by a patient, "}
