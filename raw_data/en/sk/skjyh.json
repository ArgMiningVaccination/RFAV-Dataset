In conjunction with DAMES, the Arizona Developmental Disabilities Planning Council conducted an electronic survey with Arizona's parents of children with disabilities from July 7 to August 17, 2021 to determine what is preventing them from getting themselves or their children vaccinated. 3 70 parents responded.1 The survey was also available in Spanish.2 The findings were telling of how education efforts have fared so far: The majority, 76%, of parents who answered the survey had been fully vaccinated. Among those who didn't get the vaccine, 50% said they wouldn't because they worry about possible long - term side effects, 44% didn't trust the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine, and 40% were unsure of vaccine ingredients . When parents who were both vaccinated and unvaccinated were asked if they would vaccinate their child , 62% said yes, 2 2% said no, 8 % were still unsure and 8% did not answer . Among vaccinated parents, 6.9% said they would not vaccinate their child and 7.7% were still unsure . The most frequently stated reasons why parents did not want to vaccinate their children were : they were worried about the long -term side effects ( 53%) ; they didn't trust the safety and effectiveness of the vaccin e o n their child's disability (43%) ; or they worried about the short -term side effects (33%). The survey also allowed parents to post comments about their concerns. While the majority of parents did not share any, those who did expressed similar issues regarding vaccine efficacy on those who have had COVID -19 and the vaccine's effect on disability : 1 Parents were contacted through the Arizona Early Intervention Program and AHCCCS' Arizona Long Term Care email lists. Parents were also alerted to the survey through organization Facebook pages, such as DAMES Charities Inc, Raising Special Kids, AZ Special Mamas, and AZ autis m moms). 2 10 parents responded to the Spanish survey. Due to the low number, the results were aggregated with overall survey findings. We had COVID, and have heard and read the studies on natural immunity. I don't feel like taking a possible risk for something that will give us about the same immunity that we already have. My Daughter has Down Syndrome and Heart problems . There has not been any testing on Kids with Down Syndrome. I've already had Covid so what's the point of getting the vaccine. It does not prevent Covid only lessens thesymptoms and I am not willing to make the short term more comfortable when there could be unknown long term effects since this is the first mRNA vaccine on the market. The death rate in children is so low that the risk of long term side effects is of greater concern. This survey hi ghlights t he ne ed for pe diatricians t o work closely w ith parents to help them un derstan d how the vaccine w ill interact with their c hild's disability. In r esponse to these survey f indings, ADDPC also created a parent g uide to addre ss some o f the concerns expressed.

What should I pay attention to after vaccination What are the adverse effects of fear. We had COVID, and have heard and read the studies on natural immunity. I don't feel like taking a possible risk for something that will give us about the same immunity that we already have. We don't know long term side effects of this vaccine - hasn't been studied long enough. unsafe Too much unknown for future health issues The whole family already had Covid -19 in November 2020. We already have immunity. The vaccine has not been out long enough to have long term studies and know possible side effects. Everyone I know who receives the vaccine gets sick. The vaccine has just been developed, for fear of side effects. The vaccine has just been developed, for fear of side effects.

Question 3: Please share your concerns about being vaccinated against COVID -19 Pregnant. Just waiting till after baby is born just incase of side effects. None No long term studies yet to prove effectiveness or long term side effects. No data on long term affects. Media is not honest with deat hs from the vaccine. If you look off google sites, several articles. My husband and I are fully vaccinated I am hesitant for our 14 year old daughter with neurological problems. Just scares me a bit as my migraines have been worse since the vaccine. Medical issues and vaccine reactions in the past. It's too new. I have had major long term consequences due to medicine I was forced to take. So until I know it's safe I may or may not get it It is not FDA approved and they did not do the YEARS of test ing they do for vaccines (up to 10 years) It has not been approved by the FDA It has not been tested on people long enough, My Daughter has DownSyndrome and Heart problems, There has not been any testing on Kids with DownSyndrome. I've had covid. I fully believe data has been skewed and that the numbers the CDC presents are not done in integrity. If I believed they were, I might be concerned, but there has been way too much spinning data to fit an agenda. I've gotten the first shot after a lot of hesitation I've already had Covid so what's the point of getting the vaccine. It does not prevent Covid only lessens the symptoms and I am not willing to make the short term more comfortable when there could be unknown long term effects since this is the first mRNA v accine on the market. I'm not sure if it's safe I'm afraid of side effects I'm afraid of side effects I'm afraid it's bad for my health I'm afraid it's bad for my health I think it's risky I think it's a big risk. I don't know the composition or th e risks of COVID -19 I don't know if there's any risk to my health problems I don't feel at ease about this epidemic now hospitals have no way to treat and there is no specific medicine how can the vaccine work i don't worrd I am vaccinated to protect myself and my family/friends I am concerned about fertility and DNA long ter m effects. And it is not FDA approved. I already had covid -19 and believe that my antibodies are more effective than the shot. I also have underlying medical conditions and I am not willing to get a shot that hasn't been adequately tested. i have no worrid First of all this isn't a vaccine. It is a shot. Because it is not proven to provide immunity. I have family /friends that ha ve had severe long lasting side effects from taking the shot. i.e. shingles, paralysis, Guillain -Barr\u00a9 syndrome, and many have still experienced COVID19 symptoms. Fear of side effects Family does not receive any vaccinations Don't believe in the safety of vaccines Death rate for vaccine has not been in media but in other countries sharing real data. Autoimmune issues & multiple doctors have told me to wait. all in the house have been vaccinated except our 12 yr old. Husband has serious concerns about the vaccine when it comes to our son. His friends' child is one who was a healthy child now has issues since the vaccine was given. My husband and I have been having lasting issues constant headaches and joint pain since getting the shots. So will wait for now on our son. Que no sea efectiva y tenga complicaciones Answers to the following question: Please share any additional information regarding concerns you have about vaccinating your child against COVID -19 or about the COVID -19 vaccines in general. Worrying about possible side effects Worry about vomiting Worry about side effects and safety Worry about side effects Worried about the side effects of the vaccine and the safety of children Worried about swelling Will there be any adverse reactions. Whether to the body health side effects. Whether the ingredients in the vaccine have side effects What are the side effects. We are ho peful our k ids (7 a nd 9 yrs old) will be eligible to be v accinated soon. I a m m ore c oncerned about my s ons (especially my s on w ith Down s yndrome) g etting C OVID -19 than I a m abo ut the COVID 19 vaccine. I have done research regarding the va ccine. Waiting for the a ge limit to be lowered more to make sure all my kids are protected unsafe This is a life -death issue. The vaccine doesn't kill. the virus could. there is no The vaccine has no side e ffects in children under the age of 18 The vaccine has just been developed, for fea r of side e ffects. The vaccine has just been developed, for fear of side e ffects. The only concern is the safety of the ingredients The main concern is about the sa fety of the vaccine The heart inflammation issues among young men receiving the Pfizer vaccine are concerning. But, when considering the extremely l ow incidence of that particular side-e ffect and the comparative risks of contracting COVID-1 9, the vaccine still seems to be the best option. The death rat e in children is so low that the risk of long term side effects is of greater concern. Temporarily no Temporarily no Tell me exactly what's in the COVID-1 9 vaccine. swelling Sorry we read everything put out on the vaccines and felt very comfortable vaccinating our children. So happy I have teenagers who can be vaccinated. Side effects and safety She is too young. She is 12 months old and isn't eligible Security issues Same as above. The known risks doesn't out the way unknown benefits. Same as above Safety and side effects Safety and side effects Pregnant women and children were excluded Overall I believe risk is low for both of our children, especially our son with autism. Possible exposure is low since he is at home, and most that interact with him are vaccinated or have low exposure as well. Our child received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The second dose really knocked him out. Had a fever (100.8), ate very little, and slept for almost an entire day. We kept rotating ice packs, offered water, and plenty of popsicles. Everyone reacts differently to the vaccine. P arents should just be prepared that their child may experience some of these symptoms (even if they didn't when they received the vaccine). Not sure about the long term effect. Not applicable None. All of my children who are eligible for the vaccine are vaccinated and we are impatiently awaiting authorization for my younger children. NO WAY would I ever give my child this vaccine. Even if it was not emergency status. Need more studies with children with Ds. Don't know long term effects. More likely to have mild symptoms anyway if get Covid. N/A My son already has 3 heart issues. I definitely don't want to give him the vaccine with possible side effects. My only concern is that it's not available for younger children yet and AZ is not allowing schools to mandate masks. Kids will get sick! This is not safe! My kids don't believe it's safe My kids don't believe it's safe My husband is concerned about giving the v accine to our children at this time. So we are going to hold off. My children had covid. One has a runny nose for 36 hours, the other coughed for 48. This has been blown so far out of proportion it's unreal and we need to take our government back from this nonsense. My children are terrified of vaccines My children ar e fully vaccinated. Everyone in house is. My child is afraid of its side effects My child is afraid of its side effects My child is afraid of injections My child is 19 years old. I am his guardian. my child has been fully vaccinated for several months My child has already received the vaccine. My child already had the Covid -19 virus last year. She already has immunity to it. It would be child abuse to do this to any child with not having long term data to show how it would affect the child long term. I'm just concerned how effective the vaccine will be on my child with his underlying health issues. Also, will the vaccine make their underlying health issues worse and if they will have greater side effects from the vaccine due to their disability. I wo uld like to know more about the composition of the COVID -19 vaccine. I worry about my child having an allergic reaction but worry more if they catch Covid from school. Especially now that no one is wearing masks. I will discuss with my child's doctors wh en it becomes available and decide at that time . I was very concerned as I believe he reacted horribly to his 1 year old vaccines and that this was associated with his Autism and his numerous medical conditions thereafter. With COVID -19 and his compromised immune system, I felt I had to vaccinate him, which I did. I was advised to not get vaccinated as an immunocomprised adult due to a genetic condition. I chose to get the more traditional J&J vaccine AMA even though my genetic specialist told me not to. After I had several conversations with my PCP & other MDs and researched any allergies to the J&J ingredients, I decided to take the J&J vaccine anyway. I hope to get a Covid antibody titer test to see if I made antibodies. Because my condition is genetic, the MDs said that my children should only receive the J&J vaccine and not the mRNA vaccines. Since the J&J vaccine is n ot available to those under 18, my children will have to wait to get the J&J vaccine unless it is approved for children in the future. My children are also not eligible for J&J child clinical trials. And, yes I have had extended side effects from the J&J vaccine as all of the MDs thought I would. The MDs who have patients who have received the mRNA vaccines told me that in patients like me immunoresponses were severe and expected mine to be as well; so they agreed that I or my children should not take the m RNA vaccines. Not all of us are against vaccines, but I, my family members, and my children have had severe allergic reactions to other vaccines and are cautious. I vaccinated my children as soon as they became eligible and I'll continue to do the same for my younger children. As a family, we have all worked hard to keep my oldest and medically fragile daughter safe so getting the vaccine is just part of that mission. I vaccinated my 16 year old dd son the first day he was eligible. He was able to go bac k to in -person for the last 5 weeks of school. :) I trust in science, that about covers it. I spoke to my daughters' pulmonologists and they told me to absolutely protect them with vaccination. Both of my 12 - 17 year old very medically complex children have been vaccinated along with all other 12 -17 year old children in our home. I have to know what's in the COVID -19 vaccine and all the risks. I have concerns about other people NOT getting vaccinated. I don't want them to get sick from the vaccine and I don't know what long term side effects there are. To me, the risks outweigh the alleged benefits. I don't believe the vaccine will be as beneficial as the government is stating. I believe there to be greater risk for long - term side affects and I do not want my children to be a science projects. I don't believe that children need to be vaccinated. They are healthy and the majority have to symptoms. I am very frustrated at the states push for members and families to get vaccinated. It is an individual choice. Yes it should be available to those who want it but it should not be pushed on those who don't. He's 3 and already has a lot against him. Not sure I want to put him at risk of anything we don't know the long term effects of right now. For fear of health risks to their children Fear of uncertain risks Fear of Side Effects. Fear of Side Effects. Fear of Side Effects Don't feel it should of been released to soon with out being tested more. Don't believe in the safety of vaccines Daughter is type 1 and step son autistic Children who are physically healthy have a 1 in 500,000 chance of dying from Covid. And a much higher risk of having severe adverse reactions from the vaccine. When the risk for the vaccine is far higher than the risk for Covid, it's a no brainer. If pe ople would do real research and not just listen to main stream media they would realize this. Pushing vaccines on healthy children is disgusting Better Safe than Sorry As soon as eligable and after reading about the vaccine I got it for myself and family. I did this for my family and to protect those who cannot get vaccinated because a medical professional told them they cannot get vaccine. All household members including children who c an be vaccinated, have been vaccinated. T odos en el hogar incluyendo los si ya hay vacunas para otros virus ? "}
