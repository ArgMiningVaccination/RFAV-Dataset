There she discovered how the arts could bridge the gap between what is medically and spiritually needed in times of illness. In 1999 she began working for AIM as an Artist in Residence/Coordinator. She completed the UF Center for Arts in Medicine Dance in Healthcare Certificate and went on to become a registered nurse. Using her dual education, she helped form a unique employment model wherein she serves as a clinical resource for AIM and manages the integrative therapies team. In her spare time, Lauren enjoys taking pictures, spending time in nature, and making memories with her family. Contact: Rachel Carrico (she/her) is an Assistant Professor of Dance Studies in the School of Theatre + Dance. She is currently preparing a book manuscript tentatively titled Footwork! Dancing Politics and Pleasure at the New Orleans Second Line. It explores second lining, an improvisational dance form that, for more than a century, has carried people of African descent through the streets of New Orleans. Weekly second line parades contribute to community health in many ways, not only inviting physical exercise, but also building intergenerational networks of care and security, providing venues for spiritual connection, and wresting control of city streets from structural forces of dispossession. An emerging area of Carrico's research concerns disaster and the body. This research grows from her experiences with bodily performance in post-Katrina New Orleans but has taken sharper focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Carrico holds a Ph.D. in Critical Dance Studies from the University of California-Riverside, an M.A. in Performance Studies from NYU, and a teaching certificate from the Lim\u00f3n Institute. She parades in New Orleans annually with the Ice Divas Social & Pleasure Club.
