An increasingly diverse, aging U.S. population experiencing higher rates of chronic illness is demanding more service and culturally competent care. While technology improvements help provide the means to deliver safer, high-quality care, our society is facing shortages in health professionals such as nurses, mental health workers, nurse anesthetists, physician assistants, and rehabilitation science professionals. The demand for these and other skilled professionals continues to increase and is expected to remain steady well into the 21st century. There is no more vibrant a place to prepare for these kinds of meaningful, rewardingcareers than at Drexel University's College of Nursing and Health Professions (http://www.drexel.edu/cnhp) . The College offers associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in more than a dozen health care fields. Just as the health profession disciplines have come of age, so has the College of Nursing and Health Professions. Founded in 1969 as the College of Allied Health Professions with just three degree programs and a faculty of five, the college has undergone a remarkable evolution. Today it serves more than 3,000 students with a broad array of contemporary program offerings. Along the way, it has earned widespread recognition and accreditation for the education of health professionals. Mission and Approach The College believes that the health care needs of today and tomorrow can best be met by professionals who have expertise in their own fields and a concurrent understanding of other health disciplines. In addition to providing a broad-based education that balances academic learning with clinical training, the University promotes collaboration among students in our College of Nursing and Health Professions, our School of Public Health, and the College of Medicine, which draws from the rich traditions of predecessors Hahnemann University and the Medical College of Pennsylvania. Teamwork is as important in academics as it is in health care. The College of Nursing and Health Professions' dedicated and knowledgeable faculty members work closely with students, providing a supportive and creative learning environment. Graduates from the College possess a wide range of experiences and the knowledge, compassion, and lifelong learning skills needed to become accomplished health care professionals. The student body, which is diverse in age and culture, reflects Drexel University's commitment to provide qualified students with an opportunity for advanced education. Drexel welcomes nontraditional applicants and especially encourages applications from underrepresented minorities and those interested in practicing in underserved areas. Many of Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions programs offer flexible scheduling, making it possible for students to continue their education through part-time, online, night, or weekend study.

Behavioral Health Counseling About the Program Bachelor of Science Degree: 180.0 quarter credits The Behavioral Health Counseling program focuses on developing competencies needed to engage in clinical services and support for people experiencing mental illnesses and and substance use disorders. Students create a plan of study and select courses based on interests in careers such as psychiatric rehabilitation, prevention and treatment of substance use disorders, child and adolescent services, forensic behavioral health and related areas within systems of care for people with behavioral health problems. During the freshman and sophomore years, students develop a foundation for clinical practice by studying humanities, social sciences, writing, biological sciences, math and research methods. Behavioral Health Counseling (BHC) courses build on this foundation by demonstrating that biological, psychological, and social perspectives are needed to deliver today's evidence-based practices\u2014and to develop the next generation of innovative interventions. BHC courses offer a comprehensive selection of essential subjects and advanced practice electives that focus on establishing therapeutic relationships with people from diverse backgrounds and needs. The Behavioral Health Counseling major also offers a co-op experience in a clinical setting that greatly enhances the student's preparation for employment after graduation and for graduate study in professional counseling, social work or psychology. For students interested in certification as addictions counselors, all program courses are accredited by the Pennsylvania Certification Board. Students may also pursue certification in psychiatric rehabilitation.

Career Opportunities Graduates of the Pathway to Health Professions program may choose to enter the workforce in the field of clinical research. Clinical research is a rapidly expanding enterprise. There is a great need for trained individuals to fill positions on clinical research teams that are performing the research necessary to obtain FDA approval of new drugs, new medical devices, and new medical procedures. Clinical research is performed in clinics, hospital wards, pharmaceutical companies, medical device firms, doctors' offices, operating rooms, and other health care settings. In those settings, graduates of the program can fill positions in which they are responsible for interacting with physicians whose patients are participating in the research study, interviewing participants, taking medical histories, obtaining informed consent, collecting, entering and compiling data, andmanipulating data for publication of research results. These activities require individuals with advanced training in the policies and procedures of clinical research. Graduates of the program will have that knowledge, and they will understand the procedures for designing and implementing clinical research protocols and the governmental regulations governing clinical research projects. Post-Baccalaureate and Graduate Studies The curriculum of the Pathway to Health Professions program is designed to provide a strong foundation for those students who will proceed after graduation to post-baccalaureate and graduate programs in the health professions.The curriculum enables students to fulfill all of the prerequisites for these post-baccalaureate and graduate programs. The co-op experiences that students of the program undertake will serve to fulfill the requirement of the post baccalaureate and graduate programs that their applicants have personal exposure to the profession before they apply. The Pathway to Health Professions program serves as a feeder program for the Second Degree Fast-Track Nursing program, the Cardiovascular Perfusion program, the Physician Assistant Studies program, and the Doctor of Physical Therapy program of the College of Nursing and Health Professions. Graduates of the Pathway to Health Professions program may also continue their education in the biomedical graduate programs of the Drexel University College of Medicine (such as the MS in Clinical Research and MS in Pathologist's Assistant programs).

students with real-world experience in a variety of professional settings before graduation. Co- op integrates full-time work experience in the student's field of study throughout the academic program. The College of Nursing and Health Professions co-op program is one of only two of its kind in the nation. The nursing co-op provides students with 18 months of co-operative education in addition to the traditional clinical educational experiences. Through co-op, students will have the opportunity to learn the role of the nurse and unlicensed assistive personnel as well as other daily professional, political, and social issues in a work environment. Both before and during co-op students will receive instruction on career management and professional development skills, such as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing, job searches, interviewing skills, maintaining a career portfolio, negotiating salary, and professional. The clinical background studentsgain from co-op, coupled with a knowledge of career management, makes the Drexel option a value-added model of nursing education. Co-op Descriptions First Experience Co-op I: Nursing in Contemporary Health Networks Students will have co-operative education experiences in managed care settings, pharmaceutical companies, and other non-traditional healthcare work environments where nurses and nursing can effect change. Students will either work under the direction of a professional nurse or another health care professional with a minimum of a baccalaureate degree. Students will not perform any basic nursing skills in this role. Second Experience Co-op II: Acute and Chronic Health and Illness Students on the 4-year track participate in Co-Op II, an education experience in the traditional health care environment that emphasize the delivery of nursing care to adults and adolescents with acute and chronic illnesses. The majority of placements will be in general and specialty medical-surgical units. Students will function in the role as an unlicensed assistive person and their job description will be modeled similarly to unlicensed assistive personnel or nursing externs. Third Experience Co-op III: Specialty Nursing Concentration Students will have co-operative education experiences in a specialty area of their choice which will build upon their previous clinical courses and work experiences. For example, students may elect to specialize in labor and delivery, critical care, or return to work for a pharmaceutical or managed care company. Selection of content area for the Co-op III site will be made by each student in consultation with the student's faculty advisor. Students will be given a suggested reading list and texts to be used for supplemental reading and learning for the specialty co-op area. Students will function in the role as an unlicensed assistive person and their job description will be modeled similarly to the role of unlicensed assistive personnel or nursing externs.

Nutrition and Foods About the Program Bachelor of Science: 186.5 quarter credits The nutrition and foods curriculum emphasizes the relationship between food, food processing, food choices, nutrient metabolism, and medical nutrition therapy to meet health and nutrient needs of individuals.The major prepares students to pursue career opportunities in dietetics and research. The BS in Nutrition and Foods requires four years of study and the completion of at least 180 credits. The curriculum is designed to provide a sound basis for careers in dietetics and the application of the principles of nutrition and food science to the nutritional care of individuals and groups \u2014such as in school food service or community nutrition\u2014or to provide a sound basis for careers in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The study of the biochemical nature of nutrients and foods, their interaction with the environment, and their eventual metabolic fate is a strong career path for more research-minded students and provides a unique base for graduate study. About the Nutrition Program Dietetics is the practical application of nutrition in the prevention and treatment of disease. Dietetics is an exciting and challenging profession because there are many diseases that are related to nutrition, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, diabetes and obesity. The nutrition program at Drexel University is referred to as a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) because we provide classroom training for students who want to become Registered Dietitians. Our Didactic Program in Dietetics is currently granted accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education of the American Dietetic Association: ADA -120 S Riverside Plaza Suite 2000 Chicago, IL 60606 800-877-1600 x5400Drexel University - College of Nursing and Health Professions 25 www.eatright.org The American Dietetic Association is the nation's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, most of whom are Registered Dietitians. To become a Registered Dietitian, students must complete a: Bachelor's degree with course work approved by ADA's Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education. Coursework typically includes food and nutrition sciences, chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, community nutrition, nutrition education, foodservice systems management and business. An accredited, supervised practice program, also called a dietetic internship, at a health-care facility, community agency or foodservice corporation. The internship provides at least 1200 hours of hands-on training. Pass a national examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration. After successfully completing the BS program in Nutrition and all DPD- required courses with a C or better, students will receive a BS degree and also a Verification Statement. The Verification Statement is a certificate documenting completion of an approved/accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics. Students need both a Bachelor's degree and a Verification Statement to start a supervised practice program or internship. During the senior year, most students will apply for admission into a dietetic internship. Most dietetic internships last 8 to 9 months. To have a good chance of getting accepted into a dietetic internship, students should do the following : Maintain a cumulative GPA greater than 3.0 (this includes college courses regardless of where taken). Work several hundred hours in dietetics-related work and volunteer experience (especially in the food and nutrition departments at hospitals and nursing homes and in community programs such as WIC). Participate in activities that demonstrate leadership. Mission, Goals, and Outcome Measures The mission of the Drexel University Didactic Program in Dietetics is to integrate a foundation in the nutrition sciences with courses in the humanities to provide the knowledge, skills, and professional values (such as ethics) needed for successful entry into dietetic internships, graduate school, and/or dietetics employment. The learning environment is structured to allow students opportunities for experiential learning, including co-operative education, participation in research, and use of current technologies. GOAL 1 To provide quality didactic instruction and learning experiences to prepare graduates to be accepted into dietetic internships and graduate schools, and/or work in the field of dietetics. Students obtain the knowledge, skills, and professional values specified by CADE. On senior program evaluation responses, 90% of the knowledge and skill statements will be selected as competent. 50% of juniors will do co-op. 80% of seniors will participate in a research project.On average, 75% of graduating students will apply to an accredited dietetic internship or graduate school. On average, 80% of students who apply to internships, and 80% who apply to graduate school, are accepted. Of those graduates seeking employment in nutrition and food-related careers, 80% will be employed within 6 months of program completion. On surveys to internship directors, graduate school advisors, and employers, the mean rating of each of 10 learning outcomes will meet or exceed the rating of \"3\" (satisfactory) or better. On surveys to students 1 year after graduation, the mean rating of each of 10 learning outcomes will meet or exceed the rating of \"3\" (satisfactory) or better. GOAL 2 To prepare graduates who are accepted into accredited internship programs to become competent entry-level dietitians. Drexel alumni achieve over a 5-year period a pass rate of at least 80% on the RD exam. On surveys to employers of internship graduates, the mean rating of each of 10 learning outcomes will meet or exceed the rating of \"3\" (satisfactory) or better. GOAL 3 Through recruitment efforts, encouragement, motivation, and support, faculty and staff will increase the number of students and the diversity of students who enter and complete the didactic program in dietetics. The number of students registered in 300 and 400 level NFS courses is 12 or higher. At least 10% of juniors and seniors will be from underrepresented groups. At least 90% of the students enrolled in the didactic program two years before completion of the DPD will complete the program. Senior students indicate on surveys \"satisfactory\" or better scores with respect to the encouragement and support provided by the program's academic advisement staff. Senior students rate the overall quality of 90% of their DPD required courses as satisfactory (3) or better.

An increasingly diverse, aging U.S. population experiencing higher rates of chronic illness is demanding more service and culturally competent care. While technology improvements help provide the means to deliver safer, high-quality care, our society is facing shortages in health professionals such as nurses, mental health workers, nurse anesthetists, physician assistants, and rehabilitation science professionals. The demand for these and other skilled professionals continues to increase and is expected to remain steady well into the 21st century. There is no more vibrant a place to prepare for these kinds of meaningful, rewarding careers than at Drexel University's College of Nursing and Health Professions (http://www.drexel.edu/cnhp) . The College offers associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in more than a dozen health care fields. Just as the health profession disciplines have come of age, so has the College of Nursing and Health Professions. Founded in 1969 as the College of Allied Health Professions with just three degree programs and a faculty of five, the college has undergone a remarkable evolution. Today it serves more than 3,000 students with a broad array of contemporary program offerings. Along the way, it has earned widespread recognition and accreditation for the education of health professionals. Mission and Approach The College believes that the health care needs of today and tomorrow can best be met by professionals who have expertise in their own fields and a concurrent understanding of other health disciplines. In addition to providing a broad-based education that balances academic learning with clinical training, the University promotes collaboration among students in our College of Nursing and Health Professions, our School of Public Health, and the College of Medicine, which draws from the rich traditions of predecessors Hahnemann University and the Medical College of Pennsylvania. Teamwork is as important in academics as it is in health care. The College of Nursing and Health Professions' dedicated and knowledgeable faculty members work closely with students, providing a supportive and creative learning environment. Graduates from the College possess a wide range of experiences and the knowledge, compassion, and lifelong learning skills needed to become accomplished health care professionals. The student body, which is diverse in age and culture, reflects Drexel University's commitment to provide qualified students with an opportunity for advanced education.

The program prepares nurses to teach, lead, and engage in practical, clinically focused scholarship and research. This unique hybrid program is specifically designed to maximize the number of potential career roles the doctoral nursing graduate may assume, whether they be academic, in advanced clinical practice, or in executive healthcare leadership. The DrNP, with its focus on clinical nursing practice, is the first Clinical Research Doctor of Nursing Practice degree in the nation. Graduates will be educated for many diverse career roles and will also be able to engage in practical, clinically oriented scholarship and research. The program is designed as a part-time cohort model, and can be completed in three years. There is also an Alternate Cohort Program for students who want to slow the pace of coursework down (starting in the second year). This program can be completed part-time in four years. Program Objectives Prepare doctoral nursing graduates to assume roles in academia, advanced clinical practice, or in executive nursing and health care leadership. Provide an educational experience that is innovative, enriching, rigorous and scholarly to encourage graduates to promote the health of a nation, either through direct advanced practice nursing care, or indirectly through teaching, research, and executive leadership in nursing and healthcare. Promote the use and integration of technology to support learning and scholarship in doctoral nursing education. Contribute to the body of knowledge to further develop the science of nursing through clinical nursing scholarship. Curricular Objectives The Doctor of Nursing Practice in Nursing Science (with a focus on Clinical Practice) has the following primary curricular objectives:Establish a theoretical nursing science background for analyzing clinical nursing phenomena. Build upon the student's existing practice knowledge. Enhance each student's knowledge with a specialized clinical practicum of his or her own choosing. With the use of a specialized role practicum, support the importance of role development for clinical nursing scholars with the doctorate who may choose from a variety of career opportunities. Emphasize clinical nursing research with the aim of improving health across the life span through scientific inquiry. It is important to note that the DrNP program is an academic doctorate, requiring the completion of a clinical dissertation. The clinical dissertation is scholarly and is generally completed in one year. It should substantively contribute to nursing science knowledge, but differs both in scope and in its applied emphasis from the typical PhD dissertation.
