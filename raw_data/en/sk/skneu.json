On the Nakai plateau, 1,149 households with approximately 6,340 persons will be relocated from 16 out of the 17 villages over the period 2005-07, due to the inundation to create the Nakai Reservoir. Improving the welfare of families living on the Nakai Plateau has been a joint objective of NTPC and GOL ever since the mandate for the Project's developm ent was agreed to in 1993. The evaluation of sites for resettlement and interaction with the PAP has proceeded in parallel with the development of engineering, environmental and financial plans. Various livelihood programme activities will be offe red to Plateau households being affected by the reservoir, including: The Agriculture and Livestoc k Development Programme, The Forestry Development Programme, and The Reservoir Fisheries Developmen t and Management Programme, The provision of new houses, electricity , domestic water, roads and services. All of the key parties - GOL and NTPC, the financiers, and most of all, the people who live in the project area - have an interest in ensuring that resettlement is implemented in such a way that all families involved are better off than before as a result of the Project. GOL and NTPC have agreed that the approach put forward by the World Bank in its relevant Safeguard Policies is a blueprint for the NT2 Project, with the added goal that all families are to be better off soon afte r relocation, rather than simply restored to their former living conditions. This is considered an appropriate and feas ible objective given the amount of time given to planning, consultation and training prior to the physical relocation of the people, and the considerable budgets allocated to resettlement and social development. Thus, this Social Development Plan (SDP) has been prepared in accordance with the World Bank Safeguard Policies: Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12), Operational Policy on Cultural Property (OP 4.11) and Operational Directive on Indigenous People (OD 4.20), and more recently the ADB Policies on Indigenous Peoples (versions of 1998), Involuntary Resettlement (version of 2003) and Policy on Gender and Development (OM F2). The primary aim of these IFI Policies, and the NT2 plans to address them, is to minimize the impacts on the affected population, to adequately compensate those who are adversely affected by the Project, and to ensure that resettlement is planned and implemente d in a culturally sensitive and optimal manner. In summary, the SDP has been developed under the following guiding principles; Funding is to be assured, the SDP being fully financed by the Project as an essential expenditure; Resettlement planning to be integrated with project design; GOL to develop and adopt the appropriate policies to ensure high standards of resettlement; Resettled people to have thei r living standards and income earning capacity improved; People to be resettled will play an active ro le in the design, planning and implementation; The social and cultural cohesion of villages w ill be maintained and resettl ement sites as near as possible to original villages; Traditional organizational struct ures, religious beliefs and resour ce use will be inco rporated into resettlement planning and implementation; Appropriate consultation and participatory method s, utilizing local knowledge, to be used in developing production systems that suit the people's needs and the environment, and which avoid dependency on project or government agencies; Chapter 10: Geographical Framework, D escription of Impacts and Entitlements November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2 Housing, community buildings, access roads and electricity will be provid ed in all resettlement sites, Irrigation and domestic use water will be supplied; and The planning, implementation and compensation processes w ill be open and transparent. 10.2 GEOGRAPHICAL FRAMEWORK 10.2.1 Surrounding areas The Nam Theun 2 Project (NT2) involves the inundation of part of the Nakai plateau to form a reservoir of maximum surface area of 450 km2 and minimum surface area of about 100 km2 (See Figure 10-1 and Figure 10-2 for current and post-inundation geography of the Nakai Plateau area). The Nakai plateau is situated at abou t 530 EL, and the two features of pa rticular relevance to the plateau resettlement program are: (a) the future Nakai Reservoir; and (b) the Resettlement Area , as defined in PM Decree 193 as abou t 20,000 ha of (largely) forested land on the southern shore of the future reservoir. This future Nakai Reservoir, and the Resettlement Ar ea, are surrounded by the following geographical features (illustrated in Figure 10-3): To the north - northeast is the Nakai Nam Theun National Protected Area (NPA), containing also much of the Nam Theun 2 Waters hed, an area of about 3,554 km 2, largely forested, but also inhabited by about 1,100 families in 31 villages, in 5 main river valleys; To the south-east, and after the drop-off the plateau escarpment, is a large area of limestone karst, which has been designated as the Phu Hin Poun NPA. Between the plateau escarpment drop-off and this limestone large karst area there are two flat valleys inhabited by rice growing villages; To the north-west, and surrounding the north-western part of the reservoir, is the Nam Theun - Phou Hin Poun corridor, connecting the two NPAs mentioned above; Directly south of the resettlement area, down the plateau escarpment, is the flat rice growing areas of the Gnommalath plain, surrounded also by limestone karst. Administratively, the Plateau (and future reservoir and resettlement Areas) is almost entirely located in Nakai District (see Figure 10-4), which itself is surro unded by 4 other Districts, and also borders directly with Vietnam. To the south, Nakai District borders Gnommalat District and to the north Khamkeut District. Nakai District is a new District, as up to the early 1990s Nakai District was part of Gnommalath District and the boundary between the two districts is still in the process of being determined. District maps show that the northern boundary of Gnommalath District actually extending up to the plateau. This is because at the time that Nakai was separated from Gnommalath, Gnommalath villages request ed that they still be given access to some forest on the plateau. This boundary is now under review. Also at the time that Nakai Distri ct was formed, some villages in the lowland area to th e west (between the plateau escarpment and the limestone karst of Ph u Hin Poun NPA) were included in Nakai District. However, an electricity line and a road have rece ntly been supplied to th ese lowland villages from Gnommalath District. In addition, access to these lowland villages from Nakai is via the Nam Malou basin, which will be flooded by the future Nakai reserv oir. Thus, it is most likely that this lowland area and its villages may be excised from Nakai Di strict and added to Gnommalath District. Two of the affected villages, Sop Hia and Nam Nian, are currently located on the north western edge of the plateau, and near the Nakai Dam site, and are actu ally just inside Khamkeut District of Bolikhamxai Province, on the border with Nakai District.

The middle of the area - the flat plateau itself - is formed by Quaternary alluviums. The Resettlement Area will be established mainly on soils derived from the be drock of Lower Cretaceous period, which is composed of fine to medium grained micaceous, quartzose sandstone with some gradation to (see Figure 10-5 and Figure 10-6). 10.2.3 Climate The climate of the area is influen ced by the southwest monsoon (wet season) which normally affects the area from May to October; and by the northeast monsoon (dry season) lasting from November until April (see Chapter 21, Section 2). The average annual rainfall over the Plateau is approximately 2,600 mm per year and at the dam site approximately 2,800 mm per year. Rainfall distribution is markedly seasonal with over 88 % falling between April and September during the southwes t monsoon, and only 12 % falling between October and March during the northeast monsoon. This causes substantially high flows in the Nam Theun in the months of July and August (SMEC March 2003). Climatological data from Nakon Phanom plain, Thailand (across the Mekong River from Thakhek) indicates reduced temperatures from November to February with an average minimum of 14.7 \u00b0C in January. The hottest month is April when temperatures rise to 34.5 \u00b0C on the Nakon Phanom plain. Limited data indicates that mean temperatures on th e Nakai Plateau are about 3-4 \u00b0C cooler, although the temperature difference appears to be higher during the dry season and lower during the wet season. Mean Relative Humidity (RH) declines to below 70 % during the dry season, and exceeds 80 % during the wet season, with a maximum mean of 87 % RH in August. RH data collected by SMEC in 2003 at more elevated locations in the region suggest humidity on the Nakai Plateau is likely to be similar to the Nakon Phanom plain (Thai side of the Mekong River) in the dry season, and probably significantly higher in the wet season. The Thakhek region is more seriousl y affected by the winter monsoon than other regions of Lao PDR. The summer monsoon reaches the region unhindered af ter crossing the overheated plains of Thailand. The monsoon wind speeds of highest frequency are be tween 2 and 4 on the Beaufort Scale (less than 26 km/h). The strongest winds are usually only felt during intense periods of the northeast monsoon. On average, 10 to 12 north-east monsoon events occur each year, generating wind up to approximately 100 km/h. On average, 7 to 10 South China sea typhoons occur each year, and some of these may pass over the ranges and affect the plateau, maybe once or twice a year.

Chapter 10: Geographical Framework, D escription of Impacts and Entitlements November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1010.3 PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE INUNDATION The immediate impact of inundation is that up to 450 km2 of the Nakai Plateau will become covered by the Nakai Reservoir. This will affect forests, wood la nds and agricultural land, and some wetlands, and the terrestrial and aquatic life currently inhabiting the area. At its lowest level at the end of the dry season, the reservoir will recede to a surface area of about 80-100 km2. For more details on these impacts, refer to the Environmental Assessment and Management Plan (EAMP). The crest of the Nakai Dam itself is at 538 EL, but due to back-up effect, the actual level of the water in the reservoir when reservoir is fu ll at Nakai Dam, at 538 EL, maybe be a little more than 538 EL. In addition, in some wetter yea rs, more water will be flowing into the reservoir than is released through the turbines, and thus water will overflow at the Nakai Dam (riparian flow). Thus, in these years, when the reservoir level at the Nakai Dam is > 538 EL, so mewhere between 538 to 539.5, depending on the severity of the wet season, the level of the middle and upper areas of the reservoir would be correspondingly highe r, somewhere between 538+ EL to 39.5+ EL. For this reason, the inundation cut-of f levels for the two main (social) impacts of inundation have been decided as: 538 EL for agricultural lands, on the assumption that these land s can withstand some degree of inundation, in some years; and 540 EL for housing or other permanent structures , on the assumption that these structures should never be affected by flooding. 10.4 SOCIAL IMPACTS RELATED TO THE NAKAI RESERVOIR The main social impacts resulting fr om the inundation of the plateau to form the Nakai Reservoir will be loss of houses, agricultural lands and vegetable garden s, forest land, fishing gr ounds and some small areas cultural heritage. Much of the SDP Volume 2 is dedicated to planning the resettlement of the fifteen (15) villages currently located in the area of the future reservoir, and the two (2) villages loca ted on the edge of the reservoir, and thus partly affected. These villages host about 1,029 households with approx imately 5,678 persons (as of 2003). For a detailed description of the villages and households, which w ill be affected by the formation of the Nakai Reservoir, see Chapter 11 (Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau). An outline of the mitigation and entitlements is provided in Section 10.5. The Plateau will also be the site of some of the construction activities on Project Lands, such as the Nakai Dam, Headrace Channel, Intake Structure, construction of the relocated section of Road 8B, construction of saddle dams at crest level 542.5 EL, and some tunne lling works. The impacts and mitigation of their construction is discussed in Volume 4 of this SDP. 10.4.1 Loss of Houses Inundation will affect houses in 16 villages of the plateaus 17 villages (see Table 10-1). In Oudomsouk, about 94 houses (1998 figure) will be affected and in Phonphanpek no houses will be affected as they are located above the 540 EL. In Nakai Tai and Nakai Ne ua, there are some houses that are above 540 EL and thus not affected - although th ey may still wish to move a short distance depending on the location and layout of the new village, while in the 13 other villages, all houses will be affected and villagers therefore entitled to the full relocation package. 10.4.2 Loss of Agricultural Land and Vegetable Gardens In 2002, the total area under paddy cu ltivation on the Nakai plateau was 91 ha in wet season and 35 ha in dry season, in seven and five of the 17 villages, respectively 1. This area will be inundated by the Nakai Reservoir. It should be noted however, and as can be seen from Table 10-1 that the productivity of these 1 Nakai District Agricultural Office Rice Production Survey, 2002 Chapter 10: Geographical Framework, D escription of Impacts and Entitlements November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 11rice fields is very low - averaging 1.1 t/ha for paddy and abut 0.55 t/ha for upland rice, although these figures do come form a year in which flooding and pest depredation took a heavy toll., as is often the case. Villagers also cultivated about 434 ha of upland rice field (15 villages) , and about 86 ha of corn, 49 ha of cassava and 4 ha of vegetables 2. The majority of these areas will also be lost to inundation. Table 10-1: Indicative Agricultural Lands to be Inundated by the Reservoir, by Village.

Parts of these resources are accessed from within the future inundated area and parts (especially for the NTFPs) come from above the inundation areas, in the Nakai Nam Theun NPA. Refer to the EAMP for detailed info rmation on the loss of forests. 10.4.4 Loss of Fishing Grounds The Nam Theun and it's tributaries are sources of fish and aquatic products, which make up 4 % of income and 6 % of imputed income (1998 census data). Fish and aquatic products are thus an important source of animal protein for many villagers. While curr ent fishing grounds will be lost - inundated - it is expected that the new Nakai Reservoir will be prod uctive and more than co mpensate for this loss. 2 These figures are incomplete as they only cover around half of the villages. Chapter 10: Geographical Framework, D escription of Impacts and Entitlements November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1210.4.5 Loss of Cultural Heritage According to preliminary surveys there are no archaeological or historical sites in the area to be inundated3. However, a few villages have temples, which w ill be moved to the ne w village according to specific cultural procedures. Most graves will be flood ed, but villagers have confirmed that they wish to let the graves remain where they are as long as a ppropriate ceremonies and offerings are made to the ancestors' spirits. These spirits can be moved if proper procedures are followed4. 10.4.6 Health Impacts Possible impacts on villagers health ar e discussed in detail in Chapter 5. 10.4.7 Impacts of Construction period Impacts related to the construction period on the Na kai plateau, including the increase in populations during this time, are discussed in detail a Chapter 44 10.5 MITIGATION AND ENTITLEMENTS 10.5.1 Entitlements The legal entitlements of the PAP affected by the inun dation to create the Nakai Reservoir are specified in the Concession Agreement, Schedule 4, Part 1, and shown in Table 10-2. Table 10-2: Legal Entitlements as De fined in the Conces sion Agreement. 1. Housing: the labour and transportation cost associated with the dismantling of existing house and constructing new one provision of new materials fo r construction of new house electrical wiring and basic fixtures minimum housing area not less than existing area or 42 m\u00b2, whichever is the greater households with 7 or more persons containing two families have the option to have two houses sheds, other outbuildings and fencin g will be provided to the household 2. House/Farm Land: 0.5 ha per household up to 0.15 ha of rice land per household in off village location, to be develope d/allocated on a community basis. In the event less land is available, other liv elihood options will provide re placement. [In the October 2002 CA, this rice land was to be in an 'off village' location and allocated on a community basis. However, wherever possible, this 0.16 ha will be continuous with the above mentioned 0.5 ha, and thus a total of 0.66 ha of irrigated land will be developed and improved] land provided with survey, and joint title to husband and wife house to be constructed in lo cation acceptable to owner. 3. Infrastructure: irrigation water to the house/farm lo t boundary and distribution system irrigation to rice lands year-round household water supply electricity to the house road access to house/farm lot school access within 3km clinic access within 5km 3 Stephen Sparkes (1997): Observati ons Relating to the Resettlement of People on the Nakai Plateau. 4 Stephen Sparkes (1997): Observati ons Relating to the Resettlement of People on the Nakai Plateau. Chapter 10: Geographical Framework, D escription of Impacts and Entitlements November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 134. Services: transportation of all household assets to new location health check of all household me mbers prior to and after move access to RMU for advice access to Grievance Procedure for complaints 5. Cash: one-time cash allowance to cover moving time, disturbance - USD 15 per person compensation for fruit trees lost at district prevailing market prices in case no acceptable replacement trees provided; compensation for standi ng crops at market prices. 6. Production Assistance: effective access to a range of feasible production and income generation options to meet pre-determined household income target, including prod uction forest and Reservoir fisheries tools to work the farm land and forest land planting materials for 3 years after preparatio n of farm lot, including fruit tree saplings fertiliser and other agro-chemicals for 3 years after preparation of farm lot training in farming, forest management and fisheries techniques agricultural advice for 5 years after preparation of farm lot access to identified forests for colle ction of non-timber forest products access to identified Reservoir drawdown areas skills training for wage labour jobs household budgeting training income support program during implementa tion period, at 440 kg of rice per person households with economically inactive members and ot her vulnerable households to participate in the production benefits from communal forests through the provision of a basic needs a llowance as determined by the village. 7. Departees: Those wishing to permanently leave th e District and not move to a resettl ement site will receive a one - time payment for the value of the land, trees, production, an d structures lost, plus transportation and disturbance allowances. Besides the entitlement to 0.66 ha of irrigated agricultural land (point 2 above), it has been decided to allocate two further cropping zones for the purposes of developing and sustaining agriculture production, the reservoir drawdown areas; and 'upland' areas curr ently under degraded forests. Following research and development of rainfed agriculture systems, and if they are shown to be ecological sustainable and productive, the followings entitlements may be fu rther provided in the two zones, as follows; (a) at least 0.5 ha per resettler family of extra rainfed cropping and grazing area, depending on the labour availability and ability of any family to work the land; and (b) at least 1 ha for the first new gene ration from resettler families, To give effectiveness to these entitlements, and obligations on the part of NTPC, a range of programs have been developed and budgets (a nd trailed in Ban Nong Boua, the Pilot village). These programs are detailed in Chapters 19 to 28, and summarised below. 10.5.2 Relocation The proposed NT2 Resettlement Area is situated on th e south west shore of the Nakai Reservoir. Figure 10-2 shows the NT2 Resettlement Area and the proposed locations of th e resettled villages. Efforts have been made to select these resettle ment sites within existing traditio nal territories to ensure cultural continuity and familiarity, which w ill reduce disruption or stress that ma y be created by the resettlement process (see Chapter 19). Chapter 10: Geographical Framework, D escription of Impacts and Entitlements November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 14 Table 10-3 shows the distance the resettlers will have to move to their new village locations. Ten of the villages will be moving 3.5 km or less from their current location. Three will move 10-15 km, while two villages will remain at their present location. For the two villages in Khamkeut District a decision on relocation site is still to be made. The resettlement sites comply with village desires to be near the future reservoir, near an all-weather road, near their present locations, near the forest and near land that can be used for growing rice. Because all the sites are adjacent to Nakai Reservoir, they will have access to the drawdown area, which is expected to be agriculturally productive in the dry season as the reservoir recedes, and also has potential for grazing.

Therefore, most resettlement sites will require minimal clearing of vegetation. The establishment of agricultural livelihoods and construction of resettlement sites give rise to some environmental concerns an d these are addressed in Environmen tal Assessment and Management Plan (EAMP). The construction of the villages will provide sk illed work for the people to be resettled, and this will assist in their participation in determining their own priorities and preferen ces for village and house layout. Chapter 19 of this SDP details the si te selection process and villager preferences. 10.5.3 Livelihood Options The SDP presents four main livelihoods options: for agriculture, livestock raising, reservoir fisheries, and commercial forestry These four main livelihood options have been de signed with the objectives of providing maximum flexibility to the resettlers in terms of: (a) adapting to changes in farming sy stems and other livelihoods, and (b) income rehabilitation. The livelihood options for the relocated villagers are fully discussed in Chapters 21 to 25. In addition to direct farm, forest or fisheries based livelihoods, the v illagers, especially those with spare labour or specific skills, will be supported and traine d to seek an income and livelihood from a range of other service or business enterprise s )off-farm employment), such as: tailoring and weaving; small machine repair and spare parts shops (pushbikes, motorb ikes, power tillers, etc.); small goods shops; marketing - buying and selling local pr oduce (fish, vegetable, crops, etc.); processing of locally produced produce; employment on the NPVFA; employment in the NT2 project facilities (guards, gardeners, boatmen, etc.); taxi and boat taxi drivers; other service related to tourism; and construction-related unskilled and semi-skilled labour. 10.5.4 Infrastructure and Facilities NTPC is committed to providing both the infrastruc ture and facilities for th e resettled communities. Each resettled family will be provided with 0.5 ha of cleared land for crops, vege table gardens, fruit trees and 0.16 ha for irrigated rice fields, a total of 0.66 ha of irrigated agricultural land. NTPC will be responsible for the installation, and the GoL will supp ort (with funds from the Social and Environmental Remediation Fund, SERF) the operation and maintenance of a reliable pumped irrigation water supply to these agricultural lands. A separate house block of approximately 0.12 - 0.15 ha will also be provided, in a village layout, and NTPC will support the villagers to construct new hou ses for each family. Domestic water supply systems Chapter 10: Geographical Framework, D escription of Impacts and Entitlements November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 16will be developed and electricity will be supplied to the houses. Furthermor e, roads, schools and community buildings will be constructed. A transformer with sufficient capacity to supply up to 20 MW will be located at the power station at a cost of about USD 1.3 million. This will facilitate th e use of electric irrigation pumps and will provide a more economic, convenient and reliable electric wate r supply. This power supply should also lead to improvements in nutrition and hygiene and in education. ********** * * * ********** Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 iCHAPTER 11 BASELINE DATA - NAKAI PLATEAU Table of Content 11 BASELINE DATA - NAKAI PLATEAU ..................................................................1 11.1 DATA COLLECTION METHODS ....................................................................................1 11.1.1 Baseline Surveys ............................................................................................................... .................................1 11.1.2 Participatory Approaches....................................................................................................... ..........................1 11.2 DEMOGRAPHIC BASELINE .......................................................................................... 2 11.2.1 Villages Affected by the Reservoir............................................................................................. .....................2 11.2.2 Households Affected by the Rese rvoir - 'Eligibility by Impa ct' ................................................................2 te of ff Date'............................................................................... ...........3 11.2.4 Population growth .............................................................................................................. ..............................6 11.2.4.1 Relo cation and House Ir rigated Agricult ure Program ........................................................8 11.2.4.3 Households eligible for the Fore stry and Fisher ies Prog rams....................................................9 11.2.5 Vulner able Popu lations............................................................................................. ..................10 11.3 ETHNIC BASELINE .....................................................................................................13 11.4 HOUSEHOLD INCOME ...............................................................................................15 11.5 LIVELIHOOD ACTIVITIES ...........................................................................................15 11.5.1 Agricultural Produc tion........................................................................................................ ..........................15 11.5.2 Livestock and 11.5.3 Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP).............................................................................................. ...........20 11.5.4 Forestry Resources of the Resettlem ent Area.................................................................................... .........21 11.5.5 Fisheries...................................................................................................................... ......................................22 11.6 EDUCATION ...............................................................................................................22 11.7 GENDER .....................................................................................................................23 List of Tables Table 11-1: Historic Demographic Da ta of Plateau Households (1995 - 1998), and 2003 Census and Eligible Households............................................................................................................ ............. 5 Table 11-2: Households Eligible to Participate in Housing Re-estab lishment Program and Irrigated Agriculture Programme (figure in brackets).

The Public Consultation, Participation and Disclosure (PCPD) Process (see Chapter 4) is continuing throughout the resettlement and livelihood development processes to help identify needs and solutions to potential problems. Various methodologies have been employed in assembling more quantitative baseline data for the residents of the Nakai Plateau, which would be sued for planning and then implementation purposes. The baseline data collected in surveys an d questionnaires to date consist of: 1. Household surveys of economic assets were firs t carried out by the LWU in 1995 and then by CARE, using Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) technique s in 1996. These studies listed the assets and the main socio-economic features of residents of the Nakai Plateau. 2. The Notification and Assets Re gistration was conducted by the RMU in October 1998. These formed the baseline of all entitled households on the Nakai Plateau (see Appendix H). The census included an assessment of potential assets that wo uld lost due to inundati on, including land area, population, houses, fruit trees, cattle, wells, roads, etc. The results of this census formed the basis for eligibility for entitlements, and for calculating compensation for individuals, households and villages as described in the various iterations of the RAP/SDP. 3. At the same time as the Census, a socio-economic survey was carried out using a random sample of 320 households, and this formed the basis for deve loping the economic tar get and the livelihood rehabilitation plan for the resettler s (see Chapter 25 and Appendix H). 4. The 2003 population census undertaken to determine the rate of increase in eligible populations (natural growth) and new immigrants. It was later decided that this would also be the new cut-off date census for plateau populations. 5. An on-going assessment of the productive capacity of the proposed new resettlement areas (in terms of both the land, forest and water resources), and the subsequent identification of land use options and selection of resettlement sites (see Chapter 19). The methodologies for each of the surveys differ to some extent. The NTPC survey produced statistical records of the affected populations, while the CARE study ut ilized Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) techniques and examined themes relating to livelihood and ethnicity. The PCPP reports were the result of applying Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tech niques, which recorded villagers' attitudes and expectations as well as updating statistical information on population and household numbers Baseline data and feedback from participants will continue to be collected from ongoing studies and fieldwork on all aspects of proposed livelihoods, and from the pilot village and demonstration farms experience. 11.1.2 Participatory Approaches In addition to surveys, a number of participatory a pproaches have been used to collect qualitative data and to facilitate a realistic interpretation of survey data. Both anthropological and consultation team field visits utilized participatory methods (CARE 1996, NTEC 1997 and 1998). The fo llowing participatory methods were used throughout the preparation of the RAP: In-depth interviews of individuals and families were carried out on several occasions in order to obtain additional information relating to individual household economics, social organization, cultural practices, gender relations and resource use. Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2 Discussions with local leaders were carried out on several occa sions throughout the consultation process and during all studies in order to update statistics on village population, migration patterns and relationships between traditional and formal positions of authority within the villages. Discussion with ritual practitioners was carried out in order to assess cultural practices, rituals relating to relocation, territorial spirits and religious beliefs that could affect resettlement. Participant observation was conducted in all villages during anthropological field visits starting from 1996 onwards, and by PCPP Teams in 1997 an d 1998 and by consultation teams in 2004. This involved staying in villages for seve ral days and nights in order to ob serve first-hand village life and routines and to establish trust and affirm conclusions of the quantitative surveys. Informal discussions were held with many villagers in orde r to gain insights into local aspirations and the potential challenges of the resettlement plan. Study teams comprised government officials from the RMU, LWU and Institute for Cultural Research, Ministry of Information and Culture as well as consultant anthropologists. Participatory rural appraisal techniques were used in 1997 and 1998 as part of the gender- sensitive consultation process. This involved la nd use mapping, designing \"dream villages\", prioritizing livelihood options, village layout, and house designs. Groups of men and women discussed various aspects of the draft re settlement plans and provided feedback. The above described participatory ap proaches and methods have also been utilized during the recent consultations of June-August 2004 as described in Chapter 4. All these various types of data have been cross-checked and integrated into the resettlement plans in an attempt to fulfil the consultation and planning criteria in regard to consideration of the cultural and socio- economic needs of ethnic minorities as required under OD 4.20 and ADB Policy on consultations. 11.2 DEMOGRAPHIC BASELINE 11.2.1 Villages Affected by the Reservoir The villages affected by inundation of the Nakai Plateau have changed little since the mid 1990s. The main changes relate to abandoned hamlets (Ban Nya Long, Ban Tham On and Ban Pakkatan May) and relocated hamlets. These hamlets are small settlements which ar e not officially recognized as a village, but are part of a larger village. Thus, as of 2003, ther e are 17 recognized villages, of which 15 will be fully affected by reservoir inundation and 2 villag es partially affected (see Section 11.2.2). In Phonphanpek and Oudomsouk villages, only a part of the village population will be affected and eligible for the various livelihood programmes in that only some of the houses in Oudomsouk are below 540 EL and will thus be relocated, while very few Phonphanpek village houses are below 540 EL. 11.2.2 Households Affected by the Rese rvoir - 'Eligibility by Impact' Results of population (and socio-economic) surv eys conducted from 1995 to 1998 by CARE International, PCPP teams and the RMU are summarized in Table 11-1, together with a survey conducted out by Nakai District assisted by RMU and NTPC in 2003. The number of affected households has increased both because of natural population increase and some in-migration into the region but also due to experience gained in designing and conducting surveys, leading to more comprehensive data collection on th e Plateau in the 1998 and 2003 Census undertakings. The RMU Census of October 1998 is the most detailed effort to co llect population and socio-economic information. The 2003 census was equa lly detailed, but it concentrated only populations. In both cases the surveys identified total persons and households, and thus impacted fully or part ially by the project. Of the 17 Plateau villages, 15 will be fully impacted an d thus fully eligible, an d 2 partially impacted. Note: there are two type o f'eligibilit y': (a) eligible in terms of be ing impacted - flooded - by the project (some families in Oudomsouk and Phonephanpek are not impacted and thus not eligible); and (b) eligible in terms of a Project cut-off date. Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3 In Oudomsouk, it was estimated in 1998 that of the 283 families in the town, 94 families' dwellings were to be inundated. However, it is not clear if the level of inund ation used was 538n EL or 540 EL. 538 EL is the crest height of the Nakai dam, and it is assumed that agricultural land can be developed down to this elevation. However, in those years in which water will flow over (through) the Nakai dam (when water flowing into the Nakai reservoir is more than is being released via the turb ines, the reservoir height may be at higher than 538 EL, somewhere between 53 8 EL and about 539 + because of backwater effect, and depending on the amount of 'excess' rain in any wet season. Thus, it has been decided that houses should not be constructed below 540 EL. Based on this, it can be assu med that houses (or other structures) currently existi ng below 540 EL would be subject to inun dation and thus must be relocated. Irrespective of whether the 1998 Census used 538 EL or 540 EL, the actual definition of these levels in 1998 was based on 5 m interval contour lines derived fr om aerial photos and some spot survey heights. Topographic surveys being un dertaken in 2004 will provide more accu rate maps with 0.5 m contours and thus a clearer picture of which dwellings and othe r buildings are below 540 EL. Thus, these 94 families registered in 1998, and which have now naturally expanded to 110 is, at this stage, an estimate only. Also in 1998, 25 families of Ban Ou domsouk were assessed to have ag ricultural land that would be inundated. Again, this figure is indicative only, and the Oudomsouk families whose agricultural lands will be inundated, and thus eligible fo r the livelihood restoration program, will only be know following the detailed topographic survey. Ban Phonephanpek villagers are a combination of: a) Families resettled in 1993 under a BPKP scheme, in which families from the Plateau and watershed were invited to join the BPKP reforestation prog ram, as labourers. Unfortunately, this program was not successful and the families, once moved into Ph onephanpek village, we re left without a livelihood. They thus resorted to shifting cultivation and gathering of forest products, often from as far as the southern edge of the Nakai Na m Theun NBCA. These families live in the 45 houses constructed in the hamlet Ban Jut Sun by BPKP, using softwoods, and the houses are now in poor condition, and electricity was never supplied to these villages. b) Families from other source s, not living in the Ban Jut Sun, bu t spread out over the general area They may be farmers, public servants, business people, or a combination. Ban Phonephanpek is above the 540 EL level, and will thus not require actual relocation, but the NT2 Project will assist to repair their houses, install ceme nt footings, and provide el ectricity. Of other families in Phonphanpek, a certain - currently undefined - number of dwellings may be inundated at below 540 EL and thus require relocation. With respect to agricultural lands, the current planning assumes that most of the village's agricultural lands will be inundated and thus the villagers will be eligible to participate in the livelihood restoration program. This needs to be confirmed. 11.2.3 Household Eligibility in terms of 'Cut-off Date' Up until early 2004, the 1998 census was regarded as the NT2 Projects cut-off date for eligibility and inclusion in the plateau resettlement program. Only those families registered in 1998, plus the natural growth of these families and establishment of new fa milies from at least one member of these original eligible families would be eligible. New immigr ants after that date would not be eligible. A population census was conducted in August 2003 in order to: (a) establish the rate of natural growth of eligible families, (b) establish how many non-eligib le immigrants - those entering the plateau after the 1998 census - where on the plateau. The census was undertaken by District staff, led by the District police (who are responsible for records of populations, issuance of household books and citizen cards) and the District administration, following training from NTPC staff. The results of that census are shown in Table 11-1. Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 4During this 2003 census, the registr ation lists and the assets registrati on books issued in the 1998 census were used by the team, with each fa mily, to decide if they were eligib le in terms of the 1998 census. That is, all the villagers aware fully aware that, as of the actual time of the census in 2003, the policy was that new immigrants (unrelated to level 1 to 1998 eligible families) would not be elig ible for the resettlement program - in accordance with the policy at that time. Following review of the data and the issues by GOL, NTPC and IFI's, a decision was made to accept all people residing on the plateau (all those who are actually impacted by the project) as of the 2003 census date as those eligible for participation in the re settlement program. That is, not only the 1998 eligible families, their progeny and their new families, bu t also new immigrants would now be eligible. This 2003 census date is the latest and most reasonable census to judge cut-off as, starting in early 2004, various people have and continue to enter the plateau to seek opportunities related to the PCA activities. The program to disclosure and inform all those eligible as of July 2003, and info rm that any new immigrants after that date would not be considered, except if adjudicated on a case by case basis by the NT2 Project Grievance Committee, w ill follow the following steps: (i) The Resettlement Committee issues a notice of the cut off date. (ii) The NTPC produces: (a) a village by village list of all families and fam ily members of eligible families as of 2003; (b) a village by village book of eligible fa mily members, for use by each VRC; (c) a family registration card. (iii) Consultation teams, together with relevant District authorities will then: convene a meeting in each village to explain ( a) the new cut-off date, and (b) any family can make a claim (grievance) if they feel they should be included on the census list; ensure that the village lists are posted in the Village Notice Board and Village Consultation Centres; ensure that the census book is provided to the VRC; and ensure that each family registration card is delivered to each family.

There has been some in-migration from the Ba n Lak Sao area recorded in the Bolikhamxay Province villages of Ban Nam Nian and Ban Sop Hia. There has al so been a significant increase in population in Ban Oudomsouk, the Nakai District centre, from 167 house holds in 1995 to 283 at the time of the 1998 census. Several households from villages located on th e Plateau have relocated to Ban Oudomsouk to be close to markets and services. In-migration from the Nakai Nam Theun NBCA is also a factor, although not as significant as in-migration from other areas. As described above, the population as of August 2003 is the baseline or cut-off population of eligible households. However, by the time that relocation and the development of the modified livelihoods are initiated, these populations will have grown due to (a) births and (b) ma rriages. Such natural growth in the number of eligible families must be accounted for in the planning of the various livelihood programmes in the SDP. Predicted future growth The future projections for illegible populations for each of the housing and livelihood programs (see Table 11-2 and Table 11-3) are based on the 2003 figures multiplied by an assumed average rate of natural increase in population of 3 % per annum (but not including in-migration). The eligible population projections shown in the various livelihood activity support programmes differ depending on the year that the village is actually relocated and particularly the year that the particular livelihood program comes on stream. However, it should be noted that irrespective of predicted population increases, the housing and livelihood programs will be provided to all and any el igible persons present at the time that the actual program is implemented. Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7Figure 11-1: Illustration of Populat ion Increase - Natural and Migratory, on the Nakai Plateau, 1998 to 2003 Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 811.2.4.1 Prediction of Households eligible for Relocation and House Construction Program Households eligible for new housing will be, logically enough, those that are predicted to be flooded by the Nakai Reservoir. This will include all households in 15 villages, and around 40 % of the households in Oudomsouk village. Ban Phonphanpek w ill not be flooded and villagers from this village are therefore not eligible for new housing. The number of houses to actually be moved and re-established will depend on the natural growth of households in each village, at the time of reloc ation - which will be phased over 2 years. Using: (a) the 2003 census data as the baseline or cut off date for population/household numbers; and (b) an average growth rate of 3.0 % per year the current scheduling for house relocation, the numb er of households, which may need relocation, in 2005 and 2006 (including those already moved under th e pilot village program) will be about 1,149 in total, as shown in Table 11-2.

It is assumed that none of th e remaining households in Oudomsouk have agriculture, forestry or fisheries activities, which will be affected by the reservoir. The number of households to actually be given a plot of irrigated land, and to participate in other aspects of the irrigated agriculture program will again depend on (a) the natural growth of households in each Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 9village and (b) the time of relocati on and development of the agricultural land, which will also be phased over 2 years. Using an average growth rate of 3.0 % per year, and based on the current scheduling for village relocation, the number of households, whic h may participate in the agricultural development program, starting from 2005-2006, plus the already moved pilot village, will be about 1,188 households (see Table 11-2). 11.2.4.3 Households eligible for the Fo restry and Fisheries Programs Those eligible to participate in the Community Commercial Forestry Program will be all those villages and households affected, in some way, by reservoir flooding, including all the households of Phonphanpek village and those households of Ban Oudomsouk whose rural based livelihoods are impacted by the flooding. The Forestry program has co mmenced already in 2004, and all villages ar e included in this activity as of that date, as this program is indepe ndent of the date of relocation. In 2004, the number of households to actually participate in and benefi t from the forestry program was 1, 133 as shown in Table 11-3. That is, there will be 1133 shares of the Community Forestry i ssued to the 1,133 eligible families. The forestry entitlement - the right to receive a dividend from the profits of forestry on the Resettlement Area activities - is not only provided to all resettler families, but it can be handed down from generation to generation, but sharing of an original familie s 'share' amongst the new generation. These shares can be inherited but not sold. Table 11-3: Households Eligible to Particip ate in NT2 Forestry and Reservoir Fisheries Programs.

In 2003, the number of houses thus eligible was 1,100. The number of households to actually participate in and benefit from the fisheries program will be those eligible as of 2009, when the Nakai Reservoir will be f illed and the reservoir fisheries program initiated. As shown in Table 11-3, this is estimated to be 1,315 households. Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1011.2.5 Occupations of Plateau populations The RMU Census of October 1998 also investigated the occup ations of all plateau persons at that time. The data for adult persons, as represented in Figure 11-2 shows that in most villages, farmers make up more than 80 % of the adult population. Oudomsouk and partly Phonephanpek have relatively more villagers who are occupied with othe r activities such as construction, service and trading, small business, forestry employment and handicraft. The figures excl ude school children, students, house wives, civil servants and unemployed. 11.2.6 Potentially Vulnerable Populations Some Project-affected households may be particularly vulnerable for a number of reasons, including the following characteristics: Widow headed households; Handicapped persons as household members, or as head of the family; Female headed households (but working-age males as members); Male head of household being over 60; Single person households. The 1998 census found that approxim ately 207 households or approximately 23 percent of the resettler population on the Nakai Plateau qualify as Potentially Vulnerable Households (PVH) in one or more of these categories (see Table 11-4). Although there is no evident correlation in the table between current economic circumstances and vulnerability, poverty is still considered likely to increase a family's potential vulnerability. As the majority of a ll affected households are below the La o poverty line, income levels will be monitored during implementation and economic vulnerability will be considered in the overall livelihood planning process. Given this additional focus on econom ic vulnerability, the preliminary categorization presented in Table 11-4 should be consid ered merely as a conservative benchmark estimate. Another factor affecting vulnerabilit y may be ethnicity. Although the livelihood systems of all ethnic groups on the Nakai Plateau are similar, some of the Vietic groups have only recently taken up swidden agriculture and discontinued their traditional hunting and gathering. The Ahoe of Sop Hia and other villages were resettled on the Plateau 20 years ago af ter the Second Indochina Wa r and have adapted after a long period of settlement in lo wland areas during the war. Howeve r, a few Kri and Ph\u00f4ng families are recent arrivals from the catchment area and are likely to find adaptation to the proposed livelihood system more challenging. They may lack the necessary skills, knowledge and experience in farming techniques, have the lowest levels of rice self -sufficiency, and may still rely on hu nting and gathering to some extent. The majority of the Vietic groups on the Plateau are not considered particularly vulnerable - less that 20 families are recent arrivals (within the last 10 years). Special measures for dealing with the special char acteristics and needs of potentially vulnerable households are presented in Chapter 26.

Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1311.3 ETHNIC BASELINE The population of the Nakai Plateau and a number of groups in the downstream areas qualify as \"indigenous peoples\" or ethnic minorities according to World Bank criteria as outlined in Operational Directive 4.20 and ADB's policy on Indigenous Peoples. These groups exhibit aspects of a distinct social and cultural identity in comparison with the majority Tai-Lao ethnic groups. In the Lao PDR, the term \"ethnic group\" ( xon phao ) is used to describe all groups in the country, but a distinction can be made between the major group ( Lao Loum ), who primarily inhabit lowland areas, cultivate paddy rice, practice Buddhism and are more developed in terms of integration into the mainstream economy, and other - minority - groups ( xon phao noy ). The NT2 Project area is populated by a range of ethnic groups, including various Lao Loum types and groups that belong to the Mon-Khmer ( Lao Theung ) ethno-linguist group. A detailed account of ethnicity is provided in Chapter 12. According to Chapter 12 there are five main ethnic groups on the Plateau: Brou or Makong of the West Kautic branch of the Mon-Khmer ethno-linguistic family, belong to the official classification of Mon-Khmer, commonly referred to as Lao Theung (upland Lao). Tai Bo, who may well have originally been Vietic but have adopted Tai-Lao culture and languages, also classified Tai-Lao (referred to as Lao Loum or lowland Lao) macro-group. Upland Tai groups, mostly Tai Moey and Tai M\u00e8ne, who are recent arrivals. Vietic groups (Ahoe, Kri, Ph\u00f4ng, and other smaller groups) belonging to the Mon-Khmer ethno- linguistic family. A few members of the Sek ethno-linguistic group, an ancient branch of the Tai-Kadai language family, originally from what is now the Nakai-Nam Theun NPA. Characteristics of the ethnic group communities affected by the NT2 Project which indicate that they qualify under the World Bank policie s on indigenous peoples include: 1. All villagers indicate the desire to remain on the Plateau, indicating a strong sense of belonging to the region and attachment to the resources available in the forests and rivers. In addition, there are demarcations of territory according to the range of influence of territorial spirits ( phi muang ). 2. All Nakai groups define themselves as distinct cultural groups by na me, but there is also a tendency for villagers to class themselves as Lao Theung , with the exception of the Ta i in-migrants, in relation to the dominant culture of the lowlands. The actu al differences between the various groups on the Plateau are less important than differences with the Lao Loum lowlanders. 3. The indigenous languages on the Plateau and in downstream areas are being replaced by Tai and Lao dialects that are mutually intelligible for lowl anders. There are, however, still many bilingual speakers. 4. The number of customary social and political institutions has been reduced with the integration into the Lao State. There are, however, councils of elders ( thau khon ) who oversee socio-cultural events such as marriages, funerals and collective rituals. In addition, in several villages there are hereditary positions of mediums ( mo thiem ) and ritual priests ( mo phi ) who perform local rituals and ceremonies, which differ from lowland rituals to some extent. 5. All the communities affected by the proposed re settlement have primarily subsistence-oriented economies consisting of upland rice, livestock and forest products. The surpluses of forest products and occasionally livestock are sold to merchants in Ban Oudomsouk for cash or bartered for rice. Few families have much in the way of consumer goods but demand is growing. The population of the Nakai Plateau that is to be re settled is presented in terms of ethno-linguistic categories in Table 12-2 and Table 12-3. The ethnic gr oups of the Nakai Plateau should be considered as Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 14\"indigenous peoples\", according to the World Bank OD 4.20 and ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples.1 The distinctions between groups are perhaps less significant than the contrast between the inhabitants of the Nakai Plateau and the dominant lowland cultures. Th e process of integration of these groups into the dominant culture has been occurring for some time and is ongoing. The Project will likely accelerate this process, and local villagers express a desire to see progress and to improve their standards of living, as revealed by the consultation process since 1997. It would not be possible to insulate these ethnic minorities culturally and economically from the outside or from the influence of outsiders. A preferable approa ch is to offer them the social and economic means with which they can participate in national development on a par with the majority groups in towns and in lowland areas to the south of the Nakai Plateau. Economic improvement can only serve to preserve the social structure of villages and preserve some of the cultural diversity of the region. Measures to strengthen existing village structures and aspects of local cultures such as house design have been integrated into the RAP. Ritual procedures concerning moving houses and villages will be incorporated into the resettlement process. Brou or Makong and the various Vietic speakers ar e all recognized by the Lao government as ethnic minorities. The Tai Bo appear to be a hy brid group, classified officially as Lao Loum but often referring to themselves as Lao Theung and indigenous to the Nakai Plateau (Tai Nakai). The distinctions between the groups, however, are becoming difficult to define due to increased inter-marriage, the common use of Lao language, the adoption or hybridisation of Lao culture - which is not so different from their original cultures in many respects. The area has been subjected to numerous, and often significant in- and outward, migrations over the last 200 years, so that the distinctions be tween ethnic minorities has become less clearly defined. In addition, the people of the Plateau have long been exposed to localized social disruption due to war, invasion, epidemics and physical relocation due to the practice of shifting cultivation. One can speak of a \"Nakai culture\", a kind of melting-pot culture, consisting of a shared material culture, common socio-religious beliefs and livelihood systems. There are a number of b ilingual speakers but the majority speaks dialects of Tai languages akin to lowland Lao dialects. Upland Ta i groups have migrated mostly from Khamkeut to the Plateau after 1995. The ethnic situation on the Plateau is further complicat ed by the considerable intermarriage and a shared culture. Most of the original distinguishing features of the ethnic minorities such as language, material culture, house design and ritual practice have merged. In many cases, families of these ethnic minorities exist in name only, with little or no distinguishing features from their immediate neighbours on the Plateau. Hence the emphasis is on the differences between the Nakai Plateau peoples and the dominant majority Lao culture rather than between th e Nakai Plateau ethnic minorities themselves. Health and education facilities on the Plateau are scarce, and the physical isolation of many of the villages, some of which are only accessible by boat, make it ev en more difficult for childre n to go to school and for sick people to see a doctor or health worker. Of th e 20 communities (villages and hamlets) expected to be resettled, only 7 villages have scho ols, two of which have not been op erational since 1997 due to lack of teachers. Even when children have access to school, th ey often stop attending at an early age in order to help their families economically. The district centre of Ban Oudomsouk is populated by recent migrants from all over the country. The majority are Tai Lao and Lao Kaleung from Khammouane Province to the south and Tai from Bolikhamxay Province to the north. These migrants work mainly as wage labourers in construction and forestry as well as running the majority of restaurants and shops in town. 1 The exception is a number of recent economic in-migrants from Khamkerd who have arrived in the villages of Sop Hia and Nam Nian over the last ten years and recent Lao in migration to Plateau, mainly to Oudomsouk and Phonphanpek. These groups, although they are not 'ethnic minorities', will still be entitled to all the benefits of the resettlement and rehabilitation package. Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1511.4 HOUSEHOLD INCOME Table 11-5 shows the cash and imputed household income on the Nakai Plateau based on two household surveys - CARE in 1996 and the RMU in 1998. Comparison of the two surveys shows a fourfold increa se in average household income in a little over two years in local currency. However, inflation between 1996 and 1998 was high and accounts for approximately 50 percent of the nominal increase of Kip 1.4 million. Average household income in both years is still well below the national poverty line of US$ 780 (in 2004) for the average Plateau-family size of 5.3 persons.

In addition there has been do mestic price inflation and a devaluing of the Kip in comparison to the US Dollar so that there is a s light decrease in dollar terms from US$ 462 to US$ 449. Some changes in the sources of income should be noted. There is a mark ed increase in wage labour as well as income from work for rice programs. This contrasts with the d ecrease in reliance on NTFPs, most likely due to a scarcity of some items on the Nakai Plateau. In addition, some affected areas of Oudomsouk and Phonphanpek (Ban Jat San) v illages were included in the 1998 survey for the first time. 11.5 LIVELIHOOD ACTIVITIES 11.5.1 Agricultural Production Plateau communities have traditionally had a mixed economy that included swidden rice, fish, livestock, hunting and gathering forest products, all primarily for household use. In recent years, increases in Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 16population, a shortened swidden cycle, and exposure to cash commodities, have spawned more intensive and extensive exploitation of the forest for its market able products. Soil fertility, labour availability, access to a reliable water supply and the ava ilability of draft animals and manure are all factors contributing to yield. Average yields in the area are generally in the range of 0.8 ton per hectare for upland and 1.5 to 2.0 tons per hectare for rainfed paddy rice. Paddy producti on is restricted by the av ailability of fertile non- flooded flat land. Vegetables are mainly grown on sw idden fields close to the homestead, in the garden plots next to the house or along riverbanks. The main crops include cabbage, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, beans and pumpkin. Tobacco is sometimes grown in these gardens, mostly for home consumption. With the aid of mechanical power and/or access to a reliable water supply for irrigation, maximum land use could be expanded beyond the present average cultivation area, which is probably less than one hectare per family. The size of family land-holdings vari es from 0.4 ha to 2.4 ha. Generally, large holdings are less intensively cultivated, due largely to a lack of available labour and/or draft power (buffalo and/or power tillers). The shift from an almost entirely subsistence economy to a somewhat more commercial one has been promoted by in-migrants. These ne wcomers arrived when Oudomsouk v illage became the Nakai District centre in the early 1990s, as labour fo r earlier government sponsored logging , or came in search of land or other economic benefits. They generate a buying market for items such as vegetables, meat and forest products. Even with the growth in other sectors, agriculture st ill dominates the Plateau economy, with rice being the main crop grown. Although all villagers attempt to grow rice, only 17 % of families are able to produce sufficient rice for a full year (see Ta ble 11-6), and about half of all families have a rice deficit for more than six months. Most families consider rice cultivati on their main 'occupation', probably testifying more to the cultural significance of rice than to its occupational dominance. There is no major difference in rice deficiency be tween ethnic groups. The onl y tendency towards less deficiency is for the Vietic group, which has 39 % of households with rice sufficiency and 'only' 31 % with rice deficiency for 6-8 months. Table 11-6: Rice Deficiency on the Nakai Plateau, 1996 Percentage of households rice deficient by number of months Ethnic group Sufficient Deficit <3 m Deficit 3-6m Deficit 6-8 m Deficit >8m Total Bo 17 6 15 62 0 100 Brou 6 17 34 19 21 97 Vietic 39 10 20 31 0 100 New Villages 32 16 9 13 27 97 Average 17 12 22 36 13 100 The total cultivated area in 2002 was approximately 700 ha, with rice ac counting for about 80 % of this (see Table 11-7). Paddy rice is not a large contributor to total production (< 20 %) due to the low yields associated with this type of cultivation under rainfed conditions. Upland rice production also continues to decline because of government policy to reduce shifting agriculture, poor soils and alternating flood and drought.

Even in normal rainfall years, a significant proportion of the planted area is totally lost to flooding, and yield reductions from both prolonged inundation and el ephant damage can be expected (see Table 11-8). According to this survey only 192 tons of the 983 tons required (20 %) can be obtained from the Plateau. Table 11-8: Rice Growing Areas Destroyed by Flood and Elephants, Nakai Plateau 2002 Total production incl. losses to flooding & elephants1 Total area planted Area un- harvestable due to flooding Harvestable area Un-milled rice Milled rice Total rice required Annual rice deficiency Crop ha ha ha t t/ha t t t WS Paddy 90.8 30.0 60.8 64.2 1.06 38.5 DS 2002 1 Conversion of Un-milled Paddy to Milled Rice using a factor of 0.6 The soils on the Plateau are heavily leached, suscepti ble to erosion, with low pH, low organic matter content and poor buffering capaciti es. They are also low in macro-nutr ients, particularly phosphorous. The 'A' horizons are typically shallow (less than 30 cm), with soil textures ranging from fine sandy loam to fine sandy clay loam, and clay contents between 20 % and 35 %. Insect pests, rat damage and poor planting material also contribute to low rice yields on the Plateau. For further details, refer to Chapter 21 and Appendix K). 11.5.2 Livestock and Animal Husbandry Buffalo are the dominant type of large livestock raised on the plateau. The total number of buffalo in the villages to be resettled was 4146 acco rding to the 1998 census, and 4,168 he ad according to District data as of 2003 figure (see Table 11-9).

Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 19The 1998 survey found that, on averag e, buffalo ownership per family was 3.6 buffaloes per household (see Table 11-9). However, these averages mask the reality that the ownership is very skewed, with relatively few households (358, or 30 %) raising 3 or more buffaloes, only 11 % of the households owning over 10, and 59 % of the households owning no buffaloes, as shown in Figure 11-3.

Due to disastrous flooding and the su bsequent lack of rice in 1996, many animals were sold in order to purchase food. Indeed, buffalo are kept largely as a st ore of wealth for use in times of need, rather than being considered as a resource managed for regular income. A small proportion of adult animals are used for draft purposes in thos e villages with permanent rice fields, and there is also some rental of draft animals to lowland farmers for land preparation in Gnommalat. Table 11-10 shows the sale of buffaloes and cattle from the 15 Nakai villages during the years 2000-04. Cattle and buffaloes are allowed free-range access to gr ass-fields and forest areas, but are excluded from rice fields and gardens during periods of cultivation. Taking into account all possible grazing areas, stocking rates could be as low as 1 animal to 20 hectares, but is likely to be much higher due to the way each herd is managed at the village le vel. It is evident that stocking r ates are higher in the Ban Nakai Neua and Ban Nakai Tai area, with a stocking rate closer to 1 animal to 4 ha. Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 20During the dry season, animals are grazed, largely unatte nded, in forest areas. During the wet season, they are commonly placed in a penned ar ea at night within the village to pr event damage to crops. There is no supplementary feeding of improved forage, nor management of natural forage through controlled grazing of different areas at different times of the year. A shortage of feed is reported by some farmers from March to May, corresponding with the middle to the end of the dry season, but this appears to be as much a function of how far farmers are prepared to graze their animals away from the village, as it is an absolute shortage of feed. Periodic outbreaks of Haemorrhagic Septicaemia, Foot and Mouth Disease and Blackleg with high losses are reported. Vaccination rates are low. Mortality rates in calves (0-1 years) of up to 50 % are reported. Liver fluke is also reported to be a problem in buffalo that have been rented out to farmers in the lowlands. Drenching for endoparasites is not practiced, and there appears to be no use of any other animal health remedies. Table 11-10: Sale of Buffaloes and Cattle in Nakai District, 2000-2004.

Many households would like to own cattle in preference to buffalo, citing higher productivity, higher calf survival and easier management; but have difficulty of obtaining breeding stock. Pigs are owned by most households, mainly to recycle wastes and as an income generating activity, but also for slaughter for household consumption and for use on ceremonial occasions. The only breed evident is of local origin, black and relatively small. In general pigs are not housed but are left to forage, with minimal supplementary feeding of rice bran, reject corncobs, banana and palm stems, tuberous and aquatic plants, and household scraps. Periodic outbreaks of swine fever are reported, with very high losses. Vaccination rates for all livestock are low and other animal health inputs are non-existent. Chickens of local breed are owned by almost all households, with average ownership of 15 per household. They are kept for sale, household consumption and ceremonial occasions. Chickens are generally allowed free range, and are not vaccinated. Populations are routinely decimated by Newcastle Disease and fowl cholera with near total losses. Cash income in pr oject villages from poultry was Kip 8,600/household in 1996, or 4 % of total cash income (CARE 1996). 11.5.3 Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) A total number of 247 NTFP species we re recorded during a survey of the Nakai Plateau. Damar resin (14 %), rattan shoots (12 %) and cardamom (12 %) are considered to be the most important products from Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 21the forest. NTFPs are especially im portant in those villages on the ed ge of the forest, i.e. Ban Khone Khen, Ban Ka Oy and Ban Sop On. More than half of the household cash income, which is primarily derived from the harvesting of NTFPs, was spent on buying rice in 1996. Damar resin was one of the most valuable products and almost tripled in value leading to increased harves ting in 1997. The harvesti ng of damar resin has increased from 17 tons in 1996 to 80 tons in 1997. In 1998 there was hardly any damar resin left on the Plateau and in the surrounding areas due to over-harvesting to make up for the loss of rice due to recent flooding. Bong bark harvest decreased from 50 tons in 1996 to 22 tons in 1 997, either because priority was given to collecting damar resin or its easy availabili ty declined. The situation with rattan was less clear and cardamom harvesting remains generally stable. 11.5.4 Forestry Resources of the Resettlement Area Investigations on land use in the Resettlement Area in dicated that while 90 % of the land remained under forest cover, this cover was in varying states of in tegrity, ranging from relatively pristine to highly degraded. In Table 11-11, land whic h has over 25 percent tree ground cover is referred to as stocked forest, the remainder classified as un stocked, i.e. land which could be regenerated to productive forest if not required for other purposes. Only 75 percent of the total forest area of 18,106 ha can be considered productive forest on account of logging and other forms of degradation having taken place. Table 11-11: Land use/Forest type within the Resettlement Area Land use/forest type Area (hectares) Percentage (%) \u0099 Well stocked, production forst 5,590 27 \u0099 \u0099 Unstocked land 2,014 10 \u0099 Swamp 13 0 \u0099 Water 21 0 \u0099 Urban 356 2 \u0099 Other 46 0 Total 20,556 100 Source: FIPC, 2001. According to the forest inventory carried out by FIPC in 2001 (see Table 11-12), forested land covers about 18,106 ha of the 20,692-ha resettl ement area. Over this forested la nd the average stand volume is about 100 m3/ha. There are four forest types of which mixed broadleaf/pine is the most common, with Pinus merkusii (mai pek) being the dominant pine species. The hardwood and Anisoptera robusta (mai bak). Logging and shifting cultivation in the past have heavily degraded much of the forested land. Of the 18,106 ha of forested land, after ex cluding: (a) contiguous areas wi th low stand volume (i.e. <80 m 3/ha) in about 6,500 ha, (b) inaccessible and st eep forests of about 4,000 ha, and (c) present and future areas for resettlement and agriculture of about 2,000 ha, onl y about 5,590 ha can be co nsidered for commercial production in the short to medium term.

Fish are caught for household consumpt ion and for sale, and contribute to 6 and 4 % of total imputed and cash inco me, respectively, in 1998 (see Table 11-5, page 15). Fresh fish are consumed during the rainy season; in the dry season, villagers rely to a greater extent on dr ied and fermented fish. All kinds of fish are caught for human consumption, with catfish and carp species being the most common. Occasionally, a large fish or a substantial catch may be so ld in village market or at roadside stalls. Fish, in this context, refer to aquatic organisms of which finfish are usually predominant. Small-mesh nets and traps catch many invertebrates, all of which are eaten. Men fish in the mornings and evenings, before they le ave for the fields and after they return. Most fish are caught by cast nets in the rapids, or by deep-w ater gill nets. Bait and hooks are also used, but to a lesser extent. Children and sometime s women search the banks and sha llows for frogs, aquatic insects and small fish that supplement the family's diet. 11.6 EDUCATION In many of the villages on the Naka i Plateau schools are not functionin g properly. Either attendance was low due to the need of children to support their fa milies economically or teachers were not regularly conducting classes. Teachers' salaries are low at approximately US$ 30-40 per month. Some schools are financed by the villagers themselves since the local government had neither the funds nor could provide for the teachers. Villagers understa nd the importance of education but have little means of obtaining an education for their children. The ex ceptions are the large school in Ban Oudomsouk and the roadside village of Ban Nakai Neua. In theory, each village (often shared in the ca se of small hamlets) should have its own primary school. However, only primary school s in large villages like Ban Done, Ban Boua Ma, Ban Nakai Tai and Ban Thalang were functioning properly . In many of the villages schools had not been functioning at all for several years. Adult literacy is another important element in linking education with successful social development. Most of the women and many men on the Pl ateau are illiterate. Villagers would be better equipped to handle the relocation and learn new skills if th ey were literate. It would also al low them to compete on more equal terms with more advanced downstream groups who ar e presently dominating th e service sector and off- farm employment. No detailed survey on literacy was carried out on th e Nakai Plateau but from the various surveys and participatory observations made in the area, one can conclude that only a smal l percentage of villagers were literate in the Lao language (see Table 11-13). None of the ethnic minority languages of the Plateau are written down. Except for a few women, mostly located in Ban Oudomsouk, roadside villages and Chapter 11: Baseline Data - Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 23recent arrivals from downstream areas, women in general are illiterate. Some young women and girls who have had some basic schooling (village primary sc hools) exhibited varying degrees of literacy. Table 11-13: Educational Levels a nd Literacy on the Nakai Plateau No. of People % of Population No schooling 3,076 62.9 Primary School, 1-5 1,526 31.2 Secondary School, 1-4 214 4.4 High School, 1-3 43 0.9 College 8 0.2 Institute 5 0.1 University 7 0.1 Semester / Master 1 0.0 Others 9 0.2 Total 4,889 100.0 Source: 1998 Census. Literacy levels for men are slightly higher due to a number of factors: boys tend to go to school for longer periods of time, have opportunities to acquire literacy from the monkhood and education outside the region. In addition, many labourers and recent male migrants are literate. Several village leaders were originally from outside the Plateau (Lao Loum areas), showing that literacy can play a role in obtaining positions of influence and power in the village. 11.7 GENDER2 Men, in general, are considered as the head of households and have most dealings with organizations and government agencies outside of villages. Buddhist con cepts of merit also rank men higher than women in the religious sphere. Although men dominate politics and religion, women are very active in the economic sphere, including local shops and s talls, markets and small businesses. Men tend to run larger businesses and have greater access to credit and technology. The division of labour between men and women is by no means absolute but there are clear notions of what male work is and what female work is. Table 11-14 lists the most common tasks and responsibilities which men and women perform and some of the tasks often shared. This division of labour implies an inter-dependency of men and women in the establishment of a functioning household unit. Table 11-14: Division of Labour between Men and Women Male work Shared Tasks Female Work Heavy work in the fields such as removing large trees and cutting down trees; Contact with offici als and government representatives; Overnight trips to markets in towns; Work with machines, motor boats and driving vehicles; Carpentry, blacksmith, boat-making, house-building and other tasks involving specialized tools; Formal positions of authority in the village; Herding buffalo and cattle; Fishing with nets and hunting and trapping. Weeding, clearing fields, planting and harvesting; Collecting food in the forest and along streams and Non-Timber Forest Products for sale; Fetching drinking water from the river (primarily a female task but men also fetch water upon returning from bathing). Most of the household tasks such as cleaning, washing clothes and preparing all the meals; Pounding rice twice a day; Looking after young children, the sick and the infirm; Taking care of domestic animals in the house area (pigs, chickens and ducks); Taking care of the vegetable gardens near the house; Selling vegetables and forest products in the nearby markets. ********** * * * ********** 2 this section will be updated following finalization of the gender strategy.

The overwhelming majority of villagers requested to remain on the Plateau despite the offer of wet-rice paddy in the lowlands, indicating a strong sense of belonging to the region and attachment to the resources available in the forests and rivers. In addition, there are demarcations of territo ry according to the range of influence of territorial spirits ( phi muang ). All groups define themselves as distinct cultur al groups by name (Bo, Brou/Makong/S\u00f4, Ahoe, etc.) but there is also a tendency fo r villagers to class themselves as Lao Theun g ('slope dwellers') in relation to the dominant culture of the lowlands ( Lao Loum ), according to the Lao Government classifications. The actual differences between th e various ethnic groups on the Plateau is deemed secondary in comparison with the distinction between the lowlanders (wet-rice cultivation, Buddhism and integration into the national economy) and plateau dwellers (swidden cultivation, mostly animist and peripheral). The indigenous languages on the plateau are being replaced by Lao and Tai dialects, which are mutually intelligible for lowlanders. There are, how ever, many bilingual speakers. Few of the next generation are likely to be fluent in Brou or Vietic languages on the Plateau and most children do not speak minority languages at present. The number of customary social and political instit utions have been reduced by integration into the Lao State. There are, however, councils of elders ( thao khun ) who oversee socio-cultural events such as marriages, funerals and collective rituals. In addition, in several villages there are hereditary positions of mediums ( mau thiem ) and ritual priests ( mau) who perform local rituals and ceremonies, which differ to some extent from lowland practices. All the communities affected by the proposed re settlement have primarily subsistence-oriented economies consisting of upland rice, livestock and Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs). The surpluses of forest products and livestock are so ld to middlemen or in Ban Oudomsouk or further afield for cash or bartered for rice. Few familie s have much in the way of consumer goods but demand is growing. Thus, the ethnic groups of the Naka i Plateau should be considered as 'indigenous peoples' according to World Bank and ADB Policies on Indigenous Peoples. It will be argued below that they can be considered 'indigenous' as a whole since the distinctions between gr oups are not nearly as significant as the distinction between them and the lowlanders and the newly arrived lowland Lao groups in Nakai District Headquarters, Ban Oudomsouk. 12.1.2 Classification of Ethnic Groups For practical purposes it is necessary at the outset to classify the various groups inhabiting the Nakai Plateau before elaborating on the dynamic processes an d interactions between the groups. There are five main ethno-linguistic groups inhabiting the Nakai Plate au: Vietic, Brou, Bo, Tai and Sek. Table 12-1 shows how these groups are classified acco rding to anthropologists, official cl assifications, etic categories (how other refer to a group) and emic categories (how the group refers to it self). These four types of classification of the ethnic groups do not always correspond. Smaller groups, such as the Vietic, are often catego rised in a negative manner, revealing that they have been classified in relation to the values of th e dominant groups in the area. The labels of kha meaning 'slave' or Phi Tong Luang (Yellow Leaf People or 'spirits') reflect that fact that the Lao and other Lao Loum groups consider them as lacking basic traits of 'c ivilisation'. The Lao category for Brou (Makong) is also Chapter 12: Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Soci al Development Plan - Volume 2 2used but has less of a negative connotation. The official categories are changing the notions of self-identity of smaller groups. The Vietic and the Brou (Makong) are considered Lao Theung while the Tai and Sek ethnic groups are under the category of Lao Loum . However, the Tai Bo or Bo, because they speak a dialect of Lao have been classified officially as Lao Loum . The Bo were mostly likely Vietic that have changed their ethnic identity through contact with Tai and Lao groups and intermarriage between these groups. Evidence of this is that they referred to themselves as Lao Theung like the Brou and Vietic groups of the Plateau. The self-identification of Tai Bo as 'slope dwellers' rather than lowland Lao ( Lao Loum ) will be used in the analysis to follow since the Bo clearly have much more in common with the other Lao Theung groups than the Lao of the lowland areas. There are a number of Tai Lao (the dominant ethnic group of the country) and Phou Thay residing in a number of villages and in Ban Oudomsouk. Table 12-1: Classification of Et hnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau Anthropological Designation Official Classification Referred to by Others (Etic Categories) Self-reference (Emic Categories) Vietic Group - Phong and Kri Others have no official classification Lao Thueng, Phi Tong Luang (Yellow Leaf 'People') or 'Kha' (slave) Phong, Kri, Ahoe Salang, but commonly Mon-Khmer Group - Makong Lao Theung Brou, Tri, - sometimes as Lao Theung or even Lao Loum Bo - formally Vietic but mixed and integrated with Lao and Tai groups Lao-Tai Group - Bo Lao Thueng or Lao Loum depending on location Lao Thueng , Tai Nakai or Lao Loum depending on location Tai - mostly Tai Men, Tai Moey, Phou Tai and Lao Lao-Tai Group - Tai Men, Tai Moey, Phou Tai and Lao Lao Loum , Moey, Kaleung - Lao, Nyo, Yooy, Lao Kaleung Lao Loum or Lao Lao, Table 12-2 and Table 12-3 and provides an overview of the different ethnic groups in the villages on the Nakai Plateau and their distribution. This table illu strates both male and female household members in terms of ethnic identity and is, thus, more detaile d than earlier studies that showed only the ethnic identities of male household heads, and illustrates the dynamic 'melting-pot culture' of the Nakai Plateau. Ethnicity on the Plateau appears to be a combination of factors. These include: Residency after marriage - children tend to adapt th e main ethnic group residing in that village or the ethnic group of the parent resident in that village; Identity inherited from one's parents (k inship in the sense of blood-relations); Identification with dominant groups residi ng in that village or surrounding area; Identification with dominant groups if time is sp ent outside the village studying (Lao language) or working as labourers.

All villages are mixed to some extent but in general terms, the Vietic are present in small numbers in Sop Hia in the far northwest corner of the Plateau and in Nakai Tai. The Brou dominate the south east portion of the Plateau while the Bo are more concentrated in the central parts. New arrivals (Tai ethnic groups, Phou Thay and La o) are concentrated in the District Capital, along roadside villages and in the northwest corner of the Plateau close to their original areas.

Data for 2002 is from district office records (RMU, February 2002) and includes both households that are effected and not effected by the Project. 12.1.3 Vietic Groups The Vietic groups on the Nakai Plateau have undergone a good deal of assimilation in contrast to the small pockets of Vietic groups throughout the Naka i-Nam Theun NBCA that live mostly in isolated areas where pressures to adapt to other more technologic ally advanced and larger groups have been less pronounced. The Plateau Vietic can be considered as the 'original' inhabi tants of the area since all other groups have entered the area at a later date, acco rding to historical evidence (CARE 1996: 21-22). It appears that the Vietic groups have been displaced by others with agricultural pr actices, such as the Brou and Tai. Originally, the Vietic groups were hunter-gath erers and were spread thinly over a large area - low population density is necessary with this type of livelihood. They now comprise approximately about 12% of the villagers on the Nakai Plateau and 25% of th e population in various locations in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA. Vietic groups on the Pl ateau consist of the following sub-groups, mostly located in the northern and to a lesser extent in the central parts of the Plateau: Ahoe (16 families) located mostly in the villages of Ban Sop Hia and Ban Talang. These households can be considered as 'indigenous' to the nor thern part of the Plateau, that is their villages have been located in the region for at least three generations. However, many re sidents spent time in villages in Thakhek as war refugees, returning in the mid-1980s to different pa rts of the Plateau and have subsequently been influenced by lowland culture but the Ahoe language in still spoken by all members of the community, including children. Phong (12 families) located mostly in Ban Sop Hia, in the northern parts of the Plateau, have probably moved onto the Plateau in the nineteenth century from the Nam Noy at approximately the same time as the Ahoe and the Malang/Bo groups. It is possible that District statistics have confused the categories of Chapter 12: Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Soci al Development Plan - Volume 2 7Phong (Vietic) and Tai Ph\u00f4ng in their records since only 6 Phong families were recorded in the 1996 (CARE Report, Appendix 5). The Phong language is still spoken and closely related to Ahoe. Salang and Melang groups (ca. 4 families) are recent arrivals from the Nam Sot and are now located in various villages. Vietic groups located along the various rivers in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA and Vietic groups on the Nakai Plateau have only limited interaction in terms of trade and in obtaining potential marriage partners. There is also evidence of some migration in and out of the Plateau area between the various Vietic villages. There is little or no interaction with related Vietic groups over the border with Vietnam, where they are collectively referred to as Ch\u00fat (population 2,400 - cf. Dang et al. 1993). Collectively, the Lao refer to the Vietic groups as kha, meaning 'slave', a term used for many Austro- Asiatic groups, indicating that these were hunter -gatherers and without the 'signs of civilization' (Buddhism and rice cultivation, according to the lowl and Lao) until quite recently. The designation of Lao Theung or Mon-Khmer by the Lao Government distinguis hes them from lowlanders and Tai Lao groups. Not all of the various Lao Theung official categories cover the range of Vietic groups. The Vietic speaking Phong and Ahoe are not included in the official 48 c ategories but are rather c onsidered as sub-groups only. As with other hunter-gatherers, Vietic groups former ly lived in small bands (patrilineal kinship groups for the most part) and migrated along established paths. Today, all have become sedentary on the Nakai Plateau, and many of the Vietic groups have inter- married with Brou and Tai and adapted various forms and degrees of sedentary lifestyles. A special example of this is the Tai Bo (see Section 12.1.5 below). There is evidence to suggest that many Vietic groups are being assimilated into other groups with more advanced technology. However, they are still the le ast integrated into the national economy and have traditionally relied heavily on wildlife, fishing an d collection of forest products for trade. As regards language, the different Vietic dialects are not always mutually understandable - see samples in Table 12-5. However, a selection of words presented at the end of this chapter reveals certain similarities. It is probable that these Vietic peoples developed loca l variations in the different river valleys above the Plateau. The majority of Vietic speakers on the Plateau are bilingual but many of the next generation have limited or no knowledge of Vietic languages and function instead in Lao or Tai dialects. This is due in part to the fact that the Ahoe and other groups were re settled in Thakhek for 15 years during the Second Indochina War and assimilated completely or partly into mainstream Lao culture. All Vietic speakers reported a good or fair knowledge of the Lao language (see Table 13-17 in Chapter 13). 12.1.4 Brou In contrast to the Vietic groups, the Brou repres ent a homogenous ethno-linguisti c group (Western Katuic language of the Austro-Asiatic language family) rang ing from the Vietnamese border to the lowland areas below the Nakai Plateau in Gnommalat and Bouala pha Districts. Their homeland was probably in Vietnam near the headwaters of the Nam Pheo (Chamberlain 1997: 17). There are about 40,000 Brou (Bru-V\u00e2n Ki\u00ea\u00f9) in Vietnam in areas bordering the Nam Theun 2 Watershed (Dang et al. 1993). According to Chamberlain, the Brou appear to have fled Th ai armies and attempts at forced migration in the 1800s and traveled from the lowland areas to higher ground , to less accessible areas on the Nakai Plateau and in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA. Hence, the presence of Br ou throughout the whole area and their differing livelihood systems. The Brou are patrilineal and patrilocal and for the mo st part practice exogamy (women marry into men's lineages). They appear to have replaced some of the Vietic groups due to their more competitive use of resources and swidden agricultural practices: they make up approximately 45% of the inhabitants in the Plateau. This group has been very adaptive in that their livelihoods range from mixed hunter- gatherers/swidden farmers in the Nakai-Nam Theu n NBCA through to wet rice cultivators in the lowlands. On the Nakai Plateau, they have a mixed liv elihood system with swidden cultivation being the most important element. Other elements consist of rais ing livestock, limited hunting of wildlife, gathering NTFPs and fishing as well as gardens. Chapter 12: Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Soci al Development Plan - Volume 2 8The Brou language or S\u00f4 is spoken by a number of villagers in the central and south-eastern parts of the Nakai Plateau. It functions as a language of da ily interaction only in Ban Hatkhampane and Ban Phongesaveng on the Nam Theun. In Boua Ma, S op On, Done and Khon Khene only a few households use Brou in their homes on a regular basis. In gene ral, Brou is a disappearing language on the Nakai Plateau and few children in these villages are functi onal in or even have a passive knowledge of the language. 12.1.5 Tai Bo and Lao Kaleung The Tai Bo are an interesting example of the ong oing assimilation and adaptation on the Nakai Plateau. According to Chamberlain (1997b:1-9), the Bo are likely to have been Vietic groups (possibly Melang from the Nam Sot) that have migrated to the Plateau from the 1860s onward. They have lost their indigenous languages and adapted a sedentary lifestyle with swi dden cultivation like the other inhabitants in the area. Intermarriage between the Tai Bo and other groups on the Plateau, including the Brou is quite common. The Tai Bo, however, have not been converted to Buddh ism and retain many cultural beliefs and behavior that are similar to the ethnic minority groups in the region. The Tai Bo consider themselves as the 'original' inha bitants of the area but historical evidence indicates that many groups have inhabited or passed through th is region over the past 300 years, including various Tai-speaking groups, Sek and many Vietic groups. It is possible that the de-populating of the area of inhabitants following the Thai invasion, occupati on and forced resettlement (1828-1860) may have opened up the possibility for groups from areas to the north to move onto the Nakai Plateau. The word 'Bo' ( bau) means mine or in this case the salt mi nes that were developed during the French colonial period in areas to the west of the Plateau , in the upper reaches of the Nam Hinboun. The groups living there were probably associated with these mines or used them and then later used this designation as a marker of cultural and ethnic identity. The prefix 'Tai' ( tai) was probably added later to legitimize their status as an authentic ethnic group similar to Tai Men, Tai Meoi, Tai Dam, etc. Some Bo also claimed that they were 'Tai Nakai', meaning Tai from the Nakai region. Tai Bo is an official Lao Loum category but Tai Nakai is not an officially recognized group. A si milar trend can be observed for the Tai Khang and Lao Kaleung of the Nam Theun-Hinboun project area (cf. Ovesen 1993 and Sparkes 1995). The Tai Bo are an example of a dynamic and changing ethnic identity, of assimilation to a certain extent (loss of language and sedentary livelihood but retenti on of cultural beliefs) and a reassertion of identity within the dominant ethnicity discourse of the govern ment (new labels of Tai Bo and Tai Nakai). This example illustrates the flexibility and adaptability of ethnic identity in the region where movement, assimilation and cultural borrowing are common. A comparison of Tai Bo with other Lao and Tai langua ges and dialects at the end of this chapter indicates a similarity with the closest Tai languages that surro und the Plateau, Phou Thay and Tai Nyo. The dialect probably arose in the mid- to late nineteenth century . Recently, it has been further influence by contact with Lao speakers of the national language. The situation with the Lao Kaleung may be similar to th e Bo in some ways. The Lao Kaleung are officially classified as Tai Lao and Lao Loum , however the term Kaleung seems to indicate that they could have been a Mon-Khmer or Lao Theung group that has been assimilated or adapted to Lao or Tai language, culture and customs (Ka or Kha referring to non-Tai groups), no doubt mixing with Lao groups in the region. It is likely that the Lao Kaleung could have originally been Brou groups since they have a 'special relationship' with the Brou in that neither is to break the cultural taboos of the other (CARE 1996:18). Vargyas (2000: 13), writing on the Brou in Vietnam, in dicates that one name that the Vietnamese use when referring to the Brou is 'Ka Leung', and this would seem to support the theory that the Lao Kaleung were originally Brou. Vocabulary lists indicate that Lao Ka leung resembles Phou Thay and Tai Yooy in accent. The Lao Kaleung are found in areas south and southeas t of the Plateau. Most have arrived on the Plateau as recent migrants, in search of economic opportuni ties or have married into Plateau families.

Some Tai, Tai Yooy and Phu Thai originally a rrived in the Khamkeut District area as a result of Khmu rebellions in the late 19th century (CARE 1996: 18), but most Tai are now moving into the northern areas of the Nakai Plateau and Nakai-Nam Theun NB CA from densely populated area around Ban Lak Sao, in search of land and sources of income. Th ese Tai practice swidden for the most part and have similar mix of livelihood options as other Plateau o ccupants. The Tai groups are patrilinear and animist with only minor Buddhist influences, sharing many of th e same cultural traits as other Tai in northern Lao PDR and Vietnam, such as the Men, Moei, Kwan , Ph\u00f4ng and Pao further down stream on the Nam Theun (see Ovesen 1993). In addition, some of the Ta i, especially at Ban Nam Nian, have been working for Bolisat Phattana Khet Phoudoy (BPKP) as drivers and loggers. Differences between the Tai languages or dialects are minimal and all are bilingual in Lao. The language lists provide a selected vocabulary for the two larg est groups, the Tai Men and Tai Moei, and a smaller group, the Tai Daeng. Phou Thay is not classified as Upla nd Tai but rather as a separate category in its own right in the Tai language family. Most of the Phou Thay on the Plate au are recent arrivals from lowland areas and are based in Nakai Town. 12.1.7 Sek The Sek were the first group to arrive from Vietna m via Khamkeut District in the north. The Sek have inhabited the region for some time, at least since the beginning of the nineteenth century, since it is reported that the Siamese attempted to forcibly relocate them to Thailand after their defeat of the Lao in 1832. The Sek are found in small groups in northern Vietnam and in southern China. Although the Sek practice irrigation and have the highest yields of all the groups in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA with many families being self-sufficient, on the Plateau their live lihood system is similar to the other ethnic groups. Although there was previously a strong Buddhist influe nces among the Sek with temples in villages in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA, the majority now practice anim ism, that is ancestor and nature spirit worship with some Vietnamese influences such as celebrating Th\u00eat. The Sek language is an archaic form belonging to the Tai language family. There are similarities be tween Sek and other Tai lang uages and all Sek speakers understand and speak Lao as well as other minority languages. 12.2 A MELTING -POT CULTURE 12.2.1 A Dynamic Cultural Process Culture is a dynamic process in which borrowing, adaptation and integration are key aspects. A melting- pot culture is a term that was first introduced by soci al scientists to explain the meeting and merging of different cultures in modern towns and cities. Howeve r, the term can also be applied to other locations where interaction between ethnic groups and merging of concepts, languages and cultural practices occur, such as on the Nakai Plateau. Integration into the domi nant lowland Lao culture should not be seen as passive from the point of view of the ethnic and indige nous peoples of the Plateau but rather it should be viewed as a combination of integration and adaptation. It is not a process of 'acculturation', that is a loss of culture and values, but rather a process of change where old and new ideas merge. The process of integration of these ethnic groups into the dominant culture has been ongoing for many centuries. The Nam Theun 2 Project could well acceler ate this process due to population influx from outside the area and further integration into the nati onal economy because of improved infrastructure and services. These ethnic minorities are not isolated grou ps of people and many express a desire to see progress and to improve their standards of living by being integrated into the Lao State and adopting many of its cultural traits, such as Buddhism and the Lao language. It would not be possible to isolate them culturally and economically from outsiders, and a pref erable approach is to give them the social and economic means with which they can participate in national development on a par with their lowland neighbors. Economic improvement in terms of liveli hood development can only serve to preserve the social structure of villages and some of the cultural diversity of the region. Chapter 12: Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Soci al Development Plan - Volume 2 13The dynamic quality of ethnic integration and adaptation on the Plateau contrasts somewhat with the situation in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA and the lowl ands. Because of the diversity of ethnic groups recorded on the Plateau, there is a c onsiderable amount of shared or co mmon culture, characteristic of a merging process that can lead to a 'melting-pot culture'. The reasons for this are: Centuries of contact with lowland Lao culture, an d a gradual expansion of that culture and language onto the Plateau through the migration of Lao and other ethnic groups into the area Increased social interaction and interm arriage prevalent in all the villages A common material culture (house architecture, basketry, tools and lowland style clothes) A common basic cosmology of spirits with only minor influences from Buddhism Flexible and pragmatic social organisation an d residential patterns (primarily patrilocal) Similar systems of labour exchange, ritual part icipation and community cooperation that involve all ethnic groups Traditional leadership structures and tr aditional systems of mediating conflict All of these similarities will be explored in detail in this EMDP. 12.2.2 Migration and Integration The history of the region can be understood as a seri es of in-migrations from different areas around the Plateau (see Figure 12-2). The Vietic speakers who now mainly inhabit the northernmost parts were the first inhabitants (indigenous). These groups were originally hunter-gatherers were once spread thinly over a large area, as is characteristic of that livelihood sy stem. The differences between the groups that arrived over the centuries developed and changed depend ing on geographic separation while common traits emerged due to contact, trade and inter-marriage. Ethni c boundaries were probably fluid as is revealed by the difficulties to classify many of these groups based on language and cultural traits (cf. CARE 1996). The villages on the Plateau have experienced a number of migrations and splitting over the past 50 years. Information has been collected during the various surveys and the following data has emerged and is presented in the table below. The main reason for spli tting and migration has been the search for land and natural resources in different areas of the Plateau and economic opportunities in the roadside villages of Nakai Neua and Nakai Tai.

More recen tly, various upland Tai groups from the Khamkeut area have arrived on the Plateau. The Tai Bo from the central regions were most likely Vietic speakers who have adapted Lao/Tai culture and lang uage. This parallels the more recent laosisation of the some of the Brou who have adopted Buddhism and lowland Lao di alects. The establishment of Ban Nikhom 3 near Ban Sop On and Ban Nikhom 5 in the present-day site of Ban Nong Boua Kham (Bo Cho), and the subsequent influx of lowlanders has further accelerated the process of laosisation of the Plateau since 1975. The establishment of Nakai as a district in 1992 has also added many lowlanders to the ethnic mix. Villagers were often unable to give an answer wh en questioned about their ethnic identity and gave a variety of answers, revealing in many cases a desire to be classified within the mainstream culture ( Lao Loum ). Different dialects of Lao or Tai are the language of daily communication in most of the villages due to the amount of intermarriage since many derivati ves and dialects of the original languages are not mutually understandable. These dialects of Lao or Tai have become the lingua franca in all cases perhaps due to the importance of Lao as a language of admini stration and education. Many under the age of 40 do not have a working knowledge of their 'ethnic' la nguage. The CARE Report (1996) classifies households along ethnic lines and this tends to exaggerate ethnic di fference. In some cases, it is a difference in name alone. Upon questioning villagers to state their ethnic a ffiliation, there were two noticeable tendencies: association with the Plateau or a specific area on the Pl ateau, and a desire to identify with aspects of the dominant culture. Thus some groups, especially, the Bo often stated that they were Tai Nakai, that is the inhabitants of Nakai who spoke a dialect similar to the other Tai groups in the area. The Ahoe, Malang, Selang and other Vietic groups also use the prefix 'Tai ' as a means of legitimizing their status on a par with the other Lao Loum groups such as Tai Men, Tai Lao, Tai Lue, et c. When the term Brou, is used it is often met with laughter since this group preferred to be called Tai S\u00f4 or Makong, Brou being associated with backwardness. 1 Aspects of village social structures such as a sense of village identity and family/clan loyalty cut across the different ethnic groups and are often more relevant than ethnicity. Differences of wealth within the villages need to be considered in resettlement planning . The fact that all the villagers requested to remain on the Plateau itself is an important fact that qualifies them as indigenous, since attachment to a location is one criterion according to OD 4.20 and ADB's poli cy on indigenous peoples. The possible exceptions are groups of Tai from the Ban Lak Sao area who have recently moved onto the Plateau and have shown some interest in returning to that area. The Vietic gr oups in Ban Sop Hia have shown a desire to stay in the area or to return to traditional territories west of the Plateau. 12.2.3 Intermarriage One means of gauging the extent of the melting-pot culture on the Nakai Plateau is to examine inter- marriage between the groups. The family structures on the Plateau may be characterized as patrilineal and virilocal to a large degree. Like many groups in So utheast Asia, however, there is considerable variation that depends on practical aspects relating to location, relative wealth of families and available resources. Recording life histories and changes from one gener ation to another revealed that it was not uncommon for villagers to build several houses in different loc ations (Sparkes 1997: 19-22). This also indicated a high rate of separation. Table 12-7 illustrates data from a preliminary survey to acquire an overview of the extent of inter-marriage which appears significant on the Nakai Plateau. 1Another example of identifying with the dominant culture and renouncing what is perceived as a 'primitive past' is the use of t he word khaa, which means 'slave'. Previously, the Mon-Khmer speake rs were referred to as 'slaves' by the Tai and Lao speakers. More than one informant referred to himself as Tai Kha, implying that he belonged to a legitimate ethnic group, using the word, 'Tai', and combining it with an old notion of being subordinate to the dominant group, 'slave'. This was also a common phenomenon near the site for the construction of the Theu n-Hinboun dam (see Sparkes 1995:3-8). Chapter 12: Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Soci al Development Plan - Volume 2 16 Table 12-7: Intermarriage on the Nakai Other Groups Brou 343 39 15 12 4 13 Bo 35 395 7 5 Tai/Phu Thay 3 8 48 9 3 2 4 Ahoe 10 4 5 21 2 1 1 Phong 10 2 2 1 Lao Kaleung 4 2 2 Lao 13 22 11 35 Other groups 4 4 (Compiled from District records at Nakai 2002 and field visits) An example from the village of Ban Sop On illustrate s very well the complexity of ethnic identity through a number of intermarriage cases in this mixed Bo and Brou community. Figure 12-3: Example of Intermarriage from Ban Sop On Residence pattern for the Brou and the Tai Bo indicate patrilocal residence and hence the ethnic identity as Brou for the male in the figure above since the many of residents in Ban Sop On trace their origins to this group and the father of the child is Brou. However, th ere are no longer clear cultural distinctions between the Brou and the Bo who intermarry frequently in Sop On, both considering themselves as Lao Thueng . In contrast to the Brou, the Lao favor initial matriloca l residence (wife's family compounds) such that the grandfather of the male in the figure abov e was incorporated into the Brou community. The example of in- and out-marriage from Ban Done is illustrative of how ethnic boundaries are easily transgressed and how ties with neighboring villages ar e established over time. Upon first inquiries many villagers claimed that the village was Brou and that they practiced endogamy (marriage with women from within the village proper). Upon further questioning, however, there appeared to be many other ethnic groups present as marriage partners and Brou from ot her areas. Location determined the ethnicity of the children. The examples given were as follows: \u00bdL a o \u00bdB r o u \u00bcL a o \u00bcB r o u \u00bdT a i B o L a o B r o u \u00bdT a i B o\u00bdT a i B o \u00bdB r o u+ + + += Mal e = Fe m al eBr ou La o Ta i BoBr ou Tai BoChapter 12: Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Soci al Development Plan - Volume 2 17Table 12-8: Male Marriage Partners (sons-in-laws -luk khoey) in Ban Done Number of luk khoey Ethnicity Place of origin 7 Brou Ban Ngom area 3 Lowland Lao Thakhek area 1 Tai Yoy Ban Bo 1 Sek Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA area 1 Nyo Mahaxai Lao Luang Prabang Table 12-9: Marriage Partners (exogamy) from Ban Done Number of Brou women leaving village Ethnicity of husband in new village Destination 5 Brou Ban Ngom area 3 Lowland Lao Thakhek area 2 Brou/Bo Ban Sop On 2 Brou Ban Khone Khen Lao Luang Prabang 1 Tai Phuan Xieng Khouang There appears to be no taboos on inter-marriage among the various groups although there is a preference for marrying within one's own group. In addition, the Care Report states that the population of Ban Khon Khene at the southeastern end of the Plateau could represent yet another mixture of ethnic groups, where the Vietic Phong intermarried with the Tai Yooy and then assimilated with the Brou (1996: 20). However, it has proven difficult to investigate this claim since most households consider themselves as Brou or Makong but speak Lao. If there has been former assimilation of groups, there is little evidence of this at present. 12.3 ETHNIC GROUPS SURROUNDING THE PLATEAU AND NEW MIGRANTS 12.3.1 Ethnic Groups in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA Many of the ethnic groups on the Plateau are also found in the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA area, including the inhabitants of the village of Ban Ka Oy which may also have to be relocated due to the inundation of swidden fields, qualify as ethnic minorities due to the re latively isolated river valleys and lack of contact with the lowland culture. Hence the different groups ha ve retained, to a far greater degree, their distinct customs and original languages as outlined in the CARE Report (1996). There is little in the way of a melting pot culture as of yet and still a great diversity of ethnic groups among villages. The Brou or Tai S\u00f4 of Ban Ka Oy have never had a school or Buddhist temp le and mostly use Brou as the language of daily communication. This contrasts with the Brou of the Pl ateau who speak a dialect of Tai or Lao. There was, however, one example of a Tai Meoi from Ban Lak Sao who did not speak Brou and conversed with the other villagers of Ban Ka Oy in Lao which ever ybody seemed to understand. An Ethnic Minority Development Plan has been developed in parallel wi th this document for these groups (EMDP for the NT2 Watershed 2003) by GOL. 12.3.2 Ban Oudomsouk The district town of Oudomsouk (Muang Nakai or Nakai Town) came into existence recently with the dismantling of the State Farm cum Re-education Ce ntre at Ban Nikhom 3 near Ban Sop On and the creation of the Nakai District in 1992. It is populated by recent in-migrants from all over the country. The majority of inhabitants of the town are lowland Lao fr om many provinces (Tai Lao, Lao Kaleung, Tai Lue, etc.) and they are not directly impacted by the Project. These in-migrants work mainly as officials and wage laborers in construction and forestry as well as running the majority of restaurants and shops. There is also a considerable Vietnamese presence as owners of re staurants and traders in the town. Table 12-10 below indicates the population as of March 1997. Chapter 12: Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Soci al Development Plan - Volume 2 18Table 12-10: In-migration to Ban Oudomsouk Place of Origin No. of Households Arrival Date Type of Work Nikhom 32 109 1992-96 BPKP, laborers, restaurant owners Khammouane Province 64 1992-96 Army, police, teachers, doctors, officials Nakai Plateau villages 25 1995-96 Farmers living on the outskirts of town Ban Lak Sao 23 1995-96 Laborers, shop owners Pakse 2 1995 Merchants Pakading 2 1996 Farmers and merchants Savannakhet Province 3 1995 Shop owners Mahaxai District 6 1995-96 Shop and restaurant owners Total 2343 In 1997 the former residents of Ban Nikhom 3 made up nearly half the total of 234 households of the new town (population in 2002 was 289 households). These resi dents came originally from all parts of the country and consist mostly of families of officials and army officers from Luang Prabang, Savannakhet and Sayaburi. Many have intermarried with the loca l populations in the former Ban Nikhom 3 area. The language and culture is Lao, that is lowland Lao ( Lao Loum ). This is reinforced by the addition of officials and skilled people from urban and semi-urban areas th roughout the country who also identify themselves with the dominant culture. What is important to note from this table is that the inhabitants of the villages of the Plateau have not secured work opportunities in town such as laborers, drivers or jobs in the chipboard mill. Only a few men, mostly from the roadside villagers of Ban Nakai Neua and Ban Nakai Tai work for BPKP (9 households were recorded in 1997) and a very few from the rest of the Plateau have managed to acquire temporary or fulltime wage labor. 2 Nikhom 3 refers to a State Farm that wa s established after the Second Indochina War. Many of the workers on this farm were former Royalist army officers and government officials from all over the country (Tai Lao, Lue, Phuan, etc). Nikhom 3 was dismantled in the early 1990s wi th the majority of the populati on settling on the Nakai Plateau, primarily in Nakai Town. Many had married local women and have families wi th local women. Many of the shops, sta ll and small business in Nakai Town have been established by form Nikhom 3 workers. 3 The figures here are approximate since the situation on the ground is changing rapidly with the arrival of more and more villagers and merchants seeking new opportunities. Duri ng the survey, at least 12 men were recorded who were presently staying with relatives and working in Ban Oudomsouk. It is more than likely that some of these will bring their families and set up hou se in the near future.

employed at various stages in the planning for resettlement of ethnic minorities on the Nakai Plateau: Household surveys of economic assets were carried out first by the LWU in 1995 and again during the Notification, Registr ation and Socio-Economic Sa mple Survey by the RMU in 1998. These surveys list the assets and the main socio-economic features of the re sidents of the Nakai Plateau. The data was collected by interviewing household members on an individual basis. Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) techniques were used by CARE (1996). Further surveys were carried out in 2003 for additional data and quality control of existing data. Census of all entitled households on the Naka i Plateau in October 1998 (cf. Appendix H). In-depth Interviews of individuals and families were carried out on several occasions (CARE 1996, NTEC (Sparkes) 1997, 1998 and intermittently from 2002-2004) in order to obtain additional information relating to individual household economics, social organization , cultural practices, gender relations and resource use. Discussions with local leaders were carried out on several occasions throughout the consultation process and during all surveys in order to update statis tics on village population, migration patterns and relationships between traditional and formal positions of power within the villages. Discussion with ritual practitioners were carried out (NTEC (Spark es) 1997, 1998 and 2002-2004) in order to assess cultural practices, rituals relating to reloc ation, territorial spirits and religious beliefs that could affect resettlement. Participant Observation was conducted in all villages by su rvey teams in 1997 and 1998 that involved staying in villages for several days and nights in orde r to observe firsthand village life and routines and to establish trust and affirm conclusions of the quantit ative surveys. Informal discussions were held with many villagers in order to gain insights into aspirations and potential challenges of the resettlement plan. Survey teams consisted of government officials from the RMU, LWU and Institute for Cultural Research, Ministry of Information and Culture as well as consulta nt anthropologists. Shorter field visits were carried out by various consultants from 2002 to 2003. Participatory Rural Appraisal Techniques were used in 1997 and 1998 as part of the gender-sensitive consultation process. This involved land use mapping , designing 'dream villages', prioritizing livelihood options, village layout and house designs. Groups of men and women discussed various aspects of the draft resettlement plan s and gave feedback (NTEC (Sparkes) 1998). All these various types of data were co-related, checked and fed into the resettlement planning process. These methods fulfill the consultation and planning criteria with regard to the taking into consideration the cultural and socio-economic needs of the ethnic mi norities on the Nakai Plateau as outlined in OD 4.20. 13.2 SOCIO -ECONOMIC STATUS Two major socio-economic surveys have been undertaken on the Nakai Plateau. The first one was by the CARE team in 1996 (including a revision of the LWU's work from 1995) and the Notification and Registration Survey in late 1998 (data complied in 1999). Both these surveys pr ovide an overview of all economic and livelihood activities that were later analyzed by various experts and integrated into resettlement planning. 13.2.1 Income Sources Given the difficulties of obtaining reliable data concerning household incomes, the following table is indicative only of the average household income for the Plateau and reveals the importance of agriculture Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2and NTFPs in generating cash income. Although there is a fourfold increase in income in kip due to inflation, however, this translate s in fact into a marginal d ecrease in terms of dollars. Table 13-1: Cash and Imputed Househol d Income in Reservoir Households Activities Income in 1996 % in 1996 Income in 1998 % in 1998 Agriculture and livestock 83,000 18 411,951 22 Wildlife 18,000 4 8,803 0 NTFPs 97,000 21 99,257 5 Fishing 23,000 5 84,926 4 Wages 36,000 8 203,947 11 Jewellery and Handic rafts N.A. 29,571 2 A.

Total Imputed come 205,000 44 1,040,406 56 Total income (A+B) 462,000 100 1,868,860 100 The total income of 462,000 kip was equivalent to USD $462 in 1996. The total income of 1,868,860 kip was equivalent to USD $449 in 1998. The methodology in the second st udy was more thorough and includ ed several items not taken into account in the first survey, such as rice for work, ag ricultural production and livestock as part of imputed income. In addition, there has been inflation and a devaluing of the Kip in comparison to the USD $ so that there is a decrease in terms of USD $ from 462 to 449. Plateau communities have traditiona lly had a mixed economy consisting of cultivating rice and food crops, fishing, raising livestock, hunting fo r meat and gathering NTFPs, all primar ily for household use. In recent years, increases in population, problems with sh ortened swidden cycles, and exposure to cash commodities, have spawned more intensive and extensive exploitation of the forest for its marketable products. The shift from an almost entirely subsistence economy to a somewhat more commercial one is being promoted by migrants. These newcomers engage either in government sponsored logging, or in search of other economic benefits such as trading or market stalls. These pe ople generate a market for items such as vegetables, meat and forest products. 13.2.2 Income in Relation to Ethnicity The Care Report (1996: 22) examined income in relation to ethnic groups and length of habitation. Table 13-2 shows that the length of habitation is approximately the reverse of social rank and average household income. The Vietic groups, it should be pointed out, ar e living in villages together with Tai, Lao and Brou inhabitants in Sop Hia and Nakai Tai and this could affect the ranking. The Tai, the most recent arrivals are clearly ranked first and this is due to the fact that many are more integrated into the mainstream economy and have better technology and skills. A number of Tai have been employed by BPKP and dominate the small stalls along Route 8B. Tai culture and language are also similar to lowland Lao. The Brou and Bo have considerably lower household incomes and, on average, are not involved in market activities or off-farm employment. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3 Table 13-2: Ethnicity and Household Income Social Rank Average HH Income Length of Habitation 1. Tai/Sek 359,962 Kip 1. Vietic 2. Vietic 229,127 Kip 2. 3. Brou 212,137 Kip 3. Brou 4. Bo 173,264 Kip 4. Tai/Sek In addition to ethnicity, the type s of villages in terms of location , access to markets and historical development determine to a large extent the standard of living. The further villages are from the road or District Capital, the poorer they tend to be. One ca n divide the villages roughly into three groups, and these groups correspond to a certain degree with ethnicity: roadside villages (relatively large number of Lao or Tai), villages to the south- east of the Plateau (predominately Brou) and the p oor villages at the centre and northern parts of the Plateau (predominately Bo) (cf. Sparkes 1998). 13.2.3 A Diminishing Resource Base Present conditions on the Plateau may be characterized as having a \"diminishing resource base\". The majority of time and energy goes into the cultivation of swidden rice, the staple food. Swidden, or upland rice cultivation, can only be successful in a large ar ea of sparse population. The present population has been expanding over the last 10 years at a rate high er than the Lao average (CARE 1996: 30). As a result the fallow period has been shortened to meet the demand, subsequently reducing the harvests and the quality of the already poor soils. For good harvests a swidden cycle of 10-12 years of fallow is required given the rate of regrowth and soils. Traditional sources of wealth are buffalo and Non-Ti mber Forest Products (NTFPs), which are either bartered or sold for food, and consumer goods in Ba n Oudomsouk, Thakhek or further afield. Large areas previously used for grazing animals and gathering NT FPs have been damaged by commercial logging, and these areas have still not fully regenerated after the ha lt of logging activities on the Plateau. Concurrent with this destruction of the natural environment, is an increase in demand for consumer goods and a shift from a primarily subsistence economy to a more market-oriented economy. Animals and forest products are now sold in order to acquire consumer goods imported from Thailand, Vietnam and China, which are on sale in local markets. This in turn has put more pressure on an already diminishing resource base. The majority of cultivation takes place within the village area but villagers travel afar to collect NTFPs and to find suitable grazing areas for their buffalo, that is into other villages' traditional territories and the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA. Verbal permission was all that was required in the past. For a small percentage (5-10%) villagers can take as many forest products from other areas as need ed. There are, however, indications that the severe floods of 1996 and subsequent years have created great pressure on resources. There was one reported case from Ban Ka Oy of goods being seized by village authorities in 1997 because a villager from the neighboring Ban Sop On had no t sought permission before gathering damar resin (kisii). When various informants were asked about this issue there seemed to be little consensus about whether one should or should not seek permission from village authorities regarding quotas. They all claimed, however, that this was the first case of goods being seized, and this could indicate that it is becoming difficult to acquire enough forest products to exchange for rice. The only flood comparable with the disaster of 1996 was the even higher flood of 1959, which were also of a longer duration. That time is still vivid in the memories of many elderly folk on the Plateau. Upon being questioned about the years follo wing the 1959 flood, they stated that it took about three years to recover to levels comparable to pre-1959 production. This was when buffalo herds 1 were larger, forest products more available and demands for purchased good s very low. It is unlikely that a stable utilization of resources has been re-establishe d after the floods of 1996. Intervie ws with villagers in 2002 and 2003 1 Many villagers claimed that buffalo herds were significantly hi gher before the outbreak of the Second Indochina War and that animals were shot and slaughtered by both sides during the fighting in order to supply food. There are no statistics on this an d some of the CARE Report (1996) material se ems to indicate a recent increase in numbers. What interviews with villagers did reveal, however, is that there is a significant difference in numbers owned by each individual household. Many villagers in the Tai Bo villages in the centre of the Plateau, claimed they had none either because of disease or because they had to sell their buf faloes off to buy rice. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 4indicated that NTFPs were only available in large qua ntities in the NBCA and involved camping out for several weeks at a time to meet quota already agreed upon betwee n village leaders and middlemen. A more recent development recorded during a brief field visit in April 2002 is the effects of the cessation of logging on the Nakai Plateau and in the Nakai- Nam Theun NBCA. Previously the logging companies with their numerous laborers, drivers and supervisors provided a market for local food and services along the roadside villages of Ban Oudomsouk, Nakai Tai, Nakai Neua, Thalang and Nam Nian. Evidence that the logging has stopped comp letely on the Plateau is the numerous stalls, restaurants and guesthouses that have been boarded up or dismantled. Some of the people who had migrated to the Nakai Plateau during this height of timber extraction have left, accounting for many of the households that have left the area. Although no systematic survey has been conducted there must have been income losses for many families who had invested in small businesses at that time. 13.2.4 Agricultural Production Agricultural production on the Plateau is currently based upon rain fed rice cultivation and small-scale vegetable gardens. Soil fertility, labor availability, access to a reliabl e water supply, draught and animal supply are all factors contributing to yield. Average yields in the area are generally in the range of 0.8 tonne per hectare for upland and 1.5 to 2.0 tonnes per hectare for paddy rice. Paddy production is restricted by the availability of fertile non-flooded fl at land. With the aid of mechanical power, or access to a reliable water supply for irrigation, maximum land use could be expanded beyond the present average area of cultivation, which is probably less than one hectare per family. The size of family land-holdings varies from 0.4 ha to 2.4 ha. Vegetables are mainly grown on fields in proximity to the homestead on garden plots directly associated with the dwellings or along nearby riverbanks and may include cabbage, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, beans and pumpkin among others. Tobacco is sometime s grown in these gardens, mostly for domestic consumption. With the exception of Oudomsouk itself, the vast majority of the population is engaged in agricultural production. The following diagram indicates the most important activities during the year. Figure 13-1: The Annual Agricultural Cycle Activity J F M A M J J A S O N D Swidden Rice Paddy Rice Livestock herding Fishing Vegetable gardens NTFPs The most important activity is the production of rice. Except for the roadside villages of Nakai Neua and Nakai Tai, and to a lesser extent Do ne, villages practice extensive swidde n or upland rice cultivation. This involves approximately 10 months of work with the mo st intensive periods being the actual clearing and firing in the hot season and harvesting at the end of the year. Harvests are relatively poor: 723 kilos/family compared with 1558 kilos/family in the lowland areas in Gnommalat Dist rict. The months when villagers are not engaged in rice production are mostly devoted to collecting Non-Timber Forest Products. The area is far from self-sufficient in rice as indicated in Table 13-3 below.

Even with small populations and adequate fallow time, the yields of sh ifting cultivation can rarely support a family of four without supplemental rice purcha ses in present day Lao PDR (UNDP 1994). In addition there is the desire to protect the watersheds to sustain adequa te water yields for hydropower project production. Population pressures without an increase in agricultur e production will only cause more forest area to be lost, and the amount of natural forests in the vicini ty of the village to decrease. People need to walk farther to find and use forest products. Farmers are forced to reduce fallow periods, and shorter fallow periods cause soil fertility to diminish, and erosion problems to increase. A shorter fallow period negates the use of ecologically-sound agricultural practices necessary to protect the fertility of Alisols soils, which are reportedly heavily leached, susceptible to erosion and with low pH, and organic matter content (see Table 10-12). The weathered, leached, Alisols soils require a 15-year fallow period for the best result. 2 Recent studies show the optimal number of people to forest area is about 12 persons per sq. km. The environment and the agricultural resource base are being degraded in a constantly reduced cycle. Declining soil fertility results in reduced crop yields. Labor requirements to control weeds increase, which does not exist in sufficient quantity, and thus yields decrease. This in-turn places the ho usehold at risk, and thus more land is placed under shifting cultivation. In addition , the environment has been further degraded by commercial logging on the Plateau since the 1980s. In order to compensate for recurrent rice deficits, vi llagers grow corn and vegetables, and collect wild tubers and other edible forest products. They also rais e livestock (buffalo and catt le), which generally serve as a reserve that can be sold at times of rice deficit. With the substantial changes associated with forestry operations on the Plateau, it would appear that they are becoming increasingly reliant on hunting, fishing and the collection and sale of NTFPs . The absence of wildlife in the imme diate vicinity of villages, and the declining availability of forest reso urce base would suggest that the sustainability of these practices is questionable. Most of the wildlife of the Plateau has already been hunted out and some forest products, such as damar resin, are either being harvested at an unsustainable rate or are becoming harder to obtain. 13.2.5 Rice Deficiency and Ethnicity There is no correlation between ethnicity and paddy production (see Table 13-4). Paddy is grown by Bo in Nakai Tai and Nakai Neua and by Br ou in Done, Kone Khen and Bouama. Also Vietic grow paddy (in Nakai Tai). Dry season rice is grown in the same villa ges except for Khone Khen. Upland rice is grown in all villages and by all ethnic groups. 2 Many villagers stated that they let their fields remain fallow for only 3-4 years and claimed that was ample time. They are no doubt echoing government policy concerning swidden agriculture an d the desire to stop villagers from burning down forests. The same arguments were encountered in the villages near the site of Theun-Hinboun dam (Sparkes 1995:12-13). Upon inspecting the fields in the vicinity of the villages, however, it b ecame obvious that the fields were fallow for 10-15 years. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7According to the 1996 survey Vietic households and house holds from new villages had a higher degree of rice sufficiency (39 % and 32 %) than Bo and Brou (see Table 13-5). Half of Brou households (51 %) had rice deficit for up to 6 months, while only 21 % of Bo, 25 % of households in new (mixed) villages had 25 % and 30 % of Vietic households had deficiency for up to 6 months. 62 % of the Bo households had rice deficiency for 6 months or more, while this was the case for 40 % of the Brou households and households from new villages and 31 % for Vietic.

The total number of buffalo in the villages to be resettled was 3,100 head in 1996 and 4,146 in the 1998 census, with average ownership of 4.3 per household. Distribution is markedly skewed, with some households owning over 30-40 animals (up to 90 head being recorded in 1996), and a significant proportion not owning any head at all. Due to flooding and the subsequent loss of all rice in th e autumn of 1996, many animals were sold to make ends meet. Buffalo are kept largely as a store of wealth for use in times of need, rather than being considered as a resource managed for regular income. A small proportion of adult animals are used for draft purposes in t hose villages that have permanent rice fields. There is also some rental of draft animals to lowland farmers on the Gnommalat Plain for 1-2 months of the year for land preparation. However, this practice seems to have halted due to the introduction of hand-tractors in the lowland areas. The number of domestic animals, especially buffalo, reportedly has never recovered from the effects of the Second Indochina War (1962-1975). 3 In 1996, the 16 villages in the CARE study owned 3,100 buffalo, though three villages (Ban Nakai Tai, Ba n Done and Ban Thalang) accounted for almost 60 percent. This 1996 survey of the number of anim als per household is compar ed with a more recent survey carried out in late 1998 indicated in Table 13-7. A number of villages were not originally included in the first survey so that the totals differ by approximately 30 per cent. In addition, the methodology of the second survey was more thorough and detailed. Buffalo are currently allowed free-range access to grass-fields and under forest grazing areas, but are excluded from rice fields and gardens during period s of cultivation. Taking into account all possible grazing areas, stocking rates could be as low as 1 animal to 20 hectares, but is more likely to be much higher due to the way each herd is managed at the villag e level. It is evident that stocking rates are higher in the Ban Nakai Neua and Ban Nakai Tai area, with a stocking rate closer to 1 animal to 4 ha. During the dry season, animals graze largely unattended in forest areas. During the wet season, they are commonly placed in a penned area at night within th e village to prevent damage to crops. There is no supplementary feeding of improved forage, nor manageme nt of natural forage through controlled grazing of different areas at different times of the year. A shortage of feed is reported by some farmers from March through to May, corresponding with the middle to the end of the dry season, but this appears to be as much a function of how far farmers are prepared to graze their animals away from the village, as it is an absolute shortage of feed. 3 The Second Indochina War refers to a period of hostilities last ing from approximately 1962 until the victory by the Pathet Lao forces in 1975. This is incorrectly referr ed to as the Vietnam War in the West, partly because the conflict was 'secret' and no t officially declared by either Vietnam or the US.

Vaccination rates are low. Mortality rate s in calves (0-1 years) of up to 50% are reported. Liver fluke is also reported to be a problem in buffalo that have been rented out to farmers in the lowlands. Drenching for endoparasites is not practiced, and there appears to be no use of any other animal health remedies. Average ownership of pigs in project villages is report ed to be 6 head per household. Pigs are owned by most households, mainly to recycle wastes and as a sideline income generating activity, but also for slaughter for household consumption and for use on ceremonial occasions. The only breed evident is of local origin, black and relatively small. In general pigs are not housed but are left to forage, with minimal supplementary feeding of rice bran, reject corncobs, ba nana and palm stems, tuberous and aquatic plants, and household scraps. Periodic outbreaks of swin e fever are reported, with very high losses.

They are kept for sale, for household consumption and for use on ceremonial occasions. Poultry are generally left to range outside, and are not vaccinated. Populations are routinely decimated by Newcastle Disease and fowl cholera with near total losses. Aga in, the effect of these epidemics is obvious in the district statistics. Birds are commonly sold for consumption at 1-2 years of age for 1,500-2,500 Kip per head. A few households reported more specialized chicken production, with chickens being housed and fed a diet of rice bran, corn and scra ps. Eggs are traded for 150 Kip each. Some households, generally in village s located close to the river, also raise a few ducks for sale. Three- year-old ducks are sold for 3,500-4,000 Kip each. Cash income in project villages from poultry production was 8,600 Kip per household in 1996, or 4% of total cash income (CARE 1996). 13.2.7 Livestock Distribution and Ethnicity As with rice production, it is difficult to generalize with livestock distribution in relation to the different ethnic groups on the Plateau. Livestock ownership s eems to be related to the availability of pastures (forests or wetland areas) and the presence or absen ce of various diseases more than to ethnicity (see Table 13-7). High numbers of buffaloes per household are found in Nong Boua (Bo/Brou, 17.5 head per HH) and Done (Brou, 12.4 head per HH). The villages with the lowest per household ownership appear to the smaller Bo and Vietic villages - higher rates of disease were recorded in these villages, often resulting in the decimation of small livestock. Lower pe r household ownership is also the case in roadside villages and the District Capital of Oudomsouk wher e there were a lack of available pastures and alternative sources of livelihood were common. 13.2.8 Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) During the periods of participatory observation in the villages on the Plateau, most families were engaged in searching for Non-Timber Forest Products in order to make ends meet. Such activities are common Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 10during the winter months of December through to February, between harvesting and clearing of swidden fields. Since 1997 many have camped out in the forest s well into April because th ere was no rice available in the villages, and some have been forced to surv ive on NTFPs, including wild roots and tubers, edible plants, mushrooms, insects and wildlife. The other reason for staying away from the village has been to collect NTFPs to supply to middlemen (as part of the vilage quota) who exchange NTFPs for rice and cash. With the early rains in late April and in the beginning of May, the delay may prove disastrous for some. The following is a list of products harvested on the Nakai Plateau. Damar resin ( kisii): either old resin found in clumps on the forest floor or new resin removed from trees by making V-shaped cuts to tap the bark. Th is was the main source of income for villages and in 1997 there was evidence of extensive and damaging tapping everywhere. Villagers stay for up to two weeks in the forests to collect this item wh ich is sold to middlemen and then to Thailand. There it is mixed with turpentine and other materials to waterproof baskets and boats. Limited amounts are still found on the Plateau. Fragrant bark ( nyang bong ) Notaphoebe umbelliflora ). This severely damages the tree and often kills it . The trees are sometimes cut down first and then stripped. The bark is used to make incense which is on sale in local markets in Khammouane Province and in Thailand. The bong is becoming rare on the Plateau. Rattan ( boun, saan and wai): these plants are used for food and for tying together bamboo weaving. They are increasingly rare on the Nakai Plateau. Creeper ( thoun ): this is used for binding bamboo pieces together in the construction of buildings. This was previously harvested in March but there has been virtually none in the past few years. Palm-like fruits and leaves ( tau and khau): these palm trees provide food that is consumed in villages or sold and leaves used for roofing. They are available year round but mostly harvested in the winter when villagers have more time to fix houses or build new dwellings. Villagers have traditionally made up the deficit in rice by selling these Non-Timber Forest Products and buffalo. For a number of factors already mentione d above, the availability of these products has diminished. The following table is a compilation of inte rviews and shows the relative prices of rice bought for resin sold per kilo. Table 13-8: Comparison of Prices (Kip) of Non-Timber Forest Products and Rice Date 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Rice (1 kg) 100 220 250 280 320 380 400 420- 500 600 600 800 1000 Resin (1 kg) 30-50 40 50 70 100 140 150 170 120- 200 200- 350 500- 600 800- 1200 The prices are calculated from various interviews with villagers from all over the Plateau and give a rough idea of the increase in the 1990s. Othe r items such as rattan products an d bark have increased in price by more than double but these products are more difficult to acquire in most areas. The price of fish per kilo has also doubled over this time as well. Resin is the main source of income and is often exchan ged directly for rice in the villages with middlemen from Thakhek picking up the bags of resin for markets in Thailand and returning a few days later with sacks of rice and cash. The village headman was resp onsible for organizing such exchanges and making agreements with merchants in advance. In 1990 it took approximately 2 \u00bd kilos of resin to pu rchase one kilo of rice, and in January 1997 the ratio was about the same. The difference in the latter 1990s is that so much rice needs to be bought for a limited amount of resin available. The really crucial point is the demand for seed rice in May since most households will have to buy seed rice or borrow it from relatives in the lowlands. A brief field visit by the consultant in April 2002 confirmed that the price of rice per kilo was 2000 kip in the markets and 3000 kip if transported to the villages. Despit e the fact that there is a doubling of the price of rice, the price for selling resin in the markets or to middlemen has re mained the same at 800-1000 kip per kilo in 2002. The most recent information on prices indicate one kilo of resin at 1, 000-1,200 (2003-2004) - a slight increase from 2002 - and the price of rice at 2,500-4,000 per kilo depending on the season, slightly higher than the 2002 statistics. This indicates that the exch ange of resin for rice four to one. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 11 When fieldwork was conducted in January and Februa ry 1997, authorities and NT EC were made aware of the severe food shortage on the Plateau related to the severe flooding of 1996. NTEC together with EcoLao then attempted to acquire funding and food for the Plateau through various aid agencies. CARE International Lao in Vienti ane distributed 180 tons of rice on the Plateau and 10 tons of rice seeds. The World Food Program (WFP) distributed 150 tons of rice to villages of the Plateau affected by flooding. This provided some relief but the lo ng-term recovery of the local eco nomy will only be ac complished with planning and new skills to cope with a diminish ing resource base. Hence the attractiveness of the proposed livelihood model (Chapter 21-25). The fl ooding of 2002-2004 has not be en excessive and these years can be described as 'normal' flood ye ars with yields of 40-60% of rice needs. 13.2.9 Fisheries After rice, fish is the most important item on the diet for all ethnic groups on the Plateau. Fish are caught mainly for household consumption with occasional surpluses being sold in local markets, on the roadside or to neighbours. Fresh fish are consumed during th e rainy season, but in the dry season, villagers may have to rely on dried or fermented fish ( paa daek ). All kinds of fish are caught for human consumption, with catfish and carp species being the most common. Fish, in this context, implies all kinds of aquatic organisms of which fish are usually predominant. Small-mesh nets and traps catch many invertebrates, all of which are eaten. Men fish in the mornings and evenings, before they le ave for the fields and after they return. Most fish are caught by cast nets in the rapids, or by deep-w ater gill nets. Bait and hooks are also used, but to a lesser extent. Boys and sometimes women search the banks and shallows for frogs, aquatic insects and small fish that supplement the family's diet. There is a tendency in some villages, such as Ban Sop Hi a, to catch fish for sale in the markets in Ban Lak Sao or Oudomsouk. Given that the supply of fish from numerous villages in the vicinity seems to exceed the market demand, prices have remained stable or ev en fallen. Villages, without a good knowledge of the workings of the market, have incr eased fishing to a level that may be unsustainable in the long run. Villagers in Ban Sop Hia in April 2002 complained that big fish were now rarely caught. There is no statistical information available for the importance of river fishing to the local economy. But it is evident from the numerous fishing nets and fisherme n observed along many, if not all, of the rivers in the study area, that river fishing is important to the local people and the most important source of protein. During the repeated overnight st ays by survey teams at the villages fish was the one food which was readily available at all times. 13.2.10 Reliance on NTFPs, Fisheries and Sale of Wild Animals in relation to Ethnicity The following table is based on data collected in the CARE Report (1996) and attempts to relate income from NTFPs, fishing and the sale of wild animals to the different ethnic groups in the Plateau. Not all villages were covered during this su rvey and the data is indicative only given the fact that there is a reluctance to divulge information, especially concerning hunting of wild animals. All prices are in kip. The correlation of livelihood activities with ethnic gr oups is difficult primarily because there are other factors which also determine livelihood options and that all ethnic groups on the Nakai Plateau are engaged in all types of activities to some degree since knowledge and technology are shared. As regards, NTFPs, fishing and hunting, the following factors are important: Location in terms of resources - prox imity to rivers, forests and wildlife Market access - either proximity to markets or contacts through middlemen Demand for products and prices Number of options available in the livelihood system Ethnicity does not seem to be the main factor in rel ation to the sale of NTFPs, fi shing and wild animals if one examines these three income sources in Table 13-9 . If one looks at villages with high and low average per household income from NTFPs, one can see that a ll ethnic groups are represented. The Bo in Sop Phene and Sop Ma, the Brou in Phonsavang and the Tai, Vietic and Bo in Sop Hia and Thalang have a Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 12high reliance on the gathering of NT FPs. All of these villages have relatively good access to the Nakai- Nam Theun NBCA and have market access through middlem en who visit villages or directly in the case of Thalang. The villages of Nakai Ne ua (Bo), Nakai Tai (Bo and Vietic) and Nam Nian (Bo and Tai) are all roadside villages with alternative sources of income from shops, stalls and wage employment. In addition, Nakai Neua, and Nakai Tai have poor access to NTFPs, being fu rthest away from forests. Table 13-9: NTFPs, Fishing and Wild Animals for Sale in Relation to Household Income NTFPs Fishing Wild Animals for Sale Village Main ethnic group No. of HH (1996) Value of per Village Average per HH Value of per VillageAverage per HH Value of per Village Average per HH Ban Nakai Neua Bo 58 10,050,000 000 1,950,000 382,352 2,449,500 654,000 17,675 Sailom (Bo/ Brou), Sop Hia (Tai/Vietic) and Thalang (Bo/Tai) derive relatively high amounts of kip from fishing. This is mainly due to access since these villages, with the exception of Sailom, are located on th e Nam Theun near rapids or relatively fast- moving water where fish are more abundant. One reason the residents of Sailom (now relocated into the new village of Nong Boua Kham) rely on fishing is a combination of poor agricu lture production, lack of alternatives and ready access to the markets at Oudomsuk. The lowest average per household levels were at Nakai Tai, Done and Khone Khen where the first village is located far fr om the Nam Theun and the latter two along less productive stretches of the Nam Theun in terms of fish production and farthest from markets for selling fresh fish. Data on the sale of wild animals indicates that the villages of Sop Ma/Keng Gnao (Bo/Brou), Sop On (Bo/Brou) and Sop Hia (Tai/Vietic) have the highes t average per household incomes from this source. Again this has to do with both access to resources and markets rather than ethnicity. Villages with relatively low income from the sale of wild animal s are either roadside villages with other sources of income, such as Nam Nian, far from forests, such as Nakai Tai and Sailom, or fa r from markets, such as Khone Khen. It should be reiterated that all ethnic groups partake in gather NTFPs, in fishing and in hunting. Most of these activities are being pursued at an unsustainable level at present with NTFPs, fish and wildlife disappearing from the Nakai Plateau. Traditional techniques and levels of harvesting these resources are rapidly being replaced by more systematic means, su ch as fulfilling quotas for NTFPs set by middlemen from Thakhek, dynamite fishing and hunting parties to satisfy a growing demand for fish and wildlife in the towns, in particular markets in Lak Xao. From the point of view of the different ethnic groups on the Plateau, it can be argued that the Vietic, in general, are more reliant on the natural resources of the forests and rivers, and less on livestock. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1313.3 BELIEF SYSTEMS AND CULTURAL HERITAGE ISSUES 13.3.1 Overview of Belief Systems As would be expected with a melting-pot culture, ther e is a considerable amount of shared cosmological concepts and beliefs on the Nakai Plateau. These beliefs are similar to many groups of Southeast Asia, including the lowland Lao and the various groups in the vicinity of the Plateau. All of the ethnic groups believe in spirits that control various aspects of the cosmos and explain causality, including accidents, sicknesses, death and incomprehensib le phenomena. Each type of spirit is associated with a certain location and a particular power to affect the lives of the living. Some villages, notably the Brou villages at the southeast end of the Plateau and some Bo villages along the road, have been influenced by 'folk Buddhism' from the lowlands but for the most part this Bu ddhism is a thin veneer on top of spirit beliefs. The most important powers in the spirit world are the territorial spirits that govern large areas and are an important consideration when relocati ng villages. Other spirits which play an important role in village life are the so-called 'visiting spirits' ( phi ). House spirits ( phi heun ) are important in relation to moving houses. 13.3.2 Ethnic Aspects of Belief Systems Despite the similarities, there are some differences betw een the ethnic groups, and it is necessary to review these before describing the co mmon spirits and rituals. Vietic Groups The Vietic Groups that inhabit the Plateau were orig inally forest dweller and animist but have been influence firstly by lowland Lao perceptions and traditions due to extended stays in Thakhek and other lowland areas during the Second Indochina War and secondly be residing with Tai groups from the Lak Sao area. Little is know about the original cosmology but there appear to have been a number of mediums, both male and female, who have been able to contact the sp irits in times of illness and for intervention. Only one elderly female medium was still active in Sop Hia in 2001. Mediums can also become territorial or 'visiting' spirits if powerful enough after they pass away. Belief in forest spirits is still prevalent but data has not been collected systematic ally and in many cases is difficult to obtain (only elderly specialists seem to understand these matters) since spirits manifest themselves in various ways and at various times, often causing accidents and strange phenomena. Many terms and concepts from other groups are now used, such as the word phii to cover a range of spirits from the Lao language rather than the Vietic word, kamut or kamuut on many occasions. Since the Vietic are no longer nomadic, their cosmology is changing and merging with the other sedentary groups with whom they now reside. Tai and Lao ritual specialists have for the most part taken over the roles of traditional Vietic practitioners. Bo or Tai Bo The Bo have lost most, if not all, aspects of their Vi etic origins in terms of cosmology. Like the Vietic groups, Lao, Tai and Brou ritual specialists perfor m rituals for this group and Lao terms are used to describe the spirit world. Makong or Brou Traditional Brou cosmology consisted of numerous spirits that inhabit animals, people and natural phenomena. The most importan t spirits were the spirit of the sky, known as djang sursei , the Creator Spirit, and the djang cutek , the spirit of the Earth responsible for good harvests. Originally there may have been totemism based on clan groups but this is no longer th e case for the Plateau dwellers. The Brou also had a number of ritual specialists that communicated with the spirit world, mediums who performed divinations and cured diseases by divine intervention. The Brou of the Plateau, however, have been influenced by lowland Lao and Buddhist traditions and today specialists conduct Lao rituals such as the calling of the life essence ( basi sukhwan ) and Buddhist monks are often called in for cremations or ceremonies before burial. Most ritual specialists in the Brou villages are former monks who have spent time in lowland monasteries, gaining 'spiritual power' or saksit. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1413.3.3 Territorial Spirits Territorial spirits ( phi muang in Lao, Tai and Bo, kamut djang in Brou and kamuut bauu in Ahoe) are spirits that influence a large area around a village or grou p of villages. These spirits receive annual offerings (buffalo, pigs, turtles or chickens along with alcohol and other items) before the start of the agricultural season in February. The origin of these spirits is often a legendary person/founder of a village or the medium who communicated with the spirit. Table 13-10 indicates the names, ritual centers and origins of the spirits on the Nakai Plateau. The table indicates which villages hold annual rituals for each of the terri torial spirits. These take place in January or February before the commencement of the agricultural season. The origins of the spirits vary but they are usually connected with the names of former mediums and/or founders of the village. Mediums and politically powerful people have corresp ondingly powerful spirits and become associated with a particular territory and people residing in that territory. A relationship develops between the living and the spirit consisting of offerings and respect for the spirit in return for protection and intervention in times of need or disaster. The ritual offerings consist of animal sacrifice, alcohol and various decorations. The date for a kin seng ceremony, as it is called, is agreed upon by the ritual specialists and approved by village authorities. In the kin seng ritual at Ban Nakai Neua (Bo, Brou, Tai and La o attending) in 1997, fo ur jars of alcohol ( lao hai), four chickens, one pig and forest products ( bong and san) were offered and a new platform with a roof was constructed for the spirit. The medium, Nang Ph et, a 50-year old Bo woman, became possessed with the spirit of Jao Suliya. The spirit refers to the fo under of the village who resi sted a Siamese invasion of the nineteenth century. In the festive atmosphere that follows, Jao Suliya is called upon to protect the village and ensure a successful rice harvest in ex change for the sacrifices and food offered. The territory covered by the phi muang is to be respected by those not re siding in the village. Villagers from outside must first seek permission to harvest kisi (resin) or other NTFPs and pay a tax to the village headman. Villagers without a territorial spirit also levy taxes but cannot legitimize their actions in the same manner since all Lao are aware of the power of these phi muang and avoid making trouble. An incident with the logging company BPKP reveals just how important these territorial spirits are in the consciousness of the Lao as well as those living on the Plateau. BPKP approached Ban Done in order to acquire permission to build a temporary bridge over the Nam On for transporting logs. Ban Done village authoritie s insisted on a fee of 500, 000 Kip and the sacrifice of one buffalo to the spirit. Ban Khone Khen authorities were approached instead and the fee was only 300,000 Kip and one buffalo for a different location fo r the bridge. A deal was struck with Ban Khone Khen and the proper ritual performed to inform the spirit. This episode illustra tes how the financial and the spiritual realms combine: fees an d permission to cross spiritual territor y are negotiable yet failure to do so could result in accidents and mi shaps if the spirit is angered.

These are not associated with a particular territory but rather with an individual medium or a family. Most villages on the Plateau had several exam ples of both kinds of spirits, an d they are also common in some lowland areas. Visiting spirits ( phi thiem ) are usually male spirits that originate in the forests and 'visit' villages by possessing women and, in some rare cases, men. The spirit will communicate his demands in February or March and a ritual is held in the medium's ritual hut. These huts are permanent and each year they are cleared and improved before the annual ceremony. Th e ceremony consists of offerings such as chickens, alcohol and various decorations. These forest spirits combine a number of qualities which villagers often confused with other spirits. They can also become terr itorial spirits under certain circumstances. In the Bo village of Sop Phene, the local female medium performs a ritual similar to the rituals of the territorial spirits and over time this 'visiting spirit' may in this way become the territorial spirit of that village since villagers no long er attend the kin seng ceremony in Ban Nakai Neua. A sim ilar situation occurs in the Brou village of Keng Gnao were the loca l medium informed the survey team in 1997 that next year the spirit will reveal its identity and become a proper territorial sp irit. In both cases, these villages seem to be trying to establish autonomy in the spirit world. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 17Phi thiem were also confused with phi mau (in Lao, Tai and Bo) which are translated here as 'ancestral spirits' since they are associated with a particular household. Phi mau are the sprits of deceased family members whose identity is no longer remembered but whose spirits are believed to inhabit the house and the compound areas.4 These rituals are performed by elderly men of all ethnic groups, often tracing their origins to founding families and having knowledge of magical formulae, sometimes combined with Buddhist text as a legitimising element. A long table is laid out with offerings in front of the house and copious amounts of meat and alcohol are consumed ov er a 24-hour period. The main function of such a ritual is similar to the above mentioned rituals: food offerings and incantations in exchange for protection and a successful agricultural season. There are numerous spirits that do not have specific names but may manifest themselves whenever there are inexplicable events, illnesses or accidental deaths in the vicinity. Some are associated with deceased persons, especially those who have died violent deaths or those who have committed hideous acts. Sickness and unusual phenomena are associated with the spirit world. It is perh aps easy for the western, scientific mind to dismiss such beliefs, but it is important to take them seriously when dealing with villagers. One particular example which has direct cons equences for health is the prohibition on hanging up mosquito nets in some Bo and Brou villages. The spirits of Ban Sop Ph ene, Ban Khon e Khen and some households in Ban Boua Ma ar e adverse to the idea and some v illagers risk malaria rather than arouse the wrath of these supernatural beings. 5 13.3.5 Folk Buddhist Influences Before 1975 there were many small wooden mona steries housing a few novices and monks in many of the Bo and Brou villages on the Plateau. Folk Buddhism, which is itself a mixture of Buddhist ideas and various spirit beliefs and Hinduism from the Khmer traditions, has influenced many aspects of religion on the Plateau. Today there are only two deserted mona steries in Ban Boua Ma and Ban Done which have been rebuilt since 1975, but these have not recent ly been functioning as places of worship. There are, however, several former monks, referred to as 'Jan' (short for aajaan , meaning teacher) who perform rituals that are similar to lowland Lao rituals and use elements from Buddhism such as Pali texts for magical spells ( khathaa ). Jan Som from Ban Done serves all of the villages in the so uth-eastern part of the Plateau and is representative of this type of spec ialist. He travels from village to village performing various rituals for people recovering from illness, seeking protection from evil spirits and desiring prosperity and a successful harvest. After 14 Lenten seasons in the monastery in Gnommalat District, he considers himself a practitioner of Buddhism beca use, as he expressed in his own words: ' takon bau mi sasana, bau mi kotmai ' (before there was no religion, no laws). This form of Buddhism differs greatly from the Buddhism practiced in major towns in Lao PDR. After the destruction of many of the villages on the Plateau during the Second Indochina War, most of the monasteries were not restored. Recently, howe ver, Buddhism has come to represent progress and modernization for many villagers liv ing in remote parts of the countr y. Buddhism is now associated with 'modern' Lao culture, that is the dominant culture of the lowlands. There is a monastery in Ban Oudomsouk where a dozen novices and monks now reside. They are constantly called out to villages to perform cremation rituals and for me rit-making ceremonies. The results of the PRA survey reveal that many villages requested a temple for their new village. This shows a desire to identify with the dominant lowland culture. Th is does not mean, however, that Buddhism will replace traditional spirit beliefs and practices. All over So utheast Asia, Buddhism coexists with other religious forms such that there is ample place in the cosmos for a monastery for Buddhist monks, a shrine for the territorial spirits, huts for visiting spirits an d a spirit post for the spirits of the house. 4Phi mau are nameless spirits associated with a particular family . Spirits of recently deceased family members are remembered by name or called phi phaumae, literally spirits of father and mother . The Lao word mau is also used to denote ritual specialists, such as mau basi or mau phii, and the connection can be that both the ritual specialists and the spirits can assist people in obtain ing divine intervention. 5 A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the spirits are associated with the spirit post in the house, the post that often has a shelf for offerings of food. It may be that all posts in the house have become associated with spirits over time, and thu s the prohibition of hanging a net or hammering a nail into posts has developed. This could not be confirmed by villagers. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1813.3.6 Life Cycle Rituals A brief examination of life cycle rituals reveals a number of similarities among the ethnic groups on the Nakai Plateau with only slight differences in rituals, be liefs and practices. This is due to the fact that there is a melting pot culture on the Plateau and consid erable borrowing and sharing of ritual experts, techniques and cosmology. Birthing In all villages and across all ethnic groups, the majority of women give birth in their homes or the homes of their parents or in-laws with the assistance of traditional midwives and women experienced in childbirth. Ritual specialists (male and female) are ca lled in cases of emergencies to make offerings to house spirits. All groups practice a period of recovery called 'lying by the fire' ( yuu fai or kam fai ). This involves a limited diet (rice, salt and in some cases certain roasted meats), sitting by a fire and sweating throughout the day, drinking copious amounts of boiled water with the medicinal bark of certain trees such as mai daeng and regular baths in this water. The time spent at the fire varies but at least 15 days for the first child is normal and subsequently less for other children. The general condition of the mother and child also determines the length of stay since it is unusual for the period of yuu fai to be terminated if both are not healthy. Yuu fai is a common practice throughout all of Southeast Asia and beyond, hence there are only variations between the main ethnic groups in Lao PDR, such as the number of days and whether or not there is a ritual bath after this period of seculsion. It is clear that Lao and Tai influences and practices regarding birthing have influenced Vietic and Bo groups. Marriage The family structures for all ethnic groups on the Plateau may be characterized for the most part as patrilineal and virilocal (C ARE Report 1996; Sparkes 1997). Like many groups in Southeast Asia, however, there is considerable variation, which depends on practical aspects relating to location, relative wealth of families and available resources. Recording life hist ories and changes from on e generation to another revealed that it was not uncommon for villagers to build several houses in different locations. It also indicated a high separation rate and no prohibition on remarrying for either men or women. A number of marriage ( dong) types involve changing household allegiance. Below is an account of the number of marriage types with comments on how different ethnic groups share these aspects. Dong tan (patrilocal) involves a large feast and ideally sacr ificing a buffalo, and offering up to 16 chickens, 16 jars of lao hai, two pigs and a gift of traditional money (ngeun fak).6. At the end of the ritual the bribe leaves her parents' house and comes under the protection of the spirits of her husband. Many marriages never reach this stage since it requires a considerable investment. One example of how long this takes was a 55 year old man who had been married for nearly thirty years and who had just recently performed the dong tan. This explains why many men reside in thei r wives' household or in their wives' villages despite the ideal of virilocality. The Vietic groups of Sop Hi a have a special variation on this type of marriage which is called dong pasum which prescribes that bamboo tubes be filled with fermented fish and then broken to be eaten by the relatives from both sides after being offered to the spirits of the brides' house. This type of marriage form is the preferred type among all ethnic groups but not the usual practice among the lowland Lao. Dong sukhat (matrilocal) appears to be the opposite of dong pan since the man moves into the woman's household and remains there. He is \"cut off\" ( khat) from his own family and accepted into his wife's with all the rights and privileges it entails. He can inherit property and there are no taboos usually associated with a new arrival such as entering through the same doorway as his mother-in-law. This type of marriage appears to be a form of adoption of a man who will le ad a household, possibly wh en there are no heirs or mature men living there at the time. It is also a way for younger sons to establish themselves as household heads quickly. This seems quite common in some of th e Brou villages (Ban Done had ten examples) but is form among all groups and is often due to the fact that some households have only daughters or a choice of the parents to reside with or in the vicinity of a daughter in their old age. In addition, soms may moved to other villages or off the Plateau in search of work and marriage partners. 6Ngeun fak is a traditional type of money exchanged at wedding throughout Laos and by different ethnic groups. The money is made of silver (80% or more) and shaped like a shallow canoe. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 19Dong phaksuk (temporarily matrilocal or uxorilocal) is the most common type of marriage among the Brou and Bo. The groom comes to live in the house of the bride and works for her household. It involves a payment of two jars of alcohol ( lao hai ) and two fowls as brideprice. The ancestors of the bride are informed of his presence and he thus comes under thei r protection. There are less elaborate versions of this ritual and among the Ahoe it is called dong sauhon . Eventually, the couple may relocate back to the husband's village or build a house in th e vicinity of the wife's parents. Dong yaun is a type of liminal stage in which the couple leaves the woman's parents' house and sets up their own household right away without a marriage ceremony. They are obliged to make the proper offerings to the woman's spirits within three years and perform a full ceremony called dong tan , which results in patrilocal residence. The re asons given for this type of marriage is a lack of resources to perform ceremonies immediately. This is a comm on strategy for poor Bo households. Dong pan is a type of staged elopement. A small ritual is performed informing th e spirits of the bond and the woman moves right away into the man's household. This kind of marriage probably occurs mostly when the woman comes from a poor family and cannot claim the usual brideprice. The woman's parents relinquishes control over their daughter without pr oper payment. A few examples exist among all ethnic groups, mostly involving poor households. Dong lat resembles kidnapping, but, as is the case in many Southeast Asian cultures, it is a staged kidnapping. There were examples in some villages of younger men kidnapping women for elder men. An amount of cash is left behind. This may be a face-s aving gesture for families w ho cannot afford a proper marriage or wealthy families forcing poorer ones to give up their da ughters without proper payment. A few examples exist among all ethnic groups, mostly involving poor households. The majority of households contain nu clear families of one generation but it is usual for one child to stay with their aged parents to look after them, either in the parental house or in a separate house in the same compound area. There is no social support from the State and kinship is the only social net available in time of sickness or in times of need to farmers. If all children have moved out of the village, a grandchild is often sent back to care for an elderly couple. The variations in marriage types are probably due to the amount of different et hnic groups which have coexisted on the Plateau and pragmatic considerations such as the availability of resources. In all villages there are several of the above mentioned marriage types and as a result there is a constant change in household composition. In almost every household, however, there should be an able-bodied man and woman if the household is to function properly. Among all groups courting is common and young men and women decide themselves who their marriage partners will be. Parents need to ap prove but rarely refuse. Among the Lao Loum groups there is bride price ( khaa dong ) and a basi ceremony conducted by a priest. Po st-marital residence is always matrilineal, at least initially among the Lao. Some Bo families in the roadside villages have also started to perform basi ceremonies for marriage. Illness Although there are government and private clinics an d dispensaries in Nakai To wn and in a few of the larger villages, there are also local practitioners and a belief that illnesses may have both natural (biological) and supernatural causes. All groups have local practitioners called maw (term is used by all ethnic groups 7) who are responsible for conducting elaborate basi ceremo nies or simply tying the wrists of ill villagers in order to hinder their spirit from leaving the weakened body. The use of traditional herbs is also prevalent with considerable borrowing amongst all groups. One should distinguish between local knowledge in the form of using natural ingredients such as plants, herbs, animal parts and other items combined with spells or chants and the influence of Buddhist priests, for the most part local men who have spent time in lowland monasteries and learnt ritu als. The former is shared knowle dge among the community while the latter is often guarded and secretive knowledge of sp ecialists. The priests are responsible for conducting larger and more elaborate ceremoni es, such as calling on the spirits to provide a bounteous harvest. 7 Vietic and Brou groups have borrowed the Lao and Tai word, mau, for ritual specialists on the Plateau. Among the Tri adae is also used by the elderly, and among the Sek tet is also referre d to. Tet refers to a cultural borrowing from Vietnam and the Ne w Year's celebrations of the same name. There are only a few Tri and Sek households on the Plateau. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 20 Death Traditionally, many groups in SE Asia buried their de ad. It is only through the influence of Buddhism that cremation has become the norm among many ethnic groups in the region. For the indigenous Lao Theung groups, burial was the norm. Nowadays, monks conduct cremation rituals not only for the Lao and Phou Tai groups but also many Lao Theung groups, chanting Buddhist texts and purifying the living. The Brou, Bo and some Vietic groups combine elements of Buddhism and spirit tradit ions. This includes the juxtaposition of offerings to ancestral and territorial spirits as well as to the monks, buffalo sacrifices together with Buddhist purification chants, and ordinati ons followed by a feast with alcohol and raw meat. In some cases, there is another ritual (up to three years after the cremation) called jek khao , a kind of second burial that re-introduces the spirit back into the community as a benevolent ancestral spirit that watches over the living. The figure below is a visual representation of the cosmos for the ethnic groups on the Nakai Plateau. Figure 13-3: Basic Cosmological Aspe cts of Nakai Plateau Ethnic Groups 13.3.7 Moving the Cosmos The different ethnic groups on the Plateau have frequently changed village sites either of their own volition or because of war, involunt ary resettlement or epidemics. There are, therefore, mechanisms for relocating the village and rituals for appeasing the spirits in order to facilitate such a move. After conducting many interviews with ritu al specialists, it can be concluded th at it will not be difficult to move the cosmos to new village sites if proper procedures are followed. Furthermore, allowing for this would have positive consequence for the resettlement as a whole. It would reduce the psychological stress which is often expressed in 'grieving for a lost home' or the anxiety about an unfamiliar relationship with unseen powers (cf. Scudder and Colson 1982). Examples of correct procedures resemble regular ri tuals in many ways: food, alcohol and decorations made of banana leaves and flowers are offered and the spirit is informed of the proposed move in the case of all ethnic groups. According to the medium of Ban S op On, the territorial spirit should be given a full explanation of why the village is to move. This parallels other occasions when spirits are informed when there have been a number of strange events or accide nts or when the rains are late. What is important to note is that the welfare of the villagers is in the interests of the spirits (ancestral or territorial) and vice versa. 'If the village needs to be relocated beca use of inundation and will acquire better housing and improved infrastructure, the phi muang is sure to see the sense of that', explained the medium. Village Residents Cultivated Area Forest Area Rice and fertilit y spirits Burial GroundsEvil Spirits, causing illness Mediums Visiting SpiritsAncestral SpiritsTerritorial Spirit and shrine Forest and Animal SpiritsChapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 21 In the case of villagers being relocated outside the trad itional spiritual territory, such as might be the case with Ban Ka Oy and Sop Hia, if the people decide to relocate on the opposite side of the river, several things may happen. If the area is uninhabited and a fair distance from the ritual centre of another territorial spirit, the village may be able to move the spirit and re-establish it as a phi muang with a new territory intact. If the village is located near another village, it may abandon its own spirit and seek the protection of the spirit whose territory it now occupies such as was the case for all the villages under Ban Sop On's territorial spirit. There are also cases of la nds being split between villa ges and founder spirits like in the example of Ban Done being created from land given by Ban Ka Oy and Ban Khone Khen. There are probably more variations. What is important is that villagers are consulted and given ample time to prepare for the move so that the proper rituals may be conducted. It is important that a consensus be reached within the village and under the direction of village elders who often have a double role of guardians of tradition ( thao khun ) and founding fathers (related to the spirit of a particular founder). The power and influence of these territorial spirits 'manifest' themselves over time in the way th e village prospers and the he alth of the inhabitants. However, since these spirit territories have a practical dimension in relation to access to land and resources, there may arise claims by several village s over a particular territorial demarcation in the resettlement area. Traditional conflict resolution consists of the elders of each village discussing the matter and coming to a mutually acceptable solution. This may involve ritual obligations and fees/payments/rent by one group to the other. 13.3.8 Moving Houses The following is a list of house rituals which all ethnic groups practice in one form or another when building and moving into a new house. Again the diff erences between the groups should be noted during the preparations for the resettlement but this outline contains elements from all the ethnic minorities on the Plateau and will give an idea of what kind of rituals are involved in the process of relocation. Choosing the Site : The choosing of the site involves divination ( sieng) that is receiving a message of approval from the spirits. Ritual specialists may employ a piece of bamboo cut in two which is tossed into the air. If the two halves land upright or facing down it is auspicious to build a house on the site. If the two halves are of opposite values, it is inauspicious (common practice for Brou and Bo). Another common method is placing grains of uncooked rice on either an egg or at the base of a candle. If the grains have not fallen off by the next morning, the spirits approve of the choice of site (common for Tai ethnic groups). Construction of Houses : Construction of the house ( phuk heun ), or at least the frame, is a joint effort involving relatives and other villagers. It is an occa sion for a village celebration and feast in which the women cook a meal and the men all pitch in to erect the structure. This is done on an auspicious day according to charts of the months and old texts in the possession of v illage elders, usually with training in a monastery. Once the day is decided upon, construction begins at midnight and continues for the whole day until there is enough of the ho use erected to live in. If there is not enough time, another auspicious day is selected. This is an ideal sc enario and there is significant deviation from it since the construction of bamboo huts is a simple affair with a small ceremony but large structures may be erected over a period of many months or even years. A ceremony may involve only the raising of the first two important posts, sao jeh and sao khwan . Moving In : Moving into a new house ( kheun heun mai ) involves a recreation of a journey and invitation to stay ( kae hit ). In many cases the roles of fictitious previous inhabitants of the house are played by a village elder (usually male) and the male household head wanders around the house before asking if he could enter to rest. In some cases (among the Ahoe) the elde r cries out for help in putting out the fire. The new inhabitant enters after receiving permission and hammers a nail to the post on which he hangs his belongings. This establishes him as the owner and the rest of the family member may then enter. There is also a calling of the house spirits ( phi heun ) to inform them that their descendants have moved into a new house and that they should protect and look after the interests of the living. Afterwards strings are tied around the wrists of the new occupants by the elders and all those present ( mat meu ). There are shorter variations of this ritual. The three families at the Th eun Duane Demonstration Farm stated that all that is needed is a feast the night before and calling of the spirits and tying wrists. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 22 These rituals or aspects have been incorporated into the resettlement planning so far as part of the pilot village relocation. They have helped villagers feel at ease relocating th eir homes and it shows that planners take the villagers' worldview seriously and are concer ned about how they settle in . It is important to remember that the member of all et hnic groups will not feel psychologica lly at ease if they are not under the protection of their spirits. This approach has re sulted in a relatively smoo th relocation and positive feedback from the villagers th emselves and will continue. These and other rituals have been discussed with villa ge elders in an attempt to see how they may be adapted to the resettlement of villages on the Nakai Plateau. There was considerable flexibility and a willingness to make compromise s considering how houses and villages could be moved. 13.3.9 Cultural Heritage There are no known archaeological or historical sites in the area to be flooded by the NT2 reservoir (no findings have been recorded in any of the anthropological and sociological surveys conducted to date). No evidence of prehistoric human habitation; no stone im plements or other indications of Paleolithic or Neolithic habitation have been found. Due to the mobility of the population on the Plateau and the disruption caused by war and invasion, there are very few structures and sites of cultural importance. The only items that have been identified are several monasteries constructed of wood in Ban Done and Ban Boua Ma, stupas made of stone or concrete and gravesites. In the case of village monasteries and stupas, adequate measures will be taken for their transportation to new village sites or for new buildings of at least a similar value to be constructed. Stupas and other religious structures such as spirit houses (simple st ructures made of bamboo and thatch) for village spirits (phi muang, phi thiem and phi mau ) will be moved by the villagers themse lves since they will have the required knowledge of local rituals and procedures for moving such objects. Making adju stments to schedules such as the selection of an auspicious day for commencing the relocation would contribute to the well being of the villagers during relocation. Concerning gravesites, measures will be taken to avoid locating villagers too close by for fear of spirits. Although many villagers exclaimed that this did not matter, the fact is that if certain inauspicious or inexplicable events occur, villagers may attribute them to an offended spirit at the new site. Given the possible disorientation that may temp orarily occur during resettlement, villagers may be more prone to make such associations. Hence avoiding gravesites would avoid such problems. Gravesites that will be flooded by the reservoir did not seem to trouble peop le, but this is difficult to gauge from interviews. There seemed, however, no need to conduct rituals to transport spirits of deceased relatives since they reside in the house not at the gravesites. However, fo r recently deceased family members removal of urns containing ashes, stupas and a ppropriate ritual will be needed. NTPC has indicated that it would co-operate with the Ministry of Culture and Information so that appropriate protective and/or salvage measures will be adopted if any archaeologically significant properties are uncovered during the construction activities. These may consist of old Buddha statues or religious objects from previous monasteries or shri nes in the area. The Concession Agreement outlines contractual obligations regarding the minimization of potential impacts on cultural items during construction and as a result of inundation, including monitoring, visibly marking items, consultations with GOL if items are discovered and full compensation or replacement (see CA, Schedule 4, Part 1 and 2, 'Protection of archaeological heritage'). A detail archeological studying will be completed in 2004 to verify thes e assumptions that are based on the anthropological and social surveys. Th is will include archaeological digs and a systematic collection of data from the Nakai Plateau. 13.4 H EALTH STATUS 13.4.1 General Health Status The following health surveys were carried out on the Nakai Plateau: i. Health surveys carried out by the University of Chiang Mai (Pholsena 1997) in 1994-96; ii. Health surveys conducte d by John Storey (1997); Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 23iii. Health surveys conducted by RMU (2002); iv. Health Impact Assessment and Public Health Action Plan (see Vol 1 of the SDP, Chapter 5); v. Initial and ongoing studies by the Tr aditional Medicine Research Centre. These surveys and reports along with observations an d discussions with villag ers as part of formal consultations and informal visits, form the basis for the health analysis. The major public health problems in the project area are similar to those found in the nearby rural communities of adjacent provinces with a similar level of development. The Nakai Plateau is in fact fairly representative of public health problems occurring in the country as a whole as indicated in Table 13-11. The ongoing Government/WHO/UNICEF expanded program of immunization (EPI program) is addressing major childhood diseases (measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, polio and TB) in the country. Table 13-11: Leading Causes of Mortality in Lao PDR in the mid 1990s (Kobayashi et al., 2004) Cause of Death Mortality rate (per 100,0000) Malaria 7.62 Pneumonia 3.03 Meningitis 1.45 Diarrhoea 1.23 Tuberculosis 0.75 Accidents 0.51 13.4.2 Diseases Endemic to the Nakai Plateau The communicable diseases most commonly reported by health institutions in the project area are diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections (ARI) and malaria. Accidents associated with swidden-type agricultural practices, such as serious cuts and woun ds form nearly 10 percent of all reported health problems and make an important de mand on healthcare supplies and fac ilities in the area as reported by the 2002 Health Survey of the Nakai Plateau. Health assessments of Ban Nakai Neua in 2001 and Ban Nongbua, Sailom and Pamanton (hamle ts that formed the pilot village) in 2001 indicate that there are high rates of parasites (up to 90%) and low rates of Malaria and TB. A table summarising reported symp toms by those experiencing acut e illness on the Nakai Plateau is presented in Chapter 5 (Table 5-28). Malaria Malaria is the most potentially life- threatening of the three communicable diseases mentioned in the above table. In Lao PDR, 97 percent of all cases of malaria are due to Plasmodium falciparum . Plasmodium falciparum is the species that can develop multi-drug resistance to standard drugs, can also cause cerebral malaria and is always potentially life-threaten ing (Souliya 1996). The diagnosis of ma laria cases in th e project area, apart from at Thakhek hospital, is largely based on clinical symptoms and about 52 percent of all in- patients and 27 percent of all out-patients are due to malaria (GOL/WHO, 1996). The second most commo n malaria species, P. vivax, has not yet been reported as being resistant to chloroquine anywhere in the country. It will be noted that malaria ca ses were not reported from Nakai District until 1993 when well over 70 per cent of all pati ents were positive for ma laria. This exceptionally high number cannot be explained, especially as it ha s declined in the years following. It may well be that residents of the Plateau have since had greater access to anti-malaria drugs. The malaria transmission season on both the Nakai Plateau probably occurs year round, although with the highest prevalence from May to early July, and agai n from October to early November, on account of temperature and rainfall patterns wh ich influence mosquito breeding. There may be epidemiological variations between the Plateau and the river valleys an d in irrigated areas with a different time sequence and transmission pattern emerging. Although the colder weather on the Nakai Plateau may affect transmission, and may favor P. vivax , it is not unusual in other similar situations, for transmission to take place inside the warmth and protection of the house. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 24Recent initiatives on the Nakai Plateau to reduce the incidence of malaria have been extremely successful. This EU-sponsored malaria programme resulted in only 10 reported case s of malaria in 2001 of 571 blood samples taken. Only six people requi red hospitalisation for the disease and there were no reported deaths. This dramatic reduction in malaria is primarily due to the distribution of mosquito nets. A study carried out by the Ministry of Health (2001 ) reported that only 4% of the popu lation of the three pilot hamlets that have been moved to th e new village site of Nong Boua tested positive. Diarrhoea Diarrhoea due to bacteriological contamination of wate r and food is probably more common in the hot, humid period of the year. Infections of the upper respiratory tract (coughs, colds and runny nose) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) are at their peak during the cold season both on the Plateau and in the valleys, especially among younger children. It should also be noted that the transmission season for diarrhoeal infections could be expected to be prolonged in areas where irrigation either exists now or in those areas where it will be introduced due to larger surface water areas. This is not a problem at present due to a lack of irrigation on the Nakai Plateau. Other diseases endemic to the project area are: Opisthorchiasis caused by a trematode worm and contracted by the wide-spread practice in the lowlands of eating raw fish conserved paste; large roundworm ( Ascaris lumbricoides ) which is walking barefoot); whipworm ( Trichuris trichuria ) and tapeworm. Diseases which are present in Lao PDR but which are not at the moment present in the project area include dengue fever and schistosomiasis. 13.4.3 Nutritional and Reproductive Health Problems The general nutritional situation on the Plateau is poo r. The stable is glutinous rice which provides most of the calorie intake. Fish is the most important source of protein and various green leafy vegetables, fruits and forest plants provide vitamins. Fr uit trees are relatively rare in some villages (central Plateau area). The planned vegetable gardens and fruit trees in the resettlement plan will be a positive supplement to a poor diet. Women are usually responsible for vegetable gardens and food preparation and more information is needed to improve families' diets. Improving the diet of children is perh aps the most important preventative means against diseas e in Southeast Asia (FAO 1995). Drinking water is not usually boiled. Villagers fetch water directly from the Nam Theun or Nam On or streams nearby. There is little understanding of the potential health problems and the primary concern is that the water appears clear, that is without sediment. In some cases, water is boiled with various barks and leaves resembling tea was served but this is th e practice only during the co ld winter months. It was also confirmed that there were only a few isolated examples of eating raw fish that can transmit opisthorchiasis. It is possible that lowlanders from Ban Nikhom 3 introduced it to the area but a few families keep jars of fermented fish ( paa daek ) stored in their kitchens. A particular problem which relates to both health and nutrition is postpartum recovery practices called yuu fai, which means 'lying by the fire'. Women are confined for a period of 7-15 days during which they drink medicinal water, usually made from bo iling the bark of trees and plants, and sweat profusely. They start to eat dried food (roasted fish, chicken and frogs), rice and salt after a few days. Ef forts should be made to modify the diet, by encouraging women to eat more nutritious food containing vitamins during this period, while still continuing the trad ition that relates to purifying th e body and re-establishing a balance of elements in it. There are midwives ( mae sadam or mae kep ) in all villages and in a few villages traditional healers ( mau yao ). The former have a limited knowledge about delivery and postnatal care but cannot deal with serious or complicated cases. Since most of these midwives are elde rly, they would not be suitable to be trained as paramedics. Many healers have no apprentices and fe w practice on a regular basis. It seems that the introduction of medicines, even though on a limited scale, has weakened peoples' beliefs in traditional healing practices. 13.4.4 Health Facilities on the Nakai Plateau and Vicinity Health facilities in Nakai consist of one District Hospital, five health centres and one malaria control station. The health centres can be characterised as frequently incompletely staffed and poorly stocked with Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 25essential drugs. Most villages have a designated Villa ge Health Volunteer (VHV), but the volunteer seldom has the necessary medicines and most need technical strengthening. Adjoining Nakai District there are other District Hospitals and health centres that are only slightly better in terms of resources and staff. Th e nearest Provincial Hospital is in Thakhek for serious medical problems and operations. A tota l of one Provincial Hospital, nine District Hospitals and eighty-nine Health Centers in Kh ammouane Province sereve a total population of 331,044 (LECS2 1999) as show in Table 13-12. Heal th personnel available within the province and in four districts are outlined in Table 13-13. Th e ratio of medical personnel to population within Khammouane Province is shown on Table 13-14. This ratio of population to medical staff is considered very high.

Various ethnic groups have different concepts of health and disease, but at least in the villages visited in the preliminary investigation (September 2004) most information had shared fundamental concepts that are found th roughout South East Asia. The Tai-Lao worldview is domina nt in many regions, including Lao PDR. This indigenous health consists of three basic medical categories with corresponding practitioners: Natural disease stems from exposure to noxious natural elements Losing a soul or khwan Intervention of phi (spirits, corpse or evil spirits) 13.5.1 Traditional Causes of Disease a nd Traditional Health Specialists The m\u00f4 tamnyae or traditional midwife assists in uncomp licated childbirth mainly by pushing on the abdomen at the right time. She (usually a female but not always) will cut the cord with a sharp piece of bamboo. At times she can move a breech into a head-down position before actual labour starts. Nowadays the Ministry of Health trains \"Traditional Birth Attendants\". If they are literate, these experienced midwives are invited to join. Where a M\u00f4 tamyae isn't available the husband or a knowledgeable family member will take on this role. After giving birth, a new mother traditionally is kept indoors for some 3 (Hmong) to 30 (Tai Lao) days. During this period her diet is restricted to items, su ch as salty rice, white chicken or duck meat and rattan leaves. She drinks copious amounts of hot medicinal tea which supposedly helps the uterus shrink, the breasts to fill and the body to wash ou t toxic substances. Various plants or barks are used for this purpose. While thus secluded in the house, she and her baby si t near a glowing fire and receive one visitor after another. At daily or weekly intervals she is made to sweat visibly, by lying on a bamboo bed standing over red-hot charcoal. This domestic ritual is called \" yu fai \" (to sit by the fire). It draws on the medicinal knowledge of a m\u00f4 ya (ya = poison or medicine, that is 'body-changing' substance). Herbal, mineral or animal ingredients can all serve to cure illness of natural origin. Most households know and use at least the more common medicinal plants. But a m\u00f4 ya 's pharmacopoeia is vastly more elaborate. Buddhist monks and medical researchers have again codified, systematised and expanded on this. One practice is called ya h\u00f4m (scented medicine) and refers to steam saturated with herbal essences. It can be inhaled or may soak a patient's whole body. A piece of wet cloth of varying sizes is used to confine this sauna-like function. A 'bonesetter' priest or m\u00f4 pao (priest that blows spells - usually male) heals broken bones by blowing ( pao) over them. Over closed fractures he first rubs powder of a secret root, chews a medicinal leaf, blows slowly over the breakage and mumbles his magical formulae ( m\u00f4n). Such powerful blowing and words are said to heal any body part or to prevent successive in fant deaths. It is an active principle carried by the formula that heals, like an herbal essence would. In the domestic sphere, blowing over a fontanel or a painful spot are also common reactions for consoling parents. And almost anyone in the region knows how to better muscle or tendon pain by kneading and rubbing. Often one can see child feet carefully working their parent's hurting back or waist. In order to prevent natural disorder, parents protect their offspring from dust, dirt, sun, rains, winds, insects and rotting matter. They try providing healthy elements like water, food, vitamins, rest and merit. Certainly weak persons such as dek daeng (child red= infants), pregnant women and the elderly need this kind of care. In Laos the Government has broadcast such advice in a campaign called the \"three cleans\" - food, dress and houses. Loss of Souls Every human being holds some 32 khwan or souls, one for each organ or body part. Airplanes, trucks, cars, houses, drums, elephants, buffaloes, tigers and rice also have khwan . Khwan are as 'fickle as children' or 'fearful as chickens'. Fright, curiosity, playfulness and benign or malicious attacks can all make Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 27them leave the body they are part of. The number of souls departed is evident in the severity of the resultant malaise. This concept commands a set of taboos and prevention measures. An infant is not taken near a corpse. The dead person's spirit or phi idles about there until cremation. An infant (a pregnant woman, an elderly or sickly person) should stay out of fields or forests. House and village spirits cannot protect it there. At home, parents all know how to \"tie the wrists\" ( mat khen ) of their children to steady their fickle khwan . This is an abridged version of the well-known \" baci\" or \" sou khwan \" ceremony visitors to Lao all get to know at some time. A Moh Khwan would usually be a man having spent time at a Buddhist temple. But e.g. to repair some misdemeanour a mother can perform it for a victim neighbour child. Moh Khwan are normally female with the Tai Dam. Rites of passage in Tai groups always include a sou khwan . This happens after yu fai , as part of a boy's ordination or by way of traditional marriage. Sou khwan means \"to unite', i.e. the khwan with the body they care for. But sout khwan means 'to pray', i.e. the lost khwan base. m\u00f4 khwan prevents; a m\u00f4 sout cures. Sou khwan is called for when people get separated from loved ones. As after studies abroad, after a long journey or when a family member dies. Surpri ses, accidents, operations and conflicts make khwan flee too. Whether to sou or to sout, and varying somewhat with occasion, group or location, the ceremony's structure remains the same. First an auspicious time and place is decided. The m\u00f4 khwan and numerous guests arrive about that time, and find a pha khwan already prepared. This \"tray to feed the khwan \" carries a chalice containing dry rice. Stuck in the grains are elaborate flower pieces, varied incense sticks and candles plus a few branches holding a bundle of white cotton 20cm threads. A long string of cotton lies rolled up next to this centrepiece. Other plates on the tray contain a boiled egg, sticky rice, some bananas, sweets, flowers, a bottle of alcohol plus perhaps a boiled chicken, betel nuts and leaves. The m\u00f4 khwan takes place opposite the person to be celebrated, with the pha khwan between them. Guests sit behind and often touch the attendant's (and each other's) elbow during the ceremony's prayers. All have their legs folded sideways in sitting on the floor mats. The candles are lit. The m\u00f4 greets and may call on (Buddhist) divinities for assistance. The cotton rope is unwound to span the whole congregation; it specifically encircles attendant and officiator. Its ends are tied between the centrepiece flowers. Now the m\u00f4 calls for the khwan themselves. His words try to convince or to seduce them to keep or to return to protecting th eir proper owner. The litanies last variably long. At the end the khwan are thought indeed to have united or returned. Now the m\u00f4 khwan ties the first pair of white cotton strings around each wrist of the ceremony's beneficiary. In doing so , he murmurs wishes for prosperity and good health. He deposits some of the offerings to the khwan in the hand he's tying. Other guests now come tie the attendant's wrists as well. All wish her well an d propose other things to eat from the tray. When both wrists are tied with all available threads, the ceremony terminates with a collective meal for all those present. Spirit Affliction Disrespected house spirits ( phi huan ) may whisk away a descendant's khwan, resulting in malaise or worse. A corpse carried inside the villa ge gates may unleash epidemics. Disrespected village spirits ( phi ban ) in their anger then allow the restless ghost to catch the khwan of another villager. This person then dies too and its own ghost will do the same again, and on and on. This show s why Tai peoples so honour their domain spirits. These after all are their normally protective ancestors. But more malicious phi lurk further away, in the fields, rivers , forests and cemeteries. Those who died a violent or unnatural death (by abortion, poison, suicide, accident, murder or in labour) are particularly vicious. If someone strays too far from their phi ban 's cover, or even actually disturbs those savage phi (pricking a stick in the sand, throwing a stone in a pond, cutting a tree uninvited may be all it takes) severe disease ensues. Not only did most of the khwan flee, but the enraged phi has now actually entered that person's body ( phi pop ). Diseases caused by familiar phi are less grave or more chronic. People seek to placate, not to frighten these spirits. This they do by offering them their favourite dish, e.g. chicken, duck, goat, pig, cow or buffalo. Diviners or m\u00f4 yao find out what exactly it is an angry/hungry phi wants to smell (just the odour suffices the phi). A common divination technique is to scoop a handful of rice and to count the grains. A pair Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 28result means 'yes', no pair is 'no'. More popular is trying to stand an egg or knife on edge. Others drop rice grains on an egg, counting the number of those left on top. Only if all answers are negative (\"Are you the phi huan? Are you the phi huay?\") the m\u00f4 yao decides that the disease is natural and should therefore be treated with herbs or drugs. But if the answer is yes (and several phi may be involved, each craving different foods), and the goal of rituals is to make offerings to satisfy the spirit and to exorcise the spirit from the person with the help of the m\u00f4 m\u00f4n . Without active help from healers, parents can ward off the phi by respecting the taboos on corpses or on the way guests may move or stay inside their hous e. Some ethnic groups use marks to protect children against ghosts. Most of the time, regular offerings to one's house spirits suffice to keep supernatural illness at bay. Village spirits, however, require an expert to be attended to. Once a year, in front of the sacred Village Hall ( h\u00f4 ban ) a public ritual involves the phi ban . It is conducted by a medium called a m\u00f4 thiem (priest for visiting spirits - male or female). 13.5.2 Traditional Health Practices on the Nakai Plateau Most villagers are familiar with a range of medicinal plants, often for tea and so metimes for steam baths. Most can perform simple massage ( yieb), the knowledge of which is transmitted over generations. After birth, all mothers practice yu fai . Usually it is the husband who main tains the fire, finds the herbs and prepares the teas. Guests here do not share in drinking the tea, unlike Tai Lao custom prescribes in lowland areas. The Tai Bo of Nakai Tai do not carry their infants to the field. By contra st, when they need to work their plots the Makong will mark a infant's fo rehead with soot. This tells a greedy phi that the child already has an owner and should be left alone. Just before retu rning home again, the mother will usually call after her baby's khwan so that is will not stay behind. In general, people state that either gender can perform simple domestic rituals. M\u00f4 khwan or M\u00f4 sout are all men though since they learn spe lls while residing in a temple. Naka i Tai villagers said \"We are modern now, we're already used to having a male TBA since hospital gynaecologists are mostly male too. Our women are not as ashamed as before\". But all observe the taboos related to corpses, avoided by children under five or pregnant women, and prohibited from being carried into the village. Everyone also knows how to tie wrists. Herbalists are mostly men because few women are literate since remedies are often written down. A M\u00f4 sout should have spent time at the monastery, is therefore normally male. A crucial decision for many attending a patient is whether to undertake spiritual action before, after or in parallel with bio-medicine. Makong women in Nong Boua, for example, appear to favour modern medicine in this regard. On the first day of fever para cetamol is given, on day two a blood test is taken and on day three they may make a trip to the local clinic at Nakai. A m\u00f4 yao comes only when death seems imminent. Elsewhere though, certainly among the elder and the illiterate, many call the m\u00f4 yao on day 2 or 3. At Nong Boua Kham one counts grains of rice staying on an egg but at .Done one tries to stand the egg on a coin. The m\u00f4 thiem treats questions related to their whol e community's well being. On the Plateau however, several m\u00f4 thiem use possession by way of divi nation like Hmong shamans. 13.5.3 Indigenous Health Ingredients Types of Ingredients In order to compare what present day Nakai indigenous medicine contains by way of medicinal ingredients, following is a brief overview of types of elements: Inert substances of minerals (bright coloured minerals and soils) and liquids and solids that can cause transformations, such as water, acid, etc. Inert substances of animal origin, such as milk Excrement of newborn mammals, liz ards and insects, and urine Body parts of animals, such as bear gallbl adder, livers horns, teeth, bones, shells, skin Parts of aquatic animals, such as bones, shells and bo dy parts of fish, molluscs, crabs, etc. Plant species (200 medicinal plant species and over 1000 are listed in 200 medicinal plant species in neighbouring Gnommalath, and Bualapha Districts) Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 29Many of these ingredients are rare (endangered and rare animals) or from remote areas (shells from the ocean) and this seems to increase their value and 'magical' or transformational properties. Nakai Ingredients There are a limited number of herbalists and traditional health practitioners on the Nakai Plateau. One practitioners from Done uses the following combinations: A piece of stalactite left to infuse in rainwater to cure high fever; Salt and sugar with water for the treatments of diarrhoea (similar to oral re-hydration practices); Bones of flying squirrels to treat kidney stones, skin to treat burns and penis for boosting vigour in men - also civets, tiger and gibbon parts used for vigour; 100 plants for various complaints were recognised from existing records. 13.5.4 Changes in Indigenous Practices Choices in Health Treatment on the Plateau People in Nakai Tai claim that mo st now prefer biomedical drugs to traditional herbal remedy. This change has occurred since the NT2 Project provided th em with a 26-item Drug Revolving Fund (DRF) in 2000. The preference seems to have spread to all peop le, regardless of economic status and gender. Only the elderly still prefer first consulting with the spirits using a m\u00f4 yao . Younger people would rather borrow money for pills than to pick herbs for treatment. Ban Nong Boua villagers continue to use medicinal plants. Brou women in Nong Boua exemplified the most modern attitude to cure. A feverish toddler is given paracetamol on day one, gets a blood check on day two and might return to sleep at the hospital as of day three. This usually means getting an intravenous drip, known to be effe ctive. Before, in the old village, caretakers started with herbs until someone returned two hours later with pills. Both sorts were then given jointly; without fear for conflict between them. In fact, health-seeking behaviour generally relies on trial and error until cure or death. Initially, symptoms are given up to 48 hours to abate, before a new remedy or health provider is sought. In roadside villages, this often mean s just changing the antibiotic. In re mote ones natural, biomedical and spiritual means alternate or combine in increasingly rapid succession to ward off imminent death. Since the last traditional practitioner died at the previous Nong Boua site, no one has taken on this role. In Ban Done severity of presenting symptoms (high fever, abdominal pains, seizures) decides whether to start with herbs or drugs.. Conveniently, the Distri ct Hospital is a mere 40 minutes ride away (at 5000 kp/p) and prevention items like impregnated bed nets are now bought from the District Health Office for 8500kip, against 30.000 when sold in the market. In Ban Done biomedicine wa s introduced in 2000 and the drug fund has kept revolving thanks to rules stri ctly applied by the health worker. Drugs work fast, work most of the time, are easy to purchase, easily swallowed and include contraceptives. Diagnosis seems more reliable. But they are not free, must be bought from afar, often give side effects, and steadily lose quality. If used wrongly, they're outright dangerou s. Yet on the whole people trust biomedicine more (a disease may \"return\" following poor drug regime compliance - and an ything, including herbs, will cure a viral 3d fever). Herbal cure takes longer to surface, and only does so half of the time. A shared view exists on what herbs and drugs have going for or against them. Herbs are free and always somewhere at hand. They show fewer side effects than medicines. Remarkably people find that \"when herbs heal, they do it well and the disease doesn't return \". But preparing an herbal concoction may take up to 48 hours (if e.g.7 ingredients are all found at dist ant spots) and isn't often pleasant to swallow. In addition, few people know enough about formulas and locations to collect a reasonably potent remedy. Not all villages have their herbalist. A way of preserving tradition officially endorsed by the Ministry of Health is to include industrial as well as natural formulations in revolving drug kits. Conver sely, training herbalists to administer a DRF seems quite acceptable. Such a person could decide faster when to change remedies, and one needn't locate a second person to avail of both functions. If of course s/he were absent, one again would wish for decoupled skills! Certainly a Traditiona l Birth Attendant, possibly even a m\u00f4 m\u00f4n might usefully add drug therapy to their trade. The main cr iterion for these responsibilities was felt to be literacy and intelligence, not age or experience. Having the educated work with the experienced was called optimal. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 30 Modernizing Medicine on the Plateau There was no problem in acquiring the Tai Lao names for common herbs. The Ban Done herbalist doesn't know Brou names for the plants he uses. Thou gh over 60 he doesn't speak the language himself. This is also true for Nong Boua residents, one reside nt reporting: \"but we willingly trade our tradition and customs for those of the Lao\", referring to the change from burial to cremation. This process of assimilation and integration of culture seems at work in the domain of medicinal knowledge too. Most herbal doctors are disappearing without successors (\" Pou nom khi khaan hien, khi khaan khalam\" - young people don't bother with study or discipline) which means that the compendium of medicinal wisdom is being lost: \"Ancient m\u00f4 yao knew what time of the day, the week or the moon to take what part of a plant. We here just go and get what we need and know en ough about.\" In Nong Boua elders could still cite therapeutic indications, but younger people mostly knew but the names of common medicinal plants. As ancient practices are phased out, modern ways are phased in. The young and educated are the first to take pills. Once introduced the pr actice seems to spread quickly. Ya luang (great medicine ) works well and fast, and is promoted by the Ministry. Though Nong Boua's leader thinks an intelligent m\u00f4 yao might make a good health worker, he doubts a spirit conversely would think of possessing a health worker to call her into divining. Thus the trend becomes irreversible. Differing opinion among the leaders and young population and the elders and remaining practitioners exist in many villages. Not all are satisfied with hospital treatment and many complain about the costs of medicine. It is likely that both medical systems will coexist on the Plateau for some time to come even though some traditional pr actices are disappearing. 13.6 E DUCATION STATUS Information on the education status of the ethnic minorities on the Nakai Plateau can be obtained by combining literacy levels and school attendance statistics on the one hand and by visiting and assessing the conditions and functioning of educational facilities on the other (see Table 13-15). The education levels of village leaders are important in assessing the capacity of local au thorities to tackle the upcoming challenges of resettlement and livelihood development (see Table 13-16). In addition, knowledge of the Lao language is important when considering the consultation process. 13.6.1 Literacy From the various surveys carried out on the Nakai Plateau and from participatory observations made in the area, one can conclude that only a small percentage of villagers were literate in the La o language. None of the minority languages of the Plateau are written down. Except for a few women, mostly located in Ban Oudomsouk, roadside villages and recen t arrivals from lowland areas, the majority of women are illiterate. Some young women and girls who have had some ba sic schooling (village prim ary schools) exhibited varying degrees of literacy. Literacy levels for men appe ar to be only slightly higher due to a number of factors: boys tend to go to school for longer periods of time and have opportunities to acquire literacy from the monkhood and educational institutions outside the region. In addition, many laborers and recent male migrants are literate. Several village leaders we re originally from the lo wlands, showing that literacy can lead to positions of influence and power in the village. Table 13- 15 shows that 63% of the population of the Nakai Plateau never attended school. One can al so assume that most of the population with only primary school, which is the majority of those that did attend any school, are probably functionally illiterate if they have not been usin g their writing and reading skills regularly during adolescence and adulthood.

As is expected in a melting-pot culture, there is a lingua franca among all the different languages groups, in this case, it is the national language of the country. It should be pointed out, though, th at the dialect of Lao spoken on the Nakai Plateau (in most cases, Tai Bo) is only slightly different in terms of vocabulary and tones, and is mutually understandable for lowland La o-speakers (see Table 12-5).

The overwhelming ma jority of the ethnic minorities cate gorised their own skills in the Lao language as good or satisfactory. Most ethnic groups on the Plateau, nearly all children under the age of 10, have Lao or a Lao/Tai dialect as their mother tongue and little or no knowledge of Brou or Vietic languages. The Brou language was spoken by only a handful of households as the main language of communication in the domestic sphere, with the ex ception of Kaenggnao and Boua Ma where most seem to know Brou, and most Vietic families still used A hoe and Ph\u00f4ng as languages of daily interaction. Hence, it is a mistake to associate the knowledge of an ethnic language, such as Brou or Ahoe, with an ethnic group on the Plateau since most now speak only Lao or a dialect of Lao (Tai Bo). It is quite feasible that in 20-25 years there will be no ethnic minority languages spoken on the Nakai Plateau except between elders. An independent review of the lang uage situation on the Plateau (Enfie ld, Jan 2004 - Max Planck Institute) reports that: There do not appear to be qualit ative differences in economic livelihood between villagers of different ethnicities Language is not necessarily a defining criterion of ethnicity The Plateau is a site of intense language contact, and villagers are exposed to a number of different languages in daily life The process of ethnic minority language loss appe ars to be in advanced stages in most villages However, the report also notes that attitudes to langua ge loss vary from group to group. Many Brou stated that they did not regret the loss of their original language. The Vietic of Sop Hia, on the other hand, were conscious of the importance of their language and cult ural identity. All Ahoe in this village, including children, speak Ahoe as well as Lao and other language. 13.6.3 Education Facilities In many of the villages on the Nakai Plateau, schools are not functioning properly. Either attendance was low due to the need to gather NTFPs or plant rice (e very able-bodied pair of hands is sometimes needed) or teachers were not regularly conducting classes. During surveys, teachers who should have been conducting classes were often found at home, much to their embarrassment. The incentive for performing one's duty is not gr eat since the District only pays 30,000 Kip per month (approximately USD $ 30 in 1997). Some schools were fina nced by the villagers themselves since the local government had neither the funds nor could it provide for teachers. Due to the bad flooding in 1996, many families could not pay the fees to the teachers. 8 Villagers understand the importance of education but have little means of obtaining an education for their children. The exceptions are the large school in Ban Oudomsouk and the roadside village of Ban Nakai Ne ua. In theory each village (often shared in the case of small hamlets) should have its own primary school. However, only primary schools in large villages like Ban Done, Ban Boua Ma, Ban Nakai Tai and Ban Thalang were functioning properly. In many of the villages schools had not been func tioning at all for several years. The national curriculum is in the Lao language. For most ethnic minorities (Brou and Bo) on the Plateau this does not pose a problem since their mother tong ue is Lao. However, there are some children who have a minority language (Brou or Ahoe) as a mother tongue. Studies have reported that without consideration of et hnic languages (ADB 2001 - Health and Ed ucation Needs) ethnic minority children may become disadvantaged and drop out of school. Recruitment of local teachers that speak local languages will be one important way of addressing this issue. 13.7 G ENDER ISSUES Since the 1980s, improving the status of women has become an increasingly important aspect of development projects. This is beca use it was felt that previously women's labour was not always 8 A similar phenomenon is recorded in the Theun Hinboun region. Many villages had organised th eir own classes with a local person who could read and write as a teacher. Nominal fees collected from the families made up the teacher's salary. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 34transferred to the market and that men benefited more directly in the first stages of a transition from a subsistence to a market-oriented economy. WB OD 4.30 states that women should be considered as a \"vulnerable group\" in addition to considerations of ethnic minorities in WB OD 4.20. The ADB has a policy on gender and development that outlines programmes and initiatives. The division of labor between men and women is by no means absolute but there are clear notions of what is male work and what is female work among all the ethnic groups. Men, however, were frequently seen taking care of young children and doing domestic tasks while wome n could do all kinds of work in the fields if necessary. Villagers often exclaim that \"m en and women do the same work\". But upon further inquiry, there were some definite concepts of the division of labor. One common expression was phusay sak phuying nam , which translates as \"men make the hole in the ground using a pole, women place the rice seed in the hole\". This appears to be a co-operative work effort at first glance but it also symbolizes the superior position of men in these societies: the ma n goes first and stands upright, the woman follows behind and has to bend over. Table 13-18 lists th e most common tasks and responsibilities which men and women perform and some of the tasks often shared. The PRA map-making sessions, carried out as part of planning resettlement (S parkes 1997), also highlighted this division of labor and the inter- dependency of men and women in the establishment of a functioning household unit. Table 13-18: The Division of Labour Male work Shared Tasks Female Work heavy work in the fields such as removing large trees and cutting down trees contact with officials and government representatives overnight trips to markets in towns work with machines, motor boats and driving vehicles carpentry, blacksmith, boat- making, house-building and other tasks involving specialized tools formal positions of authority in the village herding buffalo and cattle fishing with nets and hunting and trapping weeding, clearing the fields, planting and harvesting collecting food in the forest and along streams and NTFPs for sale fetching drinking water from the river 9 most of the household tasks such as cleaning, washing clothes and preparing all the meals pounding rice twice a day looking after young children, the sick and the infirm taking care of domestic animals in the house area (pigs, chickens and ducks) taking care of the vegetable gardens near the house selling vegetables and forest products in the nearby markets The division of labour as outlined in the above table is representative for all ethnic groups on the Plateau. This is due in part to a shared production system and similar access to natural resources. In addition, no religious taboos or restrictions on either men or women doing certain types of work were recorded. However, there are some differences between the ethnic groups in relation to male and female behaviour and gender roles. The most noticeable difference is that Vietic groups and some Brou communities that have settled relatively recently on the Nakai Plateau from the NBCA, tend to have more restrictions governing female behaviour, including access to rooms, commensa lity and interactions with male relatives. Addressing these differences between the groups and ensuring that women also benefit from the Project can best be achieved through gender-segregated consultations and specific measures (see Section 26.5.1). The recent Gender Repor t on NT2 (Iram June 2004) examined th e roles of men and women in the various communities on the Plateau and the potential impacts and mitigation measures. In terms of 9 Men and women fetch water whenever they bathe, but women do so for all domestic uses including cooking, clearing and washing in addition. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 35workload for women in particular, it will be import ant to monitor changes in the livelihood system and introduction of market economics to a greater degree. 13.8 RELATIONS WITH NON-NAKAI PLATEAU GROUPS Interactions between the inhabitants of the Nakai Plateau and other peoples are common. Although the region is only slowly being integrated into the national economy, contact with other groups has been ongoing for centuries as illustrated above in Section 12.2.2. It is worth noting the different types of contact as well as former and existing trends: Transferral of cultural beliefs, no tably the spread of Buddhism and lowland cultural practices. Some men acquired their education in monasteries in the lowlan d areas and returned as learned men and religious practitioners. The spread of Buddhism has varied depending on relationship between the state and Buddhism. In the twentieth century, a form of Buddhism that was mixed with local beliefs existed on the Plateau with irregular contact with monasteries to the south. Sinc e 1975 there has been a decline in Buddhist activities until quite recently when a sma ll monastery was re-establis hed in Ban Oudomsouk. Changing livelihood patterns are ev idence of continuous contact with groups inside and outside of the region. Groups such as the Brou and Sek have influe nced the Vietic population in that the latter now practices sedentary agriculture and to a large extent have similar livelihood syst ems. The recently arrived Tai groups in the northern parts of the Plateau have also adapted their livelihood system to suit the ecological niche - swidden instead of their traditional paddy production. Recent attempts by the government (Nikhom 3) and different ethnic groups at introducing wet rice paddy have not been successful in most cases, due to agro -ecology rather than ethnic reasons. Trade in livestock illustrates contact with other groups surrounding the Plateau. Firstly, buffalo from the lowland areas were previously given to villagers on the Nakai Plateau for grazin g since there was limited pasture in the lowland areas of Gnommalath and Mahaxai Districts. Buffalo were traded both in the lowland areas of Thakhek District and over the mountains in Vietnam. Several trade routes were well established for these purposes and Brou and Vietic gr oups used their kinship and clan ties to maintain these economic links, but this does not seem to be evident today. Trade in NTFPs and wildlife reveals a similar arrangement of economic and social ties that are mutually supportive. The rich resources of forest were much sort after commodities in other parts. Ethnic groups hunted, fished and collected a variety of NTFPs for sale to middlemen from the lowland areas, Ban Lak Sao, Thailand and Vietnam. Items were often bartered for rice, salt and manufactured goods. This trade and the trade in livestock resulted in the introduction of many items produced in other areas as well as essential food supplies and goods. Marriage between groups outside the Plateau is comm on as is highlighted in Section 12.2.3 above. A number of partners, both male and female, come fr om areas surrounding the Plateau, including the Brou and Lao communities in the Gnommala t and Mahaxai Districts, the Vietic groups in the catchment area, Lao immigrants from all over the country (former members of Nikhom 3) and even some Tai groups from the Ban Lak Sao area. There are no strict rule s with the possible exception of the Tai groups, and there is considerable movement between region s for work, hunting and gathering and trading. Intermarriages are one of the many reasons for the 'melting pot' designation that describes the similarities between the ethnic groups on the Plateau (cf. Section 12.2). Disturbances during Second Indoch ina War (ca. 1962-1975) have result ed in involuntar y resettlement, village relocations and a refugee situation. Some groups were relocated in areas to the south of the Plateau due to fighting, including some Vietic groups. The children of these groups attended Lao schools and these people were exposed to Lao culture and cust oms. There was considerable movement of people from and to the Plateau and the catchment area throughout the war, resulting in furt her mixing, re- composition of villages and exposure to different cultures. In addition, many able-bodie d men joined the army, a multi-ethnic organization. Chapter 13: Nakai Plateau EMDP Baseline Data November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 36Lao Nation State and dominant lowland Lao values ha ve been influencing all of the cultures on the Plateau. The establishment of the new District Capital at Ban Oudomsouk has increased the number of Lao professionals, traders and service industry work ers. Education in Lao and the economic, social and political influence of the dominant lowland Lao is significant on all cultures on the Plateau. ********** * * * ********** Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 iCHAPTER 14 LOCAL PARTICIPATION ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU Table of Content 14 LOCAL PARTICIPATION ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU ....................................... 1 14.1 CONSULTATION PROCESS - PLANNING STAGE ............................................................. 1 14.1.1 Definitions Minority and 14.1.3.3 Vulnerable Groups.............................................................................................................. ........... 2 14.2 PCPD TEAMS AND REVIEW OF LOCAL CONSULTATIONS (1997-2004) ..........................2 14.2.1 PCPD in 1997 ..................................3 14.2.3 PCPD in 2004 ................................................................................................................... ..................................4 14.3 ASSESSMENT OF 'MEANINGFULNESS ' I N R E L A T I O N T O PROJECT DESIGN (1997-98) .....................................................................................................4 14.3.1 Quality of Discu ssion or Di alogue.............................................................................................. .....................5 14.3.2 Degree of Di sagreement......................................................................................................... ...........................6 14.3.3 Affects on Proj ect Design...................................................................................................... ...........................6 14.3.3.1 The decision to remain on the Plateau inst ead of relocation in the lowland areas................ 6 14.3.3.2 Alterations in house designs to suit th e needs and aspirations of the PAPs. ......................... 7 14.3.3.3 Modifications of the livelihoods sy stems .................................................................................... 7 14.3.3.4 Village layout................................................................................................................. .................. 7 14.4 RESULTS OF 2004 CONSULTATIONS ..............................................................................8 14.4.1 Ethnic As pects................................................................................................................. ...................................8 14.4.2 Recommend ations................................................................................................................ ..............................8 14.5 CONSULTATION PROCESS - IMPLEMENTATION STAGE .................................................9 14.6 VILLAGE ORGANISATIONS ............................................................................................9 14.6.1 Formal Village Organisa tions................................................................................................... .......................10 14.6.2 Informal Organi ......................11 14.6.2.1 ................. 14.6.2.2 Lao aders................................................................................................................. 12 14.6.3 Leadership an d Ethni city....................................................................................................... ..........................12 14.6.3.1 Village Leadership and Ethnicity............................................................................................... .1 2 14.6.3.2 Organizational Strength ens and Weak nesses............................................................................ 16 14.6.4 Institutional Arrangemen ts for Cons Fac ilitator s ........................................................................................................... ............. 17 14.6.4.2 Training and Supervision of Consultation Process.................................................................. 21 List of Tables Table 14-1: Village Leadership Information ................................................................................................. ......13 Table 14-2: Challenges for Resettlement of Villages on the Nakai Plateau ...................................................18 Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 114 LOCAL PARTICIPATION ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU 14.1 CONSULTATION PROCESS - PLANNING STAGE 14.1.1 Definitions of Consultation Public Consultation can be defined as the process through which the views and opinions of all interested parties or stakeholders are integrated into project planning, implementation and monitoring. Consultation is a type of communication that specifically establishes an ongoing 'feedback loop', integrating stakeholder views and opinions into various project activities. Communication also consists of information dissemination, including discussions with non-stakeholders and media presentation of the Project. Information to stakeholders on options and potential project impacts is often the first step in establishing the feedback loop. In the context of the NT2 Proj ect, this process was referred to as the 'Public Consultation and Participation Process' (PCPP) at the onset but was later modified to Public Consultation, Participation and Disclosure (PCPD), including aspects of document disclosure and translation to stakeholders. For the remainder of this chapter, the w hole process will be referred to as PCPD. Public Relations implies communication regarding all aspect s of the Project to the general public, including all forms of media representation and the availability of reports and documents concerning the projects. It does not necessary involve feedback although this could be an outcome of media presentation of the Project and is an integral part of the transparency of the Project. 14.1.2 Local Consultation Process A dialogue has been established with all stakeholders who are directly or indirectly involved in the NT2 Project and who have expressed a wish to participate in the PCPD. Consultation at local, regional, national and international levels is well advanced and will continue throughout the different project stages. In this section, the local consultation process will be investigated. A full account of the consultation process on all levels is found in Volume 1 (Chapter 4). Local PCPD prior to the signature of the Concession Agreement had three main steps: Step 1 : Information collection and dissemination : This initial step aims to promote awareness among PAPs. Information flows in two directions, both from the local people to the project personnel and in the opposite direction. Awareness of local conditions is attained through the collection of data relating to social aspects, livelihoods, health, education and ot her areas which facilitate evaluation of impacts and planning for project implementation. Additionally, information is disseminated to stakeholders detailing project features and implications for altered social and physical environments. Step 2 : Eliciting Stakeholder Concerns : Comments from stakeholders in response to information gained during Step 1 are sought and discussions of alternatives and proposed mitigation activities encouraged. In this way, issues that may have been previously over looked or outstanding concerns of stakeholders are given a forum for review. This represents a needs-a ssessment, and provides a base from which decisions can be made. This is 'informed' and focused discussion that can lead to important insights and avoidance of problems at an early stage. Phase 3 : Active Involvement in Project Design and Implementation : Based on the decisions made in Step 2, requirements for education, training, financial and inst itutional strengthening are identified and integrated into project design. The process w ill continue during implementation so that stakeholders may be fully involved throughout the process. This process is no t linear, but provides for cyclical feedback, should deficiencies at any stage be evident. 14.1.3 Ethnic Minority Languages and Special Provisions World Bank Safeguard Policy (OD 4.20) and ADB Policy (1998) on Indigenous Peoples state that a strategy for local participation should ensure that indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities are involved in decision-making throughout the planning and implementation of the project. Effective channels of communication should be established to ensure local preferences and local- level participation. In order to do, this special attention needs to be given to a number of aspects: Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2 Language sensitivity - making sure information is understood and the ethnic groups have the means of communicating their concerns; Provisions to ensure women participate in consultations and are not dominated by men; Provisions to ensure vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, the poor, female-led households, etc., participate. 14.1.3.1 Language and Consultations The vast majority of the people on the Plateau understand and speak Lao well, most speaking Lao or a dialect of Lao as their mother tongue. However, as indicated in Section 13.5 there are some households that may have poor speaking skills and some that only use the Lao la nguage in interaction with people outside the village. In addition, one should consider the fact that many people will feel more at ease expressing themselves in an ethnic minority langua ge rather than Lao, which may not be their mother tongue. During local consultations, following steps have and will continue to be taken regarding language. Before consultations, assess the level of understanding of the Lao language - one should asks a number of people present, especially women and th e elderly in order to make sure that everyone understands and speaks Lao;Whenever there is any doubt as to the level of understanding, assign a local member of the community who is fluent in bo th Lao and the ethnic minority language to do simultaneous translation;. Using a translator will slow the consultation proces s down considerably and it might be necessary to form two groups to conduct discussions separately. Separation of a village al ong ethnic lines if there more than one ethnic minority present and if this is suggested or insisted on by one of the groups - parallel meetings should be held and a plenum session can then be held at the end of the consul tation if considered useful for sharing ideas between the groups 14.1.3.2 Participation of Women Ensuring the participation of women in the consultation process will require a pro-active approach since most leadership positions and experience in dealing with outsiders and official organisations are considered the role of the men. Thus the Project will pursue: Female facilitators, preferably with a knowledge of the local culture and ethnic minority languages, will be given the responsibility of presenting info rmation and conducting di scussions with women; Separate groups for consultations are necessary to allow women the freedom to express their opinions; Information on households has be en and will be gathered from bo th men and women in the future so as to present a balanced picture of the domestic sphere, a predominantly female sphere; Female representation in local leadership through the Lao Women's Union provides planners a means of encouraging women to participate in consultations 14.1.3.3 Vulnerable Groups The involvement of vulnerable groups in consultations is essential in order to ensure that the weaker and poorer members of communities are in volved in planning and implementation. This is also the case with smaller ethnic groups that are often under-represented in local organisations and less experienced than other groups. Consul tation Teams will: Identify all socially and economically vulnerable groups in the village - poorest households, the elderly and households run by women or without able-bodied men to assist in the relocation. Identify small ethnic minorities in the different Pl ateau villages, for example the Vietic groups in Sop Hia, Nakai Tai and Phonphanpek or the Tai-speaking persons in Ka-Oy. Separate groups or individual interviews and di scussions should be held with these groups or households, with language possibly being a factor in the case of ethnic minority groups. 14.2 PCPD TEAMS AND REVIEW OF LOCAL CONSULTATIONS (1997-2004) The stakeholders at the local level are those directly affected by the Proj ect that is residing in villages on the Nakai Plateau that are to be relocated. PCPD teams have been established and trained in PRA techniques to facilitate the flow of information. The teams comprise local Lao people, drawn from a range of backgrounds and experience in Public Cons ultation, social surveys, anthropology and education. Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3In addition, the teams represent a diversity of socio-economic, cultural, gender, and generational perspectives. They have and continue to carry out work in villages and report directly to the RMU, which will be responsible for resettlemen t planning and implementation. Since PCPD is in some respects a new approach to project planning, innovation was an important factor in being successful at soliciting opi nions and engaging the local population in discussions about the potential impacts of NT2. The traditional decision-making process through traditional consultation among leaders and indirectly with community members wa s supplemented and altered by the presence of outsiders and new methods. These methods aimed to establish trust and a partnership for development in the future as well as provide information and avoid the problem of 'consultation fatigue'. Innovative methods included: PRA methods such as making resour ce maps and 'dream village' maps; Visits to the demonstration farms to see interventions and aspects of the livelihood model; Video presentation of the Project and its e ffective on the population of the Plateau; Gender-segregated discussion groups. 14.2.1 PCPD in 1997 The first stages of PCPD have been coordinated by an NTEC consultant who has been responsible for training, planning and reporting on consultation activities on the Plateau. The RMU is responsible for carrying out PCPD activities at the local level and builds upon this experience. The RMU will ensure that there is continuity in the consultation process through adequate representation of all interest groups. Methods used during the first PCPD were participant observation, sample interviews and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) techniques. Up dating existing quantitative data on the villages was also carried out to some extent. The goals were: To ensure that all directly affected people living in the reservoir were aware of and understood the main features and impacts of the Project and the implications of relocation; To collect information in regard to existing village development systems and decision making processes (defining their structure and efficiency); To document existing livelihood patterns, land usage and aspects of society (socio-cultural and economic) likely to be affected by relocation; To conduct meetings with villagers to facilitate di scussions of their concerns and aspirations and to document these to channel to pr oject decision-making, includin g villagers' choice of locations, priorities and preferences regarding village layouts and house designs. The results of this PCPD work have been published by NTEC under the title of Observations Relating to the Resettlement of People on the Nakai Plateau (May 1997). These activities co rrespond to Phases 1 and 2 of PCPD mentioned above. 14.2.2 PCPD in 1998 A second round of PCPD work on the Nakai Platea u was carried out in Apr il and May 1998 and included members of the newly formed RMU as well as an NTEC consultant. During this visit, discussions were held on many issues raised previously and the prop osed livelihood model was also presented and feedback obtained, that is Phases 2 and 3 as described above. Extensive use was made of visual aids, including posters, diagrams, pictures and a video explaining the construction of the NT2 dam, resettlement and livelihood options. See Figures 4-1, 4- 2, 4-4 and 4-7 to 4-10 of Chapter 4 for examples of the participatory process and the most recent visual aids used. The main goals of this round of PCPD on the Plateau were the following: To ensure that affected people were fully aware of and understood the features and impacts of the Project and the implications of relocation by means of the video and discussions concerning livelihood model, house desi gn and the village move; To update statistical information about population and village inst itutions as well as noting any changes in the socio-economic situation in the villages; To conduct meetings with villagers to facilitate discussions of their con cerns and aspirations in relation to the proposed livelihood model; Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 4 To identify existing community development syst ems which could be utilized and improved during implementation; To explore potential mechanisms for esta blishing village Resettlement Committees. The results of this PCPD are summarized in an NTEC report ( PCPD on the Nakai Plateau , July 1998) and form the basis for some of the revisions of the Draft RAP that have been incorporated into many of the chapters in Final RAP (July 1998). It also identified so me items relating to plan ning PCPD activities for the next two years and a PCPD plan for RAP activities (See Chapter 4). Additional information was made available at Project Information Centres that were established outside Ban Oudomsouk and Thakhek. These centres have provided further points of contact between the Project and villagers, dealing with inquiries and disse minating information in various forms. The centres also are utilized to hold periodic meetings of v illage and district representatives and local Non- Government Organizations (NGOs). 14.2.3 PCPD in 2004 Public consultation has been carried out by the RMU since the formation of the organization. There has been regular contact between the PAPs and members of the RMU both through informal discussions and meetings and more inform al interaction during the two main c onsultation phases (1997-98 and the recent 2004 consultations). It is important to emphasize that many members of the RMU participated in the PCPD exercises and data collection surveys on the Platea u, and this provides an important continuity and familiarity for the villages in the coming years in the detailed design phase prior to construction and relocation. See Table 4.4 in Chapter 4 for further details. The 2004 consultations were the most extensive to date and built on a number of important lessons learnt from the previous consultations. In addition, more information about the project, its impacts and the proposed mitigation arrangement have been detailed in the interim. The main steps in the consultation process are explained in detail in Sect ions 4.8.1 and 4.9.1, in Chapter 4 of Vol. 1 of the SDP. Here certain methodologies related to ethnic minorities will be summarised: The size of sample for participatio n in this round of consultations included all affected households sending at least one member to participat e in the discussions at the village level Separate group discussion and consultations for Vietic groups in Ban Sop Hia, separating the Tai groups originally from Lak Sao and the indigenous Vietic into two groups. Language checks before commencement of consultations and discussions in local languages (Brou and Vietic) The choice of the 10 Village Facili tators included people from di fferent ethnic groups, male and female members, traditional and formal (political) leaders, different age groups and different levels of skills and literacy to present a balanced select ion of village members to represent the diversity within the village The Consultations Process involved the selection of Village Facilitator s, training of these facilitators in the village by an independen t communications consultant (D r. Anek Nakabutr) and his team from Thailand and monitored by an independent international anthropologist (Dr. Jim Chamberlain). 14.3 ASSESSMENT OF 'MEANINGFULNESS ' IN RELATION TO PROJECT DESIGN (1997-98) The notion of 'meaningfulness' is central in the evaluation of the effectiveness of public consultation for any large infrastructure project. If the consultation pr ocess is central to the overall success of the Project and to ensure participation of stakeholders, especially at the local level, it is abso lutely essential to develop criteria in assessing activities on the ground. In assessing the effect of consultations, one has to consider the context of Lao PDR both in relation to the traditional forms of consultation and the politic al situation. New ideas and innovations introduced new concepts and means of communication. In addition, the fact that there are different ethnic minorities in the Project Area needs to be co nsidered, although a shared livelih ood system and me lting-pot culture reveal that there are shared concerns that are common among all groups regarding resettlement planning and implementation. Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 5The following aspects are considered as a way of assessing the meaningfulness of the consultation process: The quality of discussion and dialogue; The degree of disagreement; The effects of the decision-making process on project planning. These aspects will be discussed with selected exampl es from the consultations that have already taken place on the Nakai Plateau. 14.3.1 Quality of Discussion or Dialogue The quality of the discussions and dialogues under the consultation process is to some extent subjective but the kinds of comments should indicate whether the information on the Project is understood and the kind of issues that are brought up. Some examples of this are: Food Security was a major concern of villagers is food security given rice shortfall and the unpredictable nature of the climate. This was expressed often as bo mi khao kin (no food/rice to eat) or bo mi phau kin (not enough food/rice to eat) by all the ethnic groups on the Plateau that suffer from rice shortages. The first priority was to be full ( kin khao im ). According to the social surveys and work with the livelihood model, this aspect has been the most challenging since the concern with food security is so central but cannot be met completely without cash income. Resettlement in Lao PDR is often associated with rice paddy cultivation. One Bo villager from Ban Sop Ma summed it up like this: Yaak kin khao pai muang na If you would like to eat rice, go to Gnommalat; Yaak kin pa hai yu muang phu If you would like to eat fish, stay on the Plateau; Yaak dai su hai pai Nakai If you would like a girlfriend, go to Nakai; Yaak tai hai pai nawang If you would like to die, go to the northern forests (nawang). Many discussions comparing relocation on the Gnommalat Plain below and the promise of irrigated paddy verses remaining on the Plateau near the fore sts were complex and touc hed on key issues of availability of resources, infrastruc ture improvements and potential cash-earning possibilities as well as food security. It was clear that all ethnic groups co uld see the inter-connections of all these items. Resource Mapping was a successful tool for eliciting views and confirming interpretations since the making of maps was a joint effort and often provoked discussions on locations, form (linear along roads or cluster type), ownership, assess, seasonal use an d the quality of resources. PRA exercises like this allow for corrections and different opinions as the exerci se proceeds. The comparis on of male and female resource and 'dream village' (Sparkes 1997; Chapter 12) resulted in some li vely interactions and corrections. The practical aspects of village life can be summarized by an expression of a Brou farmer at Ban Khone Khen: Tang pai wat man kieng, tang pai nong man meun The path to the wat is well trodden; the way to the fishpond is slippery. Comparative Experiences : comparisons with the recent relocation of Ban Jat San and forced collectivization in the late 1970s. Ma ny could point out the faults and mistakes of the houses, layout and problems in managing the nearby pine plantations. De tails such as a lack of adequate rooms, lack of facilities for cooking, no toilets, shortage of water, softwood beams and floors and other aspects gave insights in what to avoid when planning new dwellings. PCPD team members were forced to go into detail and show how planning and implementation would be different and rely on co-operation and participation of the PAPs. The Bo and Brou villagers at Ban Boua Ma suffered greatly under the forced collectivization policy provoking one Br ou villager to state: 'we'll go but we don't want it to be another Sumwang!', referring to the person responsib le for the former resettlement programme. Neighbours : it became clear from numerous discussions that the men and women from all the ethnic groups looked upon relocation in a different ma nner. Women voiced concerns about who would be neighbors and the importance of family relationships that would not have been voiced in male or mixed groups. One Bo woman from Ban Sailom stated that sip kha na bo tho ha kha lang (ten legs in front does not equal five in the rear), meaning in this context, that five old neighbours are more worth than ten new ones. Neighbors are referred to in terms of kinship ( phi naung ) or as sharing the same spirit ( phi diaw ). Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 614.3.2 Degree of Disagreement The amount of disagreement, both with proposed models and aspects of the resettlement and among themselves are good indicators of the openness of discussions and the quality of interactions. Some examples include: Upon explaining the draft livelihood model which did not include rice and emphasized home gardens and forest management, villagers in Ban Sop Hia open ly disagreed with one Ahoe man stating that: kin ta pak kap makmai pen ling (eating just veggies and fruit, we'll turn into monkeys). This indicated the importance of rice with regard to any potential livelihood model. Reactions to the proposed forestry management plan were mixed at first with some villages stating, pai dai, hien dai (we can go [be relocated], we can learn) but others were sceptical seeing this proposal as a threat to food security: kin mai bo dai (we can't eat wood), as one Bo man stated. Disagreements on house designs are a good example of changing attitudes and aspirations of the populations on the Plateau. Traditional house design s were studied and several models were drawn as examples for the second round of PCPD. The ethnic sensitivity (different designs for Vietic groups as opposed to Bo and Brou styl es) that had gone into these designs turn ed out to be misdirected. Villagers of all ethnic groups overwhelmingly chose the variation closest to a lowland Lao design rather than their traditional house style. Apparently, the Lao design was associated with progre ss and was more spacious although details in locations of doors, windows, the size of the veranda and the location of the kitchen were retained as local features. Many were sceptical of relocation and feared that they would not receive assistance, stating that moving was a difficult and tiresome process: nyay heun sai wela sapson theung pheun ja ko mai yung yak (moving houses is time-consuming and a confusing experience ev en with assistance - to build anew is difficult). Such skepticism forced consultation teams into outlining aspects in more detail and answering questions on specific aspects. Another related aspect was concern about fruit trees: yak makmai - tonmai kao (I want to have fruit trees - mature trees). Planners were forced to pay more attention to long-term implications and difficulties foresee by villagers in the move. Another concern, not really a disagreement but rather something that had not received enough attention in earlier planning, was that of the importance of rituals and their relationship to a successful relocation of the village. One Bo villager in Ban Sop On stated yoknyay phi muang, nyay phasa dai - ao pha song ma het phiti khaknae (moving the village spirit and the cemetery requires the monks conduct the proper rituals). This affects the time and how the practical arrangements are figured out prior to the actual move as well as the role of village leaders and ritual specialists. In general, it should be concluded that people expressed themselves openly and many expressed their opinions and skepticism towards the Project. Members of all ethnic groups stated that promises were not kept on previous occasions and that there could be many problems such as no actions or follow-up, only talk ( yan bo kheu wao ), fear of inequality of some benefiting while others will not ( yan bo samom sameu phu dai phu bo khwan lai teua laew ). 14.3.3 Affects on Project Design Many of the consultations have resulted in direct influence on project design and planning. 14.3.3.1 The decision to remain on the Plateau in stead of relocation in the lowland areas Despite the fact that there was an option at the commencement of detailed project planning for resettlement areas on the Gnommala th Plain below the Nakai Plateau, all ethnic groups expressed the strong desire to remain near the forests and not opt for the development of irrigated rice fields in the lowlands. For the Vietic and Bo ethnic groups, the option of paddy in an area that was unfamiliar was never a consideration since these groups have little in the way of direct contact with the people in the lowlands and no kinship relations with the population there. In addition, the Vietic, and to some extent the Bo, are reliant on the resources available in the forests of the Plateau and surrounding NBCA for food and income. Agricultural techniques are not as well developed among these two groups since a sedentary lifestyle was only relative ly recently adopted. Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7For the Brou, the option of relocation to Gnomma lath District was discussed among the villagers, especially in Ban Done and Ban Khone Khen where th ere are a number of kinship ties and former trade relationships between these Brou villagers and thos e on the Gnommalath Plain. Some Brou villagers stated that they would prefer to relocate and obtain paddy in the lowlands but the vast majority preferred resettlement on the Nakai Plateau, opting for the fam iliar and continuity rather than something new that would involve relocation in another pa rt of the province. It may still be the case that some Brou families may prefer to relocate near relatives and kin in the lowlands, and this is an option covered under cash payment and disturbance allowances for thos e who chose to locate off the Plateau. However, the original area identified by the Project for relocation of villages and whole communities in the lowlands will not be developed. This is a strong indication that planners ha ve taken into account the wishes of the ethnic minorities on the Plateau since relocation to lowland areas is common practice in many parts of the country. Development of a sustainable livelihood system for the Nakai Plateau is challenging given the poor soils. 14.3.3.2 Alterations in house designs to suit the needs and aspirations of the PAPs. House designs for resettlers have been determined as a result of many discussions and consultations with all ethnic groups on the Plateau. Init ially, as explained in Section 15.3 below, anthropologists studied the differences in house designs and identified two basic types - closed veranda and open veranda styles (see Figures 15-1 and 15-2 in Chapter 15), the former used by Vietic groups and the latter by most Bo and Brou inhabitants of the Nakai Plateau. There were also a number of Lao or lowland style houses but initially the emphasis was on establishi ng a number of styles acceptable to the different ethnic minorities. To the surprise of the anthropologists, all ethnic gr oups preferred the open veranda style, including the Vietic groups in Sop Hia who still us ed their traditional design. The Ah oe and Phong villagers complained that the old style was not attractive ( bo ngaam ) and there was too much smoke from cooking ( khwam lei ). Some Vietic in Sop Hia and nearly all Vietic groups in Nakai Tai and Phonphanpek now live in houses with open verandas and the practical advantages s eem to be understood by those Vietic occupying traditional dwellings. There was considerable feedback regarding the details of the designs, such as the placement of doors, the size of windows, need for larger kitchen areas, etc. In addition, Brou villagers comments that there should be a clear indication that different family sizes need different types of houses - hence the double-roof for larger houses, based on the larger Brou houses in Boua Ma and Done villages. 14.3.3.3 Modifications of the livelihoods systems Modifications to the suggested live lihood systems worked out by variou s experts are also important in showing that the different ethnic minorities' voices were listened to when planning the details of livelihood restoration and developmen t for the Plateau inhabitants. Th e feedback on the draft livelihood models in 1997 and 1998 resulted in a number of significant changes. These include: The introduction of rice as an integral part of the livelihood model followed continuous questions and concerns about food security and cultivation of rice, the staple crop for all ethnic groups. It was not enough to produce vegetables and obtain income from forestry in order to purchase rice, but the psychological factor of food security, of producing at least enough rice to feel at ease during the resettlement move. Many villagers, particularly along th e rivers (Vietic, Bo and Brou) me ntioned fishing and the possibilities of fishing in the reservoir. Their main concern was proper equipment since the nets and traps they possessed would not be suitable for fishing in a shallow lake. Training and equipment for improved f i s h i n g , a s w e l l a s o r g a n i s i n g t h e m a n a g e m e n t o f f i s h i n g r e s o u r c e s , b e c a m e a n i m p o r t a n t a s p e c t i n t h e revised livelihood plan. 14.3.3.4 Village layout Village layout was studied during the planning and most villages, except for roadside villages, were of the 'cluster type', that is houses were groups according to kinship relations and available space, usually parallel to a river. Roadside villages tended to have houses aligned on both sides of the road with the remaining houses were scattered behind them. During the first round of consultations, villagers, especially women, emphasised the importance of being close to kin alth ough the layout proposal was first based on optimal use of resources and time saved in going to fields - houses spread out along a road providing easy access Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 8to fields. Reactions from all groups were critical, es pecially among the Bo, Brou and Vietic villagers that were not located along existing roads. People wanted to live closer together and stated that they did not mind walking to their fields. However, many liked the idea of everyone being located along the road, an important sign of development. Village layouts and configurations were modified for the Pilot Village (mixed Bo and Brou ethnic groups) after considerations of clan and kin relations into gr oupings. This involved rethinking the 'scientific approach' to production based on being close to fiel ds and opting for a cluster solution but with every house arranged along the road. It is likely that such compromises w ill occur when other villages are moved. Religious considerations Relocation should occur af ter consultations with village leaders and ritual experts in order to fulfil traditional requirements. All ethnic groups stated that carrying out proper rituals was essential during the relocation for the co ntentment of the villagers. Villagers ra rely volunteered such ideas but when anthropologists discussed these matters, it became apparent that the spirit world played an important role in the worldview of all ethnic groups. During the relocation of the three families from So p On to the new houses on the Demonstration Farm, ceremonies were held. This was much appreciated an d no doubt helped in a smooth transition for the family. A culturally sensitive approa ch would involve discussions on the timing and details of location for new villages with village leaders, both political and religious leaders. 14.4 RESULTS OF 2004 CONSULTATIONS 14.4.1 Ethnic Aspects The 2004 Consultations were more sensit ive in relation to ethnic issues than the previous consultations in that ethnicity was one of the factors in determining the approach and methodology of the consultations. The following aspects and special provisions should be noted: Consultations included at least one member from each affected household. Members that did not attend the first meeting were informed later by th e Village Facilitators - thus 100% coverage of affected households rather than a sample that may or may not be representative Language checks were carried out in all villages prio r to the consultations in order to ensure that all groups, including women and the elderly participated Information was presented in the form of posters and diagrams since the majority are not functionally literate on the Plateau. Selection of Village Facilitators included members of all ethnic grou ps in the community so that all interest groups could voice their opinions GoL officials were informed about ethnic issues and suitable approaches to be used and their awareness of ethnic issues has improv ed during this consultation round In Sop Hia, parallel consultations were conducted fo r the Tai and Vietic groups since it had become apparent over the last 5 years that these two groups required different resettlement solutions 14.4.2 Recommendations The recommendations or lists of concerns of v illages are presented in detail in Chapter 4. These include proposals for modifications of livelihood options, house design, additional assistance and equipment and other aspects. Many of the concerns and proposals are already covered in the Concession Agreement and are included in the SDP. A number of issues will be considered regarding the details of the implementation arrangements - these issues have b een recognised as 'feasible and worth considering'. Proposals for the Nakai Plateau include: Village Layout : barb-wire fence around the village prope r, gardens near the house, future land for village expansions, agricultural ar eas larger than one ha per hous eholds, modifications to village layout, wells and taps to more houses and new village office Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 9 House Design : larger poles, larger bathroom with toilet, thicker timber beams, taps on upper floors, larger houses, larger windows, larger veranda/re ception area, house ownership certificate to be issued and larger distance between houses Crop Production : larger garden, survey to improve soil qualit y, hand tractor, relocation activities to start immediately, barb-wire fence, subsiding wate r and electricity fees, clear land allocation and organisation of production groups Livestock : larger number of livestock to be kept by resettlers and larger grazing areas as compensation Fisheries : fish pond (also for frogs and eels) and means for transportation fish to markets Forestry: villagers to be allowed to cut trees for buildings and repairing houses and allowed to export logs Other livelihood options : priority in obtaining work with the Project, sewing and weaving machines, start-up funds for small busine sses and support for village blacksmiths In addition to these proposals made by the villages, the consultation process was reviewed by an independent anthropologist who made recommendations regarding the consultation process as it enters a transition period from planning to implementation and monitoring. The following observations and recommendations were made: Need to focus on the non-material aspects of the resettlement process - the re-establishment of a fully functioning society (social, economic, political , cultural and psychological), especially on the central role of 'social capital', that is systems of r eciprocity, beliefs, social status and other cultural aspects). There needs to be a greater awareness of how these aspects constitute a society by planners during the resettlement process. Continued process of consultation and incorporation of concerns and proposals made by the villages. This involves a follow-up visit soon to show how villagers' comments have actually been incorporated into project design. This should continue throughout the implementation phase, and the role of Village Facilitators is important in carrying this out. GoL staff from the district, province and seconded project staff now have a greater appreciation of ethnic issues but there is still ro om for improvement. Fu rther training and discussion need to be carried out to ensure that ethnic issues are fully incorporated into planning and implementation. Both the villagers' concerns and proposals as well as the recommendation by the independent reviewer will be incorporated in to the ongoing revision of the plans and future implementation arrangements. 14.5 CONSULTATION PROCESS - IMPLEMENTATION STAGE Sections 14.1-14.4 outlined the consultation process in terms of planning and incorporation of concerns and opinions of affected persons into project documents. The following sections in this chapter will outline how the consultation process will contin ue during implementation and what institutional arrangements will be in place to ensure that ethn ic issues are considered during implementation and monitoring. When considering implementation it is nece ssary to examine the following aspects: Existing village organisations and structures and what roles these will have in consultations and implementation arrangements for resettlement and monitoring Ethnic representation in leadership and the stre ngthens and weakness of leadership in general Institutional arrangement for carrying out consultations and monitoring Consideration of funds (budget arrangements) and schedule for continued consultations 14.6 VILLAGE ORGANISATIONS The village organisations in the cons ultation and planning proc esses need to be examined in some detail. Positions of economic, social and political power have considerable influence in project decision-making and how the benefits of the Project may be shared by a community as a whole. The situation on the Nakai Plateau is complex since there are different kinds of organisations, and their roles often overlap, being Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 10either complementary or competitive. The first type of organisations is formal political structures and the second one is the informal structures, including po sitions of traditional/ritual, economic and political influence. Originally, leading families (often founder families) had a monopoly on fo rmal village positions such as the village headman and the Council of Elders ( thau khun ) as well as the most important ritual roles. Material wealth was usually equated with political, social and spiritual power. The present situation is one of transition due to the integration into the Lao State and the creation of positions that are nominated by outside governing bodies instead of positions being mostly hereditary. These new positions often parallel traditional ones but nominations depend more on education, experience, economic influence and Party membership than traditional claims to spiritual power or founding families. 14.6.1 Formal Village Organisations The following is a list of formal village organisations, consisting of either elec ted/appointed positions or traditional positions that are usually inherited. Ther e is considerable overlap between these two types: The village headman (nai ban or phau ban ) is the leader of the village and is responsible for all formal relations with district authorities and with other v illages. He is responsible for collecting taxes on the quantity of rice produced in the villa ge, appoints other officials in th e village, judges disputes and is ultimately responsible for law and order. This was traditionally a position mono polized by certain leading families but education, experience in dealing with the world outside the village and local politics are now playing an important role. The assistant headman (hong nai ban ) and the representative ( kamakan ) assist the village headman in decision making and carrying out his work in the v illage. All three members fo rm the village committee that is elected every three years when district offici als approve the candidacy of five villagers. From the five, the village elects three, the candidate with the most votes beco mes headman, the second most, the assistant and the third most, repres entative. All members of the village committee in all of the villages were male. Section Leaders and Assistants (hua na nway and hong nway ) are appointed by the village head and are responsible for helping to call the populace to meetin gs and implementing the headman's decisions. There can be up to four sections ( nway) in larger villages and none in the sm allest village. Sections are usually based on physical proximity but in Ban Sop Hia, for example, there are two sections dividing the original members of the village (mostly Vietic groups) and the new arrivals (Tai Me n and Tai Moey) who built houses beside the existing village. Council of Village Elders (thau khun ) is a traditional organization that was previously responsible for resolving disputes of all types within the village an d advising the village headman. These positions are often hereditary and occupied by the eldest males fr om founding families. There was also one case from Ban Sop Hia that the local female medium was the sole thau khon in the village. Ban Sop On had three founding families (two brothers and one sister) whose members appoint the thau khun of that village. The role of the elders has been altered by new positions introduced by the government, reducing their role to one of guardians of traditional knowledge. Primarily they are now responsible for organizing annual phi muang ceremonies, approving marriage ties and maintaining fr iendly relations with the spirit world. In fact, members (usually three) are often religious specialists. Advisory Councils for Disputes (san kai kia ) were formed in 1996 for the fi rst time and have taken over the arbitrator's role of the thau khun . They act to advise the headman when making decisions. In most villages there is considerable overla p between these new councils and the thau khun and often other organizations. For many the distinctions are not clear. The task is often expressed in terms of resolving disputes within families an d between village members - phit kap phi nong and phit kap phua and \"arguments between husband and wife\") . In most villages there were a number of disputes recorded which were resolved by the headma n with the advice of the elders and/or the advisory council in 1996-97. The headman of the san kai kia and the two other members are appointed by the village headman. Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 11The Lao Front for National Construction ( niaw hom ) consists of one to three members depending on the size of the village and is mainly responsible for or ganizing large communal proj ects, although villagers often did not understand its role and confused it with the thau kun and the san kai kia in many cases. The Youth Organization (sao num ) was for the most part inactive in the villages visited but some informants mentioned that they also organized large projects or help ed in recruiting men for military service. The leader of the Youth Organization is ofte n a Party member who reports directly to local Party officials and recruits potential members in the villages. The Village Militia (kon hong ) usually consists of two to three men bu t it is unclear what their role is from interviews with villagers. Some mention that they are re sponsible for patrolling the area while others claim that the army has now taken over that task. The Lao Women's Union (LWU - sahaphan maeying ) is the only official organization in which women play a direct role. No women occupied any of the above posi tions with the exception of the ceremonial role of the thau khun in two villages. The role of the union varies from village to village and depends for the most part on the leadership skills of the head of the union ( hua na ). In some cases the union had organized communal vegetable gardens and distributed informati on on health issues and was well organized into sections ( nway), a structure that paralleled the male structur e of village headman, s ections, assistants and representatives. In other villages there were no ac tivities recorded. The procedure for electing the union members parallels the elections of male officials. It was clear from making inquiries into formal villa ge structures that many people were ignorant of the different positions, responsibilities and roles of the le aders. The number of positions and people involved in the various decision-making processes seems unclear to even the leaders in some cases. In one village, Ban Ka Oy, there were 18 official titles in a villa ge of 23 households! There seems to be a gap between formal structures and actual practice in making impo rtant decisions. The role of the village head and his assistant were always clear but their efforts varied. Th e role of the other organizations differed but for the most part they were either inactive or played a minor role in decision-making. 14.6.2 Informal Village Organisations In order to understand better the workings of decisi on-making in the village setting, one should examine informal organisations, which are just as important - at times even more so. These can be divided into two kinds that have significant influence on decision-maki ng at the village level: leading families and Party members. 14.6.2.1 Village Elites In many villages the key positions within the formal organizations are concentrated in a number of leading families with certain members holding two positions such as combining the thau khuon and the san kai kia or rotating between cousins and rel ations the key positions of village he adman, assistant and leader of the san kai kia . When individual villagers were asked who were not part of this village '\u00e9lite', they expressed opinions that the leaders looked after their own inte rests and the interests of their families first and foremost. It is no coincidence that economically strong families are also well connected politically. Thus there appears to be a nucleus of power in each v illage which excludes the majority of members. Leaders are often from families with the largest buffalo herds, the best paddy fields and contacts with outsider middlemen who collect NTFPs. Monopolizing key resources and controlling the supply of key items means that leaders can persuade many villagers to agree to their preferred actions. Kinship ties often reinforce such an economic power base. As with formal leadership positions , educated villagers of any ethnic group tended to dominate these kinship groups. 14.6.2.2 Lao Socialist Party The second informal structure is the Lao Socialist Party ( pak pasason pathivat lao ). It is difficult to collect data on membership within the village since people ar e not forthcoming about the activities of members and rarely state that they themselves are members. Only one case was reported in which the man admitted being an active member of the Party. The task of Party members involves monitoring the activities within the village and making verbal or in some cases writte n monthly reports at district or provincial meetings. In this way the authorities keep an eye on what is going on in the v illages and ensure that government policy is being followed. The result is that villagers are cautious in expr essing their opinions about politics Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 12in many cases. They fear that being outspoken will draw attention to themselves. No doubt villagers themselves know who is a member, often leaders of the militia or the Youth Organization as well as new members and old soldiers who fought in the Second Indochina War. Not all members are active but they are a group that can be m obilized when needed. However, it would be wrong to portray this group as extremely influential since economic power and traditional positions are perhaps in most contexts more influential on decision-making. 14.6.2.3 Ritual Leaders Another important informal groups are ritual leaders. This is a diverse group of individuals who conduct various rituals and ceremonies on beha lf of the villagers. Most ritual sp ecialists are respected for the skills in communicating with the spirits in times of need (for rain, good harvests, recovery after childbirth, etc.) or when requesting intervention (finding the spiritua l cause of illness, influencing future events, etc.). Many ritual specialists belong to founding fam ilies or are members of the Council of Elders. The following is a list of the most important ritual leaders: Clan leaders (sometimes referred to as m\u00f4 - priest - or by name alone) are often responsible for contacting the local territorial spirit since the fo under of the village sometimes became the spirit of that territory or has a special relationship to that spirit. Among the Vietic, women and men can be clan leaders and carry out spirit rituals. Priests (m\u00f4 baci - mostly men) perform many rituals, includ ing propitiating various spirits, calling the khwan or life essence during illnesses and perfor ming offerings for family or house spirits Mediums (m\u00f4 phi or m\u00f4 song ) are men or women who are possessed or can contact spirits in trances. These spirits are often souls of persons wandering the earth after death by accidents or during childbirth. They cause illnesses and need to be chased out of the person or village. Monks are not present in Nakai v illages at present but some priests have spent time in monasteries and monks are often called to villa ges to perform cremation rituals or Buddhist ceremonies. 14.6.3 Leadership and Ethnicity 14.6.3.1 Village Leadership and Ethnicity Table 14-1 presents the background of the village leadership, includin g ethnicity and so urces of income. In general, there is a close corresp ondence between the ethnic compositio n of villages and the ethnicity of village leadership. For example, in the Brou ethnic v illages in the southeastern part of the Plateau, there are Brou (sub-groups like the Makong or Tri) occupy ing all positions, as is the case in Ka-Oy, Khone Khen, Don, Bouma and Phonsavang. In the Tai Bo village s in the central part of the Plateau, the Tai Bo dominate in terms of village leadership. This is th e case for Nakai Tai, Naka i Neua, Sop Phene and Sop On. What is interesting to note is that in mixed villages, the leader ship positions often reveal the ethnic composition, indicating that there are ample opportunities for all ethnic groups to be presented and occupy formal positions with the village leadership organisation. Villages such as Sop Ma (mixed Bo and Makong/Brou), Talang (mixed Tai and Bo ethnic groups), Nongbouakham (mixed Lao, Tai and Makong/Brou), Sop Hia (Tai and Vietic groups), Nong Boua (Bo and Brou) and Phonphanpek (Brou, Kaleung and Vietic/Salang). One should note, however, that the Lao and Tai groups dominate leadership in the District capital and have a proportionally high representation in leadership on the Plateau, with positions in Nakai Neua, Nakai Tai, Talang, Nongbouakham, Nam Nian, Sop Hia, Sop On and Nongboua. In most of these villages they are a small minority but they often ha ve higher levels of education and other valuable experience. Only Lao or other Lao Loum individuals have secondary income in the form of trade, which includes running shops and sta lls or acting as middlemen. It should also be noted that the Vietic groups appear to be under-represented. The Vietic comprise more than half of the population but are not represented in the top three positions. The Vietic are not represented in Nakai Tai or in Talang where there al so a number of households. There are Vietic leaders of the Niaw Hom in Nam Nian (A Liha man, belonging to a small Vietic group from Khamkeut District) Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 13and in Phonphanpek (Salang ethnic group originally from the NBCA). It is not surprising that the Vietic should have positions that relate to rituals and cultur al practices rather than political positions since the Vietic have in general less access to socio-economic and political positions of power.

Farming NTFP gathering 14.6.3.2 Organizational Strengthens and Weaknesses Table 14-2 presents an overview of Nakai Villages in terms of potential resettlement challenges, taking into consideration the present socio-economic and leadership status. The organizational strengthens and weakness for the different villages and ethnic groups on the Nakai Plateau should be understood in terms of the ability to mobilize social capital. Social ca pital can be measured in terms of the process of mobilizing members of a given community to undertake collective action for the benefit of the community as a whole. Social capital is thus a prerequisite for any development initiative. In reviewing the leadership situation and other fact ors outlined in Table 14-2, one ca n divide the villages on the Plateau into three general characteristics: Weak Organisations : Sop Phene, Sop Hia (Vietic groups that are under-represented), Phonsavang, Nongboua, Ka-Oy and Sop Ma (and ha mlets of Hat Khamphane and Keng Nyao). These village leaders have relatively little formal education. In addition, or partly because of this, there is a relatively high reliance on natural resources such as NTFPs and lim ited experience with market economics. These villages are small but represent a range of ethnic grou ps - Bo, Brou and Vietic. There are few or no Lao Loum residing in these villages and none have roads or functioning services. Strong Organisations: Villages with more robust organi sations have leaders with better education and often involved in trade and other activities as we ll. These villages can be characterised as having Chapter 14: Local Participation on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 17functioning services and relatively good infrastructu re, mostly roadside village s. Economically, they are better off, have more diversifie d sources of income and skills. Villa ges in this category include the professional inhabitants (mostly Lao Loum) of Nakai Town or Oudomsouk, Nakai Neua, Nakai Tai and Talang. In general, there are some Lao or Tai ethnic groups in these villages, often over-represented in leadership positions. The remaining villages can be classified as having or ganisations that are neither weak nor strong with only a few leaders have education beyond primary school. The ability to mobilize communities for collective action depends on the personality of the leaders and the resource base as well as the ethnic composition of the different villages. 14.6.4 Institutional Arrangements for Consultations 14.6.4.1 Village Facilitators A number of challenges arise from the analysis of leadership, ethn icity and present circumstances of villages on the Plateau in relation to the consultations process. A mechanism is n ecessary to ensure that all groups partake in the consultation process. Since the performance of leadership varies and the relationship between the different formal and informal structures is complex, an institutional arrangement must include a balanced organisation that represents the diverse interests of communities. This organisation requires training and support in order for the consultation process to continue onto implementation and monitoring phases of the Project. One conclusion of the earlier consultation experiences was the need for a representative body at the village level that would work with district govern ment organisations and lin e agencies, RMU/DRWGs and various experts and advisors at the local level. This would be in addition to the Village Resettlement Committee (VRC) that is composed of formal leadership positions and v illagers with skills in agricultural and economics. It was decided by project planners that the composition of this group should reflect the various interest groups at the local le vel and thus aim to ensure that all stakeholders would be represented. One important task of the First Round of the 2004 C onsultations was to obtain agreement at each village for the selection of this body of 10 persons to act as Village Facilitators for each affected village. The general composition consists of the following elements and balances: Village Leaders and traditional leaders (f ormal and informal leadership balance) Male and female memb ers (gender balance) Elderly, middle-aged (able-bodied ad ults) and youth members (age balance) Members of all ethnic groups (ethnic/language balance) Members with good communication sk ills and illiterates (education balance) Groups of village facilitators were selected and then immediately trained to perform their first task, that is consultations about the NT2 project following one-day of training, and under the supervision of Consultation Experts in both Nakai Plateau and downst ream villages. The role of these facilitators will be to conduct consultations in the future and to act as an intermediary between formal organisations, including the VRC and RMU and affect ed villagers and their concerns.

The following measures will be carried out: Training of RMU and Nakai DRWG in ethnic awareness as part of the ongoing consultation process - need to 'mainstream' ethnic issues Continued support for Village Facilitators and stre ngthening their role in the consultation process - need to have meetings and workshops to encourage and monitoring their involvement Supervision of the consultations process by International Community Development and Ethnic Manager and Lao Assistants on NTPC staff Independent monitoring unit and the POE need to pay special attention to the performance of local GoL organisations in relation to ethnic issues ********** * * * ********** Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 iCHAPTER 15 MITIGATION AND ETHNIC MINORITY ISSUES Table of Content 15 MITIGATION MEASURES ......................................................................................1 15.1 RIGHTS TO LAND AND RESOURCES ..............................................................................1 15.2 IMPACTS ON LIVELIHOODS AND APPROACH ................................................................2 15.3 SITE IDENTIFICATION ..................................................................................................2 15.3.1 Suitable Locations on the Nakai Plateau........................................................................................ ................ 2 15.3.2 Village Bo undaries............................................................................................................. ion Sp litting............................................................................................ ..................... 5 15.3.4 Mechanisms for Reaching Consen sus and Conflict Resolution.................................................................. 6 15.4 HOST VILLAGE .............................................................................................................8 15.5 HOUSE DESIGNS ..........................................................................................................9 15.6 LIVELIHOOD OPTIONS ............................................................................................... 12 15.6.1 Livelihood Re quirements Assessment of Risks............................................................................................................ ............................ 13 15.6.4 Livelihood Development in Relation to Ethni city................................................................................ ...... 13 15.7 PLANNED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS .............................................................. 19 15.7.1 Road Construction and Upgrading ................................................................................................ ...............

This chapter deals with livelihood development systems, site location and identification, infrastructure improvements, health and education improvements, gender-specific mitigation measures and measures to guard cultural heritage and emphasis es social and cultural issues. Technical details are provided in the SDP. 15.1 RIGHTS TO LAND AND RESOURCES Chapter 3 in Volume 1 of the SDP outlines in de tail the legal and policy framework. Some important aspects should be noted in relation to the resettlement of ethnic minorities on the Plateau since rights to land and resources is a key issues to the long-term su stainability of the plan and the long-term security of the affected persons. A sense of ownership is essential if the livelihood development options and relocation process is to be carried out successfully. The NT2 Resettlement Policy \"provides for the application of special measures as required towards ethnic minorities and vulnerable persons to assist them to take care of their needs and foster self- reliance\" (Article 1). Entitlements and eligibility are outlined in the Resettlement Regulations and allow for the natural increase in family sizes and compensation option s. The Concession Agreement Decree No. 37/PM of 12 April 2002 approves the allocation of the Resettlement and Forest Area to the affected people on the Nakai Plateau. Land title docume nt have been issued to resettlers in the Pilot Village of Nong Boua and will be issu ed to all resettlers on the Plateau up on relocation as well as resettlers in the Bolikhamxai village site. These documents co ver the resettlement household plots and 0.5 ha of farming land in the vicinity of the household plots. Decree No. 193/PM of 29 December 2000 establishing the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA Corridor Areas, the reservoir area, and the Resettlement and Forest Area for the affected people. Regulations for the establishment and operations of the Nakai Plateau Village Forestry Association (NPVFA) have been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and authorized by the Governor of Khammouane Province. This establishes the NPVFA as a legal entity and will have sole rights to harvest and sell timber and NTFPs from the allocated forest, provided this is done in a sustainable manner. Sustainable forest management is the main obligation of NPVFA, whic h will be undertaken by carrying out planning, forest management, protection, and conservation activities. In order to legally conduct a forestry business according to MAF one requires a li cense for logging, sawmilling and wood processing and furniture factories. NPVFA has applied for all three licenses but has so far only obtained one for wood processing and furniture factor ies. Thus the resettlers, in the form of the NPVFA, have the right only to the resources of the forest as long as they are properly managed but not to the land itself. The GoL is in the process of developing a legal instrument 1 aimed at strengthening the previous PM Decree's 193 and 37 in order to ensure that; (a) the forest resources in the Resettlement Area are for the exclusive use and benefit of the plateau resettlers only; (b) the allocation and use land in the Resettlement Area is undertaken within framework that resettlers have the primary right to land use, both currently and in the future; (c) land titles will be issued for all housing and perman ent agricultural land within one year of actually relocating, building new houses or opening and planting the first crop on the agriculture land. However, these titles will be issued with a caveat proh ibiting the sale of such land within the 8 to 9 year resettlement period, unless otherwise adjudicated by the Grievance Committee; (d) the fisheries resource in the Naka i Reservoir is for the exclusive us e of Plateau resettlers (and those currently fishing in the proposed inundation zone) unti l such time as it is proven that such fisheries resources are in excess of the requirement of the Nakai fishers or their descendents; and 1 as above, this legal instrument is still under review by the IFIs Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2(e) the trading in the reservoir fisheries resources is to be conducted only by the authorized reservoir fishers (the plateau resettl ers, reservoir area fishers, and their descendents). 15.2 IMPACTS ON LIVELIHOODS AND APPROACH Inundation of up to 40% of the Naka i Plateau will result in the loss of a significant portion of the land currently used by the villages for agriculture, liv estock grazing, gathering of NTFPs and hunting. However, the reservoir is likely to increase fish yi eld and will provide a source of water for irrigated farming. The drawdown zone offers a potential for seasonal agricult ure, grazing and aquaculture. Currently, agricultural productivity is constrained by inadequate water supply, seasonal flooding, poor soil fertility, and the lack of capital an d technological ability. The inhabita nts of the villages affected by the reservoir currently live much below the national poverty line and they are aware of their dwindling resource base. Rice cultivation is generally poor and al l villages have recurring food deficits. Of the 450 km2 to be inundated by the reservoir, it is estimated that only 46 km2 has actually been cultivated; the rest being largely under degraded secondary forest cover. The CARE (1996) socio-economic survey found that there were 78 ha of wetland paddy and 486 ha of upla nd rice within the reserv oir area but considerable rice deficits for over 8 months in the year on average. The affected people have not traditionally depended on a single source of income for their livelihoods, having subsisted on shifting cultivation, livestock, fish ing, hunting, gathering of forest products and to a lesser extent on paid employment. Public consultations conducted with the affected people have indicated that they do not wish to move too fa r away from their present villages. During the second round of PCPP in 1998, the main concern expressed was food security, but this did not mean, nor has it ever meant, self-sufficiency in rice. The communities are accustomed to exchanging forest products and buffalo to make up deficiencies in rice production. Hence, promise of gardens, fruit trees and livestock in their new lives helped to create some impression of food s ecurity which was familiar, building on their existing practices. In communities where there was rice production, primarily the Brou villages to the south-east and Ban Nakai Tai and Ban Nakai Neua (along the main road), there was also considerable interest in paddy. As regards forestry, their only experience is the plantation owned by BPKP near Ban Oudomsouk where some of the nearby villagers work. Even though th e BPKP plantation has not been completely successful in achieving expected targets, many showed interest in the prospect of working on communal plantations or working for companies since this held the promise of a stable cash income. In addition, many participants were relieved that they could stay on the plateau and stated that they were willing to try anything in order to improve their lot. Villagers are aware that the GOL prefers that they st op practicing swidden agriculture and many felt that they would be moved to the lowlands far from the fo rests, their traditional source of income. However they are also aware that their new lif estyle will have a number of unfamiliar aspects which, while they are willing to try, they know will require training. As ou tlined later, there will be tr aining and feedback from monitoring, and this is a key component of the overall plan. 15.3 SITE IDENTIFICATION 15.3.1 Suitable Locations on the Nakai Plateau The first step in developing new livelihood options for the Nakai resettlers was to identify suitable land on the Plateau in accordance with their wishes to remain there (see Chapter 19). Land should be suitable for agricultural development, easily accessible, with available water supply year round and located near the reservoir. Twenty-five sites were chosen on the western edge of the Nakai Plateau in Zone 3 within the current Plateau village boundaries, except for the two aff ected villages in Bolikhamxay Province, Ban Sop Hia and Ban Nam Nian, which may still opt for relocation in the same province, which is north of the dam site. The capacity of the areas on Nakai Plateau to prov ide the necessary resources for the livelihood of resettlers was assessed in detail in the 1996/97 dry season. The total area of the land available as the Plateau Resettlement Area is almost 22,000 ha. Previous consultations with villagers resulted in strong Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3indications of their preference to be near the futu re reservoir and to new roads. Table 15-1 summarizes the results of consultations carried out as part of the PCPP in 1997. Table 15-1: Resettlement Preferences of Villages on the Nakai Plateau, 1997 Village Within vicinit y Water source Road access Forest access Grazing areas Paddy Orchards Vegetable gardens Market Well water Electricity Toilets School Dispensary Temple Village hall Rice mill Ban Sop Hia Ban Nam Nian Ban Thalang Ban Nakai Tai Ban Nakai Neua Phene Sop Ma* Ban Sailom** Ban Boua Ma Ban Phonsavang Ban Sop On*** Ban Done Ban Khone Khen * Ban Sop Ma includes three hamlets: Ban Sop Ma, Ban Hat Khamphane and Ban Keng Gnao ** Ban Sailom includes three hamlets: Ban Nong Boua Kham, Ban Sa ilom and Ban Pamanton *** Ban Sop On includes the th ree households of Ban Nikhom 3 The results of the PCPP map-making exercises of \"d ream maps\" reveal that villagers would prefer the following aspects for their new villages: Orientation of the village along roads with each ho use having access to the road. This seems to have replaced the structuring aspect of the river in traditional villages. Th e road is seen as representing progress and a link with the outside world, that is markets and possible wage labour. Improvements such as electricity, access to running water and toilets that are privately owned and not communally shared. Ea ch household preferred their own garden area. Non-residential buildings such as the school, di spensary, pump-house, v illage hall and religious structures to be located outside the grouping of houses as they usua lly are in traditional villages. Surrounding the village was paddy or fields for growing crops such as corn, sugar cane or larger plots for vegetables. On a few maps villagers lo cated forests and grazing areas further a field. When the ideas for the new village were presented to the villagers in the second round of PCPP in 1998, the vast majority welcomed the potential lifestyle im provements given the poor economic situation on the Plateau. 15.3.2 Village Boundaries Earlier reviews of village boundaries indicated that it would be poss ible to relocate most households within their current village boundaries. Therefore, effo rts have been made to sel ect sites within existing traditional territories because such cultural continuity and familiarity potentially reduces possible disruption or psychological stress created by the resettlement process. Two classifications exist with regard to the administrati ve and political status of the existing villages on the Plateau. Administrative villages are those with over 20 households or 100 families. These are formally recognized as villages with defined boundaries and associated responsibilitie s and obligations to the Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 4respective district in which they occu r. The second type of classification is the \"cluster village\", generally not recognized at the District level in the planning and administrative context. These \"cluster villages\" tend to be small and scattered throughout the village boundary of the major administratively recognized village in which they occur. Often these cluster vi llages form when villagers have moved into the boundary area from elsewhere and have requested permission of the resident administratively-recognized village chief to establish their households. These dist inctions are recognized and acknowledged in local terminology. For the purposes of ease of descriptio n, these administrative and non-administrative village types are combined.

Non-memb ers of the village should first seek permission from village leaders before they can practice swidden cultivation or harv est forest products. Furthermore, these territories have a cosmological dimension. Ma ny villages have guardian spirits ( phi muang ) whose territory corresponds to traditional boundaries for larger, more established villages . Other villages are included in these boundaries. 15.3.3 Village Consolidation and Splitting Considerable efforts have been made to retain existing village structur es and respect the requests of site locations, but one has also to consider village size and the practical arrangemen ts of providing suitable infrastructure and services. In terms of sustainability of institutions and organisations, one requires a minimum number of people. A number of consolidati ons may occur depending on final consultations and detailed planning. It should be emph asised that the practical aspects will be carefully balanced with social and cultural aspects for the optimal resettlement solution. The following consolidations are likely to occur: The hamlets of Nongboua, Sailom and Pamonton : these three hamlets are an unstable group that has changed composition and location se veral times over the past 10 years. Originally, a number of families that left the large village of Bouma, a mixed Bo and Brou village, to establish a new village called Sailom. This later split into three differe nt hamlets in the 1990s. In 2001, Pamonton ceased to exist as its inhabitants joined the other two hamlets of Sailom and Nongboua. The Pilot Vi llage has involved the relocation of the remaining two hamlets into one new village, called Nongboua Mai ( mai meaning new). No problems regarding ethnicity have occurred and this is mostly likely because both Bo and Brou families have been living together for some time and ar e originally from the same village of Bouama - the language of the village is Lao and the culture is a shared 'Nakai' culture of the Plateau. Villagers themselves agreed to this arrangement during de tailed consultations. The Pilot Village is organised spatially according to the four main clans or original founding families, three Bo and one Brou. Relocation is within traditional territory, within the spir it boundaries of Bouma, the village of origin. The villages of Keng Ngao , Hat Khamphene and Sop Ma are all small villages located on the left bank of the Nam Theun above the bridge at Thalang. They form one administrative unit with a single leadership structure. The first village is a predominantly Brou village while the latter two have majority Bo populations. All three settlements were originally offshoots from Ban Bouma but a number of Brou households joined these settlements from Ban Teng and Ban Thaphaiban in the NT2 Watershed area. Two possible sites are proposed for all three settlements since none are more than 30 households. No problems regarding ethnicity are envi saged since both Bo and Brou fam ilies have been living together for some time and are already functioning administratively as one village. Relocation is likely to be outside traditional boundaries but within familiar territory with the same neighbouring villages. The village of Ka-Oy to the north of the proposed reservoir and on the Nam Theun is a traditional Brou village. There are close ties with the neighbouring v illages on the Nakai Plateau, intermarriage and trade agreements, especially with Ban Done and Ban Sop On. There has also been a history of migration up and down the Nam Theun in search of su itable sites for swidden and to avoi d flooding and pests. Villagers in Ka-Oy look upon the other Brou and Bo villages as relatives ( phii nong ) and should not have a problem integrating with regards to ethnicity. However, it is still uncertain whether Ka -Oy residents will opt for resettlement or stay in familiar te rritory and be included in the sust ainable livelihood development of the NT2 Watershed. Special efforts will be made to ensure that a consensus is reached in an equitable manner. The village of Phonesavang is a Brou village that has been formed by households from Sop On to the southeast and by new arrivals from the NT 2 Waters hed Area. Many of these villages are related but a number of families have connections to villages to the north in the Watershed. The latter are relative new arrivals. The proposed integration into the new site for Sop On should not create problems for ethnicity as long as traditional clans and kinship organisation are respected in layout. There are also two potential splitting of e xisting villages. Both Sop Hia and Nam Nian villages in the northeastern part of the Plateau. The Tai populations in the v illages of Sop Hia and Nam Nian in Bolikhamxai Province are special case since all are recen t arrivals (within the last 5 to 15 years) from Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 6Khamkeut District and surrounding areas in Bolikhamx ai Province. These Tai villa gers are located beside existing Vietic groups and have adapted to swidden farming and gathering of NTFPs. This was an economic migration caused in part by a shortage of land in their original Tai village sites and in part by the opportunity to exploit an area relatively rich in natural resources and with a low population. The relocation of the Tai-speaki ng groups to a site in Bolikhamxai will return them to familiar territory but with support for developing a sustainable livelihood system. The different Tai groups speak different dialects (Tai Daeng, Tai Moey, Tai Men, Tai Khao , etc.) and are divided into clans but there is considerable intermarriage and shared values. The co mmunities in the proposed resettlement sites (Ban Nam Pan area) are also the same Tai groups, and have also fairly recently moved to that area. The Vietic groups in Sop Hia (Aho e and Phong) along with the few Vietic households in Nam Nian will establish their own village on the plateau, on the shores of the reservoir, in the vicinity of Thalang with which they are likely to share educati onal and health facilities. It is important that th e Vietic groups establish their own village site to ensure that they are not dominated by other groups as has been the case in Sop Hia where Tai in-migration has led to a lack of representation of Vietic v illagers in leadership and the overexploitation of available natural resources in the area by new in-migrants. 15.3.4 Mechanisms for Reaching Consensus and Conflict Resolution As is explained in the above sections, efforts have been made to relocate villages within traditional territories and taking into account ethnic composition. Most of the suggested consolidations and splitting of villages above have been discu ssed with villagers and consultations are underway to ensure that any problems are dealt with in an open manner. The process of reaching consensus and resolving potential conflicts about village boundaries are similar to how the consultation process for all villages will proceed. Consensus about any possible consolid ation and splitting or alteration in village boundaries will require the following steps: Based on technical and practical considerations for site requirements and population, potential consolidation of villages will be identified Examination of baseline data and analysis of the consultation concerns and proposals will identify whether there is an issue of internal cohesion or ethnic tension (separation of ethnic groups) in the community or series of hamlets that make up a community Consultations (August 2004) have intr oduced the idea of co nsolidation and splitting of village to all location on the Plateau - villagers will then have time to consider options and to discussion these options among themselves informally Consultations (Planned for November-Decem ber 2004) will be undertaken to determine resettlement sites for new village s so that detailed site planning and preparation may commence. At this point a consensus needs to be reached. If there are some households not agreeing on a particular relocation site, other site options may be considered since it all cases of conso lidation and splitting there are options. A formal agreement then needs to be drafted and signed with village leaders on behalf of the village confirming site choice There are a number of conflict resolution mechanisms at the local level that could be drawn on to solve any potential problems regarding the realignment of trad itional or spirit territories or the establishment of one village in the territory of another village. Table 15-3 outlines potential changes in traditional territories. From the point of view of village administration unit s, a consultation process will be initiated that will include local authorities (District and previous village leaders), NTPC technical staff and the affected persons in the village. The alignment of village boun daries will depend on a number of key factors: Location and proximity of villa ges in the resettlement areas Land use and resource use requirements, especially community forestry needs Size of resettlement sites (at least 50 households ar e required for full village administrative status) Ethnicity and spirit territories Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7 Table 15-3: Realignment of Traditional/Spirit Territory Boundaries Ritual Centre (Main Village) Villages Changes in Boundaries Sop Hia - Vietic spirit residing in rapids near dam site Sop Hia (Vietic) Movement out of spir it area (under control of female Vietic Medium at Sop Hia) in to Thalang spirit territory Sop Hia (Tai groups) Movement out of Viet ic spirit territory into spirit territory of Nam Pan (Tai) Thalang (Tai, Brou and Lao groups) Reduction of spirit territ ory size (realignment of boundaries) Thalang - Tai Bo spirit residing in rapids near village Nam Nian (Vietic) Movement within existing territory of Thalang Nam Nian (Tai groups) Movement out of Thalang spirit territory into spirit territory of Nam Pan (Tai) Nakai Tai Reduction of spirit territ ory size and incorporation of part of Nakai Neua territory (realignment of boundaries) Nakai Tai - Tai Bo spirit residing in nearby mountain Nong Boua Kham Movement within existing territory Nakai Neua Reduction of spirit territory size (realignment of boundaries) Nakai Neua - Tai Bo spirit (former village leader) Sop Phene Movement within existing territory Sop On Reduction of spirit te rritory size (realignment of boundaries) Sop Ma Movement within existing territory (option of move into Nakai Tai territory) Hat Khamphane Movement within existi ng territory (option of move into Nakai Tai territory) Keng Gnao Movement with in existing territory Boua Ma Movement with in existing territory Sailom (Pilot) Movement within existing territory Sop On - Tai Bo spirit and former medium of village (refers to old salt licks) Phonsavang Movement within existing territory Ka-Oy - Brou spirit of former village leader Ka-Oy Movement out of spirit ar ea neighbouring spirit territory of either Sop On, Done or Khone Khene Done - Brou spirit of former village leader Done Reduction of spirit te rritory size (realignment of boundaries) Khone Khene- Brou spirit of former village leader Khone Khene Reduction of spirit territory size (realignment of boundaries) The location, resources and cultural requirements have already been a ddressed in terms of the ongoing detailed site locations (Chapter 19). The actual number of villages and composition is not yet fully fixed since villagers at a number of sites still have to ch oose as to where they wo uld like to relocate. The eventual number of village administrative units is yet to be determined. A consultation process will be initiated after a preliminary decision has been made by villagers as to their choice of site (November-December 2004). There will be a series of meetings that include GoL authorities at the village level and the resettlers led by the RMU and with the advice of NTPC technical staff. Discussions will be aimed at reaching agreements on: Village locations and new boundaries Village composition in te rms of village units ( nouay ) Village leadership structur es (headmen, leaders of nouay and other local representatives) Village layout according to ethnic groups and clans Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 8It is difficult to predict outcomes of spirit terr itory realignment and how people will adjust to new territories since much depends on the ritual specialis ts and events accompanying the movement, especially accidents or natural phenomena that could influence interpretations of spirit preferences. Ritual specialists within a village or mediums through rituals and cer emonies may determine how cosmological changes will be handled - ritual obligations prior to a move or after resettlement. In the case of potential conflict or realignment of territories, it will be the responsibility of the elders in each community ( thao khun ) to meet and decide on an outcome and the necessary ritual s or ceremonies. The history of the Nakai Plateau indicates that there are mechanisms and precedents fo r solving such issues, given the fact that many villages have relocated in the r ecent past for various reasons. 15.4 HOST VILLAGE Consultations with the villages of Sop Hia and Nam Ni an have resulted in the decision by the affected communities to split the villages along ethnic lines, between the indigenous Vietic groups (mostly Ahoe) and the recently arrived Tai groups (over the past 20 years). A number of options and possible locations for new village sites were discussed with the Tai groups, including resettlement on the Nakai Plateau along with the other villages. However, a consensus has emerged for relocation to Khamkeut District in Bolikhamxai Province, whence all households originated. The planning process can be summarised as follows: Consultations at Sop Hia and Nam Nian (1996-2002) - information dissemination and feedback as to various resettlement options but issue not fully resolved regarding ethnic composition of villages Location of potential resettlement sites in Khamkeut District identified by GoL as a possible site in 2002 Technical appraisal of two sites and preliminary plans and budget for best choice (Nam Pan site) by irrigation and livelihood development sp ecialist in June 2003 (see Appendix M) Preliminary survey of socio-economic and cultural characteristics (Back to Office Report, NTEC, October 2003). Affected villagers site in early 2004 and meetings between leaders and village rs from host village of Ban Nam Pan and resettlers from Sop Hia and Nam Nian Detailed consultation on option in June 2004 with conf irmation of site selection with Tai villagers from the Nakai Plateau Late 2004 follow-up consultations with the goal of achieve village consensu s (in this case, ethnic group consensus) about relocation and livelihood options for Tai groups in Sop Hia and Nam Nian There will be a full appraisa l of impacts on the host village carr ied out in late 2005 as part of the detailed technical planning - this will includ e an assessment of land usage in the proposed resettlement area, including grazing, NTFP collection, water sources and rotational swidden fields. It is important that individual families in Nam Pa n not be directly affect ed by the loss of land, resource assess or income. Formal consensus is required by the leadership and villagers of Nam Pan before resettlement is to commence. This will include agreement on the miti gation measures, primarily the new road and irrigation system for both the new resettlement village and Nam Pan Mechanisms for joint management of the irrigation system need to be finalised during the implementation process Conflict resolution measures and grie vance procedures between resettlers and host villagers are similar to those which are outlined for the project as a whole in Chapter 8. Since both groups are from the same ethnic groups or closely related groups of Tai (Tai Men, Tai Moey and Tai Phouak), they shared the same culture, language and value systems. Disputes betw een neighbouring villages are solved by meetings between the leaders of the villages, both village headmen and their a ssistants, as well as other formal leaders, and traditional leaders. If i ssues of land and resource use cannot be resolved at this level, disputes are usually referred to the District, in this case it will be to the District Resettlement Working Group in Khamkeut. Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 915.5 HOUSE DESIGNS Initial house designs have been developed through consultations with the villagers who are to be resettled, incorporating aspects of traditional house designs among the different ethnic groups on the Nakai Plateau. All houses have a number of similar aspects. The home ( heun) has a private sphere consisting of sleeping quarters, a public sphere for receiving guests and en tertaining (veranda) and a production sphere (kitchen for cooking food, washing and growing spices and vegetables). The proposed house design comprises all these elements: Figure 15-1 shows the first two designs developed after the first round of PCPP. Two basic designs were illustrated showing the two main house styles in the ar ea. The first drawing on the left represents the most common type of house on the Plateau and is similar to the style most often used by Bo and Brou ethnic groups. The second drawing to the right illustrate s a house style common among some of the Vietic groups on the Plateau, in particul ar the Ahoe and Phong of Sop Hia v illage. The main difference is that the veranda is closed in some trad itional Vietic houses. The aim at this stage of the consultations was to discuss modifications and concerns with housing. Th e illustrations provoked c onsiderable comments and suggestions, including an overwhelming desire for the first design with the open veranda, including among the Ahoe and Phong populations of Sop Hia where such houses were observed (see Section 14.3 above for comments). Figure 15-2 illustrates the modified house designs as a result of further feedback during the second round of PCPP in April and May 1998. Figure 15-2 shows house designs for single families (up to 6 inhabitants) and extended families (over 7 inhabitants). House designs may be further modified at the time of construction if the household makes reasonable request for modification according to the desire of the different ethnic groups or individual house owners. Villagers will be provided with a new house and with transportation to move ma terials from their former houses to be reassembled on the new site if so desired. These new structures conform to traditional house designs by incorporating the following elements: a veranda, a kitchen area, two doors in accordance with kinship taboos, a construction on poles with two ladders (to the kitchen and to the veranda) with an odd number of rungs, and doors which open in a direction other than the west. No house will be smaller than the original dwelling, and the actual size will depend on the number of inhabitants. Labor resources and time permitting, villagers th emselves will construct th eir own houses under the supervision of trained carpenters. When necessary, additional labor resources will be brought in. Having villagers construct their own home has important soci al and psychological advantages since by investing time and energy in establishing themselves on their new plots, they will more easily acquire a sense of belonging to the new sites. Men are traditionally resp onsible for constructing houses in villages and form a pool of labor whenever new buildings are put up. A similar pool of labor would ensure that all houses are built and that disadvantaged households , that is households with a labor shortage, single mothers, ill or disabled members or few kinship ties, will not be negatively affected by the relocation. The relocation of houses at the Pilo t Village illustrates that the constr uction of the houses is proceeding well. This involves a common frame bu t the details such as arrangement of interior space, decorations and carvings and other features have been carried through consultations with the owners. The result is that the first three houses constructed at Nongboua Mai are different in appearance. This shows that the different ethnic characteristics and details in house construc tion can be reproduced using a culturally sensitive approach and consultations with owners.

However, it must be appreciated that the amount of agricultural land availa ble in the Nakai Plateau is very small. Provincial Authorities have classified 90% of the area as forestland in 1993. The resettlement planning studies identified an area of about 22,000 ha between the western boundary of the proposed reservoir and the edge of the escarpment to identify areas suitable fo r the establishment of resettlement villages with house plots. The following factors were considered as minimum requirements for locations: above El 539.0 minimum area of 4 ha (for 8 families) access to water supply (potable & irrigation) access to drawdown zone access to roads or other transportation infrastructure access to markets minimizing distance to new location consideration of villages' spiritual boundaries adequate returns from irrigated land potential for growing rice in selected locations social, cultural and ethnic factors taken into account potential for exploitation of NTFPs potential for community forests 15.6.2 Livelihood Features A full account of the planning, selection and options for livelihood development are provided in Chapters 21 to 25). Here only an outline of the salient features is provided. The main characteristics of the livelihood development are the following: Maximizing opportunities for irrigate d cropping with priority initially for rice production due to the fact that rice is the most impor tant crop and emphasized by v illagers during consultations Intensive vegetable, food, fodder and fruit production on upland plots, replicating the existing practices of home plot gardens in the villages Intensified livestock production that aims at in troducing fodder production, improved health and extension services Commercial forestry on a community basis, incl uding a forestry development plan and forestry dividend fund Sustainable exploitation of reservoir fisheries with restricted access for resettlers and ethnic groups in the NBCA Off-farm employment will be limited but there will be opportunities during the construction period and some employment after construction for skilled workers and in the service sector. The interim income target for resettlement households, including income in cash and in kind, for year 5 of the resettlement implementation period is the then current Lao Kip rural poverty line amount per person as calculated by the National Statistics Centre, multip lied by the number of persons in the household (this being equivalent to US$ 800 per average household). The full development village income target is the Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 13national average level for the coun try (this being equivalent to US$ 1,200 per average household) as calculated by the National Static Centre, multiplied by the number of persons in the household. This final development target ensures is well above the poverty line. Refer to Chapter 25 for further information regarding income targets. The strength of the livelihood developm ent plan is its flexibility since it consists of a basic package for all households and supplementary options for income depending on specific sites, labour requirements and interests of the households and communities. Table 15-4 indicates the options. Table 15-4: Resettlement Livelihood Options Basic Package per Household Supplementary Enterprise Options Farm/House plot: 0.5 ha (Income $ 260) Fisheries Rice: 0.15 ha (optional) (Income $ 130) Forestry Forestry Dividend (Incom e $ 100 +) Buffalo Raising: Total Income $ 590/HH Off-Farm Employment An analysis of the production models and economic forecasts is provided in Chapter 25 (Livelihood Integration and Income Scenarios). 15.6.3 Assessment of Risks The income estimates of the livelihood package an d options are based on an average household size participating in all of the proposed enterprises. It is necessary to review the potential impact of the recommended general livelihood model on the incomes of individual households that may have different human resource, skill endowments or preferences among the different ethnic groups. Based on the socio- economic surveys and the consultation carried out on the Nakai Plateau, a range of possible scenarios have been examined in Chapter 25 of the SDP. Households having no male working members and with old or infirm adults will be specifically targeted with income supplements from the forestry resource dividend fund to account for lack of manpower. Given the interest in household food security, it is highly unlikely that resettlers will reject the offer of wetland rice, but those opting to do so will not be significantly affected as long as they are able to earn cash income from the other enterprises. Over 60 percent of the affected villages already own more than 5 buffaloes but some households have no buffaloes and these household should be able to compensate the loss of about 9 percent of their income, from fisheries, off-farm employment, intensive house plot cultivation and forestry. Experience from the Nam Ngum 1 Reservoir shows that after the construction of the dam, fisheries has become a major sour ce of livelihood for nearly 2000 ho useholds and there is a ready market for fish both in Lao PDR and in Thailand; thus the number of households not taking advantage of this opportunity will be negligible. Commercial forestry is a resource that is being set aside for the community by the GOL as a source of income security for the affected people; it is hoped that this will engender a sense of ownership among the resettlement community, thereby ensuring full participation in this activity. Non-farm employment as a source of income ha s been very conservatively estimated and any household that decides not to engage in this will not be adversely affected. The forestry resource in the Resettlement Area is able to compensate for any shortfall in household income from other sources (crops, livestock and fish eries). The allocation of the forestry resource from which the households derive income should therefore take this into account. 15.6.4 Livelihood Development in Relation to Ethnicity Data from the Care Report (1996) an d RMU socio-economic surveys (1999) indicate that all villages have mixed economic systems. It is difficult to examine the differences solely in terms of ethnic groups due to the fact that most villages are composed of at leas t two or more groups. However, some generalisations can be made from the data available in relation to v illage characteristics and pote ntial sites and challenges (see Table 15-5). Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 14 Some important points and potential challenges for resettlement to consider are listed below. It should be stated, however, that for the most part there are good relationships between all the ethnic groups on the Plateau and there are considerable differences within ethnic groups in terms of livelihoods, skills and experience. It is necessary to ensure that all ethnic groups ar e represented on the District Resettlement Working Group based in Nakai Town (Oudomsouk). At present there are only representatives from the Tai Lao majority groups and very limited representation by minorities. Further recruitment of members of the DRWG for Nakai should favour representatives fr om the Tai Bo, Brou and Vietic ethnic minority communities whenever feasible in or der to represent interests of these groups at this level of project planning and implementation. This is significant for dealing with resettlement of parts of Oudomsouk itself as it is for general issues regarding all Plateau villages. Vietic Groups Of particular concern are the Vietic groups because of their small numbers, the fact that they are spread out in a number of villages and dominated by other more advanced ethnic gr oups, and their lack of experience of more modern technologies and knowle dge of market economics. These ethnic groups are the most reliant on the natural resources of the Nakai Plateau in terms of hunting, fishing and forest foods. They are less efficient that other ethnic groups in harvesting NTFPs, partly because they, at least until recently, have not been motivated to earn large amounts of cash. This, however, is changing as the overfishing in the Nam Theun at Sop Hia illustrates. A number of mitigation measures will be introduced to deal with these challenges: Separation of the dominant Tai groups and the Vietic households in Sop Hia and relocation of the latter to a site south of the reserv oir or to another suitable site in the area - this will allow the Vietic to regain control over decision-making processes Option for Vietic households in Nam Nian to join the Vietic of Sop Hia at the new site Option for Vietic households in Th alang to join this new site if it turns out that there is a willingness to consolidate and if th ere are signs that the Vi etic of Thalang are not deriving the same benefits as the Tai and other ethnic gr oups at the new site for Thalang village Provisions to separate the Vietic groups or at least cluster households together for Nakai Tai and Phonphanpek where there are also sm all numbers of Ahoe and Salang. Livelihood development will emphas ise a continuity of NTFPs, fish ing and collection of forest foods that these groups are highly reliant on. Links to programmes in the NBCA regarding development of NTFPs, medicines and other forest products that could also be cultivated on the Plateau Additional assistance for adapting to and adjusting to new production techniques since many Vietic groups have less experience that the other ethnic minorities on the Plateau - this means separate programmes for technical assistance in relation to irrigation, growing cash crops, improved livestock management, literacy and accounting for forestry management an d capacity building for village leadership Establishing regular visits to demonstration sites for Vietic groups and mutual visits to Vietic resettlement sites and livelihood deve lopment schemes to share experiences Specific monitoring of small Vietic minorities in Thalang, Nakai Tai and Phonphanpek to ensure that Veitic participate in consultations on a par with the other ethnic groups and partake in decision-making Specific monitoring of natural resource usage by Vi etic groups and neighbouring villages to ensure that other ethnic groups are not exploit Vietic resources (previous conflicts over resources between Vietic villagers and other ethni c groups residing in Thalang have occurred in the past) Tai Bo There is considerable variation in the production sy stems of the Tai Bo across the Plateau. They range from reliance on NTFPs to wet rice cultivation. Of particular concern, however, are the smaller Bo villages and hamlets along the Nam Theun in the middle of the Plateau: Sop Ma, Sop Phene, Hat Khamphane and Nong Boua. These villages are likely to require additional assistance and monitoring since they have weak leadership, little experience of technology and market forces, and are highly reliant on the Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 15forests and fishing. The Tai Bo v illages along the road are unlikely to require special assistance for livelihood development. In some cases, measures to assist Vietic groups mentioned above may be used to enhance benefits for these Tai Bo communities. Brou Most Brou households and villages have mixed econ omies and exhibit a certain flexibility in terms of adaptation to new techniques. Of particular concern are reports of very large herds of buffalo and cattle in some Brou and Bo villages. These herds may exceed the carrying capacity of the proposed resettlement sites and measures to reduce herds to a sustainable level in these Bo and Brou villages will prove a challenge for planners. The current pl an is to suggest that most of the herd are capitalised and funds placed in bank accounts. The buffalo raising fami l i e s w o u l d r e t a i n u p t o 1 0 h e a d , a n d o n g a i n i n g experience with (a) the rise and fall of the reservoir, and thus the drawdown zone productivity, and (b) the productivity of fodder programs they would decide whether to reinvest their funds in a larger herd or in another livelihood activity.

Predominantly Brou and highly reliant on forests Special assistance for integration into other Brou villages and adjustment to livelihood systems Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 19 Small Ethnic Groups within Ethnic Minority Villages In many villages there are small grou ps of ethnic minorities, often only a few households in relation to a dominant group, be that Tai Lao or another ethnic minority. In most cases, this is unlikely to be a problem since all of these groups have been coexisting for a long time and intermarriage is common. However, certain measures may have to be taken: Monitoring of the progress of the different ethnic groups in mixed villages in order to identify any large differences in terms of adaptability and income; If there are considerable differences, separate tr aining and programmes should be considered to offset this imbalance in skills and experience; Visits to other resettlement sites of the same ethnic group to share experiences. The pilot village relocation indicated that villages that are mixed ethnically may relocate in a way to separate the different ethnic groups in terms of village layout since this is often based on kinship and clan relationships that do not cross-cut ethnicity in most cases. If this turns out to be the way most mixed villages are relocated, it will be easy to consider separate arrangements (tra ining, capacity building, technical assistance, site visits, etc.) for th e different ethnic groups if so required. 15.7 PLANNED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS There are three main infrastructure investments: im provements of roads, the supply of electricity and water supply (see Chapter 20). 15.7.1 Road Construction and Upgrading The existing road from Ban Oudomsouk to Ban Nam Nian will be submerged under the reservoir. A new road which largely follows the edge of the reservoir fo r much of its route will be built which will provide road access to villages in potential resettlement site s 1-13 between Ban Oudoms ouk and Ban Thalang. In addition, about 30km of village access roads to potent ial resettlement sites to the south-east of Ban Oudomsouk (sites 14-25). All new villages will have ro ad access as part of the resettlement package. 15.7.2 Electricity Supply According to the RAP Budget, a 50 KW generator will be supplied per 50 families during the first phase of resettlement and later to act as a backup generator or for other uses by the community. The permanent installation of electricity to the resettled communities will consist of ca. 80 km of main and distribution lines and electric wiring hooking up individual house holds to the grid. Details of electricity supply will depend on the final section of sites and the locations of houses, both of which will be worked out during consultation with families and community leaders. 15.7.3 Water Supply- Domestic & Irrigation A reliable water supply is necessary for each of the re settlement communities and is directly linked to the improvement of livelihoods and health situations. All resettlement villages will have access to water supplies for domestic and irrigation use. Potential sources of domestic water for domestic use include gully-stop wells and deep wells. The provision for do mestic water will greatly improve the health situation given the high presence in water-borne diseases and parasites reported in the area. 15.8 SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS 15.8.1 Health Sector Impacts The public health aspects invariably apply to the resettled, settled, or workforce groups. In many situations, these groups will not only live side by side but also will interact an d, under certain conditions, live together. The reservoir, both du ring construction and when completed, is not expected to have an adverse impact on public health within the area of its influence. Water-Borne Diseases (Malaria) Water related diseases over which concerns have been raised are malaria, schistosomiasis and opisthorchiasis. These can be controlled provided th e correct measures, such as environmental control, Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 20insecticidal application and personal protection among worker and resident communities are in place and functioning in time. During construction of the Nam Ngum dam more th an 25% of the workforce suffered from malaria at any one time. At that time, DDT (Dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane) household residual spraying was regularly carried out as well as the mosquito proofi ng of all buildings where possible and appropriate. Despite this, malaria remained a problem during c onstruction and there was much concern on what the malaria situation would be after the dam was completed. However, following completion of the dam, and its subsequent filling, the mosquito vector population declined and th e incidence of malaria dropped to levels where only a few cases of malaria are now diagnosed each year. The explanation for the above revolv es around the elimination of sui table breeding places for the two principal vectors Anopheles minimus and A.maculatus as the Nam Ngum reservoir reached its final level. This situation has continued to the present. While such an event may, or may not occur in the present Project, the previous experience with these disease vectors is important and may well indicate trends that will be seen elsewhere. Irrigation channels, when completed, may constitute a source of continued mosquito breeding for A.maculatus and A.minimus . Another potential problem is that A.dirus could increase in numbers following cattle rearing in the area of the reservoir because their flooded hoof-imprints could provide ideal breeding for A.dirus. At present this mosquito has not been recorded in the area and its behavior and survival at the altitude of the reservoir, during the cold se ason, is not known and not considered likely. Opisthorchiasis This disease requires a snail as the intermediate host, but can only be transmitted to humans through eating raw fish or fermented fish. Providing fish dish es are cooked, it is considered not to be a potential problem. Raw fish dishes are popular in some of the resident communities and it is possible that members of the workforce will expose themselves to c onditions where the disease can be transmitted. However, it will be part of the health program's pr eventative efforts to inform all communities of appropriate control methods. Schistosomiasis Schistosomiasis is absent from the project area and is not expected to be a problem with completion of the reservoir or the irrigation channels. Its nearest focus is Khong Island, Khong District in the southern reaches of the Mekong in Champassak Province. Following the finding of small numbers of the vector snail at Mahaxai the possibility of schi stosomiasis in the project area has raised. It is considered highly unlikely that Schistosoma mekongi would be able to establish itself, fr om its nearest base in Khong Island. But in any case the disease at Khong Island has been under considerable control program pressure since 1989 and prevalence in the population of about 10,000 persons is now less than one per cent , the majority of those infected being aged between 5-14 years of ag e. Routine monitoring w ill identify the problem in the unlikely event that it appears. Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) and Other STDs HIV is an important potential health problem which both immigrant workers and the existing communities face and which the Project must be well pr epared for. Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) are present in the population but are more easily identified and are treatable. Transmission of HIV is either by unprotected sexual contact, contact with contaminated blood or exchange of body fluids or through the use of shared hypodermic needles among infected drug addicts. Every effort will be made to publicize these facts to both the workforc e and to the resident communities. Testing construction workers for HIV due to the prevalence of the virus in Southeast Asia is being considered. 15.8.2 Sanitation and Health Program The following components form the basis of the health program: Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 21 Simple pit latrines protected by an S-shaped water trap are recommended for resettled households. The manufacture of S-shaped latrin e slabs is promoted by GOL and their procedures and pit design will be followed. The provision of a domestic water supply to all villages has been previously dealt with, but the avoidance of creating mosquito-breeding sites ne ar to any water pumps will be assured through construction of concrete or cement covered aprons around any pump sites. Malaria control and the control of the dengue fever mosquito will be part of the on-going disease control program as proposed by the GOL and, in Nakai and Gnommalat Districts, the joint control program with the European Union. The local population will potentially be impacted by the health of the workforce if they are in the same area. Worker health is of paramount concern to construction contractors and an important criterion to be met when campsites are selected. Good siting for the camp with the availability of natural drainage will be an important criterion. Details of the health care practices that the construction contractors will be committed to implementing may be found in the EAMP. Anti-malaria measures following accepted practi ce will be instituted at campsites and facilities established for the early diagnosi s and treatment of patients. The distribution of 300 treated mosquito nets in the 1998 round of PCPP work was the first step in improv ing the health of the local communities. Communities, on ce settled, will be better served through the existing health services infrastructure which will be strengthened at the clinic and Village Health Volunteers (VHV) levels through focal training and ensuring adequate supplies of drugs and other inputs from RMU and local NGOs. Establishment of nine clinics, s taff housing for clinics and medical supplies an d equipment (ca. US$ 1,000 per clinic) as well as a training prog ram for health personnel (see Chapter 28). In collaboration with the respective GOL health institute and the Department of Health, Khammouane Province, RMU will assist communities in the implementation of approved healthcare programs in the Resettlement Area. It is beneficial for all concerned that th e villagers overall health status improves and the burden of disease in th e population are reduced so as to facilitate the relocation and participation in learning the new sk ills of the livelihood model. This will include provision of information and education to the workforce on prevention of diseases, including, malaria, opisthorchiasis, diarrhoea and HIV/AIDS. 15.8.3 Indigenous Health Practices The inundation of the Nakai Plateau w ill result in the loss of areas that ar e presently used to gather herbs, roots and other items used in indigenous health remedies. From preliminary investigations one can conclude that there will be no loss of any plant specie s that is endemic to the Plateau alone. All ingredients used in traditional medicine are al so found in areas of the Nakai Plat eau that will not be inundated or in surrounding areas of higher biodiversity, such as the Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA where resettlers will continue to have access. The general trend in the villages is towards adoptin g more and more aspects of modern medicine and reliance on drugs available from Village Health Volunteers, local shops and clinics and treatment at the Nakai hospital or other larger establishments in the region. However, for minor complains and treatment of psychosomatic symptoms, that involve a combination of material and spiritual cures, traditional methods are still widely employed. It should be mentioned that even in urban areas of the country, traditional practices continue to exist, partly because modern scientific medicine tends to cure physically only and lacks a social and spiritual dimension. The following measure will be carried out in relation to indigenous health practices: Detailed study on traditional health practices and id entification of ingredients by the Traditional Medicine Research Centre and International Consultant to be completed by November 2004 Establish links with studies of ethno-botany being undertaken in the NBCA as part of the SEMFOP-1 Identification of rare species or commercially in teresting species that could be considered for a herbarium on the Plateau - possibly as part of an existing demonstration farm Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 22 Recruitment of traditional health specialists ( m\u00f4 yaa, m\u00f4 maun, m\u00f4 pao and m\u00f4 tamyae - priests, spirit doctors, healers and midwives) when feasible as local health workers so that indigenous knowledge may be transferred into the context of a new setting Careful monitoring of harvesting of species used in indigenous medicine and health practices that may change as a result of resettlement (possible rapid shift from traditional to modern medicine) 15.8.4 Education, Extension and Training Education interventions cover three main areas: establishment of school buildings, literacy and extension education and training for livelihood implementation, and recruitment of new teachers. Chapter 28 states that there will be approximately 17 sc hools (72 rooms) establis hed in the Resettlement Area (one per community) with supplies and equipm ent (US$ 500 per room) as well as accommodation for teachers. Given the low rates of literacy on the Plateau, ad ult education and literacy pr ograms will form a key element in community development. The consultation sessions with villages always emphasized the importance of education and literacy. GoL and NGOs working in Lao PDR for many years have experience setting up and running adult literacy progra ms in rural areas. These programs will be up and running before the actual resettlement in order to acquire the maximum benefits. It would also give villagers a positive impression that measures are being taken to ensure a better future for them. Extension education aims to persuade people to make im provements to their livelihood enterprises. It is a gradual process that first creates awareness and intere st, provides opportunities for the target population to try out the new ideas, and finally ensures that the necessary support services are available for them to adopt the concepts. In the new settle ments, farmers will be required to change from an extensive to an intensive type of farming. Beside s, they must learn new skills to practice i rrigation, fodder crop production, forestry management and optimum utilization of reservoir fisheries. They should also be assisted to strengthen their capacity to undertake community development work. NTEC has already established a demonstration farm in Theun Duane and a plant supply nursery at Ban Nakai Neua. Based on the proposed household enterprises, the ex tension education and training program will focus on the following: Forestry management : establishment of committees, awarene ss of rights and income sharing mechanisms, skills' improvements in silviculture and a community forest management plan (cf. FIPC 2001) Fisheries management : improved fishing techniques, restocking, awareness of new techniques, handling and preservation, management and marketing, and the establishment of a fisheries development plan Wetland rice farming : preparation of land, training in wetland rice agricultural techniques and water management and assi stance for storage an d pest management Upland irrigation techniques : improved terracing and land use practices and training in equipment maintenance and irrigation techniques Vegetable and fruit cultivation : training in land preparation, cultivation techniques, fertilizer application, cropping practices and marketing Livestock management : training in health management, improved feeding techniques, housing requirements, composting, grazing practices and community management of common grazing areas in the drawdown or under selected forest cover Nutrition and health : health and nutrition awareness programs as part of the Sanitation and Health Program (see Section 15.6.2). Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 23 Community development : Focus on skills development and income generation activities as well as support for community organizations with links to all of the above training programs and livelihood interventions 15.9 IMPROVEMENTS FOR WOMEN In the case of the Nakai Plateau and the lowland areas, women already play a significant role in the partially monetarized economy, primarily in the selling of agricultural and forest products in local markets. At the same time women have very little political power and do not have the same access to resources that men have. The question may be posed: how will the NT2 Project impact women's economic position in these societies? And, in addition, how will the socially and culturally productive activities in the household such as caring for children, the elderly and the sick , providing food for the family and the passing on of cultural values, be affected by the Project? An Asian Development Bank Report, entitled Handbook for incorporation of gender analysis for women in development in bank operations , (ADB 1994) identifies two complementary approaches to women in development: the equity approach, which aims at improving women's decision-making powers, and the anti-poverty approach which concerns special programs for women with the goal of improving their socio-economic conditions. Both approaches empower women by giving them more control over their own time and resources. There are a number of aspects from the Nam Theun 2 Project which could directly affect women in a positive manner: Improved labour opportuni ties in the new villages . Most of the work, such as caring for vegetable gardens and plots of cash crops in the vicinity of the house, has been th e traditional domain of women. With improved agricultural methods and be tter yields, there should be more food for the family grown near the household (money saved) and possibly surpluses which can be sold in local markets (money earned). Labour opportunities on the plantations : Caring for seedlings and weeding in the proposed new plantations and in commercial plantations would provide women with another source of income. In the resettled BPKP village in Ban Oudomsouk, Ban Jat San, it is mostly women who do the work on the nearby plantation. This income would go directly into the household coffers. Improved Health Facilities : The availability of medical fac ilities would give women access to medicine and proper advice on a range of topics which affect their lives. Women are responsible for the sick, the infirm and elderly as well as the care of young children. Im proved medical facilities in the form of a dispensary run by a trained para medic and regular visits by a doctor would be an important improvement and would save money and ti me. This would be in addition to the obvious improvements in pre-natal and post-natal care. Improved Education Facilities : The introduction of schools manned by local teachers would allow children between the ages of 5 and 12 to attend. This would have the result of relieving mothers of some of the child-care burden and allow them mo r e t i m e t o w o r k i n t h e g a r d e n s o r i n t h e plantations. Availability of water : The provision of domestic water in th e new village sites would also have a positive impact on the lives of women. It is women and girls who are mostly responsible for fetching water, washing clothes, preparing food and cleaning the house, all of which require water. New Roads : Improved transportation is beneficial to both men and women but has a special importance for women since they make most of the trips to the markets to purchase food and supplies or to sell agricultural and forest products. Again this would improve women's earning power, most of which goes directly to caring for the needs of the family. These benefits would allow women to earn more money by means of reducing the time spent within the confines of the domestic sphere with its reliance on men for cash income. Money earned by women goes for the most part to improving the lot of the family, such that development for women means development for the next generation as well. Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 24The proposed livelihood model indicates that the divisi on of labor will continue along the lines of Table 13-18. It is unrealistic to imagine that women from the villages will have the same opport unities to earn wages as the men may have because of the responsibilities at home. Providing better opportunities to earn money by selling produce from the household vege table gardens and livestock will enhance women's earning power. Much of the work in the community forest could also be carried out by women. In the villages, most women who are married and over the age of twenty are eith er pregnant, nursing or with small children. This has natu rally reduced the time women have had in the fields and outside the village proper. There were only a few women in the better-off villages along the road who have access to birth control. Improving the position of women is connected to health issues discussed above. 15.10 PILOT VILLAGE The decision to move a village in advance of th e main resettlement was taken in 1999 and work commenced in 2000 in the three hamlets of Ban Sailom, Ban No ngboua and Ban Pamanton that constitute a single village administrative unit refe rred to as Ban Nongboua. The goals are to provide the RMU and NTEC planners with an opportunity to test assumptions, verify predictions and work out solutions to problems in advance of the relocation. Th e proposed Pilot Village would be carefully planned and implemented and will possibly give planners insigh ts into how villagers adjust to the new site and aspects of the livelihood model. Monitoring labor re sources and institutional capacity will be very important aspects, continuing the work already completed on monitoring the three families on the demonstration farm at Theun Duane. An update on the progress of the Pilot Village status is provided in Appendix J. In terms of ethnic relations, there have been no serious conflicts or misunderstandings as of yet. In fact, the resettlers have insisted that the village layout be based on clans which group the different ethnic groups into two sections of Bo and one section of Brou. This pilot move, therefore, has shown that ethnicity is important for village layout and that the consultations are 'culturally sensitive' enough to allow this to be expressed and the approach to resettlement flexible enough to allow modifications to take this into account. The same can be said of the house designs. The new houses are all different in terms of details, allowing the different ethnic groups to retain their differ ences in artistic and architectural expression. 15.11 MEASURES TO PROTECT CULTURAL HERITAGE Recovery and relocation of the few moveable archaeological and historical artefacts from communities on the Nakai Plateau (e.g. Buddha images ) will be completed in conjunctio n with provincial and district Culture and Information Offices. Consultations an d negotiations will be carried out to determine culturally acceptable relocation to nominated sites. The historical ar tefacts near Ban Nakai Tai will not have to be moved but can be integrated into the new village in the immediate vicinity. According to villagers in consultation meetings, it might not be necessary to relocate village cemeteries, on the condition that appeas ement rituals for relocation of village spirits ( phi muang ) are held. The villagers have indicated that all items that may be regarded as 'cultural property' will be easily incorporated in the move with their other belongings. Appropriate protective and/or salvage measures will be adopted if any archaeologically significant properties are uncovered during the construction activities. If properties are recovered it will be the responsibility of the provincial and district Culture and Information Offices. If items are considered as having significant cultural value, it may be neces sary to seek advice from the national Culture and Information Offices. Members from these offices have been involved in the socio-cultural surveys and public consultation programs in 1997 and 1998 and therefore have a good knowledge of the culture and history of the project area. Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 25The recently completed Physical and Cultural Resource Study (2004) has id entified structures and items of cultural value that will be inundated by the reservoir and impacted by constructi on activities, and proposes mitigation measures for relocation and replacement for Project Lands. 15.12 OVERVIEW OF RISKS TO VULNERABLE ETHNIC MINORITIES AND MITIGATION MEASURES ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU Table 15-6 provides an overview of all the possible impacts, risks and mitigation that will be carried out in order to ensure that vulnerable et hnic minorities will not become marginalised but rather become project beneficiaries. By vulnerable ethnic minorities, one re fers only to the Veitic groups presently located at Sop Hia and a few households in Nam Nian, Thalang, Nakai Tai and Phonphanpek and the Tai Bo and Brou residing in smaller villages in the centre of the Nakai Plateau (Sop Phene, Hat Khamphane, Sop Ma and Keng Gnao). The larger Brou and mixed villages to the southwest and village s along the road are not considered 'vulnerable' for this analysis. Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 26 Table 15-6: Risk Matrix for Vulnerable Ethnic Minorities on the Nakai Plateau Impact/Activity Risks Proposed Mitigation Potential Residual Impact Further Possible Mitigation Relocation into new houses Families may have problems moving into houses that are unfamiliar and different House designs based on extensive consultations with ethnic groups and built with household participation as labourers - detailed decided households New designs may not be suitable to all groups or households - houses not properly maintained or cleaned Modifications to existing structures - EMs to make modifications under the supervision of a qualified carpenter or technician Change of livelihood - more intensive agricultural systems and less reliance on forests for NTFPs Introduction of new livelihood aspects and modification of existing systems will require considerable skills training and support, especially during transition. There is always a risk that some groups will return to traditional ways. Livelihood options build on existing livelihoods as much as possible Considerable support, training, supervision and monitoring during transition Poor performance in the various livelihood options due to a lack of understanding of new technology and methods. Possibly returning to post- resettlement livelihood activities such as swidden and livestock grazing in NBCA. Additional training and options for livelihood development - specific training for communities, including those of different Ethnic Minorities Increased monitoring of implementing agencies and supplementary training and ethnic sensitivity to local needs (on-the-job training by national and international experts) Participatory decision- making by affected families in the consultation process Decisions may be made without proper consultation and without prioritising the needs, concerns and aspirations of the affected households and communities. The consultations process has made efforts to include villagers' concerns and had many meetin gs and discussions with affected parties. Suggestions have been incorporated into detailed planning and relocation will be undertaken in a culturally sensitive manner. Lack of participation in consultation process as part of the implementation of livelihood improvement measures. Smaller ethnic minorities and vulnerable communities may be reluctant or uncertain about how to participate fully in the process. More sensitivity to local languages and local traditions - training and support for Village Facilitators Increased monitoring of implementing agencies and supplementary training and ethnic sensitivity to local needs (on-the-job training by national and international experts) Improved schools Levels of literacy are low on the Nakai Plateau due to schools not functioning and teacher absenteei sm. Literacy is an asset when relocating and learning new livelihoods as well as becoming more economically integrated. There is a risk that illiterate groups will become disadvantaged. Literacy programmes for all villagers and new schools as well as support in the form of materials and equipment.. Local teachers or teacher assistants from EM groups to be recruited whenever feasible. Lack of school attendance, high drop- out rates and poor performance of EMs in relation to other groups. EM adults not attending adult literacy classes Careful monitoring of school performance, teacher performance and consultations with parents and students in order to identify problems. Additional measures could be special training in the Lao language, special tutoring by bilingual teachers or financial support for uniforms and equipment. Review and continue adult literacy programme for EM communities. Improved health services Poor health facilities and high mortality rates are characteristic of the Nakai Plateau. Conditions could continue to deteriorate during resettlement and hinder the rehabilitation process. Influx of workers and camps also health risk. The PHAP provides support in a number of areas for all groups. In addition, there will be health centres at resettlement sites as well as support for equipment and training. Special programmes for preventive health in relation to project construction impacts.Higher than average health problems, higher mortality and morbidity rates for EMs during or after the relocation. Increase in health initiatives and measures to counter possible health problems - special consultations and visits by health specialists to identify problems and suggest mitigation measures specific to these communities if not already being carried out by the Project. Chapter 15: Mitigation and Ethnic Minority Issues November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 27 Impact/Activity Risks Proposed Mitigation Potential Residual Impact Further Possible Mitigation Changing use of natural resources (restriction on access) Unsustainable harvesting of NTFPs in the areas surrounding the resettlement zone and continued harvesting in the NBCA Continued gathering of NTFPs in resettlement areas and along the northern shore of the reservoir but at a reduced scale. Research into potential markets and experiments at domestication of certain NTPFs for sale. An over-reliance on NTFPs could lead to a further reduct ion in surrounding forests and potential conflict based on old village boundaries Close monitoring of NTFP harvesting and awareness programmes on sustainability of this resource. Increase domestication of selected products and introduce them into villages that are harvesting NTFPs with close supervision. More attention can also be given to successful livelihood interventions to increase income during transition and afterwards. Exploitation of vulnerable groups by other ethnic groups living in the same village or nearby More established, better educated and more resourceful groups on the Plateau and those in Nakai or camp followers may take advantage of the changing situation which they are likely to understand better. This may include hording of goods, controlling markets, obtaining land and rights to resources and other aspects of a rapidly changing socio-economic system. Each household will receive the same amount of land and housing in proportion to its size and resources with smaller. Monitoring of progress, including livelihood development and income levels and a participatory approach aim to minimise marginalisation of vulnerable groups. Exploitation of vulnerable groups by other ethnic groups living in the same village or nearby. Lack of equity in the distribution of goods within the village with certain influential individuals and families monopolising decision-making and resources. Consideration of relocation of Vietic or other vulnerable groups into a separate administrative village units with clearly demarked village bound aries and rights to resources. Increase monitoring of internal village administration and decision-making processes. Additional training and skills development for smaller and vulnerable groups.

The main components are: Resettlement Committee (RC), which will have overall responsib ility for the resettlement process, policy issues and auditing. Resettlement Management Unit (RMU) will be the implementing agen cy primarily for the co-ordination of government organizations, allocation of budgets, consultation and monitoring in relation to livelihood development, community development and training. District Resettlement Working Groups (DRWG) are the main groups for carrying out the relocation of villages, ongoing consultation with villagers, implem entation of livelihood prog rams and designing sites, plot layouts and allocation. Village Resettlement Committees (VRC) will represent villagers' conc erns and mobilization base for resettlement activities. The RMU will be responsible for organizing community development and extension services for the resettlement villages. The extension education staff required for this wo rk would have to be recruited and trained. They will participate in specialized training in all the relevant areas pe rtaining to the livelihood model. An agronomist with university level training and at least 10 years professional experience will be available to or employed by the RM U, supplemented by village level ex tension workers employed at a rate of about 1:100 households during the first five years. They will have at least a Diploma level training in agriculture, including livestock and will be based in the villages and provid ed with housing. Their residences may also serve as exte nsion centres at the rate of on e centre for every two villages. Since most of the plateau resettlers have been classified as Ethnic Minorities under WB and ADB policy, it will be necessary to have expertise to cover this fiel d in the RMU, linked to expertise in ha ndling gender issues, community development and participatory planning and consultations. It is important that understanding of social issues and international standards of planning, implementation and monitoring in relation to these issues form a central part of the capacity building programme for GoL agencies. 16.2 ASSESSMENT OF CAPACITY 16.2.1 Resettlement Experience wi th Ethnic Minorities Resettlement of ethnic minority groups in the context of hydropower development is recognised as being very challenging. There have been numerous review s of resettlement, including the recent WCD Report, that state that ethnic minorities (EMs) are among the most vulnerable of populations. Because attachment to traditional territory and reliance on the resources in these areas, EMs require additional assistance to adjust to new surroundings and adapt to new livelihood systems. In addition, a lack of representation in decision-making bodies and in gove rnment, illiteracy and different valu e systems, religion and social organisation from the dominant groups have in led to marginalisation of small groups. A critical review of resettlement in Lao PDR was carried out by the UNDP (Goudineau 1997). Some of the main shortcomings of previous resettlement projects in Lao that were carried out by the government are as follows: Lack of funds for planning, actual relocation, livelihood development and follow-up monitoring; Lack of experience on local and district levels in implementation due to a lack of qualified staff and experience in dealing with a range of issues, especi ally in the fields of livelihood development and health; Chapter 16: Institutional Arrangements and Capa city for Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2 Difficulties occurred as a result of a top-down approach from the various levels within the government resulting in a lack of meaningful consultation with relocatees in advance of resettlement regardin g site selection, services and support; Local cultural beliefs and values and ethnicity were often not taken into consideration in relation to achieving policy directives such as the reductio n of swidden practices such that many ethnic minorities lost their sense of cultural identity and well-being as communities. Given this background and capacity, a major challenge fo r the developers is to ensure that capacity is in place before implementation commences. Following the extensive interaction between professionals and planners and the different specialis ts and administrators on the Lao si de that has been ongoing since 1996, steps are being taken to strengthen the capacity and to establish robust institutional arrangements in the form of the RMU and other implementation agencies under the leadership of the Resettlement Committee. However, there will be a need for considerable input from international and national experts in a number of fields, including anthropologist or ethnic minority specialist, community development experts and institutional experts. See Table 16-1 for a list of GoL staff associated with the Project and their ethnicity.

There are, however, three members who are from ethnic minorities, two Brou and one Tai Bo represented in the Nakai DRWG. All three members of the Khamkeut represent the ethnic group in that area, the Tai Moey. 16.2.2 Implications of Village Leadership There are perhaps three possible implic ations for village leadership. Firs tly, given the complex structures and the dominance of certain families in leadership positions, it will be necessary to make sure that decisions which affect the future of the village (location, improvements, et c.) are made in plenum where open discussion may be encouraged. This is to ensure that information concerning the NT2 Project is reaches everyone in the villages, including wome n, ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups, who previously knew little or nothing about the implications of the building of the dam and resettlement. Efforts have to be made so that vital information is disseminated to the general population and not just discussed among key, male members of the village. Many of the experiences from the early participation in the late 1990s have been incorporated in the recent 2004 consult ations (see Chapter 4). Secondly, women are not always included in decision -making and may not participate fully in discussions that will affect their future lives. This is evident in the observation of decisi on-making processes during the PRA sessions described above in some detail in 1997. The only organi zation that involves women is the Lao Women's Union, which has members in each village. The level of activity of the organization varies depending on the state of the village and the quality of the leadership. In Ban Sop On and Ban Nakai Neua, for example, the Union organized gardens and had an active leader while in Ban Sop Hia and in Ban Sop Phene, little had been done for years. Strengthening the LWU w ill be a key factor for improving the participation of women in project implementation and monitoring. Thirdly, there is a danger that village elite and econ omically strong individual s and families obtain control of the distribution of goods and benefits of the Project. This is a problem with all such large-scale infrastructure development throughout the world. The only way to ensure an equitable distribution of goods and fair distribution of benefits is to monito r closely using both internal monitoring and external audits. Much can be done, and is in the process of being done, by establishing good institutional arrangements, training government staff and making the affected populations aware of their rights and proposed mitigation measures. In particular the rece nt selection of Village Facilitators representing a cross-section of interests and groups will be central in voicing the opinions of all groups in the village as part of the ongoing consultation process. 16.2.3 Patterns of Community Cooperation There are a number of ways in which villagers coop erate among households and at a community level, and these have the important role of cons tituting a village fellowship and identity that often involves all ethnic groups. There are three main types of village cooperation: labour exch ange systems, community projects and ritual obligations. Labour exchange systems are a key aspect that gove rns socio-economic interaction at the village level. Traditional systems are rooted in kinship organisation s, the basic element being the extended family. Many ethnic groups reside in compounds, consisting of three generations. One of the key differences between the ethnic groups is the composition of such grou ps. Many Tai-Lao groups, including the Lao, Phuan, Nyo and other lowland groups, practice uxorilocal reside nce, that is residence determined by the wife, at least initially. Hence, such compound s usually consist of parents and daughters' family with the youngest daughter usually living under the same roof as her pa rents, and kinship is reckoned along female lines (matrilineal). Among the Phou Thay and the Upland Tai groups (Tai Men, Tai Moey, Tai Daeng, etc.) there is a preference for sons (patr ilineal). However, in both systems th ere is considerab le variation in preferences for sons and daughters. The Brou and Vietic groups are also patrilineal, but only the former have compound arrangements, the latter being organised in small kin group (bilateral for the most part). There is still a need to investigate the social structures of the various Vietic grou ps in the project area. Chapter 16: Institutional Arrangements and Capa city for Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 4Labour exchange is an essential part of swidden and paddy rice production throughout the project area since these activities are labour-intense. Labour is available from a large kinship network and reciprocity can be delayed for a considerable amount of time. This can be in the form of labour at another time or another service at a time of need. This system is, thus, flexible in terms of time and actual means of payment/service. This is still the pr edominant system of labour exchange in traditional villages and is preferred in villages that are less integrated into the market system based on cash transactions. Community project require the cooperation of the village as a whole, and in some ways this can be seen as an extension of labour exchange systems based on kin. Many villagers refer to themselves as phi-nong , meaning that they are all related, literally elder and younger kin/siblings. Projects that require many hands, such as the construction of a house, clearing of irrigation canals, building community buildings or maintaining a temple or road, demand village-level or ganisation. This is often the joint responsibility of the village headmen or assistants an d the representatives of mass organi sations, such as the LWU and the LNF. However, kinship ties and proximity in terms of neighbours also play a part in the mobilisation process, especially in the case of house construction . One of the most common ways of organising labour on the community level is that all households provide one person, often an able-bodied male for construction, as its contribution. Sometimes households may contribute a small amount of cash instead, while other households may be exempt due to a lack of able-bodied adults or illness. One of the most common types of community projects on the Plateau is the construction of the frame of a new house where the men of the village cooperate, usually un der the supervision of an experienced villager or carpenter, to erect a frame within a 12-hour period in the evening or night time. The beneficiary household usually supplies food and alcohol to those involved. Another important type of village cooperation manifests itself in th e form of ritual obligations and community festivals. This includes all rites de passage (marriage, entering the monkhood, moving into a new house, death ceremonies and offerings for ancestors) and village-level rituals, such as offerings to the territorial spirits and 'visiting spirits', rain-making rituals and special occasions like relocating a village and rituals for averting unusual events, plagues and natural disasters. Participation is not only for the collective goal of the ritual but also a social obligation in terms of support in a material and socio-psychological manner. This relates to the sense of identity and belonging to a particular location and community where one has clear social obligations and responsibilities to other members an d can in times of need rely on a community for support. It is important to note that these th ree types of cooperation at the vill age level will be mobilised on several occasions in relation to the resettle ment process and that village lead ers and members of the VRC and the Village Facilitators are all embedded in these systems of cooperation, reciprocity and exchange. Hence, all actions carried out in the village are likely to be ca rried out within these important systems. Some important aspects relate to the village layout (k inship and residence patt erns in the community), construction of houses and clearing of fields (labour exchange) and rituals for relocation and establishment of village s (ritual obligations). 16.2.4 Traditional Conflict Resolution At the village level there are traditional means of resolv ing conflict. Most villagers prefer to resolve issues at a village level involving people and organisations that they are familiar with th an to involve outsiders and District government. The follow ing summarises the various level of traditional conflict resolution: Within household or extended families, the elde st males and in some ca ses the eldest females discuss the issue with those kin involved and find a solution or compromise - not adhering to a decision or consensus may risk exclusion, temporary or permanent, from the household Among households, the eldest males, ritual leaders or clan leaders, will meet among themselves to resolve disputes. The thao khun (Council of Village Elders) is espe cially important regarding disputes about marriage and spirits while the sang kai kia (Advisory Council for Disputes, est. in 1996) has taken over the role of the Council of Village Elders regarding non-cultural ma tters such as disputes about land or crime and function as a sort of village court for local disputes. However, the roles and responsibilities of these two groups are often overlapping with some members included in both organisations. Chapter 16: Institutional Arrangements and Capa city for Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 5 Disputes between villagers are usually handled by village leaders with sup port from assistants and other village authorities and mass organisations. Disputes usually concern land or access to resources, in particular NTFPs. There have been a nu mber of disputes of this nature on the Plateau and fees are often imposed on offenders who have go ne into other village territories without first seeking permission. Traditional clan leaders and ritu al leaders often have the role of 'advisors' in these disputes since they represent large kinship networks. In all traditional conflict resolution, the hierarchy of age (elders over younger members) and status (leadership in terms of political positions or traditiona l clan leadership) play important organisational roles. However, the main approach to solving problems is through dialogue and consensus within the group where the problem or dispute has arisen. There is an attempt to limit the extent of the conflict. Most disputes are resolved locally through a combination of social pressure and obligation on the one hand and the need for community solidarity and belonging on the other. 16.3 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS Adequate funds have been allotted for institutional capacity building due to the importance of capacity building and establishing viable institutions to implement and monitor the Project. The SDP budget indicates that the staffing costs, ca pital costs and running costs are in cluded in the overall resettlement costs. In addition, there is a budget item specifica lly for training the RMU staff and Technical Assistance programme provided by the ADB for assessing and improving the capacity and performance of GoL Moreover, GOL is providing personnel, recruiting from within the government system at the national, provincial and district levels. Much of the work at the village level will be undertaken by local village authorities as part of their overall responsibilities to the communities, including resettlement planning, co- ordination and reporting. 16.4 ASSESSMENT OF PROFESSIONAL STAFF The development of the RMU is ongoing at present with only some of the key positions filled. The RMU consists of government employees recruited from various organizations within the government system. A full assessment of the staff is not possible at the present time since only a limited number of initiatives and actions have been carried out on the ground, the most important of which is the ongoing Pilot Village relocation. The size of the RMU and the DRWGs will increase significantly when the Project moves into the resettlement implementation phas e at the beginning of 2005. However, it is clear from the type of experience and background of the staf f that there will be a need for tec hnical assistance from a variety of professionals in order to ensure a su ccessful resettlement. The district leve l staff in particularly will require assistance and training if they are going to be able to carry out their tasks and fulfil their responsibilities according to the SDP. Furthermore, there will be roles for international prof essionals to assist, guide an d help co-ordinate efforts in order to ensure international (WB) standards are met. There will be roles for local consultants and NGOs in areas that the district and RMU do not have the sufficient technical expertise, such as health awareness programs, ethnic minority issues and adult literacy. Of particular concern is the weak agricultural extens ion services at the district levels. Given the central role of the livelihood model, consid erable assistance will be needed for government staff to cope with all the implications of the model and its range of options. The SDP (Chapters 7, 21 and 24) has identified a broad-based program of extension services that will be further identified in detail in the process of establishing the Pilot Village. The handling of the Pilot Village re location by the RMU and government staff with limited input from other professionals has been a test case and involved a complete assessment of abil ities. A short field visit and assessment in April 2002, concluded that the RMU staff and technical assistants from the district and demonstration farms were participating in the establishment of the Pilot Village. Chapter 16: Institutional Arrangements and Capa city for Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 616.5 ETHNIC MINORITIES AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS Ethnic minorities are represented at the different levels of government at the local level and at district level to some extent. At the villa ge level, local leaders are select ed by the communities after being approved by the government and for the most part represent the different ethnic minorities on the Plateau. However, there is a tendency for lowland Lao and other more educated groups from outside the Plateau to acquire some positions within village orga nizations due to their liter acy, experience and skills. These are usually an individuals married with local women and integrated into village life. Hence, there represent the interests of village rs, being part of extended families and kinship relationships. At the district level, many representatives are from areas outside Nakai District or not from the villages on the Plateau. This is because Nakai acquired the status as a district on ly in 1992, having previously been part of Gnommalat District. Many of the positions are, therefore, from Gnommalat District following the reorganization of government staff. The former District Chairman was Brou and the present chairman is Kaleung, both originally from Gnommalat District, reflecting the general tendency for representation of groups in local government. The composition of the RMU and DRWG for Nakai District consist of number of a number of ethnic groups: Brou, Phu Thay, Tai and lowland Lao. There are no representatives from ethnic minorities from the Plateau village s. However, the formation of Village Resettlement Committees in Ban Sop Hia, Ban Thalang, Ban Nakai Neua, Ban Sop Phene and Ban Nong Boua/Ban Sailom/Ban Pamanton consist of representatives from local ethnic groups. Given the lack of education, skills and experience in dealing such a large infras tructure proj ect, much of the government leadership w ill need to be recruited at a national level and will be dominated by lowland groups. However, implementation of the Project will in volve the co-operation and, through consultation, understanding of the various ethnic groups. Inte rnational and national experts will monitor the involvement of ethnic minorities in the planning, implementation and monitoring process. There is also a recommendation for ethnic minority experts from the Inst itute of Cultural Research to act as advisors to the RMU and inclusion of ethnic minorities in the DRWG for Nakai. 16.6 MOBILIZATION PROCESS AND FIELD PRESENCE Since only a limited amount of activities have been ca rried out by the RMU and the District in the field, it is difficult to comment on this theme in the planning phase. One should note that there is a provision to gradually increase the number of staff before the implementation phase. Once the implementation has started there will be ample staff to oversee activities and carry out consultation with PAPs as adequate training and skills development programs will have been started by that time. In April 2002, the RMU consisted of one full time ma nager and two part time assistants from the LWU and manager of the Learning through Innovation Loan (LIL) for the catchment programs (cf. SEMFOP). In addition, staff from the demonstration farms at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm and Nakai Neua Demonstration Farm and Nursery were assisting in the establishment of plot layouts 3 days per week. At the level of the DRWG in Naka i District, there were two full time government members from the district with responsibilities for co-ordination of district support and technical cum agricultural support for the Pilot Village. Another 9 memb ers of the DRWG for Nakai District have been selected but are not yet active. VRCs have been established in all 17 villages/hamlets on the Plateau. In addition, there are activities aimed at improving livelihood and health in the villages that is being coordinated by the RMU and GOL and with the assistance of NGOs. Distribution of farm equipment, tools and seeds (mid-2001); Support for construction of schools and supply of school equipment in Ban Sop Hia; and Ban Sop Phene (District provided te achers) from mid 2001 to the present; Co-operation with CARE Int. rice-for-work prog ram and the construction of fish ponds in Ban Nakai Neua and Ban Done with the RMU supplying the farm equipment; Co-operation with EU Malaria program by supplying per diems for District staff responsible for the distribution of nets, medicine and information for training; Chapter 16: Institutional Arrangements and Capa city for Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7 Co-operation with NGO Amiti\u00e9-Coop\u00e9ration Franco-Laotienne for health upgrading, training and health monitoring on the Nakai Plateau. 16.7 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF ETHNIC MINORITY REPRESENTATION There are two main initiatives that are necessary for improving ethnic minority representation and participation in decision-making. As is noted in the sections above, there is a lack of representation of ethnic minorities on most levels except for the vi llage level. It is necessary, therefore, to make modifications to ensure that ethnic minorities are able to voice their opinions at least at the district level and that international and national experts have a role of advisors to monitor this process. 16.2.5 International and National Ethnic Minority Advisors Given the complex situation of the Plateau in terms of ethnic composition and the challenges of carrying out a resettlement programme in a cult urally sensitive manner, advice an d guidance will be necessary from international anthropologists and community development experts throughout the resettlement, especially in the initial stages when familiari ty with international standards an d WB/ADB safeguar d policies may be limited. Training of GoL and capacity building will be an important role. It is also necessary to involve national organisation in the monitoring of ethnic minority issues. The following positions are required: Member of Institute of Cultural Research to act as a part-time advisor on the RMU in the Social Unit- details on input and ToR will be finalised before resettlement commences (ca. April 2005) International expert as part of NTPC's Resettlement Office Organisation - these are indicated as a Consultation and Ethnic Development Manager and Lao Advisors (see Figure 6-4 and budget for Community Consultation and Ethnic Development) Independent Monitoring Unit and POE to monitor ethnic issues 16.2.6 Ethnic Minority Representation on the Nakai DRWG At present there are three members of the DRWG th at are ethnic minorities from the Nakai Plateau or surrounding region. It is agreed that there will be no less than three ethnic minori ty members. Efforts will be made to recruit new members that are indigenous to the Plateau and from Ethnic Minority groups if they are qualified for such positions. The fact that lit eracy and education levels are low for most Plateau dwellers makes recruitment to DRWG for Nakai difficu lt. Ethnic awareness training will be carried out for all GoL organisations involved in implementation. Chapter 17: Monitoring and Evaluation of Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 iCHAPTER 17 MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF ETHNIC GROUPS ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU Table of Content 17 MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF ETHNIC GROUPS ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU....................................................................................................1 17.1 INTERNAL MONITORING SYSTEM ..............................................................................1 17.2 INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL MONITORING .................................................................1 17.3 SOCIAL INDICATORS ...................................................................................................2 List of Tables Table 17-1: Sample Social Monitoring Indicators ...........................................................................................2 Chapter 17: Monitoring and Evaluation of Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 117 MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF ETHNIC GROUPS ON THE NAKAI PLATEAU Given the scale of the Project and the degree of capa city building and institutional strengthening that is required for implementation, monitoring and evaluation are absolutely essential aspects to ensure high standards are maintained throughout all phases. Moni toring and evaluation will be both internal and external. A number of important social monitoring indicators are also provided at the end of this chapter. The monitoring of ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups will be especially important since these segments of society may become marginalised. Detecting problems and shortcomings in performance early is key to tailoring further in terventions and realising income targets for all groups on the Plateau. All Monitoring Indicators will be differentiated by ethnic groups . 17.1 INTERNAL MONITORING SYSTEM The Resettlement Office (RO) will be responsible for monitoring of the infrastr ucture construction so that relocation can take place on time. It will report regularly to the RMU and the RC. The RMU will monitor progress in the preparation of the villagers for th e physical move, the move itself, the post move settling-in phase and the livelihood and community development. A series of reporting tables has been developed. Every month, the rese ttlement progress report fo r each village will be prepared. This will indicate the ac tivities completed, funds allocated and spent, relocations completed, development tasks complete d, and community activities complete d. These reporting cards will be collected by each village and Di strict Resettlement Working Group, and aggregated by the RMU. By comparing the progress on the ground with the implementation schedules, the RMU can identify areas of weak implementation, and take remedial action. Fo r those problems requiring decisions from higher authorities, the RMU will report to the RC. Both the RMU and the RO will each ha ve monitoring units. Reports from both sources will be in tegrated to provide an overview. Discussions will be held with village leaders and affected communities to assess a range of social issues and to qualitatively review progress on a regular basis as part of the ongoing consultation process. Monitoring will require the participation of the Village Facilitators who represent a range of village groups, including ethnic minorities, women and youth. This information will form pa rt of the monitoring reporting or feedback. Gender monitoring will ensure that women participat e in livelihood restoration programmes, management and decision-making and other activities. 17.2 INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL MONITORING The main objective of the NT2 Resettlement Policy is to ensure that Project Affected Persons are better off after resettlement and that they reach the income targets set in the Concession Agreement. Achievement of this objective may be difficult to judg e by those implementing the Plan because they will be so involved in it. To overcome this, monitoring and evaluation by an independent institution, here called external monitoring, will be conducted. The cand idate organization or individuals will be those with extensive experience in social surveys and familiar with the local language and so cio-economic conditions. To ensure that the best candidate is selected, the recruitment of indepe ndent external monitors will follow a competitive bidding process. A request for proposals will be advertised and sent to potential candidates, including NGOs and social science in stitutions. Based on a review of their work plan and qualifications, the most suitable organization will be selected to ca rry out the external monitoring and evaluation work for NT2. Selection will take place upon Project ap proval, by the RMU. A separate budget for the independent external monitor will be provided. Organizationally, the exte rnal monitoring is not unlike the Panel of Experts, in that it provid es independent advice on progress. The external monitors will report to the RC. Chapter 17: Monitoring and Evaluation of Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 217.3 SOCIAL INDICATORS The main focus of the monitoring and evaluation will be on the changes in social and economic conditions of villages, individual households and ho useholds disaggregated acco rding to ethnic groups. Based on existing socio-economic characteristics of the villages an d the type of rehabilitation and relocation schemes to be implemented, a set of indi cators will be developed for affected households and villages, including income level, sources of income, food sufficiency, basic health and education conditions, women's status, etc (see Table 17-1). The monitoring and evalu ation will be carried out until it can be shown that the resettlement objectives have been fully achieved. This is currently estimated to be December 2010 according to the rese ttlement schedule in the SDP. Table 17-1: Sample Social Monitoring Indicators Indicator Present status Objectives Household income US$ 449 (1998) Average rural village income upon project completion and at final income of per Household (in 1997/98 calculated at US$ 1,200) Division of Labour Traditional division of labour and involvement in livelihood on the Plateau (study yet to determine details but proposed as part of Gender Study 2004) New division of labour and livelihood arrangements do not overburden either men or women in terms of time and resources - indicators to be determined from proposed study. School Attendance Low and irregular in most of the villages on the Plateau - lack of school facilities and teachers Significant increase in at tendance and establishment of fully functional schools for each village Literacy Rate 48% illiterac y and only 42% have some form of primary education Significant increase in sc hool attendance at primary level and decrease in gender literacy gap; increase in adult literacy Health Facilities Only four health stations in the Nakai District at present Establishment of clinics in each resettlement village, manned by trained local personnel and supplied with equipment and sufficient medicines Nutritional Status Poor status as based on health study reports Significant improvement in potable water for all resettlers; improved weight-height ratios for infants Malaria Between 21.2% and 10.3% recorded in 1997 in Ban Nakai Tai Recent significant reduction due to EU program - continued low presence of malaria Parasitic diseases Significant presence of many common parasites (up to 90% of the population infected) Significant decrease in parasitic diseases Child mortality rate National Infant Mortality rate is estimated at 87.2 per 1000 live births for rural populations (UNFPA 2000) and is probably higher is such remote areas as the Nakai Plateau Available medical advice, staff and medicines to deal with childhood diseases and significant decrease in child mortality Maternal Care National statistics for antenatal care: - 24.2% only Births assisted by doctor or health worker: 13.5% only Again statistics are probably lower for the Nakai area Available medical advice, staff and medicines to deal with maternal and signific ant decrease in maternal mortality The methodology will include a combination of samp le household survey, focus group interviews and participatory discussion, a combination of surveys and qualitative methods. A baseline socio-economic survey of a sample of affected households has been during 1998 (see Appendix H of the SDP for survey Chapter 17: Monitoring and Evaluation of Ethnic Groups on the Nakai Plateau November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3design). This has set the reference points but the resu lts of the individual households will be compared on the village and ethnic group levels. The resettlement monitoring and evaluation work will start at the same time as implementation and will cont inue after the construction period until income levels of resettlers reach the stated goals laid out in the policy. An evaluation report will be prepared each year following a field surv ey and will be submitted to the Resettlement Committee. Such a report could, for instance, show that some families are doing very well for identified reasons and that some other families are doing poorly for certain reasons. Such findings can then be used by the RMU to re direct or adjust its programs.

Aspects that are important from an ethnic minority perspective, and that have been incorporated into the overall approach to resettlement planning, include the follo wing. 18.1 SOCIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY ISSUES IN RELATION TO IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE All relevant social and ethnic minority concerns re lating to scheduling and implementation have been incorporated into the SDP. The most important concerns are highlighted below. The general approach to planning has been one of establishing an effective, long-term relationship between government agencies and the Project, on the one hand, and affected communities, local organizations and ethnic minorities, on the other. Institutional strengthening and traini ng for both resettlers (villagers participating in the demonstration farms and pilot village resettlement) and for government agencies (RMU, DRWGs and VRCs) have been central elements from the start of project planning and will continue throughout the project construction period and during the first years of operation. This includes awareness about the needs of the different ethnic groups for planners, culturally sensitive approa ches to consultations for the implementing agencies involved and involvement of ethnic minorities in decision-making process and new institutional arrangements. The ethnic minorities on the Nakai Plateau have been part of an extensive consultation process in order to elicit their concerns and viewpoints as well as to obtain feedback on various aspects of resettlement planning and this will continue with a focus on th e needs of specific commun ities and ethnic groups within these communities during the implementation. Ethnic groups will be consulted on proposed village relocation sites, plot locations for individual households and layout of fields and livelihood elements, paying attention to belief systems, cultural practices, kinship support networks and differences in design criteria. This is being done at present for the Pilot Village relocation (see Append ix J). Choice of village sites will be finalised during the consultation process, starting in November 2004. Ethnic groups will participate in the clearing of la nd, construction of houses and other infrastructure activities and be given ample time and support to relocate, including for carrying out all necessary communal and household rituals - this is being do ne at present for the Pilot Village relocation (see Appendix J). House construction w ill commence for the new village of Nam Pan, Sophene, Sopma, Sop Hia, Nongbouakham, Bouama, Phonsavang and S opon at the commencement of the 2005 dry season. The rest of the Plateau villages will start house construction one year later. The basic steps and order for relocation is: Topographic survey Finalisation of village site location through consultation Village layout design UXO Survey and clearance Land clearing Marking of plots and land titling Village house construction and construction of public buildings Installation of technical aspects concurrent with house construction for roads, electricity supply, domestic water and sanitation, and irrigation Chapter 18: Recommendations for Scheduling and Financing November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 2Culturally sensitive assistance will be provided for assessing livelihood options, forestry management and income support procedures so that ethnic groups can make informed choices regarding their future livelihoods and changes to traditional practices. Many of the features of the planning such as the livelihood models, house de signs, village layouts, infrastructure improvements are derived in part from the consultation process and the feedback given by the ethnic groups on the Plateau. This process will cont inue to ensure that the different ethnic groups are able to voice their particular concerns during the resettlement process. Various forms of technical assistance covering all aspects of the livelihood restoration process are integrated into relocation activities. International and Lao TA for agricultural extension and livestock have already started for the pilot village and will expand considerably in 2005. Since the reservoir will not be inundated until 2009 and training progra mmes will commence in 2008 onwards. Monitoring by the affected ethnic groups on the Na kai Plateau will involve members of the communities themselves (Village Facilitators) in addition to elec ted leaders and members of government organizations - this is to ensure that all minorities are involved. V illage Facilitators have been active in the consultation process since August 2004. 18.2 SOCIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY ISSUES IN RELATION TO BUDGET A number of key features of the budget in the RAP represent the concerns and considerations of social conditions and ethnic minorities on the Nakai Platea u. The allotted resettlement budget of over US$ 20,000 per household is high by national and internati onal standards as is the goal of nearly tripling existing incomes to around US$ 1,200 per annum base d on average household pe r village. The budget covers all livelihood and infrastructure aspects as detailed in Chapter 28. Key elements of the relocation, community development and livelihood restoration include (references to budget items given in brackets): Family house, toilet, granary, electric wiring and water supply for each household based on the number of residents (house size depending on the number of residents) and designs in consultations with future owners so as to include any architectural details of the different ethnic groups on the Plateau as is evident already in how the Pilot Village houses have been constructed (Item G3); Funds for land clearing, fencing, tools, fertilizers and equipment fo r resettler families to create a sense of belonging to the new resettlement si te (Item G1 - Clearance of Village Sites); Relocation costs, including transp ortation, labour and for necessary relocation rituals for the village as a whole (territorial spirits) and for households (spirit ritual for each ethnic group) included in disturbance allowance (Item G2 - Organise Villagers for Relocation and T6 - Support Relocation); All community structures, including clinics, scho ols and tree nurseries - again designed with consideration of the ethnic groups' beliefs and interests (Items H7 - Community Buildings); Electricity supply, ponds, water supply and roads for each resettler village to ensure higher standards of health, better livelihood opportunities and market access (Items H1-6 - Design and Construction of Infrastructure and Equipment); Forestry Management Program and Reservoir Ma nagement and Fisheries Development Program that takes into consideration existing practices and attitudes to natural resource allocation, including the weaknesses and strengths of the different ethnic groups (Item F2 - Training Resettlers); Livelihood Improvement Program that involves a cu lturally and ethnically sensitive approach to instructing resettlers in the new and improved aspects of the livelihood options, including consultations involving trainers familiar with the social and cultural needs of the different ethnic groups (Budget items in P - Agricultural Deve lopment Programme, Q1 - TA for Agricultural Development Programme, R6 - Fisheries Training and T for technical assistance, training, extension and various support programmes); Community development and income generation su pport, including skills, training and income support programs that are suitable for the different ethnic groups on the Plateau in terms of existing skills, needs and information that has been and will be obtained during consultations (Items Chapter 18: Recommendations for Scheduling and Financing November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 3F2 and T8 - Income Generation Activities, T9 - Village Savings and Loans Facilities and T11 - Income Support and Support to Vulnerable Households); Health Program that is designed to address potential problems caused by the project (introduction of diseases from lowland areas), incorporating existing traditional health practices among the ethnic groups with modern techniques in a culturally sensitive manner (Budget Items N for Regional Health Programme and U for Resettlement Health Programme). Education programme supporting the establishment of nurseries, primary schools and non-formal education programmes (Item T10 - Education Programme) Training and support for Village Resettlement/De velopment Committees and Mass Organisations, including the Lao Women's Union, Youth Organisation and LNFC (Items T1 - Training of VRDCs and T7 - Support to Community Organisations) Monitoring and data collection of resettlers (Item T2 - Population and Citizen Management) Support for social development as well as technical input in terms of infrastructure, equipment and buildings is extensive and covers all areas of social concern. Since livelihoods ar e similar among all ethnic groups on the Plateau, differences will only emer ge while accessing options and consulting with communities and individual households during actual implementation. Funds will be available for cultural aspects of relocati on, including rituals for moving from one location to the other, for entering new dwellings and for arranging houses according to clans and kinship ties. This is the ongoing practice for the Theun Duane Demonstr ation Farm (Appendix I) and is presently being carried out for the Pilot Village relocation (Appendix J). Particular issues related to ethnic minorities include the following key items: External Monitoring (Item A - External Monitoring) for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the different ethnic groups and their performance during the livelihood restoration and relocation process. Ethnic Minority Advisor for the RMU (part-time), possibly seconded from the Institute of Cultural Resource or Department of Ethni c Affairs from April 2005 (Item F15.1b in the Social Cultural Unit) Training in Ethnic Minorities Awareness for RMU, DRWGs and RO staff as well as local GoL organisations involved in resettlement (b\\l F11.2) Training and support for the Lao National Front for Construction (Responsible for Ethnic Issues), including basic training in relation to project needs, investigation of new data and development of strategies, and advocacy to ensure village elders and traditional organisations have role in the resettlement process (Item T7) Awareness and cultural sensitivity training for medical staff in provincial and district health institutions (b\\l N). Training of Village Health Volunteers (VHV) wi th preference given to traditional health practitioners (b\\l N). Funding for research by the Traditional Medical Research Centre (TMRC) to carry out Part II of Traditional Health Practi ces Survey in 2005 (b\\l N). Funding for recommendations as a result of Part II Survey by TMRC, including possibly a herbarium on the Nakai Plateau or the inclusion of traditional medicines in the Village Drug Revolving Fund (VDRF) (b\\l N). Cultural and spiritual heritage issues, including Physical and Cultural Resources Survey (see EAMP Budget), Provisions for vulnerable ethnic minority hous eholds and communities, expected to include additional measures for Vietic groups in Sop Hi a and small hamlets and v illages along the central portions of the Nakai Plateau (Sop Phene, Sop Ma, Kengngao and Hatkhampan and possibly other households (Item T11 - Income Support and Support to Vulnerable Households) Chapter 18: Recommendations for Scheduling and Financing November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 4A key staff composent in relation ensuring compliance with ethnic minorities safeguard policies is the Community Consultation and Ethnic Development Team covered by the NTPC budget. There is funding for an international Technical Mana ger full-time from 2005 to 2007, two senior Lao Technical Assistants (one male and one female), one senior TA responsible for socio-economic monitoring and one database expert. This staff will be supporting and working dire ctly with the Junior Lao staff under the RMU at each village on the Nakai Plateau.

It also describes how land tenure will be developed for the housing and agricultural lands, and how villagers have, and will continue to be involved in the design and construction of their own houses in their new village location. 19.2 INITIAL IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL RESETTLEMENT ZONES Following field surveys carried out in 1995, seven gene ral potential resett lement areas were identified for further review. These general areas were numbered and located as follows: \u0083 General area No.1, located in Nakai Distri ct, Khammouane Province, southeast of Ban Oudomsouk, the boundaries of this area being adja cent to the proposed reservoir and escarpment; \u0083 General area No. 2, located in Nakai District southeast of Site 1 near the villages of Ban Done and Ban Khone Khen; \u0083 General area No. 3, also situated in Nakai Distri ct, northwest of the villages of Ban Oudomsouk, on the proposed reservoir shoreline; \u0083 General area No. 4A, located in Nakai District, southwest of the Site No.3; \u0083 General area No. 4B, situated in Gnommalat District , Khammouane Province, east of the village of Ban Pha Toung; \u0083 General area No. 5A, situated north of the v illage of Ban Nam Nian, Khamkeut District, Bolikhamxay Province; \u0083 General area No. 5B, located on road No 8 to Ban Lak Sao, about 12 km north of Site 5A, in Khamkeut District, Bolikhamxay Province. This area includes Ban Pakkatan and its periphery. After further study, four of these seven areas were assessed as suitable for resettlement. These were general areas 1, 2 and 3 on the Nakai Plateau (referred to later as the Plateau Resettlement Area) and general area 4B in the Gnommalat District (referred to as the downstream Resettlement Area). The other three areas were rejected on economi c and/or environmental grounds. Public consultations and participat ory resettlement studies demonstrated a very strong villager preference to remain on the Plateau rather than moving to the lowland areas, except for the three Tai families from Sophia and Namnian villages who chos e to return to their former home in the Lak Sao area. The relocation of these two villages will be explained in detail in Section 19.11. Although General Area 4B had obvious potential, it was not on the plateau, and, as was pointed out by the Panel of Experts (POE), the area may better be reserved for use by voluntary settlers from the Nakai-Nam Theun NPA in the medium term or potential replacement land for communities affected along the Downstream Channel or otherwise affected by project construction. For that reason it was not considered further in the Plateau Resettlement Plan, which turned its focus to areas on the Nakai Plateau. In response to villager preference for the plateau, fo cus turned to the Plateau Resettlement Area and 25 blocks were delineated as suitable for potential resettlement (see Figure 19-1). These 25 zones are located on the western edge of the Nakai Plat eau, and generally fall within the e xisting Plateau village boundaries. Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 219.3 PLATEAU RESETTLEMENT SITE SELECTION A variety of factors are important to the Project planners (NTPC and GOL) and to villagers when deciding on their resettlement site preferences and these presented in Table 19-1. Table 19-1: Factors Considered in the Sel ection of Prospective Resettlement Sites 1. The resettlement sites should be as near as possible to the old village location . 2. The resettlement site should not infringe on la nd or resources of othe r villages, but if it does then resolutions and agreemen ts should be amicable developed Social considerations 3. Social and cultural factors must be taken into account including the village spiritual areas and customary boundaries . 4. Access to water : Water supply must be accessible from the reservoir, along with an elevated site for the header tank to allow gravity irrigation to farm plots 5. Topography: Slope for the farm plot area(s) should be as gentle as possible and ideally not exceed 15% 6. Soils : The soils selected must be capable of pr oviding adequate returns with a potential for the production of wetland paddy rice wherever possible 7. Layout : All farm plots should form 1 contiguous land area wherever possible Agricultural considerations 8. Land availability: the area of land available for cultiv ation, preferably contiguous areas 9. Roads or other transportation infrastructure must be sufficiently accessible to ensure access to markets and other support services. Access 10. Access to the reservoir, drawdown zone, forest and grazing areas should be convenient. All these factors are investigated and considered thru the village consultation process (see Chapter 4), and the participation of affected villages has and continues to be an underlying theme of the resettlement area selection process. 19.3.1 Traditional Village Boundaries Initial assessments of village boundaries indicate th at it will be possible to relocate the majority of households within their existing village and administrative boundaries. For those relocating into the current boundaries of other villages, they are fa miliar with the proposed resettlement sites. Two classifications exist with regard to the administrative and political st atus of the existing villages on the Plateau. Administrative villages are those with ov er 50 households. These are formally recognized as villages with defined boundaries and a ssociated responsibilities and obligations to the re spective district in which they lie. Figure 19-2 shows these existi ng village boundaries, as assessed in 1997. The second type concerns hamlets, which tend to be small and sca ttered throughout the village boundary of the major administratively recogn ized village in which they occur. Of ten these hamlets form either (a) when villagers have moved into th e boundary area from elsewhere an d have requested permission of the resident administratively-recognized village headmen to establish their households, (b) families of a village decide to establish dwelling closer to their (newly opene d, or shifting) agricultural fields, or when villages split and a number of families relocate due to a shortage of land or resources in a particular area. Traditional village territories tend to follow natural features of the la ndscape, and may correspond to the customary land use patterns of the villagers. In a ddition, these boundaries often have a cosmological dimension. Many villages have guardian spirits ( phi muang ) whose territory corresponds to the traditional boundaries for larger, more established villages. Othe r villages or hamlets that are established later are included within these spirit boundaries. However, traditional village boundaries are, especially on the plateau, somewhat dynamic, reflecting the change on village locations and establishment of new villages over the last 20 to 30 years. The following Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 3describes the existing village boundaries in the Rese ttlement Area, and the way that other villages may be accommodated in these areas. Ban Thalang village boundaries This village had no clear border in 1998 as it is a rel atively new immigrant village. Previously the area was part of the administrative area of the Ban Nakai Tai. The boundary to the north is generally recognized as the Nam Theun, although the villages of Sop Hia an d Ban Nam Nian also utiliz e this northern area for swidden cultivation. \u0099 Ban Talang will be relocated within its current v illage boundaries. Some villagers of Bna Sop Hia, and the village of Ban Sophene will move into this area Ban Nong Boua Kham boundaries : This is also a new immigrant v illage without clear boundaries. \u0099 Ban Nong BouaKham will be relocated within its cu rrent village boundaries. Some villagers of Ban Sop Ma will move into this area Ban Nakai Tai village boundaries The southern boundary of Ban Nakai Tai borders with Ban Nakai Neua. It follows the Huoui Nakai west to the Sayphou Ak Range and the tributary of the Huou i Paduk. The western edge is the escarpment to the Nam Malou, to the Nam Gnalong, and then to th e Nam Theun. From here the boundary is the Nam Theun upstream to Ban Thalang. The eastern boundary is along the Nam Theun from Ban Thalang to the track which leads to Ban Sop Phene. Ban Nakai Neua village boundaries The northern border of Ban Nakai Neua is Ban Nakai Tai along the Huoui Nakai to the boundary of Ban Sop On. In the south, the border is the tributary of the Huoui Hai up to the Range and over to the Huoui Paduk. The western boundary borders Ban Van Giem along a ridgeline going north to the Huoui Paduk. The village of Ban Nakai Neua is on e of the largest villages in the pr oposed Resettlement Area. This village contains 67 families and 303 inhabitants and is centered near the old district headquarters at Nakai Kang. \u0099 Ban Nakai Neua and Naki Tai will be relocated with in their current village boundaries, and no other villagers will be relocated into th ese current village boundaries. Ban Boua Ma village boundaries This village is bordered in the north by Ban Nong Boua , and the boundary is determined by Huoui Samkha and the Huoui Arak towards the watershed of the Huoui Khuang. The south is bordered by Gnommalat District and the Nam Ka thang Gnai towards Nam Nong Boua Nyai and to the Nam Theun. The eastern boundary is Ban Phonsavang on the Nam Theun from the Huoui Arak to the Nong Tai Khuang pond. The western boundary is Ban Oudomsouk and the Huoui Ta Bot and Nam Kathang Gnai, which commences from the watershed of the Huoui Khwang to Huoui Ta Bot until the tributary of the Huoui Kathang. \u0099 Ban Bouma will be relocated within its current v illage boundaries, and no other villagers will be relocated into these current village boundaries, except that some families from Keng Yao and Sopma hamlets may join the families of Bouma in its new village site. Ban Sop On village boundaries The northern boundary is Ba n Sop Ma and Ban Phonsavang. The boun dary runs from the Na Hao hill to Nong Tai Khuang pond, across the Nam Theun and the feeder road to Ban Nong Boua across Nam Theun to Nong Phong towards the farming areas. It follows across the Khok Kwang and road to Huoui Tao and the Nam Kathang. The southern boundary is with Ban Done, which commences from the tributary of the Huoui Chicho (which drains into th e Nam Theun) and then to the Sayphou Ak Range to the Nam On and along the Nam On to the tributary of the Huoui Swing, along the Huoui Swing and finally to the road to the Nam Kathang Gnai. The eastern border is with Ban Ka Oy commencing from the Phu Hao southward along the Huoui Xang Tay, Huoui Tong and to the tributary of the Huoui Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 4Chicho. Gnommalat District form s the western boundary where the Nam Kathang Gnai is the border. The boundary starts from the tributary of the Huoui Tao and follows the Huoui Kathang to Ban Done. \u0099 Ban SopOn will be relocated within its current village boundaries. Bna Phonsvang, and possibly some families from Ban Kaoy, will be relocate d into these current village boundaries. Ban Done village boundaries In the north, Ban Done is bordered by Ban Sop On, with the Nam Swing as the border from the Huoui Swing to the Nam On. The boundary follows along the Huoui Swing across the feeder road to the Nam Kathang Gnai. The opposite side of the Nam On is the boundary from the tributary of the Huoui Ta Long to the Sayphou Xoy Range towards the Huoui Yai where it drains to the Huoui Mun Tun. The eastern boundary is Ban Ka Oy from the Huoui Mum Tun to the old road towards the watershed of the Huoui Kheng Sun that drains to the Nam On until it reaches the Huoui Khone Khen. The border to the south is from the tributary of the Huoui Khone Khen to the feeder road Huoui Lao Yai and into the Nam Kathang Gnai. The western boundary is from the Huoui Lao Yai to the Nam Kathang towards the track to Ban Gnommalat Neua across the Nam Kathang Gnai. Ban Khone Khen village boundaries The village is bordered in the north by Ban Done wi th the Huoui Khone Khen as the border from tributary of Huoui Kathang Gnai and the Huou Yai which to the Huoui Khone Khen towards the Nam Theun. From here the boundary runs on the opposite side of the Nam Theun along the Huoui Mun Turn. In the south the boundary is th e Gnommalat District, with the border on the Huoui Leak and then from the watershed of the Huoui Leak to the Nam on. The eastern boundary is the tributary of the Huoui Leak and Nam on and then to the watershed of the Huoui Theun. The western boundary is Gnommalat District (Sayphou Xoy Range) with the Nam Kathang Gnai as the border. \u0099 The villages of Ban Done and Ban Khon Khen will both be relocated within their current village boundaries, and no other village will be relocate d there, although they ma y be joined by some families from Ban Kaoy. These above village boundaries were described by the villagers themselves and correspond to a combination of administrative, customary land-use and sp iritual boundaries. It shou ld be noted that some areas of the Plateau which are not iden tified as belonging to a particular village, although villagers do make use of them for hunting, fishing, harvesting NTFPs, and for grazing. In summary, nine of the seventeen villages will be moved relatively sh ort distances and within cultural, land-use and administrative boundaries. Another six villages will be relocated within these boundaries, while two village Sop Hia and Nam Nian, will be relocate d back close to their original areas in Khamkerd District. Prior to and after relocation, new village boundaries ar e require to be negotiated, as described in Section 19.8 on FLUPAM.

The vast majority converse in Lao, share cosmological be liefs and a common livelihoo d system. Indeed, many plateau inhabitants, especially the Tai Bo, describe themselves as 'Tai Nakai', meaning 'ethnic group of the Nakai Plateau'. The Brou and Bo populations have co-existed in the region for hundreds of years and intermarriage is common. Therefore, one should consid er that any relocation within the Plateau, even if they are outside traditional village boundaries, as bein g within the general cultural and cosmological system of reference. Thus, such relocation is not a threat to traditional ways of thinking or an introduction of new cultural beliefs. There are historical instances of movement within the plateau area with existing villages splitting, satellite hamlets developing and smaller communities joining. Some examples of this historical splitting and consolidation of plateau villages are described un der Village Consolidation in Section 19.3.5. 19.3.3 Cultural Preferences and Resource Access When the idea of relocation was presented to affect ed villagers during the pa rticipatory consultative process, their first reactions were mainly positive. Most welcomed the potential for improved lifestyles and new livelihood options given the poor economic situation on the Plateau. Their main concern was food security, but this did not mean, nor has it ever me ant, self-sufficiency in rice. The communities are accustomed to exchanging forest products, fish and livestock for rice or workin g for others to make up deficiencies in family food needs. Hence, the potential for vegetable, fruit trees and livestock in their new livelihoods was a food security concept with whic h they were already fam iliar, given their existing practices. There are also instances in plateau co mmunities where paddy rice production has been developed, primarily the Brou villages to the southe ast (Don and Khon Kaen and the Bo villages of Ban Nakai Tai and Ban Nakai Neua. As regards production forestry, the plateau populations have experience in at least two types; (a) the forest plantation owned and managed by BPKP near Ban Oudomsouk (now defunct) where some of the nearby v illagers have worked, and (b) the various logging activities over the last ten years, in which some villagers have participated in, in various capacities. Many villagers are now interest ed in the prospect of working on community commercial forestry activities, particularly as it held the promise of a stable cash income. Villagers are aware that the GOL pr efers that they stop practicing pi oneering swidden in new areas of forest and try to develop sedentary farming practi ces. Although they are more familiar with swidden agriculture, most expressed a willingn ess to adopt stabilised agricultural activities. However they were also keenly aware that their new lifestyles would have a number of unfamiliar aspects for which they would require training. 19.3.4 Assessment of Villager Preferences in 1998 Villager preferences for the plateau relocation sites have been previo usly assessed on two occasions. The first, in the dry season of 1997/78, identified the gene ral area where they would pr efer to be resettled. In the second assessment, conducted in 2003 more specific sites were iden tified within the broader area selected earlier. The results of these two participator y assessments, along with the relocation distances and boundary changes that they would incur, are presented in Table 19-2 and the latest indicative resettlement site shown in Figure 19-2. The third assessment will be made during the rather protracted FLUPAM process (see Section 19.8) Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 8Table 19-2: Summary of Consultations on Vi llager Preferences for Relocation Sites.

Such village consolidation will facilit ate the provision of improved infr astructure and services, and with the proper support as planned under the SDP, will allow stronger and more cohesive communities to develop, with the capacity to manage and improve their own livelihoods in a cooperative and sustainable manner. Existing village structures will be maintained , and the cultural traditions of villagers will be Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 9respected during any consolidation process that may be required. The following consolidations are likely to occur: 1. The hamlets of Nongboua, Sailom and Pamonton ar e an unstable village group that has changed composition and location several ti mes over the past 10 years. Origina lly, a number of families left the large village of Bouma, a mixed Bo and Brou village , to establish a new village called Sailom. This later split into different hamlet s in the 1990s. In 2001, Pamonton ceased to exist as its inhabitants joined the other two hamlets. The Pilot Village involves the re location of the remaining two hamlets into one new village, called Nongboua Mai ('mai' meaning new). In establishing this 'consolidated' village, there have been no problems regarding ethnicity since both Bo and Brou families have been living together for some time, and are originally from the same village . Villagers themselves agreed to this arrangement during detailed consultations held in 2002-03. In addi tion, the site of relocation is within traditional territory and within the spirit boundaries of Bouma village, the village of origin of these hamlets. 2. The villages of Keng Ngao, Hat Khamphene and Sop Ma are all small hamlets, located on the left bank of the Nam Theun upstream fr om Ban Talang. They form one administrative village unit with a single leadership structur e. The first village is a predominantly Brou village while the latter two have majority Bo populations. All three settlements are fairly new, being formed as offshoots from Ban Bouma but a number of Brou households joined these settlements from Ban Teng and Ban Thaphaiban in the NT2 Watershed area. There are two proposed sites for the three settlements since none are more than 30 households. No problems regarding ethnicity is envisaged since both Bo and Brou families have been living together for some time, and the village units are already functioning administratively as one village. Pro posed relocation is outs ide traditional boundaries but within familiar territory with the same neighbouring villages. 3. The village of Ka-Oy to the north of the proposed reservoir and on the Nam Theun is a traditional Brou village. There are cl ose ties with the neighbouring village s on the Nakai Plateau, intermarriage and trade agreements, especially with Ban Done, Khone Khen and Ban Sop On. There has also been a history of migration up and down the Nam Theun in search of suitable sites for swidden and to avoid flooding and pests. Villagers in Ka-Oy look upon the other Brou and Bo villages as relatives ( phii nong ) and should not have a problem integrating with regards to ethnicity. Special efforts should be made to ensure that a consensus is reached in an equitabl e manner and that the village moves as a whole unit, or at least following clan lines. 4. The village of Phonesavang is a Brou village that has been formed by households from Sop On to the southeast and by new arrivals from the NT 2 Waters hed Area. Many of these villages are related but a number of families have connections to villages to th e north in the Watershed. The latter are relatively new arrivals. The proposed integration into the new site for Sop On should not create problems for ethnicity as long as traditional clans and kinship or ganisation are respected in the village layout. If necessary, there is also the op tion of relocating Ban Phonesavang on a separate site. 5. The Tai populations in the villages of Sop Hia and Nam Nian in Bolikhamxai Province are a special case since most are recent arrivals (within the la st 10 years) from Khamkeut District and surrounding areas. These villages have located beside existing Vietic groups and have adapted to swidden farming and gathering of NTFPs. This was an economic migration caused in part by a shortage of land in their original village sites and in part by the opportunity to exploit an area relatively rich in natural resources and with a low population. The relocation of the Tai-speaking groups to a site in Bolikhamxai would be to return them to familiar territory, of the same ethnic group, but with support for developing sustainable livelihood systems. The various Tai grou ps speak different dialec ts and are divided into clans but there is considerable intermarriage and shared values. 19.4 T ECHNICAL SITE INVESTIGATIONS 19.4.1 Specific Site Selection Criteria and Site Carrying Capacity Following the consensus amongst plateau villages th at the main resettlement zone should be on the southern shore of the Nakai Reservoir, the Pr ime Ministerial Decree 193/PM was enacted on 29th Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 10December 29, 2000 to legally establish the entire plateau area southeast of the reservoir as the Resettlement Area, and defined its boundaries and legal st atus. The decree require d that more detailed studies would be required to establish the exac t location of specific resettlement sites. During consultations undertaken between 2001 and 2003, leaders of plateau vill ages then went on to further clarify the exact prefe rred location of the resettled village (see Figure 19-2). Notwithstanding the fact that total v illage consensus will first be sought, rather than just villager leaders, for relocation site preference, a range of technical st udies or other considerations must also be undertaken to confirm the resources, the developm ent potential and the suit ability of each site, be fore detailed village layout planning can be undertaken. At least three types of technical studies are will required to precisely locate the resettlement village site s and farm plot areas (see Sections 19.4.2 to 19.4.4) based on the three main technical considerations for re settlement site selection and suitabilit y assessment - topographic, soils and irrigability, which are part of th e larger considerations of agricultur al potential, social considerations and resource endowments and location (see Table 19-1). On the basis of the above criteria, potential resettlement sites should be located on the reservoir shoreline, with access to irrigation water, and the drawdown zone. Access to grazing and forest lands is also important. Most of the land should have slopes less than 15 percent, suitable for village sites and the establishment of individual farm plots. Many of the potential resettlement area s meet these criteria, and also fall within existing village customary use areas (see Figure 19-2). The existing land use in the resettlement area is indicated in two maps, a inte rpretation based on year 2000 Spot imagery (Figure 19-3) and the more recent satellite photo compilation of QuickBird photos and Landsat images (Figure 19-4). The availability of land is of cour se a basic consideration. A minimum total resettlement area of 810 ha will required, based on approximately 1000 households each requiring a 0.66 ha flat or terraced farm plot, with an additional approximate requirement of 140 ha of land required for housing and associated village facilities (based on a house plot size of 30 x 30 m, or 0.09 ha, plus land for schools, markets village meeting hall and office etc). Beginning in 2003, the NTPC has s tarted to investigate the topogra phic, soil-type and irrigation considerations. The investigations could be seen a progressing through four (4) phases, as follows: (i) Reconnaissance; (ii) Conceptual planning; (iii) Detailed survey and feasibility assessment; and (iv) Detailed Design. A summary of these four phases, an d progress to date, for the three main technical considerations, is provided in Table 19-3 and described in more detail in the following sections. 19.4.2 Topography Resettlement village sites must en compass adequate areas of flat or gently sloping land for house construction and agricultural land development. These areas must also be largely contiguous to enable the development of irrigation systems an d associated structures. Slopes must be less than 15 percent for effective development of terraced farm land. Steepe r slopes would require the movement of excessive amounts of top soil (to create terraces), uncovering infertile sub-soil horizons or even underlying parent material in the shallow surface soils that predominate in the area. In addition, the risk of soil erosion, particularly in the early years of terrace developm ent before contour hedgerows are fully established, increases with steeper slopes. Soil erosion is a particular risk, given the erodable nature of the sandy loams and loamy sands common in the area. In addition to the presence of sufficient areas of appr opriate land for the village site and farm plots, at least one point of sufficiently high elevation to site a header tank providing adequate head for gravity irrigation will be required in close proximity to the agricultural land area. Topographical considerations will also be important in designing the layout of irrigation water distribution systems.

A deta iled topographic survey will be undertaken at each of the chosen resettlement sites, following the reconnaissance soil survey. The data collected during the survey, will be used to produce topographical maps at a scale of 1:2,000 with 0.5 m contour intervals. The topographical maps produced will be used to identify housing sites, and will also be the basis for the layout, and later titling, of the individual farm plot s. The completed maps will also be used for village layout and infrastructure planning including the locati on of roads, houses, community structures and areas for future growth, for planning the soil survey and for the detailed design of the water supply systems both agricultural and domestic. 19.4.3 Soil Survey and Suitability Soil surveys are required to (a) identify any areas with significantly better soils than those areas currently identified by a combination of villager preference, topography and closeness to reservoir waters, and (b) provide a better understanding of soil quality and constraints of selected resettlement sites. The aim is to reduce the level of risk associated due to poor phys ical and nutrient condition of the soil types which predominate in all the resettlement sites. Soil surveys will begin with an initial reconnaissance surv ey covering all land identified as generally suitable for agriculture based on topography and irrigation potential. The intention here is to identify any soil types with particular promise for agriculture or any particul arly poor soils unsuited to agricultural production. This survey will be transect-based and somewhat broad, based on a few main parameters (texture, colour, pH, N, P, CEC, for example). Existing or earlier forest types may be assessed prior to the survey as an aid to defining appropriate transect lines to ensure that potentially promising soil types are not missed, as natural forest cover is determined to a large extent by soil moisture regime and soil type and thus may be a valuable indicator of soil fertility. Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 12Following the reconnaissance survey, a detailed grid-bas ed soil survey may be undertaken. Survey results will be computerised and used in a GIS system, wher e they can be overlaid with topographical survey and other spatial data sets to assess land capability classes. Here again, the survey will be supported with soil chemical analysis for all soil types identified. Unlik e previous soil surveys, chemical analysis will be expanded to include lime requirement and soluble ferric iron. Lime requirement is essential for calculating inputs to ameliorate the high level of acidity in the major soil types and soluble ferric iron levels. This is essential to assess the potential risk of iron toxici ty in paddy rice to which the commonly occurring Ferric Acrisols found in the area are prone. The second and more detailed survey will thus include: \u0083 Soil survey of the potential resett lement sites at a scale of 1:5,000 \u0083 Preparation of maps at a scale of 1:5, 000 for soils, land use and land capability \u0083 Prepare of a soils report incorporating the findin gs of the survey includin g physical and chemical characteristics The grid survey method will require up to 120 observ ations per square kilometre, to be used with additional observations on the physiographic correlation of the soils, and some additional detailed observations at designated intervals. The physiograph ic survey is used to provide for more exact soil boundaries. Aerial photo interpretation (API) may be used in combination with topographic maps, traditional land use, forest cover and geological maps as a means of finalizing the soil boundaries after completion of the fieldwork. Such a detailed soil su rvey will take time and re quire significant manpower requirements and will therefore begin in late 2004, immediately following the topographic surveys. 19.4.4 Water Supply and Irrigation Potential All resettlement sites will be provided with water su pply systems for both domestic use and irrigation of the agricultural land. The water so urces, types and designs of individu al systems will vary according to local topography, distance from the reservoir, groundwa ter-quality, water-table ty pes and depths, and the resettled village population. Domestic supply will be of adequa te quality and quantity to serve the needs of all households. In some cases it may be common to the irrigation supply system, with or without additional treatment. In other cases, however, domestic and irrig ation water systems will be separ ate. Domestic water supply systems that might be considered include rainwater storage, bore holes, li ned dug wells, impoundment of small streams, and reservoir-water with or without treatment depending on water quality. Water sources and supply systems for domestic purposes will be assesse d for each site, and, where required, groundwater surveys will be conducted. The assessment, planning and conceptual design of irrigation systems will be based on access to year round water from the reservoir, which is dependent on local topography and slop e. Systems will comprise intakes, pump-stations, supply lines, header-tanks, dist ribution systems and on farm irrigation structures. The potential options currently under consideration for each of the system components, along with design considerations are presented in Table 19-4. The above system components and design considerations were developed through a generalized reconnaissance design study in 2003 (s ee Chapter 22). This study asse ssed overall irrigation potential, feasibility of different sources and delivery system s and estimated approximate cost figures for each. Further site-specific studies for the most appropri ate farm plot locations identified by soil and topographical surveys are required to develop detailed irrigation plans. Making use of the aforementioned survey data, these studies will select the most appropriate type of sy stem, the necessary capacity, most suitable components, define specifications and approximate costs, for each of the resettlement sites. These conceptual design studies will begin in 2004, once the t opographical and soil survey data become available.

Detailed irrigation system planning w ill be dependent on the following: Accurate topographical data and maps from the completed topo-survey; Finalised farm-plot location and layout; and Finalised village residential site selection (for combined irrigation/domestic water systems). Detailed irrigation system designs will take into ac count the potential need for future expansion to accommodate anticipated population and/or IWR demand increases.

The Pilot Village has been carefully planned and im plemented and is already providing insights and lessons for the future resettlement process. The three hamlets of Ban Nong Boua, Ban Sailom and Ban Pamanton were selected for relocation as a Pilot Village based on the following: Villagers were positively inclined to wards moving as soon as possible; The hamlets were relatively small and had much to gain from resettlement; The re-location distances involved were generally less than one kilometre; The hamlets contain both Brou and Bo ethnic groups, and would thus provide valuable lessons for future village consolidation; The total number of households involved was 30, which was considered sufficient to be representative of future relocations, but small enough to be manageable as a pilot; Existing houses and conditions were generally of very poor quality; and The potential for developing irrigation based on a small reservoir on the Malai creek. Planning for the establishment and relocation to the Pilot Village comme nced in 2000 and actual relocation began in early 2002. Planning involved: In depth consultations with the 30 households involved; Participatory preparation of v illage layout plans and options; Soil survey Topographic surveys and design of field and house layouts; Preliminary design of infrastructure works; and Detailed design of the irrigation systems. Detail consultations were carried out with villagers from the three hamlets regarding site selection, village and farm-plot layout and the location of individual househol ds. Following site selection, El 538 was marked off with fencing an d land was cleared in April 2002. Identifi cation of potential land for irrigation and system requirements was carried ou t in the second half of 2002. An ac cess road to the relocation site was completed and facilities for te chnical staff were constructed in late 2002. The RMU supervised planning and relocation activities with the assistance of the RO, technical specialists from the demonstration farm at Theun Duane and Ban Nakai Neua Nursery staff. The villagers first cropped their agricultural lands in the 2002 wet season, and three houses constructed at that time. Most houses were constructed in late 2002 and 2003. Appendix J provides a detailed overview of the establishment of the Pilot Village and its present status. Valuable experience has been gained from Pilot Village relocation, and has been used to modify future plans for the main resettlement process. Ongoing de velopment and support is being provided, and further lessons are expected to be generated. Th e major lessons learned to date include: The topographical survey data were not sufficiently detailed for planning purposes. As a result, topo-survey plans for the remaining areas have now been changed to a scale of 1:2,000 with 0.5m contour intervals. Soil surveys were not implemented on a grid system, and thus results difficult to interpret and use. The original plans that each family would be given 0.15 ha area of paddy separate from the main farm plot was found not to be workable, nor want ed by villagers. As a result, the 0.15 paddy land entitlement and the 0.5 ha of agricultural land en titlement, will be combined to a 0.65 ha irrigated Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 17agricultural land entitlement, and villages will develop and plant paddy rice were and when they consider it feasible, but most likely on the lower terraces of the farm plot. The original plan of constructing the family house on the farm plot was not acceptable to villagers, who wanted to reside together as a 'nuclea r' village in close proximity to each other. The consolidation of disparate villages from different ethnic groups into a single community has not posed any problems. The various groups are living together in harmony and inter-marriage continues to take place. Planning and constructing the irrigation system highlighted a number of technical and local constructor capacity problems. It emphasized the need for thorough surveys prior to design, for a thorough design process of all components, and the need to strengthen the technical screening and selection of contractors. 19.6 SCHEDULE OF VILLAGE RELOCATION It is intended to move all village s to their respective resettlement si tes in an orderly manner with the minimum level of stress and social upheaval in the affected populations. The re location schedule will be carefully developed, to ensure all villages are reloca ted in an orderly manner, and before any impacts are experienced in their existing location s. Existing villages will be affected by flooding at different times, as first the coffer dam (at 524 ESL) and then the main re servoir fills. Those (slightly lower) villages that will be affected by backwater flooding due to the coffer dam will need to be moved first, followed by those that will be affected first by reservoir inundation . The impact of flooding is obviously dependent on elevation, thus those villages at higher elevations, those very close to new resettlement areas (on the edge of the plateau) will be moved last. Table 19-5: Indicative Relocation Schedule of Plateau Villages with Predicted Number of Households, House Plots and Agriculture Area at Time of Relocation.

Thus, the plan to relocate villages over 5 years - although with an intense main period of three (3) years - is based on the ability to have as many facilities and livelihood options as possible in place, and operational, prior to actual relocation, and to allow sufficient time and resources for an orderly move. Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 18 As access to water for domestic and irrigation purposes will, for most resettlement sites, be dependent on reservoir inundation, relocation will be delayed as long as possible. Resettlement sites with an opportunity for non-reservoir-based irrigation (e.g. Nong Boua an d Bouma villages) may be moved first. However, it will be unavoidable that some villages will be relocated up to 3 years before water from the reservoir is available. In these instances, livelihood activities that are not dependent on reservoir waters will be given priority and emphasis. The indicative schedule for relocation as indicated in Table 19-5 will continue to be revised up until the actual time of relocation. 19.7 VILLAGE LAYOUT 19.7.1 Village Layout Preferences of Affected Communities PCPP meetings were held in the affected villages on the Nakai Plat eau by NTEC consultants and GOL officials in 1997 and 1998. These participatory cons ultations were aimed at fully ensuring active community involvement in planning, improving villager understanding of how the Project would affect their lives, and obtaining local perspectives on resettlement. Participatory mapping techniques based on individual aspirations and community 'visions' for livelihood systems and quality of life were used in these consultations. Table 19-6 summarizes the results of the participatory mapping exercises which culminated in sketching 'dream' maps of the resettlement area s, along with key attributes of the new villages.

A similar participatory planning proc ess has already been used for the design of the Pilot Village. Here again, a major design feature desired by the resettled households was that villages houses should be grouped together, separate from the farm plots. This is reflected in the Pilot Village resettled households' choice of Layout 2 from the two proposed layouts, Figure 19-5and Figure 19-6. 19.7.2 Detailed Village Layout Planning A consultative and participatory appr oach will continue to be taken in the planning of village layouts to ensure that local preference s are incorporated, and to allow for fl exibility among different resettlement villages. The process will consist of two main steps: (i) the development of village layout options through participatory planning for each resettlement village; and (ii) the preparation of technical plans for the desired layout. The first step is entirely participatory and based largely on villager ideas and preferences (with facilitation from RO and RMU staff). These pro posed village layouts will be over -laid on the new topographic maps (at 1:2,000 to 1:5,000 scale), along with information on so ils, water supplies, etc. to check their technical feasibility. This will generate detailed technical pl ans which will be re-presented and discussed with villagers for feedback, modification and final approval. The development of alternative village layout option s will be an iterative process. As new ideas and options are received from one rese ttlement community, they will be adde d to the growing 'inventory' of options that can then be presented to and discussed wi th other villages during th e planning process. The participatory nature of planning w ill be facilitated by simple approach es. Maps and aerial photographs will be used to aid participatory analysis at two levels, firs tly, the village position and its relationship with farm- plots and other resources such as the reservoir, grazing land and villa ge-use forests, and secondly, the location of houses, roads and infrastr ucture within the village itself. Scale 3-D models may also be used to place specific features - houses, schools, farm plots, forest, etc. - to enable villagers to explore different options and comb inations in a visual, easily understood and realistic format.

Prime Ministerial Decrees 37 of 12/4/04 then specifies in article 4.1 that ' The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is entrusted in collaboration with the Provincial Go vernor, local administrative authorities, the department for national land planning and development and the Resettlement Committee for the determination of the boundary of the land areas and categories of land uses such as the area on which new villages will be established, the area for agricultural production activities, the forest land ar ea for a sustainable forestry business activities, the ar ea for construction and expan sion of Nakai District for the future , consistent with the actual local conditions'. Recent discussions on this directive have resulted in the agreement that villagers should also be incorporated in the land and forest use planning exercise, and indeed this is consistent with the widely accepted FLUPAM process. This issue, along with th e need to ensure (a) that the land and forest use planning in the resettlement areas takes the resettlers needs as the primary objective, and (b) to ensure that land acquisition and use is managed (not just planned), will be addresse d by the enactment of a Provincial Governors Directive (in December 2004) to ensure the managed and a ppropriate planning, delineation and distribution of land and resources in the Resettlement Area (see Chapter 3). The ultimate objective will be to have a Land and Fo rest use management plan for the entire Resettlement Area, which would include zonation in to major use categories which may include; urban areas (especially around Nakai District centre); village areas; industrial areas; tourism areas; rural and permanent agriculture areas; and forestry areas, etc However, such a total Resettlement Area planning shou ld ideally be a product of a participatory panning process, the main component of which would be the forest and land use planning of each resettlement village, as described below. 19.8.1 Forest and Land Use Planning, Allocation and Management Forest and Land Use Planning, Allocation and Management (FLUPAM) is a process of participatory resource management planning, aimed at ensuring equitable access to forest and land resources and providing the basis for their sustainable management by local communities. The process was initiated some years ago in the Lao PDR, and has seen evolution and improvement to the stage where clear and effective guidelines and process's are now available. However, FLUPAM objectives, and also the guidelines and processes for its implementation, must be adapted to the particular situation, and the resettlement of villages on the Nakai Plateau is such a particular situation. In the case of the Nakai plateau Resettlement Area, the major objectives of FLUPAM will be; \u0083 to develop appropriate and balanced forest and land use zonation, with a view to sustainable management systems and productive land use in order to achieve sustainable and integrated resettler livelihoods; \u0083 to ensure equitable access to fo rest and land resources for all resettler community members, and formalizing land use rights within the existing legal framework. \u0083 to develop a partnership between villages and the Go vernment for the joint ma nagement of forests, agriculture land, other lands and the reservoir. Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 23Although NTRA-FLUPAM will employ many of the methods and tools which are common to standard LUP procedures, the process has been modified in a ma ny key areas to make it more appropriate for use in Resettlement Area. \u0099 It will have to be closely scheduled with the whol e resettlement program an d with the timing that the various livelihoods will be able to be initiated and developed; \u0099 Land allocation will be not be init ially provided as temp orary certificates, but rather perm anent land titles (to housing and agricultural land ) and perman ent use certificates to the rest of the land, to be provided within one year afte r relocation, or establishment of the agricultural lands; \u0099 Rather than working in one village at a time, it w ill be conducted simultaneously for all the villages, or at least in two groups of north western and so uth eastern villages. The fact that the community networks have already being promoted over many years already, will facilitate this process; \u0099 Swidden cultivation will not be co ntemplated in the Resettlement Area, as all agriculture will be sedentary and managed. Thus, monitoring of agricu ltural land use over time will be much more manageable (in comparison to areas where shifting cultivation is a feature); \u0099 Unlike other areas, the forests will be intensiv ely surveyed and managed, this facilitating (a) planning of forest use and (b) monitoring of forest use; \u0099 While NTFP and other forest products will be alloca ted to each village mana gement and utilization, the commercial timber resource will be managed jointl y by all the villages, as one production forest; \u0099 A significant portion of the Rese ttlement Area, around 6,000 ha or more, is currently degraded forest, and decisions as to how to develop or ma nage this area - for forest regeneration, for development for agriculture or grazing, or a mixture of these, can only be made over a long period of time as the productive potential of these areas and livelihoods is further tested and understood. \u0099 Most (not all) of the RA is currently divided unde r the responsibilities of 9 villages - which will also be relocated into their own area villages - and the ar ea of these villages will have to be subdivided to make room for 6 other villages reloca ting into the area from the othe r side of the plateau. Thus, the current boundaries will have to be modified and new and land use arrangement will have to be renegotiated; \u0099 The village settlement (housing) zones will be the su bject of detail urban planning, except in this case village participation will be an in tegral part of the urban planning; \u0099 The planning of the irrigated ag riculture zones areas will also be the subject of detail design; \u0099 The livelihoods of the villages - to which the forest , land and reservoir use planning is inextricably linked - are not their current livelihoods but the ra nge of new (if not similar livelihoods) some of which are unknown in terms of productivity, and all of which will be progressively developed at different times, over the next 6 years. Thus, the NTRA-FLUPAM will have to be both; (i) timely , in that the Project construction and relocation program musty follow certain timelines and (ii) flexible , to accommodate both (a) the progressively initiating and then development of each of the livelihood options livelihoods - and (b) the change in the physical characteristics of the area with the inundation of the reservoir 3.5 years into the program, and the operation of the reservoir 5 years into the program. Thus, the NTRA-FLUPAM will be a phased but iterativ e process which proceeds through various stages, some run simultaneously in each v illage with technical studies and li velihood development planning. While the exact processes and steps will be improved and modified over time , Table 19-7 provides a preliminary definition of the progressive implementation of FLUPAM in the Resettlement Area.

On-going FLUPAM Following the zonation and allocation of the drawdown zone and reservoir areas, FLUPAM will be undertaken on a cyclical basis, probable every 3 years The aim is to (a) revise the macro level zonation and allocation to competitive uses, in accordance with the requirement so the livelihoods of the reseller's, and sustainable resource utilization and management (b) revise land and resource management arrangements and process's (b) ensure the equitable access to resource Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 27FLUPAM has a number of im portant attributes which w ill be adhered to in order to achieve its desired objectives. That is, FLUPAM must be e: Participatory: It involves villagers in every st ep of the process and encourages them to make their own decisions about livelihoods and sustainable natural resources management. Empowering: It strengthens community organisati on and capability and pr ovides villagers with the skills and tools to solve their own problems and make improved land and forest use and management decisions. Gender responsive: It promotes the active participation of women in all decisions regarding resource allocation and management and addresses the unique problems of women by the use of gender dis-aggregated discussion groups. Networking: It promotes inter-village cooper ation to solve resource use conflicts and creates linkages and networks between villages to facilitate mutual support and cooperation in both conservation and community development activities. Holistic: It focuses at the level of the en tire ecosystem, includ ing community livelihood systems, and addresses the key interactions between habitats and people. Interdisciplinary: It involves group tasks by teams comprising land use planners, foresters, agriculturists, gender specialists and distri ct officials who work with villagers in an interdisciplinary manner. Integrated: It links sustainable resource use and management with development in an integrated manner Stepwise: It follows a logical sequence and prov ides time for both villagers and officials to consider the outcomes and implications of each step in the process. Iterative, flexible: As villagers implement agreements an d adopt new resource management and livelihood practices, conditions change, new problems emerge and additional lessons are learned requiring that certain steps are repeated in the light of the changed circumstances. 19.8.2 Family and Village Livelihood planning Family and livelihood planning is a central feature of the resettlement program, and as such will be an integral part of NTRA-FLUPAM. Family level so cio-economic data already well known, and will be monitored continuously. In addition, the range of livelihood options will be both; (a) tested in pilot schemes; and (b) reviewed, both by specialists and buy the villagers themselves.- Such experience and review will lead to choices bein g made about the livelihood s mixes that a family may wish to adopt, and then the way that a village wishes to use, develop and manage its village territory of land, forest, drawdown zone and reservoir. Livelihoods in the drawdown zone will be dependant on the technical fe asibility of cropping, grazing or otherwise using the area, wh ich is influenced by; (a) the operation of the reservoir, and (b) the level of soil erosion or deposition in any particular. Livelihoods in the reservoir will be basically be defined by two issues. (a) the technical feasibility and productivity of fishing, and the need for fisheries management from an ecological perspective. (b) the decision as to where to manage and harvest the fisheries by (a) private (household) enterprise or (b) a cooperative business enterprise. Development of the livelihoods in the land of the Re settlement Area itself it self, however, is somewhat more difficult as (a) there are a range of options, (b) the relative productivity of the options is not known Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 28actuary, and (c) the villager adaptability and preferen ces for these options will change over time. These issues (b) and (c) will only be resolved progressively, over about 6 years. Basically, the challenge will be to match the resource av ailability in the site wi th the gradual development of livelihoods of the resettlers, and such balancin g will them lead to the required zonation. Thus, eventually, villagers must decide on the balance of the land (that land which is cu rrently degraded forests) will be used to be used for: agricultural land; grazing land; regenerating forest land; or other uses. A parallel choice which will have to be made is th e programs (and villagers) focus on intensive irrigated agriculture or the more extensive rain fed cropping using DMC systems. It should be noted however, that all three livelihoods are not mutually exclusive. For example, it may be possible for some, maybe many villages, to have separate area areas dedi cated to both irri gated and rainfed cropping systems. Silvo-pastoral systems may be de veloped whereby grazing and forestry are compatible. In addition, the establishment of grass swards for graz ing could be an integral part of the DMC systems. 19.8.3 Forest and Land Use and Urban Development Monitoring and Mapping Unlike most other development projec ts, the status of forests will be su rveyed and monitored in detail by the NPVFA and district forestry staff. They will delineate; production forest areas conservation forest areas (mainly the sloping areas) degraded forest areas - which will be the subject of on going trials to define the best use of these areas - which could be regeneration forest, DMC systems or grazing, or a combination of all three nature tourism areas which could be undertaken in the first 2 areas above The data of these areas is aided by the availability, over 60 % of the areas, of detailed satellite photos. Thus, monitoring and mapping is achieved by the parallel activities of (i) review and mapping from satellite photos and (ii) field/forest level verification. Also, unlike most other development projects, the status of the agricultural areas will be the subject of detailed topographic surveys and land allocation and irrigation development. The urban areas likewise w ill be the subject of detailed mapping, planning. This forest cover and land use mapping will be repe ated every 5 years, using both detailed forest and field surveys and satellite photos as the basis for monitoring land use changes and as a means of checking that village land use agreemen ts are being followed. On-going FLUPAM processes will then ensure particip atory review of the data (photos, maps etc,) in parallel to review of the socio-economic and liv elihood development. Based on these reviews, the zonations and land use plans and regulations may be amended, as required. 19.9 ACHIEVEMENT OF A 'GREEN LIGHT ' ON A RESETTLEMENT SITE The above sections review the soci al and technical considerations that will be taken into account in the process of deciding on (a) the resettlement site location, and (b) the land and forest use planning for that whole area allocated to each villages. These considerations (for resettlement site selection) can be summarised into a checklist of issues which must be finalised before a \"green-light\" can be given as confirmation of a particular resettlement site. Social green-light indictors Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 29(i) all villagers having visited the site; (ii) all villagers having being given te chnical information about the site; (iii) all villagers having agreed on the site; (iv) if in another villages territory, arrangements and agreements reached with that village; and (v) preliminary forest, land (and reservoir) use planning and allocation being undertaken w.r.t. the whole area allocated to the villages (and within boundaries agreed to by neighbouring villages. Technical green-light indicators (i) topographic studies complete, and showing sufficient land with slope less than 15 %; (ii) access to year round reservoir water confirmed an d costed, and appropriate location for a header tank defined; and (iii) soils as good as possible. 19.10 LAND AND RESOURCE TENURE IN THE NAKAI RESETTLEMENT AREA These zones, or similar, would be subject to review and revision over a set period of time, every 5 years, for example. Within, and between these zones, or areas of approved land use, ther e will be differing tenure arrangements depending largely on the type of ownership, such as: 1. land owned and managed by individual households, including (i) re settlement houses,(ii) farm plots, and (iii) privately owned land of existing households who are not to be resettled; 2. land owned and managed communally by individual resettlement v illages (for example, community infrastructure, public areas, sacred grounds, etc.); 3. land owned by the State, public land and build ings such as hospitals, schools, roads, etc 4. community commercial forest area s managed for the common benefit of all resettlement villages. The NT2 Project policy specifies that resettlers will be pr ovided with guaranteed la nd titles to their house and agricultural plots soon after they are relocated into the resettlement sites. In addition, it is intended to ensure that resettled communities ar e provided with communal rights to village use land areas, and that fair and equitable tenure and management arrangements are put in place for common property land and resources on the plateau. 19.10.1 Privately Owned Land Under Lao law, all land is the property of the national community, but all citizens have the right to use, transfer and inherit this land. The usual process of land registration involves an assessment of an individual's right to the land, and if successful in showing such right, the individual is issued with a land title, registered in a Land Register Book and Land Parcel Register Index specific to each village. In the case of the NT2 Project, the issuance of PM Decrees 193 and the register of eligib le households will provide for the 'assessment of an indi viduals right to the land'. Such titles can be inherited, sold and be the subject of a court order (known as permanent assignment). It may also be leased or mortgaged (indefinite assignment ). The land title provides the owner with security of tenure for that land but it does not specific the us es such land may be put to or classified as (for example agricultural or forestry land). In the NT2 Project, all resettlement housing and agriculture land will be issued a land title in acco rdance with the procedure based on the Ministerial Direction on Systemic Adjudication of Land Use Right No. 997/MOF, and in the name of both the husband and wife's of each individual households. An example of a Land Title Ce rtificate and an English translation are presented in Figure 19-7 and Figure 19-8.

Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 32However, due to the specific and unique nature of the NT2 relocation of mainly ethnic minorities, and in order to protect these villagers from unwise decisions, it is intended to enact a Resettlement Committee regulation to the en sure that the land titles issued to each resettler family are endorsed to the effect that they cannot sell the land (or title) until the end of the Resettlement Period (about 8 years), unless that resettler makes a claim to the Grievance Committee w ho may decide that they indeed have a valid and reasonable rationale for selling the land. Thus, while the basic procedures of land titling (sys tematic registration) in Lao PDR will be followed for the registration and issuance of land titles for all resettled families - in the name of both the husband and wife, and for both household and farm plots - some mo difications will be required to meet the somewhat unique needs of NT2 resettlement proces s. These are summarised in Table 19-8 . Table 19-8: Steps in the Land Titling Process for Plateau Resettled Villages Normal land titling process Modifications proposed under the RAP 1. Adjudication Team (AT) inspects the property Inspections will be phased acco rding to relocation schedules. Adjudication team will be provided with all relevant maps and assisted on-site by RMU staff. 2. AT reviews with the abutting neighbours regards the boundary - assume consensus. Representatives of rese ttlement households will have to be on-site during this process. 3. Survey team surveys the land (and installs 'posts') House and farm plot maps to be provided by RO/RMU. 4. AT calls for all documentary and historical evidence of land occupancy (15 yrs required) No historical evidence in the NT2 project, in which case PM Decree 193 effectively waivers the 15 yea rs occupancy requirement.. 5.

Title goes to Prov incial Land Office for approval and signing. As normal titling procedures, wi th the specification that an endorsement be given to protect resettlers. 19.10.2 Common Property Resources and Land in the Resettlement Area In regard to land use management and tenure of each resettlement village land and forest areas the forest areas surrounding each village, curre nt government policy emphasizes th e use of a well-established system of participatory land use planning (LUP) to identify, delineate and define uses for a variety of land use zones within customary village land use boundaries. The various zones recogn ized are as follows: 1. Village Settlement Land: Includes private houses, public buildings, roads, and so forth. 2. Village Agricultural Land: Includes cultivated land, and other intensive productive uses, such as fishponds, livestock and so on. 3. Village Conservation Forest : Strict controls are enforced, with few uses are allowed. 4. Village Protection Forest : Activities that contribute to soil erosion are prohibited, including the cutting of trees, and forest clearance, by NTFPs collection permitted. 5. Village Use or Production Forest: Cutting of timber permitted for domestic use, but timber will be extracted by the NPVFA, following a sustainable logging plan. Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 33In the NT2 Resettlement Area, the a bove zones and the participatory land use planning system will be adapted to define uses and management resp onsibilities for common property resources. Although village customary land use boundaries exist (Figure 19-2), the lo ss of much of these to reservoir inundation, the creation of new rese ttlement villages, and the consolidation of some former villages means that retaining them would result in a highly inequitable distribution of resources and management responsibilities. It is therefore proposed to use a modified LUP process where all resettlement villages would together address the issues of common property resource tenure and management, including forest areas, grazing land, the reservoir and other water resources. The aim is to develop appropriate management agreements for their use to ensure: an improved understanding in resettlement communities of the potential benefits and key management issues associate d with these resources; equitable and appropriate access to the resources for all resettlement communities; a fair division of tasks and responsibilities among communities for their sustainable and productive management; an equitable distribution of the benefits accruing from the use of the resources; and the development of appropriate management and conservation agreements for their sustained use. This significant LUP exercise are will need to be phas ed over the period of re settlement and beyond as villagers acclimatize to their new locations and as they adjust to different livelihoods, as commercial management plans are developed for forestry, an d as water is impounded in the reservoir. 19.11 BOLIKHAMXAY RESETTLEMENT VILLAGES The two northern villages of Sop Hia, located in Bo likhamxay Province and Na m Nian (located on the border of the Bolikhamxay and Khammouane Provinces) have compositions and histories that differ from the other villages on the Nakai Platea u. Some Sop Hia residents are Vietic people, indigenous to the area (Ahoe), others are Tai settlers rece ntly arrived from the Khamkeut District. Nam Nian village was established mainly as a roadside village and service ce ntre for logging trucks and consists mainly of Tai groups, originally from the Lak Sao area. 19.11.1 Choice of General Resettlement Area Discussions with villagers from So p Hia beginning in earl y 2002, revealed that th e Vietic households wanted to remain on the plateau and relocate resettlement areas 7-13, near Ban Thalang. The remaining Tai households preferred to relocate to the district s in Bolikhamxay from where they originated. Further discussions in early 2003 concluded that the Tai grou ps from Sop Hia and Nam Nian would relocate in Bolikhamxay Province and the Vietic groups from Sop Hia would relocate on the plateau. The results of the latest round of consultations with villagers are presented in Table 19-9. Table 19-9: Results of 8 June 2003 Consulta tions with Sop Hia and Nam Nian Villages Preferred Location by Number of Households Village Lak Sao Nakai Reservoir Elsewhere Sop Hia 21 32 4 Nam Nian 26 0 0 Totals 47 32 4 Given the fact that there are only 25 Vietic hous eholds, there are not enough to compose a new administrative unit. Hence, it was proposed to relocate them at a separate site, but close enough to share health and education facilities with Ban Talang. This s atisfies their desire to retain their original village composition, and at the same time, allows the necessary improvements in social and livelihood services to be provided. It should be pointed out that there are already Vietic groups in Talang (4 households) and that Sop Hia's swidden fields are located in Nakai Dist rict, which is familiar territory to them. The Vietic Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 34households from Sop Hia thus become part of the plateau resettlement process which has already been discussed in the preceding sections of this Chapter. In regard to relocating the Tai groups from Sop Hia and Nam Nian, district authorities along with RMU staff identified a suitable area near to their original village sites. The chos en site is in Khamkerd District of Bolikhamxay Province, close to Nam Pan village, whic h lies to the southeast of Lak Sao, the district centre. The site was chosen as there is good access to Road 8A, an availability of spare land, and potential for the construction of an irrigation system. However, unlike the plateau resettlement sites, there is a small recipient village, Nam Pan, established in 1975 by 17 families fr om the Nam Pheo area. It now has 35 families of the same ethnic groups as those to be resettled. Because currently, the Nam Pan community is so small, it is administratively part of another village, Chom Jeng, which is close to Lak Sao Town. Thus, while it was originally envisaged that resettlers from Sop Hia and Nam Nien would be relocated in a newly established village area, this new option allows them to combine with a similar ethnic group, making the new community large enough to be officially recognized in its own right and thus have its own administration, school, water supply and the like. Discussions have been held with Nam Pan villagers, w ho are generally receptive to the idea of accepting the resettled families from Sop Hia an d Nam Nian for a number of reasons: The proposed consolidation will allow the village to be officially recognized in its own right. Current families will benefit from the improved soci al services such as a school, dispensary, etc. Existing residents will also have access to irrigation water from the system to be constructed for the resettled households. Resettlers are of the same ethnic group an d are originally from the same area. A number of additional steps will be required to fina lize the proposed relocation agreement between the recipient and resettled communities. Firstly, a visit to Nam Pan by Sop Hia and Nam Nian residents will be organized to discuss the desirability of consolidati on and how best to achieve this. If agreement is reached, follow-up visits will be required to jointly explore possibilities for the location of housing and agricultural land. It is also planned to organize a series of extended visits by Sop Hia and Nam Hian representatives to undertake land use planning jointly with Nam Pan resi dents. This will allow both parties to jointly assess the land and forest resour ce base, its current uses and to develop new management plans to accommodate the resettled households into the area. Forest and Land Use Planning Allocation and Mana gement Land (FLUPAM) pro cedures will be used to extend the standard LUP process in two important dimensions. First, it will cater for the issuance of land use certificates to resettled (and exis ting) families for their house and farm -plots. Second it will be used to plan livelihood development activities in support of relocation, in a participatory manner. FLUPAM processes of resource management planning are aimed at ensuring equitable access to forest and land resources and providing the basis for their sustainable management by local communities, by: Stabilizing forest and land use patterns under a sustainable management system; Ensuring equitable access to forest and land re sources for all community members and formalizing land use rights within the existing legal framework; Establishing resource use and conservation co-management agreements with local communities; and Developing a partnership between villages an d government for the joint management of community development and conservation activities. Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 35As such, it is considered an extremely appropriate t ool for use in preparing both recipient and resettled communities for the proposed relocation and consolidation. 19.11.2 Detailed Site Investigation Detailed site investigations in the proposed Nam Pa n resettlement site will proceed largely as those described for plateau resettlement sites in Section 19.10, but with a few important differences: The social requirements of consolidating two resett lement and one recipient village into a single harmonious ethnic Tai community. An assessment of existing infrastructure and services and the preliminary identification of what is needed or what will be upgrad ed in the relocation site. Consideration of existing land-use and in the specific resettlement site and customary tenure issues in order to determine the need for compensation in the host community. Resettlers at in Nam Pan will not have the same opport unities as those who are re settled adjacent to the Nakai Reservoir. They will not have: Access to reservoir fisheries resources; Access to the Nakai Plateau Villa ge Forestry Association; nor The employment opportunities created both during and after construction of the hydropower project. These differences will be fully assesse d and adequate provisions will be ma de to ensure a fair and equitable entitlement package. For example, as the plateau resettle rs are to be provided with a 0.66 ha irrigated farm plot, it is proposed that Nam Pan resettlers be provided with a larger 1.5-ha plot, to compensate for their inability to participate in the fish eries and forestry income generating activities. A fuller comparison of potential entitlements is described in Table 19-10.

NTFPs 20 75 Total 1,302 1,330 Note: For 50 households and a 1.5-ha plot, a net irrigation area of 75ha is required. Allow a 10% increase for land lost by tra ck and canal right-of-way, plot berms, gullies etc. A 82.5-ha gross scheme area is required to be established. The Khamkerd District officials proposed two possi ble areas for village and irrigation development: 1. Houay Sot Irrigation Scheme: BPKP has prepared drawings and a design report for 63-ha scheme; and Chapter 19: Resettlement Site Selectio n, Land Use Planning and Land Tenure November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 362. Nam Pan Irrigation Scheme: Khamkerd DAFO have prepared a preliminary assessment report and commenced a topographical survey. The Houay Sot scheme was in invest igated and considered infeasible. The potential irrigated agriculture area is only 63-ha, and two earth dams are required to be constricted to service this areas. Thus, at an estimated total development cots of US $454,000 (US $7,208 per hectare), th is option is fa r too expensive. It is also near a river in an area subject to flash floods which would cause wet season damage, while the river has low dry season flows. The Nam Pan Irrigation Scheme The DAFO report shows an earth dam 780-m long an d 28.7-m high. A high spillway and main canal intake structure will be required. A less expensive option is required. The Consultant has identified an irrigation area of around 150 ha . The revised proposal includes: \u0083 Irrigate below the 530 masl. contour. \u0083 The cropping pattern is wet season rice and dry season vegetable and field crops. \u0083 An embankment dam about 190-m long and 10-m hi gh located on the Na m Pan. A reinforced concrete spillway. If no storage is proposed, the dam will be smaller. \u0083 A gravity canal system distribution system including a main canal, 4 secondary canals and a series of tertiary canals. \u0083 Including households from the existing Ban Nam Pa n. They will have traditio nal land-rights in the area. Exercises based on the topographical survey maps will be sufficient as a pre-feasibility study. For a feasibility study, further investigations are required including: \u0083 Geo-technical for the dam foundation and borrow pits. \u0083 Hydrology. Nam Pan mean monthly and flood discharges. \u0083 Soils in the irrigation area. \u0083 Cost comparison of various options on cropping patterns, dam storages and command areas. A local consultant company will comple te these studies. If Ban Nam Pa n households are included in the scheme, a cost sharing arrangement will be developed with Khamkerd District..

The infrastructure provid ed at each resettlement site will include housing, irrigated farm plots1 and community buildings. The provision of such infrastructure will be preceded by the topographic survey and mapping of each resettleme nt site. The resulting maps will be a basic tool for the on-going consultations with the resettlers, who will continue to participate in the planning and design of the village and irrigation system layouts. The resettl ers will also participate in the design of the houses, community buildings and other facilities. Electricity will be provided to a ll villages and buildings therein. The provision of domestic water is a priority, and various options are available for this. Every house and farm plot will have access to a road, and this road/track network within each village will be directly conn ected to the new all-weather roads from Oudomsouk north west to the Thalang Bridge, and from Oudomsouk southeast to the last resettlement village of Ban Khone Khen. The schedule for the design and then construction of the various infrastructure components of the Plateau Resettlement Program is provided in Chapter 27. 20.2 T OPOGRAPHIC SURVEY , MAPPING AND BEACON INSTALLATION While Chapter 19 describes the existing topographic maps and data that have been used to date for the preliminary selection of the resettlement sites, the next step will be the topographic survey and the preparation of maps of all the rese ttlement sites. Following the survey of the Ban Nong Boua pilot village in 2002, two sites - Ban Oudomsouk and the Ban Sop On/Phonsavang (currently known as Theun Douan) - were surveyed in the dry season of 2003/2004 to produce topographic maps of 1:2,000 or 1:5,000 scale with 0.5 m contour interval. Included in this surveying program is the installation of bench marks and beacons to de marcate the Nakai Reservoir full supply level of EL 538 m and EL 540 m. All the remaining (10) plateau resettlement sites will be surveyed during the 2004/5 dry season to produce topographic maps of 0.5 m contour interval. The Nam Pan resettlement site, to which half of Ban Sop Hia and all of Ban Nam Nian will move, will also be surveyed in the 2004/5 dry season. 20.3 V ILLAGE LOCATION AND LAYOUT After detailed topographic maps have been prepared, preliminary altern ative village locations and possible layouts for (a) farm plot, (b) irrigation system, (c) village housing and community infrastructure, and (d) the road and track network will be developed and pr esented to each village. During consultations, the reasons for the layouts will be explained to the village rs, who will then have time to review and consider the layouts and other data such as the results of soil surveys and visit the sites. They will then decide the preferred locations and layouts. Following this participatory decision making process, detailed layouts will be prepared. 20.4 UXO CLEARANCE AND SITE PREPARATION Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) will be surveyed and cleare d from all resettlement areas. It is envisaged that two contracts will be ne cessary for full UXO survey and clearance, as follows: (a) sample surveys of all the areas in which a represen tative sample strip will be surveyed. The sample survey will identify the level and type of UXO contam ination. An area may be classified as either having light, moderate or heavy contamination; (b) the second contract will be for the actual clearance and based on the findings of the sample surveys. Experienced companies and/or NGOs will be contracted to undertake the work, with an important 1 Chapter 22 provides a description of the irrigation systems to be constructed. Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 2selection criteria being the ability of a comp any or NGO to include the resettling villagers themselves in the UXO clearance activities. After UXO clearance, the demarcated areas will be clea red, by the villagers themselves, of trees and other vegetation. Some of the areas will have trees that ar e commercially useful, particularly in the northern Plateau resettlement areas and at Ban Nam Pan. These areas will have to be surveyed and identified and the Plateau area trees logged by the Nakai Plateau Village Forestry Association (NPVFA). The small trees and bushes will be cleared by the village rs using slash and burn techniques. The individual plots will then be surveyed, measured and set out, and plot boundaries marked on the ground. The land titling procedures (see Chapter 19) can then commence. 20.5 R OADS AND DRAINS Every house and farm plot will have access to a villa ge road (or track) and the village roads will have access to the nearest all-weather ro ad. For the resettled villages locate d north of Oudomsouk, the nearest all-weather road will be the reloca ted Road 8B, for which the NTPC he ad contractor - the HCJV - is responsible for the survey, design and construction. For the villages located south of Oudomsouk, a new road will be built from Oudomsouk to the Nakai Reserv oir saddle dams in this area, and this is again the responsibility of the HCJV. However, there will be at le ast two villagers located fu rther south of this road, and thus this saddle dam road will ha ve to be extended (by the resettle ment program) to connect to these villages. Road 8B will have two lanes, a gravel pavement, a formation width of 7m and a design speed of 40km/hour. The road south to the saddle dams and the extra 30 km of new southern resettlement roads will be a single lane with a formation width of 5m, a gravel pavement and a design speed of 40km/hour. Rainfall on the Nakai Plateau is high during the wet season and the inclusion of a surface water drainage system will be an important aspect of the road design, and the v illage layouts. Road 8B and the resettlement road bridges will be designed for 100 -year occurring design floods and culverts 50-year floods. The intra village roads will be connected to the main roads describe d above. They have a minimum of 4 m pavement and a formation width of 8 m. The drainage system will consis t of \"v\" shaped open channels and precast concrete culvert pipes to convey the runo ff to the reservoir or nearest other natural water course. Local competitive bidding procedures will be undertaken for the constr uction of the roads which will be completed before the commencement of house construction. 20.6 H OUSE DESIGNS AND CONSTRUCTION 20.6.1 House Designs Based on the farm plot and village layout preferred by the pilot villages, each resettled household will be allocated a 0.65 ha plot for irri gated agricultural land and a 600 m2 (20 x 30 m) plot for the construction of a new timber house and surrounding garden. It shou ld be noted however that such a configuration may change slightly if villages choose to locate the house plot within the agricultural land area. House designs have been developed through consultations with the villagers who are to be resettled. Figure 20-1 illustrates the modified house design as a result of feedback during the second round of PCPP in April and May 1998. The main improvements on ea rlier designs where (i) to build houses with wood instead of bamboo walls, (ii) to inco rporate larger verandas, and (iii) an d where possible, to split the roof into two peaked sections. These improvements reflect the current designs of houses belonging to the better-off villagers on the plate au, a house design that all plateau dwellers aspire too. The improved design incorporates aspects of traditiona l house designs, including three 'zones' - private, public and production spheres. The private sphere is the sleeping quarters. The public sphere is the Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 3veranda, for receiving guests and entertaining. The pr oduction sphere is the kitchen, for cooking food, washing and growing spices and vegetables. The new structures will further conf orm to traditional house designs by incorporating elements such as two door s in accordance with kins hip taboos, an elevated construction on columns with two ladders, one to the kitchen and one to the veranda, the ladders having an odd number of rungs, and doors which open in a direction other than the west. Not only is the NT2 Project committed to providing houses in a style whic h are preferred by villagers, it is also committed to providing housing of adequate size . The housing entitlement of plateau resettlers, in terms of size of house, is a minimum of 14m 2 per person. It is estimated that for at least 75 % of the plateau population this is larger than the house th ey currently occupy. For thos e households whose current house is larger than this, their new house will not be sm aller than the original dwe lling, so that households whose dwellings are currently larger than 14m2 per persons will be provided with a house as large as their current dwelling. Thus, based on this requirement to provide a house which is proportionate in size to the number of household members, there are seven stan dard house designs, based on households or 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 persons, which thus varies in minimum size from 42m 2 to 126m2. In 1998, 66 % of the households lived in bamboo wa lled houses and 21 % in softwood walled houses, so that a full 67 % of households will be living in houses of improved c onstruction materials. All the house plots will be fenced. Typical house designs for a 3, 6 and 8 person househo lds are provided in Figure 20-2, Figure 20-3 and Figure 20-4, while Table 20-1 provid es a summary Bill of Quantities for the materials required to build these houses Table 20-1: Summarized Quanti ties of Materials to Build 3, 6 and 9 Person House's. 3 pers/hh 6 pers/hh 9 pers/hh no Description unit quantity quantity quantity 1 doorframes and doors pc3 3 3 2 windows frames and windows pc3 3 5 3 wooden pillar 15 x 15 x 300 pc 11 13 24 4 concrete pillar 15 x 15 x 250 pc 11 13 24 5 galvanized iron 300 cm sheet 80 21 109 6 galvanized iron 240 cm sheet 89 43 7 nut & bolt 18cm pc 38 43 80 8 nails for galvanized iron box 20 28 35 9 concrete to su pport stair sheet 2 2 2 10 all type of nails k g 40 53 70 11 hinge/(door and window ) pc 21 21 24 12 locks/latches (door and Window ) pc 12 12 16 13 handles/ (door and window ) pc 12 12 16 14 Normal lock/ pad lock and hin ges (door) set 2 2 2 15 wooden planks wall: 1.7 x 20 x 400 = 420 pcm3 2.448 3.536 5.7 16 wooden planks floor: 2.2 x 20 x 700 = 70 pcm3 1.1088 1.584 1.12 17 other t ypes of wood > 5 x 15 x 500 = 28 pcm3 0.9 0.78 1.05 > 5 x 15 x 400 = 32 pc m3 0.45 0.525 0.96 > 5 x 10 x 500 = 70 pc m3 0.325 0.84 1.75 > 5 x 10 x 400 = 34 pcm3 2.304 0.6 0.68 > 4 x 8 x 400 = 300 pcm3 2.304 3.072 4.1 Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 4 Figure 20-1: House Designs Follo wing Consultations in 1998 Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 5Figure 20-2: Typical Design of a 3 Person House Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 6Figure 20-3: Typical Design of a 6 Person House Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 7 Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 8Figure 20-4: Typical Design of an 8 Person House Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 9 Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 1020.6.2 House Construction Following agreement on the design of houses, NTPC staff will finalise de tailed final drawings and bills of quantities (BoQ). The BoQs will be divided into two sections: Section 1 will include all non-timber materials incl uding precast concrete footings, nails, nuts and bolts. Section 2 will include all the timber for the house including columns, beams, floors, walls, roofing, doors and windows. The, local, Provincial and National level builders will be invited to bid for the construction of the villagers houses, and contracts will most likely be for one or multiple numbers of houses. However, the villagers will be fully involved in the constructi on of their own houses, in order to: (a) facilitate a flexible design process and thus ensure a design appropriate to ethnic and other concerns of the householders; (b) ensure householder feelings of ownership and belonging; and (c) generate some transitional income; Thus, while local and provincial builders will be contra cted to build the resettler houses, the builders will be given an allowance to employ the householder, plus any other labour they may require. In cases where no able bodied men are available in a particular househ old, the whole village will be mobilised to assist. Having villagers participating in the constructi on of their own home ha s important social and psychological advantages since by investing time and en ergy in establishing themselves on their new plots, they will more easily acquire a sense of belonging to the new sites. Men are tr aditionally responsible for constructing houses in villages and form a pool of labour whenever new buildings are put up. A similar pool of labour would ensure that all houses are bu ilt and that disadvantaged households, that is households with a labour shor tage, single mothers, ill or disabled me mbers or few kinship ties, will not be negatively affected by this aspect of the relocation. Local competitive bidding procedures will be applied for the supply of the non-ti mber materials such as house footings, roofing materials, nails, hinges etc. For the supply of timber, it is likely that timber will come from two sources. One source of timber will come from the trees salvage harvested from the reservoir area and processed by a local sawmill. The se cond source will be the processing of trees salvage logged from the various Project Lands in the Resettle ment Area. This logging wi ll be undertaken by the NPVFA and they will also saw and process this timber, so that they can provide (i.e. sell) not only wall and floor planks but also prefabricated doors and window panels and frames. Just before construction commences, each family w ill be consulted once again on the house design, and the design can then be modified and amended on site during the course of construction, as long as no more construction materials are required. Villagers wi ll not only be provided with a new house but also assistance with the transportation of materials fr om their former houses. These materials can be reassembled on the new site, if so desired, to either enlarge the house built by the Project or to build an outhouse. The materials can also be saved for future family expansion. 20.7 P UBLIC BUILDINGS 20.7.1 Introduction Each resettled village will be provided with the following community buildings: nursery and primary school; meeting hall/community centre/village office; market, small or larger, depending on village size; rice mill and workshop; and organic fertilizer factory. Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 11Standard designs for the buildings were prepared for the construction for the Pilot Village. These designs will be used or modified for the other resettled villa ges of similar number of households. For the larger village communities, larger buildings will be required. In either case, there will be further consultations with all the resettled villages to agree on the designs. All the public buildings will be conne cted with electricity. They will have access to water and latrines will be built nearby. They all will have adequate drainage facilities to evacuate surface water. 20.7.2 Nursery and Primary Schools Section 26.6 of the SDP describes educational support. It explains that three types of educational support are envisaged: (i) nursery and cr\u00e8che-type facilities, (ii) primary and secondary schooling, (iii) adult education and vocational training. Nursery facilities will be provided in every resettlement villa ge to improve the welfare of infants and to relieve their parents of the task of childcare during the day. The village rs will decide whether the nursery facilities will be part of the village primary school or independent of it. The nurseries will be of a simple design, allowing good air circulation, with a mixture of wooden tile and corrugated iron roofing, rainwater collection and latrines. Nursery school equipment will include simple bedding, mosquito-nets and first-aid kits. The primary school design will be based on two st udents per household and a classroom area of 56 m 2 for thirty students. The school will be constructed with concrete flooring, a hardwood frame, half brick and half timber walls, and roofing of either corrugated iron or timber tiles. The school will be connected to the electricity supply and will also have a water supply. There will be at least one latrine provided per class room. Housing will be provided to teachers, as necessary, an d they will be constructed to the same design and standards as the resettler houses and provided with the same facilities. The adult education and vocational training will take place mainly in the village meeting hall. 20.7.3 Meeting Hall/Community Centre/Village Office As a general rule, few of the villages on the plateau have or maintain a temple. Thus, a communal meeting area must be developed to provide a space where i ssues can be discussed openly, and where non-formal training can be provided. In addition, village technica l staff should have a good environment in which to keep their records, in which to plan and report on their work, and in which to conduct small and larger meetings. Thus, it has been decided that a mu ltipurpose building or group of build ings will be constructed to serve these purposes. The floor plan of th e village hall constructed in Nong Bo ua is illustrated in Figure 20-5. The village meeting hall and office will be constructed with a hardwood st ructure, concrete floor and sheet metal roofing. It will be connected to the electricity and water supplies. There will be a toilet and adequate drainage to evacuate surface water. 20.7.4 Market Each village will have a roofed ma rket with a concrete floor, wooden roof structure and sheet metal roofing. Considering the crucial importance of produce marketing for the NT2 resettlement program, special and innovative consideration will be given to th e design of these markets, including consideration will be given to the requirements of fish marketing. The size of the ma rkets will depend on the number of village households. Adequate drainage around the market area is particularly important. 20.7.5 Rice Mill/Workshop The project will provide one rice mill and workshop for every fifty families. They will be constructed with concrete flooring, hardwood stru cture and sheet metal roofing. Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 1220.7.6 Organic Fertilizer Factory An organic fertilizer fa ctory will be established in most villages as in some cases it can be shared by more than one village. The experience gain ed in Ban Nong Boua Pilot village will be used to finalize design of the factories, which require the desi gn of efficient workspaces for raw materials storage, materials mixing, composting areas, packaging areas and a finished prod uct storage areas. They are likely to be constructed with concrete flooring, hardwood structure, bamboo lattice walls and a mixture of timber tile and thatched grass roofing. 20.7.7 Seed Processing and Storage Facility Most likely aligned to the organic fert ilizer factory, each village or group of villages will be provided with a seed processing and storage facility. The facility will include a covered and concre te area for final seed drying and cleaning and at least one room with air conditioning. Rat and mice proofing is another important design factor. The design of the facility being built in Ban Nong Boua pilot village is presented in Figure 20-6, and experience gained from the construction and utility of this building will be used to design further seed facilities. 20.7.8 Clinic There will be at least 2 clinics cons tructed and operated in the Resettl ement Area (in addition to the rehabilitated District hospital), one in the north west (probably in Ban Thalang) and one in the south east (either Ban Sop On or more likely Ban Done). These clinics will be constructed with concrete floo ring, brick and/or hardwood structure and corrugated iron roofing. The clinic will be supplied with a sink an d furniture appropriate to the size of the clinic. If required, staff housing, to the same standard as resettler houses, will be constructed.

There are a range of possible domestic water supply systems that could possibly be developed2 in the area, including rainwater collection; water pumped or hand lifted from an open well; water pumped from a lined borehole; and water piped from the irrigation header tanks, via a filtration system. The development of domestic wearer supply systems will be undertaken in two stages; Prior to reservoir inundation: During this period, the use of the irrigation sy stem water supply for domestic water will not be possible. However, boreholes or wells may be dug in lower areas. Following reservoir inundation: During this period the lower area boreholes or wells will not be possible (flooded) but the water table in the general area will be higher and thus groundwater more easily accessible. Also, it will now be possible to use/divert some of the water pumped from the reservoir in the irrigation system for domestic purposes. Groundwater is generally the cleanest source of water, and the feasibility of using groundwater, abstracted by hand pumps or by rope and buck et from hand dug or bored wells, will be assessed. The water quality, well discharge and depth to the water table in the dry season are the principal considerations and some test wells will be implemented. If the use of groundwater is found feasible, then consultations will be he ld with the villagers to assess the type of well, method of abstraction, number and lo cation. The number will depend on the village layout and number of households in the village. The dug well is a traditional method of obtaining water in rural areas. Smaller diameter wells, boreholes or tube wells are quicker and easier to sink. This type of well is usually fitted with a handpump but water can also be raised by small buckets or an electrical pump. For shallow wells, \"TARA\" handpumps, de signed and manufactured in India, is a reliable pump and are commonly used by UNICEF in Lao PDR. However th ere are cheaper Thai and Lao manufactured pumps available. Whatever type of well is dug, it will be protected fr om contamination by the construction of a reinforced concrete apron around the well head and a drainage channel to a soakaway to prevent creating a muddy surrounding. Also, before a well is used, it will be disinfected by a chlorine solution. The yield of wells placed in the higher areas of a re settlement villages before reservoir inundation may not be sufficient for all domestic use, and thus it may be necessary to excavate or drill the wells at a lower elevation and pump up to a header tank , or tanks, located within the village. Rain water collection , by individual households, from roofs via guttering and downpipe into storage tanks, is a common source of domestic water supply and is being practised at the Pilot Village. It provides very clean water and will be promoted in all village s. However, problems with this method include: it is somewhat expensive to install, for every house; there may be insufficient storage to last a family through the dry season; and if the collection tank is not covered, dengue fever may be problem. 2 The generally preferred method of rural village water supply is by a piped gravity fed system after tapping a perennial spring or stream located above a village. However it is unlikely that any such stream exist near the sites of the resettled villages on t he Nakai Plateau. Chapter 20: Resettlement Infrastructure Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 17These issues will be addressed, and the use of this ra in water, in the wet season, for consumptive use, is a preferred method to be presented to villagers for consideration. Filtered and piped irrigation/reservoir water . The irrigation system to be developed for Plateau resettlement villages will consist of pumping from th e Nakai Reservoir to a header tank or stilling basin located on high ground in the resettlement area. Th e less-sloping areas will have a stilling basin and an open canal system of water conveyance. The more-sloping areas will require a header tank and buried pipe conveyance system. It is possible to construct a gravity domestic water system in parallel to this irrigation system, by installing a supply pipeline from the head er tank to the village housing area, via a filtration system. In this case the water is pumped by the irrigation system, and a small quantity siphoned of for the domestic water system. Such a system has already been constructed in the Pilot Village, and includes a gravel and charcoal filtration tank, located between the header tank an d the village, to remove suspended solids and some micro-organisms from the water (see Figure 20-6). After passing the filtration tank the water is piped to stand-pipes located within a household group, with approximately 5 households per standpipe. If the wells and rain water collection methods are not satisfactory, then this further method of water supp ly will be investigated and implemented if proved feasible. 20.8.2 Sanitation Every household will have its own latrine. There are se veral types of latrine ava ilable in Lao PDR. Given alternatives, the usual village choice is the \"pour flus h\" type which uses a pit for excreta disposal but a ceramic pan cast into a cover slab. The pan provides a water seal which ensures that odours are kept from the shelter, and a vent pipe, with fly screen, will be fitt ed to the pit. Pour flush types require 1.5 to 2 litres of water for flushing. The pans are slightly more expensive but they are odour free and are the safest type of latrine regarding the transmission of excreta related diseases. Latrines should be located at least 30 m from any well. A timber shelter will be located around the la trine for privacy and protection from weather. Notwithstanding the above, a review will be made of the various designs provided by or recommended by WHO, and in consultation with villages, the final d ecision will be made. Installation is not technically difficult and after being shown how to construct a couple of latrines, the villagers will be able to construct their own. As previously stated, latrines will also be constructed outside all public buildings. 20.8.3 Hygiene Education and Maintaining and Monitoring the Facilities Generally, the resettled villagers will not have expe rience of water supply and sanitation facilities. The installation of the facilities alone will not lead to improvem ents in health unless they are accompanied by changes in hygiene behaviour. A hygiene education pr ogramme will be implemen ted by the RMU that will encourage the villagers to corre ctly maintain the water suppl y and sanitation facilities. The quality of the water will be monitored and regula r inspections will be made of the water supply systems to check for contamination. The costs of operation and maintenance of the water supply and irri gation systems will be borne by NTPC prior to COD, and by the Social and Environmental Remediation Fund (SERF) after COD.

This will require the following: Provision of a 22 kV transmission line to each village; The installation of step down transforme rs with accessories and safety features; Provision of a 0.4-kV network through the housing area; and Individual house and public building connections with meters, wiring, and the provision of fluorescent light fixtures and power points consistent with the size of house/household. 20.10 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY The process by which any particular infrastructure is to be designed and constructed will depend on the scale and complexity of the structure, on whether NTPC undertakes the activity or the work is contracted out, under the supervision of NTPC, and whether the villagers can be involved in the activity. A summary of the agencies or groups that may implem ent each of the main activities required for the development of an infrastructure is provided in Table 20-2 below. For those activities which will be contracted to private compan ies the following process will, in general, be followed: NTPC will call for technical submissions - for major or difficult infrastructure activities - usually via newspaper advertisements; NTPC will then review the technical submissions, and prepare a list of preferred bidders for each major activity. This will be the first round of technical pre-qualification. NTPC will then issue a call for tender, in some ca ses only to those compan ies that have passed the technical pre-qualification; The bids will then be evaluated, based on (a) tec hnical content of the bid (that is, the companies and firms will be evaluated twice for their technica l and personnel capability to conduct the task), and (b) the financial submission. Contracts will then be prepared.

AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT 21.1 INTRODUCTION The goal of the Agriculture and Livestock Development Program is to enable resettled households on the Nakai plateau to develop productive and sustainable agri culture and livestock production as a part of their livelihood system, a livelihoo d system which will also include reservoi r fisheries, commercial forestry and various non-farm or off-farm enterprises. The Resettlement Area, on the southern edge of the Nakai reservoir, is on generally poor soils and thus specific cultural practises 1 will be developed to ensure sustainable and economically feasible agriculture in the area The adoption of these new forms of sedentary agriculture will take several seasons for full adoption. Achieving this goal will require support during the transi tion from their traditional rainfed, upland shifting agriculture based systems to IWDC and DMC systems. These new agricultural systems will require the introduction of new crops and breeds of livestock, im proved land, soil and mulch cultural practices, some increased use of agricultural inputs and the marketin g of surplus produce. The vehicle for providing this support will be an enhanced and strengthened extensi on service on the Nakai Pl ateau that can sustain the delivery of inputs and support services to the chosen cropping and liv estock systems. - The adoption of irrigated paddy production, for example, would be a new activity for many households, and the use of irrigation for the production of field and vegetable crops in the dry season, and the use of supplementary irrigation water in the wet season, will be a completely new venture. While the villagers will be dealing with familiar crops, it is the adoption of improved practise and varieties together with their culture on terraces or under mulch, and the use of or ganic and chemical fertilise r, and selected herbicides, which will be new to them. 21.1.1 Agricultural and Livestock Entitlements Relocated households will, accordin g to the Concession Agreement (see Appendix A1), be entitled to assistance to establish new (although similar) livelihoods at the new locations. Entitlements related to agriculture and livestock include the following; 0.5 ha of irrigated land will be provided to each household, and up to 0.16 ha of rice land per household. [In the October 2002 CA, this rice land was to be in an 'off village' location and allocated on a community basis. Ho wever, wherever possible, this 0. 16 ha will be continuous with the above mentioned 0.5 ha, and thus a total of 0. 66 ha of irrigated land will be developed and improved]; the land will be provided with survey and joint title to husband and wife; the land will be cleared and prepared for cultiv ation by the owner, with their own labour paid; the land will be provided with year round irrigation water; tools will be provided to work th e farm land and the forest land; planting materials for the first 3 years after preparation of farm lot, including fruit tree saplings, will be provided, as will fertiliser and other agro -chemicals. [The Octobe r 2002 CA provides for fertiliser provision for the first 3 years only, bu t revised plans envisage support, if required, throughout the transition period]; training in farming, forest management and fisheries techniques will be provided; agricultural advice for 5 years after preparation of farm lot will be provided [this entitlement has been revised to allow provision of agricultural advice for the whole resettlement period of about 8 years, as required]; access to identified reservoir drawdown areas for grazing of existing animals [this entitlement has been revised to allow also cropping in allocated areas of the drawdown zones]; training to be provided in household and enterprise budgeting; 1 Some families already practice sedentary agriculture (paddy (wet ) rice production, while most practices slash and burn cultiva tion which, in some cases, is practiced in fairly well defined sw idden cycles. The new agriculture systems will include irrigated w et and dry season cropping on formed terraces (IWDC), and rained direct seeded mulch-based cropping systems (DMC). Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 2 Resettlers will have the flexibility to choose from a range of farming opti ons and maintain current livestock numbers; and Households without large livestock (about 60% of ho useholds) will be eligible for up to two large animals to supplement their livelihoods. Besides the entitlement to 0.66ha of irrigated agricultural land, it has been decided to allocate two further cropping zones for the purposes of developing and sustaining agriculture production, namely (a) the reservoir drawdown areas; and (b) 'upland' areas currently under degraded fore sts (in which DMC systems will be developed). Following research and development of rainfed agriculture systems, and assuming they are shown to be ecological sustainable and productive, the followings entitlements may be furt her provided in the two zones, as follows; (a) up to a further 0.5 ha per resettler family of extra rainfed cropping and grazing area, depending on the labour availability and ability of an y family to work the land; and (b) up to 1 ha for the first new gene ration from resettler families, which, assuming 4 families are developed for the one original per resettler family. 21.1.2 Program Components The Agricultural and Livestock Development Program is composed of five main areas components: (a) The timely delivery of relevant inputs This will be achieved through assisting all the rese ttled households after choosing their particular livelihood mix to develop their own farm plans, assist ing them with the physical layout of the contours and terraces on their farm lots and providing each hou sehold with the seed and other agricultural inputs based upon the cropping pattern that they have selected. Continuous support will be provided during the growing season to guide the resettled households in the adoption of improved cultural practices and alternative crops through the provision of all inputs together with demonstration and training. (b) Improving the productivity of livestock raising through improved animal health care and nutrition, and upgrading of the breeding stock. The traditional forms of livestock raising will be impr oved by the introduction of more extensive animal health care programs to reduce the level of mortality th rough enhanced capacity of local veterinary staff as well as training farmers in animal management, disease diagnosis and treatment. Nutrition levels will also be enhan ced by increasing and upgrading the grazing resources of the forested areas and exploiting the drawdown areas for seasonal use. An Animal Breeding Centre will provide the focus fo r improved breeding progra ms with the acquisition of stock for dispersal to farmers as well as the establishment of AI programs as well as natural breeding. Training will also be provided for farmers on impr oved animal husbandry and breeding practices. (c) Participatory Research and Extension Due to the unique and challenging conditions for agri culture in the resettlement area, a parallel program of participatory research and extension will be unde rtaken to develop appropria te and sustainable forms of land use and management, and so il fertility management, for both so il erosion control and development of sustainable soil fertility enhancement methods, based on the DMC system. This will include use participatory farmer led extensio n approaches within the re settled villages. Training of all extension staff on the use of Farmer Field Schools will enable th is approach to be adopted for all farmer training. This will ensure that the training for farmers is all conducted in the field as a continuous process through the growing season. The approach w ill enable extension staff to interact much more closely with the farmers. (d) Strengthening the capacity of the DAFO and provision of TA: To ensure that the delivery of extension se rvices on the Nakai plateau are improved , technical and managerial support will be provid ed through the NTPC/RO by the hire of local TAs as well as Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 3recruitment of International TAs. Additional field ex tension staff will be deployed through the District Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO) and th e office and training facilities upgraded. (e) Development of marketing systems Nakai Plateau households must be able to dispose of their surplus produce, and they will be assisted in this endeavour by the construction of markets, by the provision of vehicles, and by development of numeracy and marketing skills. A small market in formation unit will be established in DAFO 21.2 CLIMATIC FACTORS The climate of the Nam Theun catchment is influenced primarily by the seasonal South West and North East monsoons, the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone and the tropical cyclone disturbances that include tropical storms and tropical depressions. During the WS from mid May to early October the catchment area is normally affected by the South-West monsoon (WS) which predominates when atmospheric pressure is low over Asia. This is a period of frequent and heavy rainfalls over the catchment alth ough there is a dry period of one to two weeks between June and July. After this period the rainfa ll becomes more frequent, including heavy storms which results from tropical cyclones entering the region from the South China Sea, mostly from September to November. Flooding frequently occurs when two or more of these storms occur in succession or when the ITCZ, which is the forward edge of the SW monsoon, has passed into one of its more active stages, with tropical cyclones following shortly thereafter. There is a transition period from mid-October to early November, which is fo llowed by the colder dry North East monsoon that normally blows from China between October and February. This season is characterised by sparse, relatively light rainfall, lower temperatures and humidity. This North East monsoon is followed by another transition period prior to the onset of the hot weather from March to early May and is characterised by increasing rainfall and humidity. This transition is slower than the transition from wet to cold seasons. 21.2.1 Rainfall The rainfall in the project area is the highest that occurs in Lao PDR. The South West monsoon produces a warm moist airflow into the area from May to Sept ember, and spatial variation of rainfalls is principally affected by orographic effects. The high rainfall occu rs where physical barriers cause uplift. The limestone precipices and the main escarpment along the South We stern edge of the Nakai plateau provide excellent conditions for orographic intensification of the precipitation. The rugged terrain in the upper parts of the catchment acts as an additional barrier, but much of the moisture is precipitated at the first barrier. Apart from the spill-over effect on the edge of the plateau, the rainfall in the Nakai plat eau is likely to be rather less than in the upper parts of the catchment. The monthly rainfall on the Nakai plateau is highly seasonable with 89 percent of the rainfa ll occurring between May and September. The rainfall is the most important climatic variable in determining the productivity and potential of rainfed agricultural systems. Although total rainfall is hi gh (2,979 mm) and would a ppear to be more than adequate to support rainfed agriculture from Apr il to October, when rainfall exceeds potential evapo- transpiration, the bimodality of its distribution means that there is normally a high risk of prolonged dry periods, usually in June or July. Although this is not obvious from mean monthly rainfall data (Table 21-1), these period of drought are long enough to induce severe drought stress in rice and field crops. Table 21-1: Mean Monthly Rainfa ll for Nakai Tai Station (1994-2001) Station Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Total B Nakai Tai 9.9 17.3 59.6 140.0 389.8 85.1 13.1 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 421.2.2 Evaporation Evaporation is closely related to temperature, hu midity and wind speed. The rates of evaporation (measured by a Class A Evaporation Pan) that are experienced during the hottest months in March and April are in excess of 180 mm per month. Within the catchment area it is only in the period from April to September that the rainfall normally exceeds the evapo-transpiration rate. 21.2.3 Temperature Reduced temperatures are experienced from November to February, with a peak before the onset of the South West monsoon in May. Mean te mperatures at Nakai vary from 17.3o C in January to 26.1o C in April and an annual mean of 22.6o C. The extremes of temperature show that during the cooler months the minimum temperature may fall as low as 2o C, whilst maximum temperatures have reached 34.9o C, on occasions. Although the frequency of experiencing su ch minimum temperatures is relatively low, it does have the potential to damage to fruit tree crops.

During thunderstorm activity, convective currents may produce strong surface winds, albeit usually of short duration. The catchment area is at a latitude at which the maximum frequency of typhoon landfalls occurs along the Vietnam coast and these occur mo stly between August and October. Although the Anamite Chain presents a barrier to such storms, wh ich usually dissipate rapidly overland, the catchment boundary is only 55 km from the coast and records indicate that three storms retained typhoon strength (>118 km per hr) over the catchm ent area in the past 40 years. 21.2.5 Day Length The day length is important in crop growth since it determines the potential amount of solar radiation available for crop growth. Also, many rice varieties, particularly the traditional ones, are photoperiod- sensitive, meaning that they flower in response to da y length. The day length is determined by the latitude. The Nakai Plateau is situated 17o North of the equator and experience s noticeable changes in the day length during the year. On the longest day (June 21st) day length is approximately 13 hours whilst on the shortest day (December 21st) it is only 11 hours. This reduction in day length between the summer and winter stimulates the photoperiod-sensitive varieties to flower at a specific time of year with the result that the traditional rice varieties reach maturity at approximately the same time regardless of when they were planted. 21.2.6 Sunshine Hours The data on average daily sunshine hours demonstrates that the lowest figures are recorded from June to August, corresponding to the peak of the WS. During the DS, despite the shorter day length the number of sunshine hours is still considerably higher. The so lar radiation measures the potential energy available for crop growth and the higher sunshine hours during the DS raise the yield potential of crops produced during the dry months. The slight decline in sunshine hours in the month of March is noticeable at other recording stations in the country and is attributed to the amount of DS burning that is taking place in the uplands with the smoke produced reducing the level of solar radiation. 21.3 SOILS AND LAND MANAGEMENT 21.3.1 Description of Soils The old alluvial soils (Lower Cretaceous Period) found within the agricultural resettlement area are classified predominantly as Acrisols, derived from bedrock of mainly sandstone with some gradation of mudstone and siltstone in places (see EAMP, Chapter 3) . These are strongly weathered soils with low base saturation. The soils are podzolic with development of lateritic horizons in some areas and in general are heavily leached and infertile. They occur mostly on old land surfaces with hilly or undulating topography and are commonly encountered in wet tropical, monsoon climates. On the plateau, texture tends to be medium (sandy loams) under the hardwood, broadleaf forest, grading to medium-to-coarse (loamy sands and sands) under pine cover. The A horizons are generally shallow (<30cm) and are relatively structureless. Example soil analysis results 2 presented in Table 21-2 indicate that organic matter content, pH and cation exchange capacities are all low, as are the major nutrie nt availabilities, particularly phosphate. These soils are prone to aluminium toxicity and all have strong P-sorption with a characteristic tendency for slaking and crusting, with high susceptibility to erosion. These factors all impose some severe limitation on their arable land uses. However, recent experience in the Pilot villages has shown that application of both lime and inorganic fertilizer can overcome these fertility limitations, thus making the soils suitable for production of annual rainfed and irrigated field crops only, although the need to maintain such inputs or the need use of suitable crop rotations with appropriate crop residue management practices, is now the issue. 2 Example soil analysis results from the Soil Survey conducted in the area of the Pilot Village Ban Nong Boua. See Appendix K-1 for detailed results. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 6Table 21-2: A Soil Analysis Results from th e Pilot Village Area on the Nakai Plateau Range Level Texture pH KCl 4.1 Highly Acidic pH H 2O 4.9 Highly Acidic Organic Matter % 0.9 to 1.8 Low Nitrogen % 0.06 to 0.08 Very LowC/N Ratio 8.5 to 12.5 % 0.019 to 0.026 LowP, available ppm 1.4to 1.5 Medium K. total % 0.037 to 0.045 Low K, available ppm 5.3 to 7.3 MediumCEC, total me/100g 6.3 to 8.0 LowBase Saturation, % 13.8 to 16.1 Very LowCa me/100g Very LowSandy Loam 21.3.2 Appropriate Cropping Systems and Fertility Management Generally, these Acrisols on the Nakai plateau have been used for low yielding subsistence farming, mainly shifting cultivation systems which, provided fallow periods are adequate, have proved to be a moderately sustainable utilisation of these soils . However, farmers remain desperately poor when practising these swidden systems and swidden cultiv ation will no longer be possible or allowed in the resettlement area due to pressure on land and fore st resources. Thus, alternative land management and cropping practices must be developed, aimed at incr easing organic matter and cation exchange capacity which are preconditions for cropping these soils and obtaining responses to chemical fertilization. Irrigation on formed terraces and us e of composted organic fertiliser Adapting cropping systems with co mplete fertilisation and careful mana gement are probably a precursor for productive sedentary farming in this area, and it is likely that low input farming on these soils will not be rewarding. Thus, one way to improve the soils an d their productivity is to increase the cropping and management intensity and thus productivity potential of the soils by double or triple cropping with the use of irrigation and organic fertiliser. The villagers ha ve chosen resettlement si tes on the shores of the reservoir, and thus pumping the reservoirs water to the resettlement sites is an attractive option. In addition, many of the villagers have requested the prov ision of irrigation system, which is also necessary for the productive and reliable production of wet paddy rice. However, because of the sloping nature of most of the areas identified for resettlement as well as the irrigation required for dry season crops and paddy prod uction, it will be necessary to establish contoured terraces to stabilise the slopes and allo w for the development of adequate organic matter levels in the soils. DMC - direct seeded mulch based cropping The only alternative to irrigated cropping in the resettlement areas is DMC or direct seeded mulch-based cropping systems in upland rainfed areas . The main pr inciple of these systems is that the soil is no longer disturbed by mechanical action, and is always kept covered by former crop residues and dead or living mulch, and the main intention is to increase organic matter and stop soil erosion. Deep rotting systems of cover crops improve soils structure, increase below ground insects and microbial communities and recycle nutrients deep in the soils. If the quantity of mulch is sufficient then weeds are also controlled and water availability for crops increases. The zero tillage syst em's are now common in broadacre agricultural areas where machinery has been designed for direct seeding and fertilizin g and herbicides used for mulch control. There uptake in less developed small holder systems is le ss common, but has nee demonstrated to be possible, productive and economic. However, specific systems - and their three main components of (a) soils management and land preparation, (b) crop management techniques, and (c) Thematic adjustments - will have to be develo ped for the Nakai resettlement area. Challenges in this area include poor soils will make fertility improvements diff icult and mulch build up rather slow. However, experienced specialists consider that it can be done, ov er a 4 to 6 year timeframe to develop the systems. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 7 pH The low inherent pH of the soils can be ameliorated by the application of lime, at indicative rates of between 2 and 5 tons per ha. Application of ground limestone will raise the pH and improve cation exchange capacity. The objective should be to simply neutralise the exchangeable aluminium, which is the main problem in these acid soils, rath er then to bring the soil close to a neutral reaction. In practical terms this implies raising the pH to above 5.5. 21.3.3 Irrigation Potential and Limita tions - water use efficiencies The percolation losses in the soils in the resettlemen t sites will be a significant part of the water requirements for irrigated paddy production as well as irrigation for other crops. For heavy clay soils within the Mekong Plains, percolation rates of 1 to 3 mm per day are normal, but in lighter well draining soils, such as occur in the plateau, these rates are si gnificantly higher. However, estimating the percolation losses without the results of infiltration rate tests and area field experience is difficult. For example, at the Theun Douan Demonstration Farm the soils are light and dry season rice trials required considerable pumping and achieved only low yields. After taking into account effective rainfall, a moderately high 6 mm per day could be assumed which results in a peak net supplementary IWR of 8 mm per day. After adjusting for the distribution efficiency and field appl ication losses, which would normally be of the order of 60 percent, a gross IWR of 13 mm per day would be indicated. However, there may be lower irrigation efficiencies through higher distribution losses as the water will have to be conveyed between terraced paddies. It is for this reason that the land areas that are planted to irrigated paddy must be on the lower slopes where soils will have a higher clay content and percolation losses will be lower. Another factor will be that the soil wa ter table level may change after the after the Nakai reservoir is filled. At least in the wet season, the water table should be considerably raised, and thus irrigated paddy water requirements in the wet season may be reduced considerably following impoundment of the reservoir. 21.4 SITE SELECTION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT 21.4.1 Site Selection Nakai Plateau villagers have repeated their preference to remain living on the Plat eau rather than moving to the lowland areas, as previously proposed. In resp onse to this preference, studies have been conducted to assess the natural resources in the area above th e mean supply level of the reservoir (538 EL). The studies examined the area between the western boundar y of the reservoir and the edge of the escarpment to identify suitable areas for the es tablishment of resettled villages with individual farm plots. Agricultural, social and resource related criteria were given due consideration in selecting prospective resettlement sites (Table 21-3), as described in detail in Chapter 19 Table 21-3: Factors Considered in the Se lection of Prospective Resettlement Sites 1. Water supply must be accessible from the rese rvoir, along with an elevated site for the header tank to allow gravity irrigation to farm plots 2. Slope for the farm plot area(s) should be as gentle as possible and ideally not exceed 15% 3. The soils selected must be capable of prov iding adequate returns with a potential for the production of wetland paddy rice wherever possible Agricultural considerations 4. All farm plots should form 1 conti guous land area wherever possible 5. The resettlement sites shou ld be as near as possible to the old village location Social considerations 6. Social and cultural factors must be taken in to account including the village spiritual areas and customary boundaries 7. Roads or other transportation infrastructure mu st be sufficiently accessible to ensure access to markets and other support services Resource considerations 8. Access to the reservoir, drawdown zone, fo rest and grazing areas should be convenient Potential resettlement site s meeting the above criteria are located along the south-western shoreline of the reservoir, providing water for irrigation, and access to the drawdown zone, grazing and forest land. A significant portion of the land has slopes below 15 percent, which allows large enough areas for the selection of village sites and agricultural land. These potential resettleme nt areas also largely fell within Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 8existing village customary use areas, thus reducing the potential of social upheaval and the risks associated with acclimatization to a new environment. Initially, the lands along the reservoir shoreline were divided into 25 potential village resettlement sites. These have now been reviewed by villagers and a each village has chosen, based on its own criteria, indicative sites, as shown in Figure 21-2. Most of the sites are flat to undulating, and a total area of about 750 ha will be developed into terraced and irrigated farm plots, based upon 0.66 ha per household, with an additional 50 ha of land required for the homesteads and associated village fac ilities. Surrounding these irrigated areas are similar area of upland degraded forest, and these may be developed into rainfed cropping, as described Section 21.5.2. While the villagers' choice of site often relates to cl oseness to water and the reservoir, some have also chosen areas where, based on available maps, there may be a large area of drawdown, land between elevations of 538 masl to about 530 masl. Villagers obvio usly see the potential to utilize such areas for dry season irrigated and early wets season rainfed cropping. A range of cropping options will be made availabl e to each resettled household, and they will have flexibility in their choice of what and how to grow cr ops on the farm plots. In addition, what they grow on the land will likely change over time, as experience is gained as to what are the best crops and systems for the area, and as markets emerge and change. 21.4.2 Land development The areas to why the villagers will be relocated and develo ped as agricultural plots is currently under degraded to medium to good forest. Thus the land will have to be opened up for the farm plots. The establishment and development of these farm plots woul d require substantial labour inputs at the outset. This would include: \u0083 Felling of trees and slashing of vegetation , a task which many of the villagers are accustomed to; \u0083 While the good trees will be sawn by the NPVFA for sale to NTPC and then used to build villagers houses, the other vegetation will be burnt on site; and \u0083 Removal of tree stumps is necessary if the land is to be cu ltivated, but may not be necessary of the DMC system is adopted. Stump removal is a difficul t task, which cam be undertaken in three ways: (a) slow burning of the tree stump, in situ, which may take some years for the stump to disappear; (b) manual dodging and removal of stump; and (c) mechanical extraction In most cases, the land opening in the first year will be part of planting a wet season upland rice crops, atypical way that agricultural land is first brought into production in the Lao PDR. Following this first season's crop, in the case of the irrigated and terraced areas, the land would be surveyed and terraces started to be formed as explai ned in Section 21.5.1. This would be conducted in parallel to survey and design of the irrigation system. The on farm development of the irrigation system would, in most cases, begin in the following year. The experience being gained from the Pilot Village and demonstration farm will be used in developi ng the lands within these farming areas. 21.5 CROPPING SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS There are three possible farming (cropping) systems th at could be developed in, or in relation to, the resettlement Area, as follows: (a) irrigated, multiple season cropping, on bench terraces ; Irrigated cropping has been tested in the Theun Douan farm and now in th e Pilot Village, and has proved to be technically feasible and productive. It is also the system requested by resettlers (farmers). It is thus the main cropping system used in the planning of the agriculture program (until DMC and reservoir drawdown systems are shown to be feasible, and developed). (b) rainfed cropping in the area current ly classified as degraded forest; Non-irrigated cropping of the fragile soils in th e area is probably only viable under legume rotations and minimum tillage, the 'direct-seeding mulch-based cropping' (DMC) systems. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 9However, rainfed cropping with legume rotations and minimum tillage will take considerable time to develop as a productive and sustainable system, and at this stage the productivity of its technical components is not known. Thus, it will be part of the particip atory research program, but not, at this stage, part of the deta iled farm planning and income modelling. (c) cropping in the reservoir drawdown zone . The extent and type of cropping in the reservoir's drawdown zone is not possible to predict at this stage. It may be possible in some specified areas, especially those areas not subject to wave erosion. Thus, this is not at this stage considered in detailed planning and income scenarios, but villagers will have the full right to pursue cro pping in theses areas if and when they become possible and viable. Regulations regarding the use of this area will be established in each village by the DAFO and the village authorities. 21.5.1 Irrigated Agriculture on terraces The main features of the planned irrigated cropping systems and components which are modelled in the economic analysis (see Secti on 21.10 and 21.11) include: An area of 0.66 ha of land per family will be deve loped and provided with irrigation water to allow production of wet and dry season crops and forages. Some households will initially co ntinue to plant upland rice in these areas, but most will gradually change to production to the irrigated paddy, where technically and economically feasible and especially after the Nakai reservoir in operation. Paddy land will be locate d on the lower terraces, where slopes are less, and the land contiguous to the drawdown zones where cropping may also be developed, including mid to late dry season paddy rice . Both wet and dry season paddy can be grown or dry season crops such as water melon grown in the formed paddy areas. Maize and sorghum will be important crops to be grown in both wet and dry season, intercrop or rotated with legumes such as peanuts, mung beans, black beans and soybeans - could be expanded in both WS and DS, mainly as sole crops but al so as an intercrop with maize during the WS. Vegetable production will be mainly undertaken in the dry season, with double cropping of vegetables as households further intensify the cropping patterns and gain experience. Vegetable crops will include cabbage and broccoli, cucumber, eggplant, tomato, chillies an d garlic, in fact any species which grows effectively in the plateau environment and has a good market. Fruit trees are another option that can be planted ei ther (a) on the lower terraces where the water table will be more accessible in the dry season, thus reducing their need for supplementary irrigation, or on the higher terraces. Fruit types will include mango, jackfruit, guava, lychee, tamarind, pomelo, bananas and pineapple. Irrigated forage production is another option. On perfectly flat areas these could be developed into grazing fields. However, on areas with any slope, cut and carry systems would be probably be developed to avoid erosion or da mage to terracing. Establishment of forages/pastures could also be part of the cropping cycle, with the pastures being returned to crops every 2 years or so. Establishment of long cycle industrial type crops is also a possible - tea, coffee, rubber, or whatever is feasible and economically productive. Most of the land areas selected for relocation have undulating to pography that will necessitate the establishment of terraces along the contours (see Section 21.5.1). The Irrigation Water Requirements for paddy production will be considerably higher than for the field crops grown on the other parts of the farm lot. Paddy grows best in a standing water depth of 10 to 15 cm, which needs to be maintained throughout the growing season. In addition irrigation water is required to cover evaporation losses from the open water as well as compensate for percolation losses in the inundated fields. Furthermore, there is a substantial w ater demand to saturate the land to permit the soils to be puddled prior to transplanting. The process of puddling the soil disturbs the fine clay soil particles that move settle between soil particles lower in the profile and hence reduce percolation losses. A dry season paddy crop has been included in the Whole Farm Scenarios following the filling of the reservoir, although this may prove possible in the lo wer terraces or in certain drawdown zones There are areas within the resettlement sites with higher clay contents, although these are mostly found in the Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 10northern area. However, these soils will still have higher percolation losses than ra tes than the heavy clay soils normally used for paddy. The effect of puddling the soils will be to progressively change the soil structure and this will in turn pr ogressively reduce perc olation losses. Once th is occurs then the production of dry season paddy could become more feasible, in the longer term. On the upper slopes non-ponded crops will be grown, because of the hi gher percolation losses. Although the annual applications of organic manure will impr ove the physical structure of the soils it will not materially influence the percolation rates. Dry season field and vegetable crops will be pr obably be grown under two general systems: (a) on flat ground or in 'holes' in cases where water is provided by sprinkler; (b) on raised ridges or beds where furrow irrigation is possible. Sprinkler - either semi automatic or fully manual - will be possible were dry season vegetable and field crops are grown on small areas (normally less than 1 50 sq m). This will substantially reduce the water demand although it will increase the labour requirement . in larger areas, water reticulation in pipes and canals will be the main syst ems developed (see Chapter 22) Terrace Design and Construction The work that has been done over the last two years in the Pilot Village has raised some concerns relating to the establishment of terraces and the task of providing irrigation water to these farm lots. Some basic assumptions regarding terrace design that should be applied are: Terrace vertical intervals must be kept to a mi nimum to minimize cut and fill topsoil movement. The greater the vertical interval, the greater the cut and fill earth movement. The maximum vertical interval should not exceed 40 cm (20 cm cut and fill). The rise in the interval is not ve rtical as there is little stone ava ilable for stonewalling. Instead the terrace rise should be cut at a slope of 0.5:1 (horizontal : vertical). Consequently some land will be lost by terrace construction. At the end of the terrace there should be a small earth bund, 10-cm high. Thus, assuming 1:1 side slopes and 10-cm top width, a strip 30-cm wide will be lost. The terraces surfaces must be level to ensure even distribution of irrigation water. Table 21-4 and Figure 21-2 below present guideslin es for Bench Terrace Design and Construction, applicable for plot slopes between 2 and 20 %. The table shows the less the vertical interval the more the number of benches that are required and the less total bench width. The recommended maximum vertical interval is 0.4 m with a preferable 0. 3 m interval (0.15 m depth cut and fill). Table 21-4: Parameters for Design and Construction of Terraces Vertical Interval (m) between terraces No. of benches Total bench width (m) 0.4 25 4 0.3 33 3 0.2 50 2 The preferable method of locating a contour is by th e use of a clear hosepipe and water rather than using a conventional \"A\" frame. The method to be used should be as follows: Temporary benchmarks are installed at every farm plot. This will require th e use of theodolite and a skilled operator. Individual plots are surveyed and mapped to determine land slope or slopes. Initially a 20 metre grid can be used. With experience, it will be po ssible to decide what density of spot levels is required. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 11 The existing terrace lines are also located and the existing terrace widths/vertical intervals/land slopes are compared with those in Table 21-3. If the existing terrace widths are considered s atisfactory, then improving the existing bunds is undertaken using the clear hosepipe and pegs. Set th e top of the pegs to the level of the contour. Excavate a trench and build a bund to the top of the pegs and then level the plot behind the bund accordingly. If the existing terraces are not considered satisfactory then it will be necessary to re-design the terrace widths using the guideline table in conjunct ion with the farmer wishes regarding cut and fill depths (some plots may have shallower top soils than others). Irrigation efficiency will also be determined by the degr ee of levelling of the terraces to permit an even distribution of the water. If the terraces are uneven larger volumes of water w ill be required to maintain the minimum standing depths of water for the paddy. Terrace development should, where possible, be done manually, as the use of heavy equipment can resu lt in the disturbance of the sub-soil which if mixed with the top soil can result in areas of the terrace that will have largely sterile soil. The actual construction of the contours and terraces is difficult and can be done by various means, often a combination of the following; mechanically, by the use of large ploughing tractors or smaller hand tractors to loosen the soils and effect some levelling of the ground; and manually, by use of hoes to level the ground and transfer soils for the construction. Using both these methods, it will take time - 2 to 3 the years - to fully de veloped the terraces and contours. Thus, there will be a requirement for substant ial labour inputs during the first and second years to achieve (the land clearance and then) contouring and terracing, as well as the initial land preparation for cropping. This is estimated at 50 to 70 person days for the 0.66 ha farm lot, at least 60 % of which should take place during the first 2 years. This will be suppor ted by the Project in the form of Food for Work Programs, and is a form of transitional income support. For the smaller households who have labour shortages, this support can also be used to compensate hired labour. A third method employed for terrac e and contour development in more developed countries is the use of laser levelled graders (on very gentle slopes only). Th is is currently not contemplated to be used in the NT2 Project, but could be an option. Land Preparation Following opening up the land (see section 21.4.2), and in the early ye ars in parallel to the progressive development of terraces and contours, the land in the irrigated plots needs to be prepared on a seasonal. The most common way to do this is with power toilers, the same tillers used to develop and level the land on the early years. The project will provide one power tillers to an average of 10 families or community groups. These machines, however, are multiple purpos es, and when not preparing land are used for the transportation of inputs (fert ilisers) and produce to market. Smaller areas, especially for vegetable crop beds, are also prepared by hand, with hoes etc. Following trialling and experience the progressive introduction of DMC systems into the terraced and irrigated areas may also be a possibility, and be especially important for the decrease in reliance on imported fertilisers or fertiliser production materials.

The main principle of these systems is that the soil is no longer disturbed by mechanical action, and is always kept covered by former crop residues and dead or living mulch, and the main intention is to increase organic matter and stop soil erosion. Mechanical actions (hoeing, ploughing) are replaced by biological improvement of soil structure by rooting systems of cover crops which improve soils stru cture, increase below grou nd insects and microbial communities and recycle nutrients deep in the soils. If the quantity of mulch is sufficient then weeds are also controlled and water av ailability for crops increases. The ze ro tillage system's are now common in broadacre agricultural areas where machinery has been designed for direct seeding and fertilizing and herbicides used for mulch control. The uptake of the DMC systems in small holder systems is less common, but has been demonstrated to be possible, productive and economic in the Lao PDR. However, the DMC systems require that the principles are applied creatively within each particular agro- ecosystem. Scaling-up of DMC systems must be base d on the understanding of the agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions under which alternatives are adopted and implemented at the local level. Thus, development of specific systems which are feasible and productive on the Nakai plateau, and especially in the resettlement area, will take time to develop, an d will require research and onfarm trials on the main components of the cropping system, which include (a) Soils management and land preparation The DMC system replaces ploughing and scarification with the production and management of mulches - organic matter covering the ground, wh ich could come from crop residues, or plants established to produce mulch such as grasses - which actually also have a forage function. This mulch management often include the use of a herbic ide ('glyphosate') although over time villagers may develop systems which do not require herbicide use. The system replaces convectional planting techniques with specialised plante rs as shown in Figure 21-6. (b) Crop management techniques While crop sowing dates and plant density may ch ange only slightly under DMC systems, special emphasis must be given to the development of notational and annual crop sequencing which will enhance mulch management and soils fertility. Cr op management will also reduce economic risk and climatic risks Many options are available when using additional crops cover crops) but for smallholders a integrated cropping and lives tock system is often mist suitable. (c) Thematic adjustments Finally, as in conventional systems, an understanding of the best and adapted cultivars must be developed, and especially the required fert iliser regimes and application methods. Challenges to the development of this DMC system in the Nakai resettlement area include the paucity of soils nutrients and organic matter means that the DMC systems alone may take time to show significant improvement in soil fertility . given the rather poor natural grow th of natural vegetation on the plateau, will significant mulch be able to be develop to prevent erosion ? the more intensive management - change for villagers ? On the other hand, shifting cultivators do not plough the soils at the moment, bu t rather dibble the seed, which is a rudimentary form of direct sowing. In DM C systems, these dibbling systems must be improved, probably by the used of specialised machines. Exam ples of DMC rotational systems which could possibly be developed in the Nakai resettlement area include: eg i: Annual crop and forage association: ca sh crop (maize) associated with forage specie ( B. ruziziensis ) to increase fodder resource: 2 years of forage and 1 year (wet seas on) of a maize or sorghum crop. eg ii: Annual crop and forage association: ca sh crop (maize) associated with forage specie ( B. ruziziensis ) to be used as cover crop for the next cycle. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 16eg iii: two annual crops - early season legume (mun g, peanuts) or other crop sesame) followed by a longer an main wet season grain crop - maize or sorghum, to be used later as animal feed. Figure 21-6: Direct Seeding through Mulch usin g a Hand-Jab Seeder; Maize / Sorghum emerging through Mulch (photos courtesy of CIRAD). The main areas or zones where these DMC systems, inte grated with cattle grazing of cut and carry forage production, will be tested and devel oped, and then expanded as appropri ate, will be in areas currently under degraded to very degraded forest in the Resettlement Area. Th ere may be between 2,500 to 4,000 ha of such areas in the Resettlement Ar ea (within that approximately 7,000 ha defined as 'degraded forest'). However, there will be competition with other uses of these areas. For exampl e, permanent pasture may be one use (although these could also be used as fallow for annual crops in trhe DMC system), while natural regeneration or plantations of native trees and NTPCs - bong bark and cardamom for example - may be another preferred use. Thus, the uptake of DMC in the rainfed areas of th e Resettlement Area and the use of the rest of the currently degraded forest areas will be a matter of trialling and village choice (see Chapter 19 for the on-going FLUPAM process). 21.5.3 Reservoir Drawdown Zone Agriculture Analysis of reservoir area maps (developed on a based of 5 m contour intervals), and the operation of the reservoir which is predicted to range from a full su pply level of 538 masl to 526 masl - or a 12 m drop annually - suggest that a large area of land will be inundated by the reservoir only for some months of the year. These areas are exposed as the reservoir is drawin g down in the dry season, or progressively filling up in the wet season. In fact, areas between 538 to around 536 masl will in some yea rs not even be inundated (see Figure 21-7 and 21-6). However, only in that the area above 530 m asal (approximately) is considered as possible to grow crops. While the exact nature of this drawdown zone of th e reservoir is difficult to predict, and will only be known after some years of operation of the reservoir, the drawdown zone could include the following types: (a) areas in the southern edge of the main reservoir wh ich may be subject to erosion, especially in areas of slope > 5 %; (b) low areas which are very flat and may remain as swamps during the dry season - this would be the case for lower areas, say below 530 masl; and (c) higher areas of very gentle slope, or areas in the small embayments not subject to wind and wave, which could develop as seasonal grassl and, seasonally flooded forests etc. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 17 Figure 21-7: Annual Fluctuations of Nakai Reservoir Surf ace Water Elevations and Reservoir Surface Water Areas. 524526528530532534536538 JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN MonthReservoir Water Level (masl) 4686126166206246286326366406446 Water Surface Area (km2) Dry Year Level Wet Year Level Average Year Level Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 18 Figure 21-8: Drawdown Areas in Main Reservo ir and Areas Close to Resettlement Area. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 19It is this third ecological zone that could be developed for agriculture, in two general seasons and systems, as follows: 1: during the dry season, as the reservoir is reced ing. Crops could be planted into the wet soils. for short season crops they may mature on wet soils alone. For longer season crops, they could be provided with supplementary irrigation. The most likely crops grown would be short season grain crops, short season legume crops, vegetable crop s in small areas, and dry season paddy rice in bunded rice fields. The supplementar y irrigation could be provided by: (a) a supplementary pipe or canal from the main irrigation systems - in cases where the drawdown zone utilised is contiguous with the main irrigated cropping; or (b) small dams or gully stops holding water from the receded reservoir, as is done around the Great Lake of Cambodia. 2: during the early wet season, befo re the reservoir is filled again (as it is progressively being filled) there will be large areas of exposed land receiving early wet season rains. In selected and appropriate areas, villages could grow short se ason crops such as maize, peanuts etc, as they currently do along the banks of rivers before they flood (e.g. the Xe Bangfai) or in their upland fields. The total area of possible drawdown lands immediately below (contiguous with) the Resettlement Area and which could possibly be utilised in this way has been tentatively been assessed by GIS mapping (see Figure 21-6) to be; area of drawdown land between 530 to 535 masl = 1,258 ha area of drawdown land between 535 to 538 masl = 1,045 ha For planning purposes, it is assume d that around 60 % will be either t oo steep, subject to erosion or for some other reason not suitable fo r copping, thus leaving about 1,380 ha of drawdown zone which may be suitable for cropping. 21.5.4 Crop Seed and Varieties Seed of improved varieties of all crops will be provided by the Project. Seed of im proved selections of legumes and maize will be accessed many sources, including Had Dokkeo Vegetable Research Station, Na Phok National Agricultural Research Station in Vientiane municipality and the new Khammouane seed production station. At Had Dokkeo the maize variety LV N10 has proved successful in achieving yields in excess of 5 tons per ha in field trials. This is a hybrid variety bred at the National Maize Research Institute in Vietnam where they have also developed composite va rieties, which would be more suitable since they would avoid the necessity for re-purchasing of seed ev ery year. Priori to promoting any variety, simple on- farm variety trials will be conducted in each villag e to compare the performanc e of varieties under the fertility and climatic conditions of the plateau. Examples of current varieties include the peanuts varieties of Mock Kay, Khor Kean and Tong Nang, which have given unshelled yields of up to 2 tons per ha, the mungbean th e variety VC 1468 which has yielded from 1.2 to 2 tons per ha, and the soybeans va riety Chiang Mai 1 can yield up to 1.2 tons per ha.. Seeds of many vegetable crops and varieties are commercially available in Laos or in Thailand, although most of these are hybrids. They would provide the best yield potential and it will be necessary to ensure that households would have reliable supplies of the seed in future years when they become responsible for providing their own inputs. Rice varieties that are currently in use on the plateau under both upland culture as well as irrigated paddy are all glutinous varieties and most are photoperiod sensitive. These trad itional varieties have a low yield potential, although through selection by the farmers they are well adapted to the local growing conditions. In the case of irrigated paddy, they are growing the same varieties in both the wet and dry seasons, although the area planted in the dry season is very small. However, because of the low temperatures in December and January short season cold tolerant va rieties should be used. Planting normal varieties Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 20earlier than this and exposing them to temperatures of less than 15o C can result in them not flowering. It will be necessary to test a number of varieties prio r to identifying those that should be multiplied. While initially, seed will be purchased, the project w ill develop its own sown seed production facilities on the plateau.. Aside from the hybrid vegetable crops farmers will need to be encouraged to retain seed of the improved varieties of the field crops from their own crops for use in future seasons. 21.5.5 Fruit Tree Propagation Local and improved fruit tree varieties have, and will continue to be tested on the plateau to assess their adaptability and productivity on the plateau. Based on these and on farm results and farmers requirements, the project is encouraging the multiplication of fruit trees at the pilot farms and Village and in villages themselves, so that the pl ateau (and its farmers) become the main source of seedlings of fruit trees for distribution to farmers (as part of their entitlements). Training in nursery management is and will continue to be provided to interested farmers who wish to establish their own nursery. 21.5.6 Fertiliser Materials Because of the limitation of the soils in terms of thei r erosion susceptibility, high acidity, poor nutrient content low CEC, high absorption of P they will n eed careful management duri ng the initial years of development. As the soils have high inherent acidity that will ad versely affect crop growth , the Project will provide limestone for the initial treatment of the soil prior to the commencement of land and crop development in the resettlement sites. The extent of the need for furt her applications of limestone in subs equent years will need to be carefully monitored by soil sampling and pH testing. This District Agricultural and Forestry Office (DAFO) will support this activity by establis hment and operation of a simple soils laboratory. However, it is envisaged that the liming treatment will not be required beyond the third year of cultivation so that the input costs of the lime will all be bor ne by the Project and will not be a burden to the households in the subsequent years. No liming should be necessary on the irrigated paddy land as the anaerobic conditions caused by the flooding of these soils in itself results in a stabilisation of the pH at an acceptable level for paddy production. The use of heavy applicati ons of organic fertiliser will be necessary to build soil organic matter, and to improve the nutrient holding capacity, which in turn will also improve the buffering capacity of the soil to enable the pH to stabilise at an acce ptable level. Producing large amou nts of organic fertiliser will be a substantial task for the households, and the project will initially produce and provide this fertiliser by the establishment of organic, compost fertiliser factory, similar to that developed in the Pilot Village. If rates of application of at least 1 ton are applied on ea ch 0.5 ha plot this will entail the production of on average over 30 tons of organic fertiliser each year in each village. However, during the first three years higher rates of application, about 2 to 3 tonnes per ha, will be applied. Farm generated animal manures will eventually have to become the main source of organic fertilisers, although the systems whereby villagers raise there ca ttle and other livestock - ex tensive, range feed or more intensive and based on the irrigation areas - w ill largely determine the extent and the way that these animal manures and used and processed before application. As experience and understanding is developed, and soil organic matter and buffering capacity is improved, the use of inorganic fertilisers will consid ered. The use of compou nd inorganic fertiliser will be necessary particularly for paddy, maize and vegetable crops that w ill counteract the low levels of phosphate as well as supplying addi tional nitrogen to supplement that supplied by the organic fertiliser. The commercially available 15.15.15 may be appropriate, and rates of application of 50 kg per ha applied as a basal dressing during land preparation would be likely. For irrigated paddy where higher rates of nitrogen would be required to optimise yields a top dressing of 50 kg per ha of urea should also be Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 21applied3. If required during the transition phase, the use of the inorganic fertiliser will be funded by the Project.. Subsequently, if the households revert to lower input levels it has been assumed that they would not maintain the use of chemical fertiliser but wo uld revert to the use of only organic fertiliser. The soils are also low in phosphate, so that significant additions of either rock phosphate or dolomite will be added , either as basal dressing of in-hole applications. The introduction of leguminous field crops , as well as the planting of perennial leguminous species as hedgerows to stabilise the terraces will all contribute to building the nitrogen reserves of the soil. However, careful observation of the nodulation of the le gume field crops should be used to determine the need for inoculation of the seed. This applies most particularly to Soybeans where the rhizobium may not be present in soils where this crop has not previously been planted. Incorporation of crop residues into the soil after harvest will also contribute to increasing the inherent soil fertility or alternatively allowing livestock to graze on the harvested areas. However, if livestock are allowed into the area the leguminous hedgerows may prove to be more attractive grazing th an the crop residues. The foliage of the hedgerows will be better utilised as a part of a cut and carry system. 21.5.7 Pest and Disease Control On the plateau there is little if any use of pesticides and in the resettlement sites the crops will, as far as possible continue to be grown without the use of pesticides. The intensification of the cropping patterns inevitably will increase the incidence of crop pests and diseases and this will apply particular to some vegetable crops. However, there are effective IPM approaches that can be effective in controlling particular pests 4. There will be programs of farmer training to support the introducti on of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) to enable them to minimise pestic ide use. The principles of IPM will be taught using the well established approach of Farmer Field Schools, which will be the basis for the delivery of all farmer training whereby an emphasis is placed upon practical based teaching in the field rather than classroom based training. Producing organic vegetables on the Nakai plateau could enable the farmers to sell produce into niche markets in Vientiane or across the border in Thailand . There would be a need for assistance in sourcing and development market linka ges and establishing a marketing centre in Nakai where buyers could obtain their produce. 21.6 EXTENSION APPROACHES FOR CROP PRODUCTION One of the greatest challenges to the intensification of the farming sy stems and cropping patterns will be the motivation of the farmers to adopt the new forms of (sedentary) agriculture. A wide range of extension approaches and developm ent assistance will be provided to ensure that the resettlers progressively adjust to, and adopt the system s. The extension approach should focus on involving the farmers in a participatory manner so that farmer training and technical inputs are in response to their needs. The extension strategy proposed relies heavily on the use of Farmer Field Schools and the identification of Farmer Leaders, Village Livestock Agents., etc., who can themselves fulfil some of the functions of the field extension staff, and the development of trials and demonstration areas, as described below. Inputs The project will support the following inputs , mainly during the early years after resettlement to enable the households to establish their livelih ood on their farm lot and gain expe rience. The physical inputs will comprise the following: seed of improved varieties of all crops will be provided; agricultural lime will be applied to all farm lots at the time of initial land preparation to counteract the inherent high acidity of the soils; 3 These rates of application are indicative only, and quite modest. They will effectively supply only 7.5 kg per ha of N, P and K respectively from the 15.15.15 supplemented by 23 kg per ha of N from the Urea topdressing applied to the paddy. There is no precise information on the chemical composition of the organic fertiliser. 4 One example is the control of control of Diamond Back Moth which attacks Brassica crops by the use of the parasitic wasp Trichogramma pretiosum that can be released into the area. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 22 organic fertiliser materials will be supplied for all cr ops and chemical fertiliser s supplied for specific crops in particular to address phosphate deficiencies; provision of hoes and other simple tools; provision of power tillers, and of direct seeding tools; and all of the farm lots will be supplied with irrigation water, and the costs of this support will be borne by the Project including the ongoing maintenance an d pumping costs, although after the first three years the villagers will be expected to contribute some nominal fee for use of the irrigation waters. Technical support The joint support from TAs and traine d Provincial and District staff will ensure there is a high level of technical supervision to the agri cultural development activities within the resettled villages. Research and trial areas in each village As discussed previously, the development of the ne w cropping and livestock systems will present certain technical (and social) ch allenges. Thus, there will be a need to esta blish a program of research and trails in range of subjects including; crop cultivars; fertiliser rates; mulch management etc for DMC; new types of crops; methods for terrace management, etc This program will be managed by TA team , and established in two general ways: (a) research trails on dedicated research sites, linked closely to selected villages (an example of this is already established within th e Nong Boua pilot village ; and (b) on farm trials, where the various components are tested in farmer fields Demonstrations plots Demonstration plots will be developed on actual farmer fields, with leading or innovative farmers, to provide examples of possible crops, and their main agronomic requirements of them. Such demonstration plots, or model farms, will be de veloped in each village to provide convincing demonstrations to the farmers of appropriate practices and crop management. These demo plots are also a useful tool for the conduct of these FFSs, with visits to the farmers' own farm lots being a part of the regular training sessions to discuss particular problems that have occurred alongside the organisation of additional on- farm trials and demonstrations. Farmer Field Schools Farmer Field Schools will be established as the vehi cle for providing training to farmers on improved cultural practices, and to ensure that training on particular commodities extends for the duration of the production cycle, with the training being conducted on a regular basis in the field timed to coincide with critical growth stages. This will en able farmers to learn how to achiev e optimum plant densities, raising and transplanting vegetable seedlings, fertiliser application, weed control and post-harvest practices. In general FFSs should be conducted with groups of farmers that number less than 25. This is to ensure that there can be good interaction within the group during each training sessions and it is easier to monitor the attendance of all the farmers at each training session. One of the important tasks of the AEWs, who will be the main facilitators of the FFSs, will be to motivate the farmers and seek their continued interest in attending the training sessions. However, the AEWs can use the regular attendance at the training sessions as a condition for the continued release of inputs to the households during the first three years. Normally, each FFS is concluded with the conduct of a graduation ceremony where farmer are awarded a certificate that gives them some prestige as having successfully completed the training. However, the AEWs may wish to keep the groups of fa rmers from the FFS intact to provide a vehicle to the continued provision of extension support, and also the conduct of other FFS that may deal with other commodities. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 23A program of Cross Visits for the farmers to other areas will be im plemented, although there seem to no other examples of this type of irrigated agriculture on terraced uplands in other parts of Laos at present. However, enabling farmers to visit established resettled villages will be a useful way of introducing them to the approach for the development of the farm lots in their ow n resettled areas. 21.6.1 Risks and Assumptions As already described, the introduction of intensive cr opping patterns and sedentary agriculture will incur a number of risks: (a) Resettled households may not be prepared init ially to adopt the intensive cropping patterns to maximise the utilisation of their farm lots. This is a risk that has been highlighted in the discussion and has been observed in the Pilot Village where there has been a tendency for example to continue to plant upland rice, in some cases as an intercrop with maize. By providing full support to the resettled households in the form of inputs as well as Food for Work Programs as a contribution towards their labour particularly during the initia l land clearing and preparation it is intended that households will learn from experience and training programs and be encouraged to intensify their cropping patterns. (b) The optimum levels of inputs that are prov ided to resettled households through Project support may not be sustained. This is risk that in subsequent years, particularly with respect to the amounts of fertiliser, villagers to not maintain the levels of inputs supported by the project in the transition period. However, in the computations of Gross Margins and subsequent calculation of farm incomes, scenario's has been developed that depicts a reversion to lower input use to assess the impact of this change on the household income. (c) Households are prepared to develop their farm lo ts and work to improve the soil conditions in order to increase productivity. Applying and incorporating organic fertiliser will be a continuing need for a number of years. Again this is a practice that can be promoted during the initial years when support is being provided but it will require sustained exte nsion efforts in future ye ars to ensure that the households do maintain the practi ce. Adoption rates will be depend ent on the improvement in soil structure and crop productivity that can be achieved during the first three years. (d) Levels of productivity can be achieved for the recommended crops. Assumptions have been made on yields for each of the crops examined. In ge neral these have been kept at a modest level and in the analysis of farm incomes assumptions have been made in relation to a medium level of yield at each level of input usage. The results from the Demonstrati on Farm and Pilot village have provided some guide to the likely level of yields that can be achieved. (e) Irrigation potential of the soils. Detailed soil surveys have not been conducted in each resettlement area but the results from the Pilot Village indicate that it will be feasible to irrigate dry season crops provided, soil conditions can be improved. In the resettlement areas to the north the soil conditions appear to be rather more favourable for irrigated crop production. In the comparison of the farm incomes for different cropping patterns it has been assumed that there may be a gradual increase in dry season irrigated areas as the farmers gain experience as well as the soils conditions improving. 21.7 PILOT VILLAGE EXPERIENCE TO DATE Experience gained in the Nong Noua Pilot Village is presented in detail in Appendix J. The following section summarises the results and experience of the pilot village agriculture programme. The development of agriculture in the pilot villages has in summary taken the following course: \u0099 2002/03 dry season: clearing of the land and first layout of contouring; \u0099 2003 wet season: pilot and limited scale wet cropping; \u0099 2002/03 dry season: pilot vegetable produc tion around a gu lly stop dam/pond; preliminary planting of fruit trees etc.; \u0099 2003 wet season: first full scale season cropping; \u0099 2003/04 dry season: first irrigated vegetable production using new irrigation system; follow up planting of fruit tress; \u0099 2004 wet season: 2nd wet season of full cropping; Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 24\u0099 2004/05 dry season: 2nd seasons of irrigated vegetable growing. 21.7.1 Wet Season Cropping in the Pilot Village The 2003 wet season crop plantings in Ban Nong Boua are presented in Table 21-5, which shows that a total of 1.59 ha of upland rice (13 families), 3.97 ha of maize (all 27 families), 1. 83 hectares of peanuts (all 27 families) and 1.82 hectares of blac k bean (25 families) were planted. Yields were monitored through sampling of four 3m * 3m areas within each farmer's plot. The average maize yield was 1.7 t/ha, ranging from 1.0 to 2.3 t/ha . With low input medium yields are expected to be around 1.5 t/ha, while high inputs (improved seed, ch emical fertiliser and more organic fertiliser) would expect a medium yield of 3.0 t/ha.. Yields for unsh elled peanuts were in average 1.1 t/ha and ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 t/ha. In summary, yields of maize and peanuts were only fai r, and will have to be impr oved if the cropping of these crops would prove to be viable alternative to ri ce growing. One reason for low yields is that farmers planted a mixture of local and improved varieties of corn, and planting in such mixtures crop agronomy is difficult. Peanuts were considerably attacked by soil insects, a problem which should decrease after a couple of years of cropping.

At this stage, vegetables rather than fi eld crops are normally grown during this dry season, and for many vegetables it is possible to plant and harvest two crops over the duration of the dry season. Table 21-7 provides details of the number of vegetable seedlings planted by each family in the first round of vegetable planting in the 2003-2004 dry season. This was the first season that vegetables have been grown on Ban Nong Boua Pilot village by utilising the newly constructed irrigation system. The main vegetables planted were cabbage, chilli, tomato, cucumber and eggp lant, with smaller quantities of broccoli, kale, lettuce and herbs also grown. Table 21- 9 presents the technical pl an for 2004-05 dry season cropping. 21.7.3 Fruit Trees While some fruit trees were planted in 2002, most trees were planted in 2003, and all households planted various quantities of a number of fruit trees, includ ing pomelo (total of 325), lychee (total of 178), lime (total of 302), jack fruit (total of 135), mango (total of 194), rose apple (total of 18) and longan (total of 16), as detailed in Table 21-8. The average number of trees planted is about 43 trees per family, considerably less that the 72 trees per family that wa s envisaged in the earlier RAPs. This is because the profitability of fruit trees is not ye t fully understood or proven, and th us the plantings to date are more trial plantings. If, over the years, any family considers that fruit trees are suitable in terms of labour requirements and profitability, then they will have the option to plant more trees and manage their farm plot as an orchard. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 26In addition, most households planted pineapple, while only a minority of households planted banana, rose apple and longan. These fruit tress were planted from end of April to mid June.

Of these 15 families with buffaloes, th e average ownership is 15 head per family. 6 families have significant numbers, 20 or more head of buffalo. Only 2 families have cattle - cows - and these are all from the Project. Thus, pre relocation, none of the families had cows. Only 12 families ha ve pigs, and 9 of these received their pigs from the project.

The excess land is absorbed for the constr uction of terraces. However, the plots vary in shape and only 14 % of them are roughly square to rectangular. About 58 % of the plots are irregular and about 28 % are long and narrow. Such variation, due to the topographic variations in the size, presents problems for farm plot development. There have been additional problems in preparing designs for bench terracing, in construction of terraces and the irrigation water distribution within individual the farm plots. Apart from varying in shape, the plots also vary in slope. The maximum slope is around 15 %, most are in the range of 6 to 10 %, although some plots are relatively flat. In addition, the slopes ca n also vary within an individual plot, and the soils in the area are very light and sandy. These physical characteristics have created two major problems: The occurrence of soil erosion (although still rather limited) on the steeper slopes; and Supply of irrigation water to the bottom of the longer plots. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 29 In recognition of the importance of bench terraces for (a) dry season irrigation of the farm plots, and (b) development of paddy rice, the 2003/ 04 dry season saw a dedicated effo rt to better development of the bench terraces and formation and compaction contours. 21.8 LARGE LIVESTOCK RAISING 21.8.1 Current buffalo and cattle raising The best estimate of cattle and bu ffalo populations and ownership in the 17 villages comes from the 1998 census, when it estimated that the total number of buffalo was 4,300 and for catt le 351 (see Table 21-11). While the average buffalo ownership was 3.6 per household some villages like Bang Nong Boua and Ban Done reporting 18.5 and 12.4 per household respective ly. Buffalo ownership is highly skewed with about 60 % of households having no large livestock, while some individuals have very large herds (see Chapter 10). Data collected by Nakai district in 2002 reflect similar gross numbers (4 ,168 buffaloes in total).

A small proportion of adults are used for draft purposes in those villages which have permanent rice fields. Nonetheless, livestock play an important role as a source of income contributing 36% of total cash income in 1996 and in 2002. Table 21-12: Number of Buffaloes and Cattl e sold from the 15 Nakai Villages, 2000-2004. 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Buffaloes 404 492 537 530 641 Cattle 9 18 23 19 35 Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 30At present these animals are able to gr aze over an area of at least 57,000 ha5 with a stocking rate of 1 animal to 12.2 ha. This level of stocking is certainly sustainable, based upon visual observation of both pasture condition and stock condition as of mid dry season. A shortage of feed is reported by some farmers from March through May corresponding with the middle to the end of the dry season but this appears to be as much a function of how far the farmers are prepared to graze their animals from the village as it is an absolute shortage of feed. 21.8.2 Existing Forage Production Potential The inundation of the Nakai plateau to form the Nakai reservoir will re sult in the loss of 45,000 ha of prime grazing and other habitat for buffalos. Due to th is inundation, it is generally assumed that buffalo raising in the future will be restricted to a smaller area and thus it will be difficult to raise the same or more buffaloes than currently raised. This assumption, ho wever, may not be correct. An estimate of the current forage in the resettlement area was made in 1997 (Margules Poyry) whose data is set out in Table 21-13. This table estimates the current forage potential of the resettlement area without pasture improvement interventions.

This estimate does not include the use of the drawdown zon e of approximately 9,600 Ha. Note: Animal Numbers vary with other Tables due to use of 1996 Census The table shows that while the grazin g conditions and area in the Rese ttlement Area will be more limited than at present, the area may still be able to carry the cu rrent herd sizes, althou gh there may be other factors, especially water availability, which, if undeve loped, will limit the carrying capacity in this area. Thus, the livelihood strategy , in recognition of the social and economic significance of the buffalo, the Resettlement area will be developed to allow both intensive livestock raising (in conjunction with the development of the more intensive farming systems which ha ve been described in the previous section) and extensive livestock grazing in the general resettlement area. Most resettlers should be able to retain their current he rd size, although it is expected that those families with very large herds currently will have to decrease the size of their herds immediately after inundation until such time as the actual grazing potential and management systems, are more clearly understood or developed. 5 This area includes the main plateau - and future reservoir area - and the gentle uplands which will become the Resettlement Ar ea on the SW side of the reservoir, but excludes the 10,010 ha of upper dry evergreen and mixed forest types. The area on the NE side of the reservoir has been excluded from the calculation since it is more densely forested and provides little grazing and its utilisation is constrained by the adjacent NPA. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 3121.8.3 Potential for improved forage production The grazing potential of the resettlement area and thus stocking rate of the order suggested by Table 21-13 will be close to the sustainable long term carrying capacity of the area. Thus, if: the forage potential predictions are overly optimistic; and/or the total number of large animals raised needs to be increased so that the resettlement area can not only 'feed' the current numbers of buffalo but an increase total numbers due to the provision of cattle to resettlers who currently ha ve no buffaloes (as an entitlement), ... then there would be a need to develop the forage production of the Resettlement Area. A number of possible methods for increasing the producti on of improved forage have been identified, such as: Establishment of intensive cut-and-carry fora ge plots, mainly in the irrigated area; Utilisation of the reservoir draw-down areas for graz ing of natural pasturage growth, or of semi- aquatic plants planted by the project; Improved pasture production from the agro-forestry areas, for the upland areas in the Resettlement Area; Establishment of tree and shrub legumes in th e agro-forestry areas of the Resettlement Area; The use of Urea treated rice straw, placement of urea blocks and development of watering holes or points to enhance utilisation of forages. Intensive forage production in irrigated farm plots There are two scenarios that will be considered for the production of forage in the irrigated farm plots; \u0099 the establishment of perennial swards; and \u0099 the planting (cropping) of annual or semi-annual forage crops. In both cases, the utilisation will be mainly by cu t-and-carry in order to ma ximise dry matter production and stand life, and to avoid erosions or other problems due to animal trampling. Free range but manage grazing, may, however be possible in very flat areas of irrigated pasture. For the establishment of a perennial sward, the best option in terms of yield and quality is likely to be Braciharia sps, and Elephant or Napier Grass ( Other Guinea Grass ( Panicum maximum ). It would be desirable to include legumes in the sward and the best alternatives to initially that may have application in a mixed sward include Glenn American Joint Vetch Cavalcade and Bundey. However, none of these types have been evalua ted for the suitability to the local environment. . For the Elephant Grass, the establishment would be by vegetative cuttings, and using seed for the other species planted or sown into a well prepared seedbed treated with basal applications of lime and phosphate. Nitrogen use could also be economic, but the rate of application should be related to the legume composition of the sward. However, there are two situations where annual forage crops may be preferable to perennials grass swards. Firstly, when it is necessary to establish a bulk of forage quickly at the start of the resettlement process while the perennial stands of grasses or legumes ar e establishing. Secondly, during the cooler months (November to March) the production of grass and legume perennial swards may be insufficient to meet requirements. The establishment of the annual forage crops would be by seed sown into a well prepared seedbed treated with basal applications of lime and super phosphate wi th nitrogen applications (or organic fertiliser). Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 32Using the above scenarios the production of 15,000 to 20,000 kg DM/ha/year would be quite feasible under irrigated and fertilised cond itions. The production would peak during the warmer summer months although the inclusion of the cool season forage as annual crops would provide compensation for this during the colder months. The main constraint to ensuring this level of productivity would be related to the reliability of the irrigation water supply during the dry season as well as the availability of fertilisers and the willingness of the farmers to purchase these for the production of non-food crops after the Project withdraws direct support after the transition period. Stall feeding of cattle and buffalo would also represent a shift in the style of management for some resettled households, involving a shift from relatively extensive to intensive production systems. Labour demands associated with stall feeding can be considerable. Reservoir drawdown zone forages The drawdown areas may have potential for two type of forage: (a) those that grow naturally; and (b) those that are planted and established. Obviously, the higher areas, areas which are inundate d for less period of time (say, above 530 or 535 masl) may have better potential for plant survival. Thus, this forage would be available primarily from the mid dry season - as the reservoir level drops and drawdown areas become exposed - to the early to mid wet season before the reservoir fills up again. This would coincide precisely with the time of the year when feed in the dryland areas (especially good quality feed) is most scarce and animal live-weights are declining during a period when nutrition is below maintenance levels. Thus, this drawdown area may provide a very important and high potential contribution to animal production. The extent to which the drawdown area can be ut ilised for grazing will depend on two main factors. Firstly, the aquatic and semi-aquatic varieties will not su rvive in more than 3 to 4 m of water of standing water. If the usable drawdown area is restricted to the area between 538 and 535 m, the available area reduces to only 9,600 ha and most of this area will be ex posed for at least 3 to 4 months of the year during the mid to late dry season. Second ly, the areas on the far side of th e reservoir will be inaccessible as grazing land for the resettled villages aside from th eir proximity to the NCBA which further complicates the utilisation of that side of the reservoir. If a radi us of 9 km from the resett led areas is introduced the potential area of drawdown grazing area will reduce to approxim ately 4,500 - 5,000 ha. Based upon research that has been conducted 6 the possible aquatic and semi-aquatic grasses that couldbe introduced and thrive in can survive prolonged periods of immersion in water up to 4 to 5 m deep. Aleman Grass will perform be st in depths of less than 3 m. Para Grass is likely to be the most suited to areas immediately below the FSL that are waterlogged for relatively short periods of time. Most of these forages can be relatively easily esta blished by vegetative means. Stock will need to be excluded during establishment to prevent damage to the young stand and this may take several years. Also the grazing should only take place during the mid to late dry season. Grazing during the wet season or too early in the dry season, when the ground is still exce ssively wet, may result in damage to the stand. However, during these periods the areas which support growth of naturally occurring swards could be grazed. Thus, the utilisation of any fo rage grown in the drawdown areas will need to be carefully managed to prevent overgrazing and to ensure that the pastures are not excessively damaged or destroyed. This will not be an easy task since there will be no individual ownership of the drawdown areas and this form of grazing control will be a totally new concept to the resettled households. The use of single strand electric tapes to keep cattle off wet shoreline areas of the reservoir that have been planted with improved forage may be one approach that could be piloted but there would remain a need for community support for the concept. 6 Conducted by the Primary Industry Services, DBIRD, Northe rn Territory, Australia. See Appe ndix K-3 for further details. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 33Assessing the potential contribution of the drawdown areas for increased forage production before the reservoir has been filled is not an easy task. The main constraints to either the development or utilisation of the drawdown areas will include: (a) low inherent fertility of the soil and the low ba se nutrient status of the reservoir water; and (b) wave action causing in some areas, and deposit of silts in other, quieter area. However, even where stands can be successfully estab lished, or natural swards are established in the medium to long term, production is unlikely to ex ceed 2 to 3,000 kg DM/ha/year. Also, given that none of these forage species are currently growing in the ar ea, it will be necessary to establish some small-scale evaluation trials7. It will be necessary to compare the speci es under various ratios of immersion and exposure to evaluate their survival rate but using cu t-and-carry to estimate productivity rather than in-situ grazing trials. Forages in upland open and degraded forest areas The total area of the proposed rese ttlement site is 21,900 ha. Within this area 20,540 is forested out of which approximately half of the area consists of upper dry evergreen, upper mixed deciduous or mixed deciduous forest types. These forest types are generally denser and less suitable for grazing and should be managed solely for timber and NTFP production, with grazing livestock excluded. These denser forests types and also some other areas are too steep for grazing and herd manage ment, a total of about 6,000 ha Thus, while only surveys and experience will tell us a ccurately, the upland open fo rest or degraded forests areas that may be suitable for gr azing may be around 6,000 ha This grazing area includes the mixed deciduous/pine forest type, unstocked areas of degraded forest and existing grassland. Aside from their utilisation for grazing, the forest ar eas will also be managed for timber production on a sustainable yield basis. This may involve natural, una ssisted regeneration or enrichment planting which will be carried out during the early years of the Project in order to improve the basic condition of the forest. Protection will be needed to be give n to young saplings while they are still within the browse height of the cattle. This could be achieved most effectively by sepa rating the forest to be ma naged by each village into compartments and grazing each compartment in turn for several years to allow undisturbed growth of the seedlings. Again this arrangement would require care ful community management to ensure success. The available forage comprises a mix of native grasse s, sedges, low shrubs and bushes. Dry season quality is generally low, providing not mu ch better than a maintenance ration, but improves during the wet season. Quality shows a marked improvement in areas th at have been recently fired, especially where Pek Grass ( Pennisetum alopecuroides) is dominant. However, invasion by Imperata cylindica and other relatively hard species of low palatability is apparent in areas that have been repeatedly fired, especially on the poorer sites under pine forest. The forest areas would be utilised fo r grazing during the wet seaspn when drawdown areas are inaccessible (from June to Dece mber). This seasonal utilisation should enhance total production and the persistence of any improved varieties that can be established, although it would be desirable if some degree of within-season rotational grazing could be introduced also. The project will improve the productivity of these grazing areas by the establishment of dryland forage species. The most likely grass and legume species that may have application under the mixed deciduous/pine forest include Guinea Grass similar environments indicates that es tablishment by over-sowing may not be successful. Thus, some initial soil cultivation may be required to incorporate the seed into the soil. Establishment without fertiliser may be feasible in localised areas with better soils, but in genera l, and particularly under stands of pine where the poorer so ils tend to occur, establishment wi thout fertiliser is likely to prove 7 The experience gained on other similar project should be sought and the Ubolratana Dam in NE Thailand, which has similar characteristics to the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir, would be a useful site to visit. Appendix K-4 documents the experience of the UNDP/UNDAC/IFAD Project in Xieng Khouang Province. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 34difficult. Areas where improved varieties are sown w ill be protected from grazing until plants are well established. In selected areas, and following tr ials, the establishment and use of fo rages will be integrated with DMC systems of rainfed cropping (see Section 21.5.2). The main constraints to forage produc tivity will be the low soil fertility as well as the difficulty of ensuring within-season rotational grazing. Thus, the potential for improving forage production from the forest areas may be limited without on-going inputs of phosphate and possibly also lime. Production is projected to increase by perhaps only 250 kg DM/ha/year, although this will only be verified by trials and experience to evaluate the productive potential gr ass and legume varieties for use under the mixed pine/deciduous areas, and in DMC systems. Leguminous fodder shrubs There are a range of shrub and tree legumes that can be grown satisfactorily in the Project area, potentially supplying a protein-rich supplement for feeding to lives tock. This will be particularly valuable in the mid- to-late dry season. Farmers will be encouraged to esta blish tree-shrub legumes around the periphery of the farm lots, the forage production areas and along the contour strips that are established on the terraces of the sloping lands. Species that will be used include Calliandra calothrysus, Femingia macrophylla, Glicidia sepium and Leucaena sp. will require the app lication of small amou nts of phosphate and they can be used for judicious feedin g to the highest return stock, which would normally be the fatteners, late pregnancy and lactating females as well as sick animals. Urea treated rice straw Fermentation of rice straw with urea (UTRS) is a well proven and relatively inexpensive technique for improving the quality of rice straw for feeding to cattle and buffalo. The key limitation on applying this technique in the Resettlement Area will be the supply of rice straw, its availab ility being dependent on the areas that are developed for irrigated paddy. Where this potential does exist, then UTRS will be promoted to farmers. The contribution to feed supply would be likely to be of the order of 2 to 3,000 kg DM of reasonable quality feed for each hectare of paddy grown. Mineral supplementation (mineral licks) Severe phosphorous deficiency in cattle and buffalo has been reported in the pine tree savannah grasslands of Xieng Khouang, which has resulted in lameness of animals, low productivity, and in extreme cases sudden death. Dramatic responses to feeding of bone meal and or TSP has been demonstrated. Although clinical symptoms of this nature are not repo rted within the Project area, there is a potential risk particularly in relation to the doubling of the stocki ng rate that will occur af ter the reservoir has been filled, and that the forage under the pi ne forest will constitute a far larger proportion of the total diet than at present. Responses to sodium, iodine and sulphur supplementation are also possible. Project Feed Balance for Forage Improvement in the Project Area The Project will support various forage development ac tivities which have been described above, and in summary these programs may provide the following forage production: Establishment of irrigated cut-an d-carry forage plots that have th e potential to produce 15,000 kg DM/ha/year, which from an area of 60 ha would produce 900 tons DM/year 8; Establishment of semi-aquatic pastures in the drawdown zone, which over an area of say 2,000 ha with a potential pr oductivity of 2,500 kg DM/h a/year, representi ng a total production 5,000 tons DM/year; Establishment of improved forage production in the forest areas producing an incremental production of 250 kg DM/ha/year, which from 6,000 ha would produce an extra 1,500 tons DM/year (in addition to the curre nt estimated 14,000 tons produced per year on these areas). The results of the combined strategy are summarised in Table 21-14, which shows a potential for a total increase of 7,400 Mt of forage or approximately 50 % more than the present carryi ng capacity. However, 8 Assumes that 10 % of households (approx. 120) adopt the in tensive buffalo/cattle production Combined Household Livelihood Model that develops the whole 0.5 ha area for cut-and-carry forage production in combination with 0.16 ha irrigated paddy. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 35this analysis is very sensitive to the success of the drawdown area strategy, which contributes 68 % of the increase in potential forage. This indicates a potential productivity of the areas that could be utilised and improved by the project, could be up to 22,000 tons DM/year. As discussed in a previous section the to tal DM feed requirement for the existing herd of 4,481 buffalo/ cattle is estimated at 12,100 tons DM/year9. At the existing levels of stocking this implies that there should not be an immediate constraint on th e availability of forage. However, this forage production depends on: (a) the development of forages in the drawdown areas, which may not be develo ped immediately; and (b) the development of grazing management and facilities in the rained upland and semi-forested areas, which is required in order to realize the potential grazing productivity of this area.

Total 22,335 21.8.4 Future Management of buffalo and cattle in the Resettlement Area In order to: (i) realize the grazing potential of the rainfed areas (open forest and degraded forests) of the Resettlement Area; and (ii) avoid degradation of the natural resource base in the area, ... it will be essential to develop (a) provide grazin g management and livestock raising facilities, (b) improve mechanisms for monitoring and managing the total livestock numbers, and (c) improving the ecological condition of the forest areas being grazed. The shift of the herds away from th e more suitable habitats on the lo wlands of the Nam Theun river will take place over at least five years as the reservoir slow ly fills so that more intens ive forage production can be introduced as is considered ne cessary by individual villages. Deci sions will need to be made about paddock management at the village le vel. The maximum carrying capacity of the area surrounding each resettlement village will be assessed in consultation wi th the villagers, and periodically reviewed on the basis of the monitoring data. Equitable mechanisms for restricting the number of buffalo or cattle owned per household may also need to be investigated. Of pa rticular importance will be some form of control on the number of animals that are brought on to the Plateau from outside areas. As the resettlers gain experience and knowledge of which systems are better suited to the specific environment in the vicinity of thei r villages they may also wish to us e more intensive forage production and increase or decrease the size of their herds of la rger livestock in relation to local carrying capacities. The project will assist on this process by undertaking the following activities: 9 This is computed as an average of 250 kg LW Buffalo and 200 kg Cattle and a daily DM requirement of 3 % of LW. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 36 development of water sources : One of the main determinant of ca ttle productivity is availability of drinking water. Thus, while forage may be availa ble in the resettlement area forests and degraded forest, cattle will be restricted to those areas with water. Thus, the project will develop watering points, by either/or (a) gully stop type dams on small creeks (which can also be used by buffalo, or (b) windmill type bore wells; the design and management of herds, possibly as large paddocks, and thus the provision of fencing; mineral licks: which are discussed in Section 21.8.3 above; development of a range of forage sources, which are further discussed in section 21.8.3; animal health, to reduce the current problems associated wi th parasites, liver fluke and worms, which is further discussed in section ?? 21.9 OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE LIVESTOCK PROGRAM 21.9.1 Animal Health Care While the native breeds of livestock that are raised on the plateau, notably the pigs and poultry, are well adapted to the poor standards of animal husbandry, they are not very productive and even these stocks sometimes suffer from high mortality rates due to disease. Strategies for improving animal health will include: Training of selected farmers in the administration of vaccinations and drugs treatments who can act as Village Livestock Agents (VLAs), charging no minal rates for their services from farmers. Supply of a basic kit of veterinary tools as well as supply of glass syringes in the form of veterinary boxes to all VLAs together with basic training on vaccination and drugs administration for all classes of livestock. Improvement of the facilities within the DAFO fo r storage of drugs and vaccines and a diagnostic laboratory. Supply of small refrigerators to all VEOs for the storage of drugs and vaccines for use by the Livestock Extension Workers (LEWs) and ultimately the VLAs. Farmers will have to be convinced of the benefits from improved livestock health care, and thus demonstrations in selected villages will be organised to focus subjects including: Calf worming : Farmers are generally reluctant to worm young calves that are still suckling, yet the high calf mortality experienced is most likely due to very high worm infestations. A simple program to worm calves from two weeks, and again at six weeks, three months and then regularly thereafter, would reduce calf mortality rates. Pig vaccination : High levels of mortality of pigs can be caused by the incidence of Swine Fever and Pastruella (Haemorragic Septicaemia). This can be reduced by the use of vaccines provided these are stored adequately under refrigeration. Although the DAFO has a program for the regular vaccination of pigs their limited operational funding results in a very low rate of vaccination on the plateau. Chicken vaccination : A dramatic improvement in the health management of poultry can be achieved by the introduction of the Heat Resistant Newcastle Disease (HR-ND) Vaccine that is commercially available from laboratories in Vietnam. The use of the vaccine needs to be demonstrated to show its effectiveness in selected villages. Being an oral treatment it avoids the necessity for vaccination of poultry and does not require cold storage to retain viability. 21.9.2 Housing and nutrition for small livestock Improving the nutrition levels of small livestock, pigs and poultry, will need to precede any efforts to promote an improvement in the breeding stock. In the case of pigs this will include the utilisation of grains and legumes that are produced from the farm lots. For the poultry, protein nutrition will be improved by incorporating legume seeds, which must be boiled prior to feeding, and the use of fish meal. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 37All small livestock will need to be provided with improved housing as an alternative to the present practice of allowing the animals to forage around the homestead. This will be part icularly important in the case of poultry in order to successfully raise day old ch icks. This will be done simply and effectively by the construction of small bamboo cages, elevated above ground level, in a protected or sheltered area close to their house, together with a 40W incandescent bulb to supply heat. Providing this form of supplementary heat will be important for the first week, most especially during the cooler months of the year. Similar cages could be used for day old ducklings. At six weeks the chicks need to be treated for ND and at seven weeks they can be released. At thirteen weeks they can be sold or consumed by the household, or kept for breeding. In the case of poultry, the Tam Hoang breed from Vietnam has proved productive in neighbouring provinces provided there is adequate attention to their feeding regime and health care. 21.9.3 Animal Breeding Programs Once significant progress has been made with improvement of the animal health care, alongside improved nutrition, then the productivity of small livestock will be improved by breeding. The main focus should be on pigs, poultry and promoting duck production fo r some areas where suitable conditions exist. The activities should include the following: Establishment of an small number of Animal Breeding Centre in the Resettlement Area, probably one in the northwest and one in the southeast. These will include: (a) maintenance of male Landrace, Large and Chinese type Boars that will either for hired out to farmers or for semen collection for direct AI services by the LEWs; (b) establishment of a small poultry hatcheries for cross breeding of appropriate chicken breeds with local breeds (for both meat and egg layers), the progeny (day old chicks) being distributed or sold at subsidised prices to villagers; and (c) breeding of aquatic species such as frogs, and eels. The small breeding centres will be provided with appropriate equipment, in cluding liquid nitrogen and flasks for storage of semen. 21.9.4 Extension Approaches for Livestock Development The provision of support services to livestock produc tion is the responsibility of the DAFO in Nakai town, and the NT2 project will improve and upgrade the services provided by DA FO by the provision of equipment, training, and technical and managerial advice. Substantial improvements in the provision of animal heal th care will be effected, as well as direct support of physical inputs to households to promote improved nutrition and management of their livestock. The following will be key elements in the exte nsion program for livestock development: Improving Animal Health care by training of LEWs together with a selected livestock raiser in each village, who will be trained as a Village Livestock Agent (VLA). The VLA will coordinate farmers' requests for routine vaccination of their calves, piglets and chicks to reduce mortalities. Training farmers on improved livestock husbandry through the conduct of FFSs in same way as for crops through regular training sessions. Establishment of demonstrations, managed by farmers, for pigs, poultry and ducks in selected villages to provide the venue for the conduct of the FFSs that also fe ature enhanced feeding regimes including the introduction of improved pasture and fodder production. Identification of households to act as bull caretakers who can receive payments from farmers for servicing their cattle. Development of procedures for a livestock dispersa l system for cattle and pigs where farmers must attend training prior to becoming recipients of animals and must make a commitment to re-disperse an agreed number of offspring to other fa rmers in return, who in tu rn have also undergone training. This process would enable a progressive dispersal of improved breeds throughout the resettled villages. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 38 Another feature of the extension program for livesto ck will be an emphasise on the integration of crop and livestock production so that ( a) crop by-products can be utilised fo r livestock feeding, (b) the use of the manure is maximised on the farm lot, and (c) forages can be used in DMC cropping systems. Thus, farmers will receive training on Integrated Irrigated Upla nd Diversified Cropping. 21.9.5 Risks and Assumptions The intensification of the livestock producti on systems may entail a number of risks: (a) Farmers may not be receptive to the concepts of improved animal health care and willing to pay for vaccinations. Improving animal health care must be the precursor to any attempt to improve nutrition and particularly the upgrading of stock and introduction of breeding programs. Convincing farmers of the need for regular vaccination, and particularly drenching of calves, can only be achieved through the extension service using farmers who agr ee to better health care for their livestock to demonstrate to others the benefits that are gained. Getting farmers to pay for vaccinations in the long term may prove difficulty and the provision of subsidie s for the vaccines may be an option to ensure their wide scale use. (b) Adequate supplies of vaccines can be supplied. Although there appear to adequate facilities at provincial level for storage of vaccines and sufficien t supplies of vaccines are available the increase in demand that will result from a more effective exte nsion program may result in shortages developing. There may be a need to source vaccines and drugs from private sources of supply either in Laos or in Thailand may become a necessity. (c) Farmers are willing to be trained as VLAs. The approach of using farmers as veterinary agents has been adopted successfully in other parts of Laos and should be equally acceptable on the Nakai plateau. The key to success is ensuring that the VLAs are able to receive some payment for the treatments that they provide so that the approach can be sustainable. 21.10 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND FARMING SYSTEMS INTEGRATION In order to: (a) present a summary of the production system by which a particular crop could be typically grown; (b) to compare the relative profitability of producing a range of crops in a typical irrigated farm plot; and (c) to compare the effect of a range of input levels and prices, and a range of production outputs and market prices, and as such provide sensitivity analysis. ... a series of individual Activity Models an d Gross Margins Budgets (AMs-GMBs) have been prepared that feature a total of 26 different annual an d tree crops, and 3 animal raising activities, as listed in Table 21-15 and presented in detail in Appendix K-5.

Appendix K-5 provides details of all individual GMBs generated to date, i.e. for all crops mentioned in Table 21-15. The Gross Margin Budgets/Activity Models have been developed in a format similar to the FARMOD application (FAO). In order to construct the AMs-GMBs a number of assumptions have been made, as follows: Scale: All of the GMBs (aside from the livestock mode ls) have been based upon an area of 0.1 ha. Those for irrigated paddy have been based upon 0.16 ha since this is the standard area that is to be given to each household. Input Costs: Price estimates have been made for the pr ices of seed, fertiliser materials, labour, irrigation costs, animal feeds, veterinary supplies and other equipment, based on information as of 2003, from Project staff and ma rket research in Thakhek, Vientiane and in Thailand. Varieties: These were identified throug h consultations with local research institutions as well as information from local staff on th e availability of improved varieties for annual crops as well as vegetables and fruit trees. Fertiliser Materials: Although it is proposed that there is to be a considerable reliance on the use of organic fertiliser materials for all crops there will be a need for the judi cious use of inorganic fertiliser materials in particular to address phosphat e deficiencies as well as soil acidity. Limestone will also be provided in the early years, but this has not been refl ected in the Activity Models. The use of organic fertiliser during th e subsequent years shou ld improve the buffer ing capacity of the soil and enable the pH to stabilise. Input Levels: In order to determine the range of productivity that might be achieved two input levels have been selected for the calc ulation of the Gross Margins. The Low Input Level involves (a) low application of inorganic fertilisers, (b) general use of local varieties and (c) less labour inputs for crop maintenance during the growing season. The alternate option - High Input Level - uses high er levels of organic fertiliser (applied as a split application), inorganic fertiliser used generally as a top dressing, improved varieties adopted where these are available and higher labour inputs for crop maintenance. Production Levels: The yields have been based upon reports from local staff and farmers, yields obtained generally in the Lao PDR, with the d ata from the Demonstration Farm and Pilot Village providing corroborating evidence. For both the Low and High Inputs three yield levels have been used to determine a range of potential Gross Margins. Labour Cost and Usage: While labour has been included in the Activity Models, two types of Gross Margins have been calculated, i.e. one with and one without the cost of labour. As for hire of draft animals / machines, this has been included for irrigated paddy (where it is assumed to be used) and excluded for all other crops, as it is anticipated that families will make use of animal draft power - either their own or provided through soft loans from the Project. Imputed Income: It has been assumed that some proportion of each co mmodity will be consumed by the household. The actual proportion that is assu med will be consumed is documented within each of the Gross Margin Budgets. The proportion of the production that is consumed is regarded as Imputed Income in the subsequent preparation of the combined Whole Farm Scenario. Project Support: The Gross Margins have been prepared in tw o ways. Firstly, on the assumption of full Project support for all inputs (seed, fertiliser materi als, irrigation costs, animal health care, etc.) during Years 1 to 3. Secondly, without Project support in the Post-Project period (Years 4 to 6) 10 the term Stability Phase, explained in de tail in Chapter 25, refers to cropping syst em after the Nakai reservoir is full and i n operation, and cropping systems have been developed over a number of years Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 40when the households would have to demonstrate self-reliance and the ability to generate sufficient income from their farms as a contribution to sustaining their livelihoods. Risk Analysis: In order to determine the element of risk involved in each comm odity two alternative scenarios have been constructed based upon 10 and 25 percent reduct ions in Farm Gate prices and upon 10 and 25 percent increases in Input Costs. The GMBs in Table 21-16 and Table 21-17 are presented each with a low and a high input level and with three levels of productivity (low, medium and high yield). For each scenario, the GMB is given with and without material cost (as the Project is paying for these the first three years) and with and without costing family labour.

From this analysis it is apparent that the vegetable crops offer considerably greater profitability than most of the annual field crops. Annual field crops doing well include peanuts, mungbeans, black beans, whereas the most profitable vegetables are garlic and water melon. The calculations assumes that the Project is bearing the cost of seed, fertiliser and pumping, which will be the case for the first three years after relocation. The figures further exclude the cost of family labour.

Appendix K-5 provides details of these GMBs.

The buffalo raising is largely based upon existing practi ces, but with improved health care. The pigs and poultry enterprises have remained as largely backyard activities, although with inputs to improve feeding and health regimes. The most promising enterprise is undoubtedly duck raising. However, this will only be feasible for a limited number of households. A GMB of buffalo raising (2 fatteners) is presented in Table 21-21. The buffalo fattening is based on forage production, and GMB is given with production co st (the first three years, as the Project is paying these) and without production cost (from year four onwards) and with and without costing family labour. The implication for those farmers who retain their buffalo herds and continue their extensive grazing practices is that returns to individual households will be in proportion to the size of the herd and also dependent on the number of animals sold during a gi ven year. Given to potential for current and future forage production it appears to be feasible to main tain the current level of annual sales of 641 heads (2004, see Table 21-12).

Those households without large livestock are to be given two animals as part of the project entitlement. Consequently, to obtain a total household income for the households retaining more than 2 animals, incomes would need to be increased in proportion to either their herd size and/or annual sales. As the household herd size is highly skewed some househol ds and villages will have substantially higher total incomes than others. This is discu ssed in more detail in Chapter 25. 21.11 WHOLE FARM SCENARIOS 21.11.1 Possible Integration of Crops a nd Forages on Irrigated Plots In order to make plans fo r the possible ways in which villagers ma y integrate cropping on their irrigated plots and raise their livestock in relation to these pl ots, a series of potential Cropping (and livestock) Systems have been developed for th e 0.66 ha farm lots, and these are termed Whole Farm Scenarios. They are intended to represent a range of ways in which resettlement families may use the 0.66 ha of irrigated land allocated to them. A total of 11 Whole Farm Scenarios (WFSs) have been developed, and these can grouped into six general groups. They are briefly presented below, whilst a more detailed description of each WFS is provided in Appendix K-6. Labour requirements by months are presented for each of the WFS in Appendix K-7. WFS 1: three variants - 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3: Cereal /Legumes with dry season Vegetable Production. These three WFSs represent a progressive intensification of the cropping pattern with increasing areas of legumes being grown and an increasing area planted to Vegetables in the dry season, with the eventual introduction of double cropping of dry season vegetables. WFS 2 two variants - 2.1 and 2.2: Fruit Production with Cereal/Legumes and dry season vegetable Production These two WFSs feature increased areas planted to fruit trees alongside double cropping of DS vegetables. WFS 3 two variants - 3.1 and 3.2: Industri al Crops with Cereal/Legume Production These two WFSs are based upon a coffee and tea, which are provided as examples only of perennial semi industrial crops, intercropped with legume production in the wet and dry season.. WFS 4 two variants - 4.1 and 4.2: Irrigate d Paddy with Legume/Vegetable Production Two WFSs based upon larger areas of irrigated paddy production, with or without water melon production in the dry season, together with wet season legume and dry season vegetable production. These WFSs would only be feasible on farm lots where the soil and topography favour an expansion of the irrigated paddy land. WFS 5: Pasture and Field Crops in Support of Intensive Buffalo/Cattle Production This WFS is based upon the establishment of pasture and legumes on the farm plot for use as cut and carry feeding of buffalo and/or cattle . The annual cropping is confined to the production of irrigated paddy. WFS 6: Intensive Duck Raising with Cereal/Legume/Vegetable Production This WFS considers the possibility of duck ra ising as the primary activity of household alongside annual cropping of maize on the WS and legumes and vegetables in the DS. This WFS would be suitable for households that have access to open water areas that can be enclosed and used for herding the ducks. Irrigated farming in most villages will not be feasible until after filling of the reservoir (see to Section 21.13). Thus, most of the above Whole Farm Scenarios will only be applicable after that date. However, WFS 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 (with rice, maize and legumes as dominant crops) and 6 (rice, maize and duck Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 47raising) will be feasible without i rrigation (in what is know as the tr ansition phase - see Chapter 25). The 4 WFS for the transition phase and 11 WFSs for the stability phase are presented below in Table 21-22 and Table 21-23 with indications of land area planted to each crop, as well as the total cropping intensity for each of the wet and dry season. While these WFSs present what may ha ppen in the 0.66 ha of irrigated cropping land, many families are entitled to 2 buffaloes or cattle, 1 pig and 15 chickens . These livestock are not included in the WFS, as it is assumed that they will be raised partly by remainin g forage from irrigated pl ots, and from crops grown around houses, and in the rainfed la nd of the village as a whole.

The following four dimensions are therefore applied to the analysis: Input level: High and low Input price: Medium and high Yield: Medium and low Output price: Medium and low An example for WFS 1.1 for Stability Phase is presente d in Figure 21-11. The sensitivity analysis for the 4 WFS in the transition phase and the 11 WFS in the stability phase are presented in Appendix K-9. Current input and output prices are defined as medium ; scenarios include sensitivity for a 25 % increase in input prices and a 25 % decrease in output prices. A ll crops and most livestock calculations include high and low input levels; for pig / chicken, however, only one input level is used for all calculations. For annual field and vegetable crops there are two levels of yield (medium and low). For fruit trees, coffee, tea and livestock only one yield scenario has been included for all gross margin calculations. The gross margin calculations for the whole farm s cenarios are based on various combinations of crops for 0.66 ha and livestock, suitable for the resettleme nt areas. These are further combined with other economic activities (forestry, fisheries, small sc ale business and wage labour) in Chapter 25, where scenarios are also presented for various household types. It is intended that the transition whole farm scenar ios will be introduced progressively over the first two to three years. The areas planted to DS cropping in particular will only be increased slowly. It is not intended that there will be any DS cropping in the first year after reloc ation of each village. Three villages (Nong Boua, Boua Ma and Phonsavang (Theun Douane area) will have ac cess to irrigation by the second year, and half of the targeted area will be planted with DS crops. Full development of the irrigated area for the remaining villages will only take place once the reservoir is filling by COD-1. As the project assistance is progre ssively withdrawn, resettlers will have to be come increasingly responsible to ensure the in vestments required to produce the crop animal products.

Consumer demands are largely being me t year round. Previously and to date much of the market for out-of-season produce in both Thakhek and Vientiane has been satisfied through importation from Thailand. However, this appears to be changing as the internal trade in fruit and vegetables accelerates and different areas of Laos exploit their sp ecific climatic conditions to meet market demands. 21.12.1 Market Description and Analysis Marketing channels vary by commodity; these channels are not static and change in nature in response to external factors (including policy) and market forces. Field crops in small quantities are produced and sold within Khammouane province principally for the local market. Most of the maize produced in Khammoua ne is for the fresh food market and dried maize is not found in any Thakhek market. Small quantities of peanuts are also produced for the local market but no soybeans are sold in Khammouane. Larger areas of cultivation of these grain legume crops are usually only associated with contract farming type arrangements that have to date in Khammouane proven to have had mixed success. In Bolikhamxay, closer to Vi entiane processing plants, contract farming appears to be operating at a greater level and with more success which is attributed to the proximity to processing plants. Local production of peanuts and soybeans faces competition from imports from both Vietnam and Thailand. Field crops appear to have the lowest market potential for the Nakai because of high competition from lowland areas and relatively lower levels of seasonal price fluctuation. Peanuts appear to have relatively good farm gate prices (US$ 0.40 to 0.60 per kilo dried and sh elled) with the Thakhek market for peanuts currently being largely met from Vietnam. Another market opportunity may be the production of fresh maize or sweet corn for the fresh food market in Thakhek if off-season production is possible. Vegetables and Fruit which is sold at markets can be classified into two broad groups. The first are predominantly small scale producer/sellers who are li kely to also be selling a range of NTFPs and who may purchase from neighbours for market sale. This group of traders are by far the most numerous. They usually sell on the edge of the market with their produce displayed on tarpaulins laid on the ground. Volumes traded by such sellers are small with av erage daily sales in the region of US$ 5 to 25. The second and smaller group of vegetable sellers trad e in higher value goods with a higher proportion of these being sourced outside the immediate market lo cation (e.g. from other districts, provinces or countries). They have much high levels of stock an d their wares are displayed on tables. This second group of sellers have highly organized market linkages and usually place orders two to three times a week, frequently by mobile telephone. They have linkages with a large number of traders operating from different areas and will compare prices between trader s prior to placing orders. Vegetables are usually delivered the following morning and such sellers have average daily sales ranging from around US$ 20 to 80. Small traders ( meh kai mera'gang ) are the backbone of the vegetable trade in Laos. Typically women, they frequently own their own 3 tons trucks and buy directly from producers around their home for sale elsewhere. They have strong local producer knowledge and are fully aware of what is ready for harvest in their area. Such traders have initially started their operations by focusing on a single product widely grown in their area for which there is a reliable market. Over time as these traders develop their networks and contacts they start to diversify a range of vegetables and fruit. While much of the vegetable trade is by order frequently orders are insufficient for a full load so additional vegetables are taken on and sold on an impromptu basis as required. Such traders will always seek to carry goods back to their point of origin even if the profit margins involved are very low to try to cover fuel costs. As trade from an area become more widely recognized traders from outside start to enter the area to exploit the trade opportunities that exist. The altitude and temperature on the Nakai plateau seems to provide the opportunity for high value off-season vegetable production. The Bolovens plateau in Champassak is currently the dominant source of such vegetables in Central and Southern Laos but it would appear that Nakai production could effectively Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 54compete for the Thakhek market for both white and Ch inese cabbage. Similarly Nakai appears to be well positioned to compete with Lak Sa o's Chilli production supplies to Th akhek and Vientiane. Off-season tomato production also appears to be a strong market opportunity with retail prices during the wet season reaching US$ 1 per kilo. Opportunities for the production of high value cold season crops such as asparagus and broccoli also exist and while levels of de mand in Vientiane remain modest (less than 5 tons and 20 tons, respectively) farm gate prices are high. In all cases, however, production quality (i.e. fit with consumer demand) and seasonality are critical. Considerable quantities of Thai fruits are imported but the recent establishment of a number of commercial farms suggests that this is largely a temporary phenomenon. Oranges and pomelo are largely imported from Thailand with limes being traded from Champassak as well as Thailand. Price trends for oranges are particularly strong with prices rising by some 30% over the last three years in Thakhek. Prices fo r Limes appear to be fallin g slightly over the same period but remain reasonable with farm gate prices of between US$ 0.15 and 0.45 per kilo. Pineapple production in Lak Sao is substantial with apparent significant over supply at peak production time when farm gate and retail prices are reported to have fallen as low as US$ 0.03 per fruit. Unless the Nakai peak production period is significantly different to that of Lak Sao it does not appear that pineapples have significant market promise. Livestock have three principal marketing systems for large ruminants: Local and Vientiane abattoir owners frequently have a number of agents located at district level who will arrange for livestock purchases on the abattoir's behalf, which the abattoir will then transport. In a number of districts, including now Nakai, the rights to the exclusive trade of livestock from the district are auctioned (or sold directly) to a legally registered trading company or individual 11. Private traders will purchase livestock directly fr om farmers on a daily basis and pen these animals until a sufficient number have been accumulated. At this point they will then either hire or use their own truck to transport these livestock to market, in the case of Gnommalath District, and almost exclusively Vientiane abattoirs. These traders are required to pay a head tax to the District. Buffalo comprise the single most valuable traded pr oduct from villages on the Nakai in terms of value and in 2002 this trade earned Nakai v illagers an estimated total of US $ 250,000 (farm gate). Cattle are not present nor traded in large numbers but appear to be preferred by farmers for a variety of reasons, not least their faster reproduction. Goat numbers are low but market demand appears to be growing, the goat in Thakhek is largely supplied by stock sourced from Sepon District, Savannakhet. In the case of small livestock no i mmediate problems are anticipated in the marketing of livestock with the possible exception of local breed pigs. This market appears to have suffered fairly significantly from the introduction of commercial pig farms in the province which appears to have resulted in a decline in demand for local pigs and reportedly, a drop in farm gate prices. The livestock trade in Laos is perh aps the most sophisticated encountere d during the study. At its most developed the principal Vientiane Abattoir has production contracts in place with commercial pig farms and uses its own vehicles for the transport of these livestock. In addition a number of small scale district based livestock traders sell directly to abattoirs who arrange transportation. Similar arrangements exist in contract farming relationships in a numb er of provinces, including Khammouane. Despite the start up of commercial chicken farms in Khammouane, demand fo r local breed chickens remains strong with such chickens commanding a substantial price premium. Traditional 'free range' pig and chicken raising at the household level using local breeds and available feedst uffs has traditionally supplied urban centre's with pork and chicken. Sophisticated trade networks and large numbers of private traders were involved in this key trade in Khammo uane. In recent years howe ver this trade has been altered and in the case of pigs, appears to have reduced. Trade volume in local pigs appears to have reduced as a result of increased local competition fr om small scale intensive pi g raising units located in Thakhek and Nongbok districts (see Figure 21-12). Additionally, there has been increased government 11 In the case of Nakai this is the recently established Nakai Ab attoir Supply Association which acts as the agent fort the Vient iane abattoir. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 55emphasis on attempting to reduce the spread of infectious livestock diseases through requiring all livestock exports from a district to have veterinary ce rtification. Traders reported that small quantities of such livestock (e.g. two pigs or less than twenty poultry) are informally exempted from these new regulations. As a result it appears that the trading systems for small livestock and poultry has re-structured away from larger scale traders towards larger numb ers of smaller scale and mo re village based traders operating at lower individual commodity volumes. Figure 21-12: Khammouane Pi g 'Exports' by Type 1998-2002 Mahasai Mahaxai serves as a trade node for poultry in the wet season for some villages in Mahaxai, Gnommalth and Boulapha Districts. During this time traders from Thakhek come to old Mahaxai and purchase chickens from farmers or village based traders for sale in Th akhek. These trading chains can be complex; chickens can pass through up to five separate traders before reaching the Thakhek market. There are five to six traders who re gularly come to Mahaxai during the wet season for this trade. It is reported that total daily sa les in Mahaxai to these traders is rel atively low, perhaps averaging 100-200 birds per day. 21.12.2 Assessment of Current Market Volumes An assessment of market volumes in Thakhek and Vientiane was undertaken; these estimates are shown in Table 21-26 below. Estimates are likely to be low becaus e they are solely based upon the market trade and as such exclude street retailers.

Most of the traders met during the study had been in the trade for less than this period. The reasons for this are many but include: A substantial expansion in access to relatively cheap 3 tons trucks, which are well suited to small scale vegetable and fruit trade. Improved road access from the South to Vientiane along ro ute 9 and associated improvements to secondary roads. Policies encouraging import substitution and increased ri gor in the control of informal cross border trade. This trend looks set to continue and accelerate further. The relative proximity of upland areas of Laos - with their distinct production potential - to Thai markets makes it likely that Lao agricultural exports will expand in the short to medium term. The balance of trade in such products that has appeared until recently to have been in Thailand's favour is thus set to reverse or has done so already 12. In the medium term it is likely that seasonal pri ce variations will reduce somewh at as the opportunity that this offers for off-season producers is increasingly exploited. The current large volumes of fruit imports from Thailand are also likely to reduce as newly established commercial scale Lao fruit plantations come into production (e.g. Paksan Orange farm). It is likely, but not inevitable, that these commercial scale fruit farms will be followed by smallholder production of sim ilar fruits in the same area as technical and market knowledge from these farms diffuses. In crops with low entry barriers and relatively easy production significant seasonal gluts are already being experienced . Pineapples are perhaps the classic case where in production areas prices seas onally have fallen as low as 300 kip per fr uit (Lak Sao). This was also the case in 2003/2004 with in-season tomato pr oduction in Khammouane where pr ices fell as low as 500 kip/kilo. As the production potentials to meet market demand s become better understood it is likely that many areas will become specialized in single crop production . This is already the case in Southern Sayabouly where maize is now perhaps more widely grown than rice. The current internal trade in fruit and vegetables is characterized by large numbers of relatively small volume traders, mostly operating from production locations. Trader numbers in the short to medium term will increase as new areas enter market production and identify their production niche's. However, in the medium to long term (10 plus years) it is likely that there will be a consolidation of this indu stry with fewer larger traders involved and these most likely be market, as opposed to production area, -based. The market for meat will remain strong and prices are set to continue to rise along the same patterns as has been the case to date. The opportunity for the establishment of seasonal feedlots for cattle and buffalo clearly exists given dry season weight decline but as ye t does not appear to have been exploited. Given the scale of the opportunity that this pres ents it is likely that such feedlot operations will establish in the short to medium term. If the current policy environmen t, which makes livestock export to Thailand problematic, should change this would further bo ost the development of this agro-enterprise. The 12 Because of high volumes of unrecorded border trade, official data on balance of trade in such goods cannot be considered reliable. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 58potential for similar types of activities at a household level would also appear to exist13. Similarly, the potential for expansion of local chicken production remains strong because of the strength of consumer preference for this type of poultry. One possible exception to the strong opportunities that exist within the livestock sector is that of farmed pork where prices appear to be slowing somewhat and production levels may have reached or surpassed levels of market demand. Pig farmers are reporting a slight drop in live-weight prices over the past few months and this may be indicative, similarly while this industry continues to grow in Khammouane the rate of growth appears to have peaked. Predicting future market volume sizes and demand is not possible because of the wide range of factors likely to influence such outcomes. However three broa d scenarios of overall demand levels are presented below: The current balance between production and consumption remains broadly the same but increasing in line with population growth. The impa cts of rising wealth levels are also likely to increase demand for out-of season vegetables and other 'luxury' food products. As such farm gate prices remain broadly the same or rise. The risk of overproduction as road networks improve and market forces penetrate deeper, market orientated production increases substantially to an extent that farm gate pr ices remain static or decline. Growth of new markets or further developed of existing markets and thus absorb increased Lao production. All of these three scenarios can occur to varying exte nts depending upon the particular product. Already, in some crops at peak season the effects of scenario (b) are being felt in some areas (e.g. pineapples). In general, however, it appears most likely that a combination of scenar ios (a) and (c) will prove to be dominant. At present there are significant opportunities for import-substitution driven production of certain vegetables and many higher value fruits. Thes e opportunities have been exploited for a number of years on the Bolevens and are also emerging elsewhere (e.g. fruit orchard establishment). In the longer term as ASEAN develops and border trade restrictions fall, Lao products will become increasingly sold in Thailand where they are already seen as being more 'natural' by consumers. At present, however, it appears that the reverse situation is occurring with an increased emphasis by GoL authorities on the control of Unrecorded Border Trad e in the interests of expanding taxation revenues. In some areas it appears as through efforts are being made centrally to discourage trade in products for which there is a perceived shortage in Laos. Thus it was reported that livestock exports to Thailand from Thakhek are not being encouraged because Vientiane' s demand is so considerable. Thailand's demand for livestock is considerable and given Laos' low population densitie s and large areas suitable for grazing, the country appears to be well placed to continue and expand its re sponse to this market oppo rtunity. Similarly it is likely that Laos will increasingly be in a position to take advantage of its highland areas in central and southern regions to supply fruit and vegetables to adjacent areas of Thailand. 21.12.5 Nakai Comparative Advantage and Implications Even with the anticipated road impr ovements the Nakai Plateau will rema in relatively remote. Soils on the Plateau are poor and the resettler population's major market linkage to date has been through the livestock trade. To date their production has been la rgely subsistence focused wi th major sources of cash income being livestock and NTFP sa les. However, Nakai has obviou s comparative advantages over districts such as Nongbok which is just south of Thak hek. Nongbok district has rich, deep alluvial soils, and its farmers have many years of experience in using available irrigation infrastructure. A high proportion of agricultural production in that district is for market sale both to Thakhek and Thailand. Farmers are market attuned and are using relatively high levels of agro-chemical inputs and sophisticated production techniques Due to the altitude of the Nakai Plateau it is signific antly cooler than lowland districts and the cool season is reportedly of longer duration. As such, production seasons for cool season vegetables on the Nakai will 13 The extent to which this is an opportunity that could be expl oited on the Nakai will depend in large part on the extent to whi ch the draw down zone offers grazing potential. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 59be longer than in lowland distri cts. The presence of NT2 and the a ssistance that will be provided to resettler communities in the first 3-5 years following construction to enable them to produce dry season vegetables. Although dry season irrigation is now fairly common in lowland areas of Khammouane, upland irrigation on the scale that w ill be created will be unique in th e province. The combination of altitude and irrigation thus offers significant production potentials. A possible fourth, but as yet unproven advantage, is that of the very large annual draw down zone of the lake. This may result in a number of very specific production opportunities. However, not until the scheme is operating is it likely that the opportunities, if any, offered by this zone will be understood. There are substantial seasonal price variations in vegetable prices in Thakhek and as such off-season production offers potentially high farm gate prices as well as, presently, lower production competition. Figure 21-13 provides some examples. In addition , there are a number of cool season high value vegetables, such as broccoli that are currently only available during the cool season. The potential for longer cool season growing seasons on the Nakai must, from a marketing perspective, be exploited to its fullest extent if vegetable production is to effe ctively compete with that from lowland districts. Figure 21-13: Seasonal Price Ranges, Thakhek 2002 020004000600080001000012000 Tomato Cabbage Fresh Onion Sour ce : CPI Data, NSCKip / KgIn-Seas on Off-Season A number of field crops such as peanuts and soyb eans could be cultivated on the Nakai and there is a local market for these products. However, from a ma rketing perspective it is unclear what Nakai's advantage is in the production of such crops unless the quality of produce is high. A summary of the short to medium term market opportunities, risks and production features required to exploit these opportunities are presented in Table 21-28. 21.12.6 Market Strategy and Acceleration Program Marketing channels for Nakai produc tion will, over time, emerge spontan eously as they have elsewhere in Laos. However, such a process will take time and traders from the Nakai are likely to focus, in the short to medium term at least, on areas of high return and low risk, this is likely to be fish production. A number of measures will be undertaken to accelerate the development of mark eting channels (traders) sourcing products from the Nakai. However, such measures will be futile unless the production that is promoted on the plateau is attuned to market demand. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 60Production promotion The success of these measures is conditional upon a Pr oduction Promotion Strategy that is closely linked to current market demands, (primarily in Thakhek an d secondarily in Vientiane) and Nakai's comparative production advantages. The following points guide this: The construction phase of NT2 will generate a su bstantial demand for fr esh food. The obvious short term opportunities that are presented by th is market should not be ignored. However, this period will also be used to develop the Nakai's re putation for the producti on of particular crops and/or livestock for which it appears to have a comparative advantage. During this period traders from Thakhek and else where supplying construction sites with food are likely to be interested in having commodities for transportation on their return trip. This opportunity will be exploited and tr aders made aware of production th at is available for sale on the Plateau. Rigorous production trials will be undertaken for off-season (or extended season) vegetable production and high value fruit type s suited to the Nakai's climate. If necessary NTPC will invest in hardware (e.g. greenhouses) required to enable such production to occur.

Scale: Medium-High Risk of monopolistic trading association being continued possibly reducing farm gate prices. Scale: Medium-High No specific features required. Small livestock Decline in market demand for traditionally raised pigs. Increasing demand for goat, potential to compete with Sepon for Thakhek and Vientiane Market. Scale: Medium Low trader interest in purchase of local pigs and/or low prices. Scale: Medium-High Levels of goat production would need to be relatively high to ensure stable supply of sufficient quantities to warrant Vientiane traders shifting from Sepon purchase area. Poultry Strong Thakhek demand, high farmgate/retail price differentials, strong price trends.

Fruits Good market demand for citrus, largely currently met from Thai and Pakse. Scale: Medium-High Risk that commercial farms recently established meet Thakhek market demand. Scale: Low Quantity and quality (marke t favoured varieties) of production must be sufficient to generate trader interest. Vegetables Significant opportunity for off-season vegetable production; esp. Cabbage, Chilli, Broccoli, Tomato and Asparagus. Scale: High Vientiane market production (Asparagus, Broccoli) will be difficult because new, unknown production area and high transport costs. Scale: High For Off-season production quality and quantity needs to be sufficient to generate trader interest. For Broccoli and Asparagus NTPC may need to be pro-active in marketing. Field Crops Scale of production on Nakai and location unlikely to be attractive to commercial cons umers (i.e. Contract farming unlikely). Scale: Low-Medium Without contract farming, marketing likely to be difficult, will require significant volume of production. Scale: Medium-High To compete effectively Nakai production will need to be of lower farm gate price or sig. better quality. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 62Market acceleration Market acceleration may occur as a natural phenomenon so that in some areas of production it is likely that no external assistance will be required. The Live stock Marketing Association established on the Nakai is likely to continue in operation and it is not envisaged that there will be any problems with the marketing of these large livestock. The marketing of small livesto ck is also not expected to be a problem and will occur as volumes of production warrant. However, apart from those trading in livestock and NTFP's there are no existing traders based on the Plateau expo rting Nakai agricultural produce (crops, vegetables, fruits). Therefore, a number of interventions will be undertaken to accelerate the natu ral development of the trade sector in this area. Wit hout such acceleration it is likely that opportunities will be missed and many households will abandon (or not adopt in the firs t place) commercial produc tion because of the lack of buyers. The following measures should be undertaken to accelerate market development: In order to foster Thakhek based trader interest it is proposed that traders supplying construction sites are invited to the Nakai on a regular basis by NTPC to understand the production that is being undertaken there and the market opportunities that will thus result. Cross visits by Nakai farmers to Nongbok farms will be undertaken both for technical production reasons but also, critically, to develop Plateau residents appreciation of the opportunities (and risks) associated with market oriented production. Such visits will be timed to coincide with critical production periods as well as at time of harvest and sale. If the production of quality, high value, niche market vegetables (e.g. asparagus and broccoli) does prove viable it may be necessary to engage directly in the marketing of this produce at least initially until Nakai or Thakhek based traders are convinced of the viability of such trade. This engagement should be as minimal as possible and be limited to the provision of trade subsidies where NTPC would part-fund the capital outlay required for such trading trips. Such subsidies will be available only during the initial production season of such crops an d be reduced each trip. Such subs idies will reduce the risks faced by traders in entering new and specia list markets. It is anticipated th at a maximum of US$ 5,000 would be required for this purpose. For niche market production such as asparagus and broccoli more detailed mark et assessment is required as to volumes of demand and critica lly institutional buyers (hotels, etc) to enable the effective marketing of this produce. In addition it appears as through there is a significant market opportunity for dry season 14 cattle and buffalo fattening for sale. This requires further assessment to be conclusive but a partnership with the Nakai Livestock Marketing Association to undertake such activities holds significant promise. Such assessments, and that for ot her possible niche crops will be ongoing during the support period. Fostering the establishment of contract farming agreements between Plateau residents and traders and/or processors is the strategy most likely to ensure th at resettlers have a market for their produce. The opportunities for estab lishing such relationships ap pear to be limited but will be explored fully both in Laos and, if appropriate, Thailand. To enable the implementation of these measures and, if necessary, to play a direct marketing role, two staff will be recruited. One Marketing Officer, ideall y an existing trader (pro bably female and Thakhek based) will have responsibility fo r developing and maintaining cont act with Thakhek based and other traders as well as implementing the measures liste d above. S/he will be supported by a vehicle and a driver. Marketing support Marketing support will be required in the early stages. Because of the poor road conditions the villages on the plateau have to date been comparatively weakly integrated into the Lao market economy. Apart from buffalo, cattle and some NTFPs there are no formal trading systems established for the 'export' of plateau produce. With road improvements Nakai's market in tegration will change ra pidly. Even without any external assistance it is likely that traders will, over time, identify pr oducts from the area with market 14 When cattle and buffalo are at their thinnest and command lowest prices. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 63potential and seek to exploit these. Existing market traders in Nakai and members of the newly established Livestock Trading Association are all potential future traders from the area. The markets generated during the construction phase are likely to attract traders from Gnommalat and other districts to supply these markets. Such traders will want to seek back-loading of their trucks and could become potential buyers for produce from the plateau. However, the constraints is that the produce is not being delivered to the district centre at Nakai at present so these potential bu yers would be unab le to easily access the supplies of fresh produce. There are a number of interventi ons that will be supported by the Project to improve the marketing situation: Establish close marketing contacts between buffalo and cattle producers on the Nakai with Construction Camp Servicing Companies. There is potential for improved local marketing and use or development of local he alth certified abbatoir outlets The Demonstration Farm as well as the Pilot Nursery are each producing significant volumes of fruit and vegetables. NTPC will encourage th e marketing of these products by the villagers from the area. This could be done in the local ma rket in Nakai where there is currently a dearth of fruit and vegetables being offered for sale. Th is will assist the devel opment of private market channels and would represent a fi rst step in enabling villagers to learn more about local market demands and preferences. Only two villages are likely to be resettled pr ior to commencement of dam construction, when the demand for fruit, vegetables and meat will begin to escalate. NTPC will encourage the production of goods on the Nakai for which the area has a comparative advantage. This entails encouraging farmers to market fruit and vegetables that they are already producing as well as promoting greater vegetable produc tion in villages that will not ye t have resettled. This process will help catalysing the process of establishing a local market during the construction period and would help establish a reputation for these products. NTPC will also organise a trade fair in Naka i and invite traders fr om Thakhek to see for themselves the production that is being promot ed. This can only take place when sufficient production has commenced to warrant their making buying trips to the plateau. NTPC is considering promoting the establishment of a Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association and financing the establishment of cool storage facilities in Nakai to which farmers could deliver their produce and traders could purchase from. Marketing of produce The cropping patterns that have been developed feature a number of crops that can generate cash income for farmers. It is assumed that all of the rice produced will be consumed by the household together with a large proportion of the grain maize, whilst a larger proportion of the legumes and high proportion of the fruits and vegetables will all be sold. Of these the field crops may have the lowest potent ial because of high comp etition from the lowland areas and relatively low levels of seasonal price fluc tuation. However, peanuts have relatively good farm gate prices with the Thakhek market for peanuts being largely met by imports from Vietnam. Another market opportunity may be the production of fresh maize or sweet corn for the fresh food market in Thakhek by off-season production in the dry season. The climatic conditions on the plateau should provid e good opportunities for the production of high value vegetable crops during the dry season. Current ly the Bolovens plateau in Champassak is the dominant source of such vegetables in central and southern Laos but it would appear that Nakai production of white and Chinese cabbages could co mpete for the Thakhek market. Similarly, Nakai appears to be well positioned to co mplete with the production of chillies from Lak Sao which supplies Thakhek and Vientiane. Off-season tomato production also appears to a strong market opportunity with high retail prices in the dry season. Opportunities for the production of broccoli, and possible also asparagus, also exist and although levels of demand remain relatively low the pr ices are high. However, in all these cases, production quality and seasonality re main critical factors in determining the ultimate profitability of the enterprise. Chapter 21: Agricultural and Livestock Development Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 November 2004 64 Account should also be taken of the impact that the construction period will ha ve on the demand for food on the plateau. The Whole Farm Scen arios featured in Models 1 and 2 w ill be targeting the likely demands that will arise during the four year period when co nstruction is on-going. The construction period is estimated to result in the creation of a fresh food mark et with an annual value of US$ 3.5 million rising to US$ 7 million depending on the size of the labour for ce and dependants that move to the plateau. This population is likely to be based at a number of differen t sites thus dispersing the demand into a series of separate geographical markets. This constitutes a ma jor opportunity for resettled households in Nakai and adjacent districts, most particul arly Gnommalat where the bulk of the workforce will be based. 21.13 IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE The implementation schedule for the Agriculture an d Livestock Program for the Resettlement Phase is presented in table >?? below. The Irrigation part of Program will only start in Year COD-1 when the reservoir starts to fill up. ********** * * * ********** Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area

122 IRRIGATION SYSTEM PLANNING FOR THE PLATEAU RESETTLEMENT AREA 22.1 INTRODUCTION Thirteen of the fifteen villages affected by the Na m Theun 2 Reservoir impoundment have chosen to be resettled on thirteen of the possible twenty five resettlement sites located on the southwestern edge of the Nakai Reservoir. Their choice was mainly based on exis ting administrative and cu ltural village boundaries of land that is known to them. As part of the resettlement package, the following irrigation facilities (per resettled household will be provided, if the irrigation system development in the first irrigation villages (Nong Boua, Bouama and Phonsavang) are shown to be feasible and sustainable. 0.5 ha of irrigated farm land for growing field crops, vegetables, fruit trees, possibly wet season rice and fodder for livestock consumption 0.16 ha of irrigated rice paddy All-year round irrigation of the areas is required for the farm land crops. The following amounts were included in the Concession Agreement of 3 October 2002: Irrigation and household water supply and distribution US$ 1,673,750 Gully stop dams and head ponds US$ 75,900 However new estimates have been prepared and the amounts for irrigation and water supply have been significantly increased to: Irrigation, Plateau and Khamke rd District US$ 3,348,400 Gully stop dams and head ponds US$ 79,100 Household water supply US$ 472,500 Total US$ 3,900,000 This chapter identifies the possible irrigation system required for each of the reservoir rese ttlement sites that the Resettlers wish to move to and their prel iminary cost estimate. The Pilot Village Irrigation Scheme at Area 16 is described and the Bolikhamxai Irrigation Scheme is also briefly described. The chapter discusses the furthe r investigations required be fore the detail design of the individual schemes can be undertaken, the operation and maintenance of the completed schemes, and extension services. The locations of gully stop dams and ponds have not been identified. Because of their small water storage volumes and the small catchment area s of the gullies in the project area , their use for storing water for irrigation purposes is limited. It is envisaged that they will consist of low earth embank ments constructed by an excavator and the larger ones by a bulldozer. A spillway will be cut in natural ground at the side of the embankment. Topographically, ther e are many potential sites availa ble and they will be of use for increasing resettlement area water reso urces for livestock use. It is also possible that they will be used for trapping water as reservoir levels recede in the rese rvoir drawdown areas. However it is preferable that there locations are chosen when: further local knowledge of the hydrology of the potential sites is available, and after village consultations on possible grazing areas. The area of the irrigation systems is based on the expected number of affected households when relocation occurs. This number is based on a 2003 cens us by the Nakai District assisted by the RMU and the NTPC. The number is then increased by an annual growth rate of 3 percent applied until the year the village is scheduled to relocate. Af fected are all the households from fi fteen Plateau villages plus all the households from Ban Phone phanpek and an estimated 31 from Ou domsouk. The villages are scheduled to move either during the 2005/6 or 2006/7 dr y seasons. Sop Hia Village will be split into: Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 2 The recent Tai immigrants who will be resettle d in Khamkerd District, Bolikhamxai Province with Nam Nian Village.. The Vietic groups who will be resettling to a new village on the edge of the reservoir. Table 22-1 lists the future reservoi r resettlement area v illages, the expected number of households, and the net and gross irrigation areas required per site. The gross area is the net irrigation areas of 0.5 ha and 0.16 ha per household increased by 10 percent to include land possibly lost by right of way for non-farm areas such as access roads, irrigation canals and drains, other natural drain lines, termite mounds, other local high spots and heritage sites. In some resettle d villages, the expected number of households is still subject to further villager consultati on. For example, Ka Oy villagers have chosen to move to one of three sites, Areas 19, 21 and 22, and the actual numbers moving to an individual area has not been finalized.

Most of the ar ea will remain mixed forest with village and irrigation development taking place on the edge of the reservoir. Half of the resettlement sites have undulating topography and the other half are flat and gently sloping. The surface soils in the area are generally poor, acidic, sandy to sandy loams. Lower horizons are a clay loam texture. The soils in the northern areas, 7 to 13 are generally better with less sand content and higher organic matter. Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 3The average annual rainfall over the Nakai Plateau is relatively high at 2,600 mm per year. Distribution is markedly seasonal with over 88 percent falling between April and September during the wet season southwest monsoon period. 22.1.2 Irrigation Water Sources for the Nakai Plateau The watershed areas of the streams that flow throug h the resettlement sites to the Nakai Reservoir are generally small resulting in non-perennial low discharges. For example, the edge of the Nakai Plateau escarpment is typically 2 to 3-km to the southwest of a resettlement area, and then land-slopes and surface runoff are in the opposite direction. Consequently the streams that flow through the sites have not been considered as a source of irrigation wate r, with the exception of Ar ea 16. The Pilot Village Irrigation Scheme at Resettlement Area 16 has utilized the Houay Malai, with a watershed area 11.41 km 2. This is one of the largest watersheds and the development of the irrigation system necessitated the inclusion of an earth dam and spillway as well a pump station. The chosen irrigation water source is the Nakai Reservoir which can vary in elevation by 12.5 m throughout the year. The full supply level is El. 538 from August to November duri ng high rainfall years. The minimum operating level is El. 525.5 in May/June during low rainfall years. The average rainfall year minimum elevation is predicted to be El. 526.5. As the resettlement villages irri gation areas are above the full supply level of El. 538, pumping is required. For the purposes of pump design, the minimum reservoir elevation has been c onsidered as El. 526. However lo wer reservoir elevations can be accommodated by a pump station sump excavated at a bed level of El. 524. A previous resettlement study, Resettlement Options for the Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project, Margules Povry Pty Ltd, April 1997, vaguely considered \" blocked off reservoir areas forming water storage ponds \". The areas were blocked off by \" earth bunds constructed seasonally \". Retention basins were identified at three locations and had water storage depths ranging between 9 to 16 m. There were no further technical details given and no cost estimates. This type of retention basin has not been considered further as for earth bunds of these heights to hold water for ev en a single dry season, considerable volumes of earthworks will be required and compaction will not be possible under water. It is possible to construct permanent earth dams fed from the reservoir by two-way spillways. Ho wever experience from the Pilot Village Irrigation Scheme is that the combination of dam and spillway and pump station plus the required irrigation conveyance and distribution systems is prohibitively expensive. 22.2 PUMP STATIONS 22.2.1 Supply Channel A supply channel is required to be excavated to convey water from low reservoir elevations to a pump station located on the reservoir perimeter. Pump stations located in deep water within the reservoir have not been considered as they would be more expensive to construct and have inherently more operation and maintenance problems. The supply channel bed width is a practical 1 m with side slopes of 1:1.5 (v:h) if possible. 1:2 side slopes will be necessary for deep er excavations in poorer strength materials. The sump, the point of lowest bed elevation where the pump station is located, is to be 6 x 6 m with side slopes of 1:2. The gradient of th e channel bed is 0.001 m/m or 10-cm per 100 m. The bed elevation of the sump must be at El. 524 to incorporate a low rese rvoir elevation of El. 526 plus a further 2 m so that there is a good factor of safety clearance from the pump suction intake to the excavated sump bed elevation. Consequently there is a height of 14 m from the sump bed level to the reservoir full supply elevation of El. 538. There may be some initial collapses of the supply chan nel side slopes until the banks stabilize. These will have to be cleared by earth moving machinery in the month of June, the month of lowest reservoir elevations. Therefore a 4 m wide access track is ne cessary along one of the channel banks at El. 527. There will be some reservoir sediment deposition at the sumps and some depo sits from local runoff erosion. The deposits will only cause a problem during low reservoir years and any deposits will have to be cleared manually. Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 4It will be attempted to minimize supply channel maximum excavation de pths to avoid large earthworks volumes which will have to be prop erly disposed of. However the sl ope of the land at the proposed locations of the pump stations is frequently of low gradient and long lengths of deep excavation depths will be common and will cause excessi ve excavation volumes on some sc hemes. The supply channel will also be used as a low reservoir waterway for village fishing boats. The sump area can also be utilized as a wharf. 22.2.2 Power Supply An electricity mains supply will be provided to all the resettlement v illages and it will be extended to power the irrigation pumps. No other power source is either as convenient or more cost-effective for powering an irrigation pump. Other sources such as diesel, wind or solar powered pumping have not been considered. The cost of the electricity supplies ar e not be included in the irrigation development cost estimates even though irrigation will probably be the largest user. 22.2.3 Type of Installation Fixed pump installations can either be axial flow pumps fixed to the reservoir bank at an inclination, preferably 30 o, or centrifugal pumps with horizontal shafts and significant extra reinforced concrete and other civil works. Both types involve pump impellors submersed below El.526 and driven by a motor, via a shaft coupling, located above El. 540.00. El. 540 inco rporates a full supply level of El. 538 plus a 2 m freeboard for wave action and flooding. However they are considered expensive options, especially the civil works necessary for the horizontal installations . The lower cost axial flow option can have more breakdown problems associated with the long incl ined shaft coupling from the motor to the pump impellors. The preferred option is centrifugal pumps installed on floating platforms, or pontoons, that move up and down with the varying reservoir elevations. A flexible discharge hose connects the pump outlet to a steel delivery pipe fixed on the reservoir bank by reinforced concrete foundations. This delivery pipe delivers the water to a suitable high location within or ne ar to the proposed irrigation scheme. Between El. 538 and El. 526.00, the delivery pipe must have severa l connection points to accommodate the varying pontoon levels. This type of installation is used ex tensively for irrigating from the Mekong River and its tributaries because of its lower initial cost and less maintenance requirements. For all the schemes, two pump sets, each of half th e required scheme discharge requirement, are installed on one pontoon. Therefore if one pump breaks down then the other can supply the irrigation requirements by increasing the pumping hours. 22.2.4 Delivery Pipe Delivery pipes fixed to the reservoir bank will be steel of 15, 20, 30 or 40 cm diameter. The pipes commonly come in 6 m lengths and will be joined by bolted flanges and seals. Above the bank and leading to the header tank, steel is the preferable stronger material, however uPVC pipes will also be considered. The total pump head requirement is static head plus pipe and other friction losses. There is a cost relationship between the diameter of the delivery pipe and the total pumping head requirement. For a similar irrigation requirement, the smaller the pipe diamet er, the higher the water velocity in the pipe. This results in higher pipeline friction and other fittings head losses, which are measured in meters head of water. Consequently smaller diameter pipelines will have higher total pumping head and power requirements. Using a larger pipe di ameter will reduce the head losses bu t with the long delivery pipelines required in the project area, the initial capital costs may be higher than the saving on pump and motor sizes. However it is preferable to choose the larger diameter pipes as there will be significant future savings on pump power costs over the project life. Al so, the irrigation systems mu st have the potential for expansion to accommodate growing populations. The larger pipe diameter is desirable in this respect. 22.2.5 Header Tank/Stilling Basin The pump station delivery pipe will discharge into a header tank or a stilling basin. A header tank is necessary for a pipe irrigation system and a stilling basi n is necessary at the head of an open channel canal. Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 5Both structures will be located on high ground to en able gravity distribution. The structures will be of reinforced concrete construction. However if there is no suitable high spot relatively near the pump station, then an elevated tank will be necessary. In this case, a steel tank supported on either a steel or reinforced concrete fr ame will be considered. A header tank is required for pipe distribution systems for the following reasons: A buffering storage between the pump discharge and the irrigation requirement as it will not be possible to select a pump with discharge exactly the same as the scheme IWR. Also, a new pump will pump more than a used pump. Similarly, the pump discharge will vary with the varying reservoir elevations, the higher the reservoir leve l, the less the pumping head and greater the pump discharge; The tank will act as a trap for an y sediments that are pumped up; If reservoir water quality is suitable, the tank will store water for domestic use after irrigation pumping ceases. The domest ic pipeline will pass through a sand filtration tank. The header tank will have outlets for irrigation, dome stic water supply, overflow and flushing. A system will be provided so that the pump operator knows when to stop the pump if the tank is overflowing. A flagged float has been installed at the Pilot Village Sc heme. There will be steel ru ngs cast into one of the sides for access for inspection and cleaning purpos es. There will be an access track to the tank. The minimum dimensions of the header tank are those so it can store water for evening and night time domestic use. As a buffering storage the larger the be tter, with cost the limitin g factor. Provisionally, for preliminary cost estimate purposes, a buffer of fift een minutes over-pumping has been assumed. This can be several times more than the over night domestic storage requirement. For costing purposes, the header tanks have been a ssumed to be 2 m high, including a freeboard of 0.25 m, and of square dimensions. For possible open canal systems in the flatter areas, the delivery pipe must discharge into a reinforced concrete stilling basin located at the head of the main canal. The velocity of the pumped water is such that it would erode an earth canal if pumped directly into it. Therefore the stilling basin is designed so that water enters the main canal at the correct elevation and at a suitable velocity so that canal erosion does not occur. It will have no buffering storage bu t for canal systems this is unnecessary as the open canals have inherently more storage capability within the free board area. It is unlikely that a stilling basin can be adapted for domestic water storage and supply. 22.3 IRRIGATION WATER REQUIREMENTS AND SCHEDULING 22.3.1 Farm Plot Crops Irrigation Water Requirements For the non-ponded farm plot crops such as ve getables and maize, a peak net irrigation water requirement (IWR) of 4 mm per day will supply all evapo-transpiration needs during the dry season. However there will be conveyance, distribution and fi eld application losses, the amount depending on the type of conveyance and distribution and farm plot slopes and soil types. A typical project irrigation efficiency of 70 percent has been used, equating a rounded-up gross IWR of 6 mm/day. 22.3.2 Paddy Rice Irrigation Water Requirements The IWR for ponded rice paddies is considerably higher than for the farm plot crops. Rice grows in a standing water depth of between 10 to 15-cm. Extra irrigation water is required to cover evaporation losses from the open water as well as to compensa te for percolation losses in the inundated fields. Furthermore, substantial irrigation water is required to saturate the land for land preparation. That is, softening the ground for ploughing and puddling. Puddling is the disturbance of fine clay particles that settle between lower soil particles and reduce percolation losses. For example, for paddy on heavy clay soils on the Mekong Plains, percolation rates can be between 1 to 3 mm per day. In lighter well draining soils, such as the project area, percol ation rates will be significantly high er, a worst case scenario being as Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 6high as 20-cm per day. A saturation depth of water of between 20 to 25-cm is typical for land preparation. Also, the project irrigation efficiencies for rice are lowe r as there are higher fiel d application losses as the water passes from terraced paddy to terraced paddy. For the light soils in the project area, the percolatio n losses for paddy must be carefully considered. Even with good irrigation practices there will be percolation losses. However for other non-ponded crops, efficient irrigation practices can largely eliminate perc olation losses. Unless there is significant clay content in the soil, it is recommended that dry season paddy rice irrigation is not considered. The high percolation losses will cause an increased IWR, higher capital cost s, long pumping hours and the possible leaching of nutrients from the soil. The following has been assumed for the hydr aulic design of the irrigation systems: There are areas with soils with clay content in the Resettlement Area that can be developed for paddy production. These are mostly in the northern area sites; However their percolation losses will be higher th an the heavy clay soils normally used for paddy. Therefore wet season production only has been considered. That is, supplem entary irrigation water is supplied when rainfall does not meet the crop requirements; After a few years of land preparation and puddling, the percolation losses will reduce. If they remain high, then the land is used for growing fiel d crops. If they reduce to a suitable level, then dry season double cropping of rice can be attempted. Estimating the percolation losses without the results of infiltration rate tests and area field experience is difficult. For example, at the Theun Douan Demonstration Farm the soils are light and dry season rice trials required considerable pumping and low yields . After taking into acco unt effective rainfall, a moderately high 6 mm/day has been used which results in a peak net supplementary IWR of 8 mm/day. Then taking into account the various system effici ency and field application losses of 60 percent, a gross IWR of 13 mm/day has been assumed. It is possible that dry season rice production can be undertaken in reservoir drawdown areas after some bunding to trap the receding water. There will be some fine silt deposition that will increase soil fertility and reduce percolation. However it is difficult to predict how much production is possible and it has not been included in the resettler livelihood options. 22.3.3 Domestic Water Supply Whenever possible, and if the reservoir water is of suitable quality, the irrigation system should incorporate additional water supply for domestic use ot her than drinking. This requirement is 50 liters per person per day. Assuming a household of 6 persons an d taking an example of 50 households in a village, 15 m 3/day is required. Over 12 hours pump ing, an extra discharge of 0.35 l/ s is required. This is a small percentage of the irrigation requirement and does not need to be included when making the pump selection. It can be easily delivered from a head er tank during the day and by a few extra minutes pumping at the end of the day to fill the header tank. 22.3.4 Pumping Hours and Water Duty 1 mm/day IWR equates to 10 m3/ha/day of water. Therefore a 6 mm/day IWR equates to 60 m3/ha/day and 13 mm/day equates to 130 m3/ha/day of water. The estimation of water duty or liters per second per hectare (l/s/ha), for estimating pump capacity and dimensioning conveyance pipes or canals, depends on the number of irrigation hours practiced per day. Th e more hours, the lesser the pump capacity and canal dimensions and the lower the capital cost. The fewer th e hours the greater the capacity and the higher the construction costs. For the Pilot Village Scheme, eight hours a day was used for farm land crops. However when including wet season rice areas this must be increased to twelve hours per day. Consequently for twelve hour irrigation, the following water duties have been assumed: Farm plot crops, 1.39 l/s/ha, say 1.4 l/s/ha; Wet season rice, 3 l/s/ha. Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 722.4 IRRIGATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND FARM LAYOUTS 22.4.1 General The type of the irrigation convey ance and distribution system depends on the topography of the area: Undulating, irregularly sloping land require buried pipeline systems; Flat and gently sloping land is irrigated by trapezoidal shaped open channel systems. The locations of the farm and rice lands and farm layo uts will be determined after more consultation with the Resettlers and further topographic survey and investigations on soil types. As stated previously, the rice lands must be in the flatter areas with heavier cl ay soils. There are some existing shifting cultivation areas and they will be more suitable for agriculture. Farm and village access roads are required within the area s, the cost of which has not been included in the irrigation development estimates. 22.4.2 Canal Systems A typical canal distribution system has main, secondary, tertiary and quaternary canals. However for the small resettlement schemes, not all this order of canals may be required. A system also has canal structures to control the discharges and water levels within the system including turnouts, checks, and check/drops. Conveyance structures su ch as culverts and siphons will be required to convey water under roads or drains. An open canal system is generally preferable for wet season paddy because of the higher water duty required and the high cost of uPVC pipes. It has be en assumed that the rice land is located on the lower, flatter slopes adjacent to, or near to, the farm land. Then the same pump station, delivery pipe and header tank or stilling basin is used for both farming systems. In the flatter and more gently sloping areas a series of regular sized blocks can be designed and prepared. As the farm land plots are 0.5 ha, a simple 50 m by 100 m farm size is recomme nded when possible with the irrigation supply canal traversing the 50 m length . The distance between the canals must be about 106 m to include land for the right of way of the canal, field drain at the end of the plot and a walkway along the canal bank. The flatter central and southern site s have the more sandy soils and the open canals will suffer more than average from seepage losses. Canal lining is the conv entional strategy for redu cing losses and must be considered. There is wide range of lining alternatives ranging from low permeability clay or earth layers, through plastic membranes to hard surface linings such as concrete or brick. Clay lining is preferred, that is excavating between 0.3 to 0.5 m below the cana l bed level and then back filling with compacted low permeability earth mate rial. This will be considerably cheaper th an concrete lining wh ich can suffer from cracking. The inclusion of drainage systems is normally an in tegral part of irrigation and small open channel trapezoidal section drains will need to be included at the end of the farm plot in the flatter areas. However for the more sloping areas with light free-draining soils and small farm areas, drainage considerations are minimal. 22.4.3 Buried Pipelines Systems A typical buried pipeline system will use uPVC and sm aller-diameter high density polyethylene (PE) pipes and has valves for flushing accumulated debris from pipe low spots and trapped air from high spots. Other fittings will include gate valves, clamps, junc tions, tees, elbows and reducers. In the farm layouts will be irre gular, the Area 16 Pilot Village Scheme being a good example. There, no two farm plots are of the same shape and long pipeline lengths are required to convey and distribute the water throughout the area. Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 8The pipes will be laid on sand bedding. Concrete anchor blocks, also known as thrust blocks, are necessary to transfer any forces in the system to the surrounding soil and prevent any pipe movement leading to disruption of the joints and subsequent leakage. Typical locations of anchor blocks are at all bends greater than 15o, changes in pipe diameter, tees and junc tions, in-line valves and at the end of the line. After construction of the buried pipelines, the routes will be marked by 1 m high precast concrete posts painted white. 22.4.4 Farm Inlets and Terracing Each farm plot will have its own farm inlet structure. At the Pilot Villag e Irrigation Scheme the farm plots are of various shapes and slopes. Consequently a unique type of farm inlet has been installed so that various farm plot irrigation techniques can be practiced and tested. Every plot has a 6 cm diameter PE pipe taking off from the buried pipe distribution branch line to the top of the plot. At the end of this pipe there are three outlets. One outlet is to a small conc rete tank used for filling watering cans. The second outlet is for attaching small-diameter hose pipes for overhead irrigation methods and the third is for attaching larger diameter pipes for conveying water further away from the outlet, particularly down some of the steeper slopes and avoiding soil erosion. This type of multi-purpose farm inlet has many fitt ings and is relatively expensive and similar outlets cannot be installed at all the resettlement irrigation schemes. The type of outlet at individual schemes will depend on the shape and slope of the plots and the type of irrigation technique to be practiced. On the flatter plots, where surface irrigation can be fully pr acticed, a much simpler struct ure can be installed. For example, a small mortared brick outlet box and a gate valve for regulating the supply. On open channel systems, a small gated precast concrete stru cture will be prefabricated and installed. In the undulating areas terracing of farm plots will be required. Te rracing will reduce soil erosion and water losses thereby improving irrigation field efficien cies and reduce pumping costs. Terracing must be carefully designed and undertaken to preserve the current soil fertility le vel. The use of large earth moving equipment will be avoided. Small tractors with front blades can be used in some areas but with the general project poor soils, the best suited method is for the farmers to gradually level the land over a period of years. At the Pilot Village Scheme, irrigation techni cians work closely with the farmers on terracing survey, design and earth moving. The co st of terracing has not been includ ed the irrigation cost estimates. 22.5 INDICATIVE IRRIGATION SYSTEM FOR EACH RESETTLEMENT SITE 22.5.1 General Following villagers' indicative choice of resettlement site, a desk study was undertaken on the possible irrigation system layouts for each resettlement site, on the basis that access to irrigation and domestic water is actually one of the main determinants of final resettlement site choice. The plans that follows, on a back ground of the currently available 1:25,000 scale maps, shows the approximate irrigation area site boundaries based on topography and the area required by each village site, and the proposed location of the supply channel, pump station, delivery pipe and main canal or pipeline. Village populations, farm areas and irrigation water requirements are explained, and brief description of the irrigation system and estimated cost is provided. At the time the maps were prepared, the expected village populations were based on a RMU census of 1998 plus an annual growth rate of 2.2% applied over 7 years to 2005. However the expected populations are now based on a 2003 census and a 3% annual growth rate until either 2006 or 2007. Also households that were previously considered in eligible have now been included. Therefore the number of households and consequent irrigation areas are now higher than when the maps were prepared. The data accompanying the maps has been revised but the boundaries and areas shown on the maps have not been amended to suit the new figures. However when topographic survey and mapping is undertaken, a larger area than the boundaries shown on the maps will be covered and the scheme desi gns will be based on the revised figures. Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 9The boundaries of the Resettlement Areas shown are not definite in that, for example, no village has chosen to be resettled to Area 12. Consequently th e boundaries of Areas 13 (Ban Thalang) and 11 (Ban Sop Phene) can be extended into Area 12. Maps have not yet been prepared for the Oudomsouk and Phonepanpek irrigation systems in Area 15. They were included in the program at a later date. The irrigation systems w ill be located in areas relatively close to the NT2 Headrace Channel to the Power Conduit Intake Structure and it is preferable and possible that the Supply Channels from low reservoi r areas to the two pump stations will start at the Headrace Channel. Also, that number of Oudomsouk households is still not clearly known. However general descriptions of the schemes are included. 22.5.2 Preliminary Construction Cost Estimates Preliminary construction cost estimates have been prepared. Unit rates from the construction contract for the Pilot Village Irrigation Scheme have been modified. Assuming that the construction of the schemes will be tendered in lots and not individually, they ha ve been modified to reflect the considerably larger contract quantities involved. The average cost per hectar e for the Plateau schemes is estimated at about US$ 3,900. Not included are the cost of investigations and de sign, UXO clearance and the electricity transmission lines to power the pumps. These items are covered in various othe r sections of the Social Development Plan. AREA 13: Ban Thalang Number of households: 70 households Approx.

Area 7 bisected by relocated Road 8B. V illagers wish to reside alongside this road. Large areas of low slope drawdown areas available on both sides. Irrigation System: The villagers chose Areas 7 an d 7a because their predominant occupation is cattle production and they wish to use the large adjacent drawdown areas for cattle grazing. Consequently Area 7 is far from low reservoir elevations and for irrigation development, will require a long length of supply canal. Area 7a is too small and even farther from low reservoir levels and has not been considered for irrigation. Area 7 requires a pontoon pump station located on eastern side. Long, about 880 m, supply channel required to pump station sump. 2 centrifugal units pumping total of 60 l/s and total head of about 35 m. Total pump motor requirement is 40-kw.

After reservoir inundation the areas will become pe ninsulas during reservoir full supply elevations. North of the two peninsulas are larger areas that will become islands after inundation. The NT2 Power Conduit Intake Structure is located between Oudomsouk an d Phonepanpek and the Headrace Channel to the Structure will be located between the two peninsulas. The Headrace Channel is an obvious place for the start of the two irrigation Supply Channels. They will be of relatively short length and will have the best access to reservoir low water elevations of all the Resettlement Irrigation Schemes. However the final designs of the Headrace Channel have no t yet been prepared and it will have to be agreed by all interested parties that the designs can be modified to include the irrigation Supply Channels. There will be massive volumes of spoil from the excavated Headrace Channe l that will be properly disposed of. Some of this spoil can be used for la nd fill to connect the two peninsulas to two more northern islands. Then ther e will be a significantly large enough ar ea to locate the irrigation systems. Both of the areas are close to the Pilot Village Irrigation Scheme at Area 16 and it is assumed that similar type schemes can be developed. That is, pumping to a header tank and buried pipe distribution to individual farm plots.

Results of 8 June 2003 consultations with the RMU Manager are presented in Table 22-2. Table 22-2: Preferred Location of Village rs from Sop Hia and Nam Nian Villages. Preferred Location & Number of Households Village Lak Sao (Khamkerd) Nakai Reservoir Elsewhere Sop Hia 21 32 4 Nam Nian 26 0 0 Totals 47 32 4 For planning purposes, the number of households considered for development is fifty-five. Each household will be allocated 1.5 ha of irrigated land, therefore a net irrigation area of 82.5 ha is required. Allowing for a 10% increase for land lost by non-farm areas, a 90.75 ha gross scheme area is required to be established. The Khamkerd District officials ha ve proposed two possible areas for village and irrigation development: 1. Houay Sot Irrigation Scheme: BPKP has prepared drawings and a design report for 63 ha scheme. 2. Nam Pan Irrigation Scheme: Khamkerd DAFO have prepared a preliminary assessment report. The Houay Sot scheme was not considered feasible . It was only 63 ha in extent, and the Houay Sot stream has low dry season flows and the design shows two earth embankment dams required to irrigate the area. The estimated cost was high, over US$ 454, 000 or US$ 7,200 per hectare. Also, the irrigation area is located near to a river that is known to cause flash-flood damage along its banks. The second area proposed is along the banks of the small Nam Pan river, about 12 km north east of Khamkerd District Center. The DAFO development report and irrigation concept design shows an earth dam 780 m long and 29 m high with a high spillway an d main canal inta ke structure. A less expensive option has been identified and an irrigation area of around 150 ha as shown in Figure 22-1. The revised proposal includes: Irrigate only below the 530 masl contour and a cro pping pattern of wet season rice and dry season vegetable and field crops. An embankment dam about 190 m long and 10 m high located on the Na m Pan. A reinforced concrete spillway. If no storage is proposed, the dam will be smaller. A gravity canal system distribution system including a main canal, 4 secondary canals and a series of tertiary canals. The inclusion of households from the existing Ban Nam Pan as they will have traditional land- rights in the area. Exercises based on the topographical survey maps will be sufficient as a pre-feasibility study. For a feasibility study, further investigations are required including: geotechnical, for the dam foundation and borrow pits; hydrology, including Nam Pan mean monthly and flood discharges; soils in the irrigation area; and cost comparisons of various options on cropping patterns, dam storages and command areas. The preliminary estimated construc tion cost is about US$ 400,000 not in cluding survey and mapping, the feasibility study, detail design, UXO survey and clea rance. More information on the Nam Pan irrigation scheme can be found in Appendix M, Khamkerd Resettlement Village Site Planning, of Volume 2 of the Social Development Plan.

This is particularly significant for agriculture and irrigation as many of the identified re settlement areas are undulating with poor sandy soils. The poor soils must be improved by agricultural techniques and different methods can be attempted. The Pilot Village Irrigation Scheme is located in Resettlement Area 16 about 3-km east of Oudomsouk, the Nakai District Center. The resettlers are from Ban Nong Boua, Ban Sailom and the Pamanton Hamlets. Later, some households from Ban Sop Ma and Keng Gnao may also will relocate to this area. The village housing and irrigated ga rden areas consist of basically fo ur hills that will become connected islands once reservoir impoundment tak es place. The hills are irregularl y shaped and the soils have been identified as sandy loams. Access roads were cleared and housing and farm plots established. The villagers commenced cropping their plots during the 2002 wet season and the irrigation scheme was constructed during the 2002/3 dry season. An electricity supply is in place. The Pilot Village irrigation scheme consists of 17.74 ha for twenty nine households later increased to thirty. In the 2005/6 dry season the conveyance and distribution pipe systems will be expanded and the Area 16 total net irrigation farm land ar ea will be 28.24 ha for fifty households. The Houay Malai is a small stream located adjacent to Area 16 flowing to the Nakai Plateau. After investigations, it was decided that this stream woul d be developed for the i rrigation water source. The stream is not perennial, but a dam constructed on it can store sufficient water for irrigating dry season crops. After Nakai Reservoir impoundment it will be inundated nearly every year. However, as the reservoir recedes, it will trap and store water for the dry season months of low reservoir elevations even when the reservoir has receded far from the area. 22.7.2 Irrigation Scheme Components Earth Dam and Spillway on Houay Malai The earth dam is an impervious homogeneous embankme nt with a crest length of 86 m, a crest width of 5 m at elevation El. 532. The upstream and downstream slopes are 1:2. 5 (v:h). The upstream slope has riprap protection on a sand and gravel bed. The downstream slope is protected by sodding and will require riprap protection before the impoundment of the Nakai Reservoir. The crest is protected by a gravel laterite camber. The spillw ay is a trapezoidal channel exca vated through sandstone with a reinforced concrete structure to ma intain the spillway crest at El. 529. 50. The channel is 31 m wide with 1:2 side slopes and can discharge a 50-year return period flood of 60 m3/s while maintaining a minimum freeboard of 1.3 m. It is estimate d that the dam will store about 800,000 m3 of water. This is sufficient to also supply the adjacent Area 17 irrigation scheme with water. Supply Canal, Pump Station, Delivery Pipe and Header Tank A supply canal, 420 m long, 2 m bed width, 1:1.5 side slopes and variable depth, was required to convey water from the reservoir to the pump station sump during low reservoir elevations. The pump station lifts the irrigation water from the reservoir to a reinforced concrete header tank. A pontoon mounted centrifugal pump is able to discharge a peak irrigation water requirement of 29 l/s at a total head of 40 m. The pump is driven by a 22. 5-kw electrically driven motor. A 285 m long, 20-cm diameter steel pipe delivers the water to the header tank, storage capacity 56 m 3, at elevation El. 554. The header tank is located above the housing area and is also used for storing water for non-potable domestic use. This domestic water supply passes through a filtration system. Buried Pipe Conveyance and Distribution Systems The irrigation conveyance and distribu tion systems is by buried pipelines because of the undulating area topography. The header tank is at such an elevation that the pipe systems can convey and distribute, by gravity, irrigation water throughout the irrigation area to the farm plots. Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 25 Conveyance pipelines are 20 or 16-cm diameter uPVC pi pes. From the main lines, the water is distributed by high density polyethylene pipes varying from 10 to 6-cm diameter at the farm inlet. Each farm plot has its own multi-purpose farm inlet so that various irrigation methods of the plots are possible. 22.7.3 Pilot Village Scheme Cost Pre-qualification and local competitive bidding procedur es were undertaken invo lving Contractors from Vientiane and Thakek. A Contractor from Thakek was awarded the contract at a contract price of US$ 143,269. However it was later decided to construct a la rger dam downstream so that it could also be a water source for the adjacent Area 17. This, and im provements to the farm inlet design and pipeline systems caused cost escalations result ing in a final cost of US$ 197,800. To complete the remaining 10.5 ha before the next resettlement, the conveyance and distribution pipeline systems must be extended at an estimated cost of about US$ 23,300. Before Nakai Reservoir inundation their must be extra rip rap protection placed on the downstream slope of the dam embankment. Also extra connections will be required to the steel deliver y pipeline as the ponto on range of elevations will increase. This extra work is estimated at US$ 16,000. Also required is an 8 ha rice paddy area. An area has been provisionally identified south of the pilot scheme and the estimated developm ent cost is US$ 61,700. The final scheme estimated cost is US$ 298,870. For the total 36.3 ha scheme, this equates to US$ 8,200 per ha. If the cost of the dam and spillway is deducted from the total, the cost is about US$ 5,600 per ha. 22.8 CHALLENGES IN PREPARING PRELIMINARY DESIGN AND BUDGET 22.8.1 Contours on Topographic Maps The maps used for the study are scale 1:25,000 prep ared from aerial photographs take n from December 1992 to January 1993. These maps show 10 m contour intervals with the flatter areas showing 5 m contour intervals. The flatter and gently sloping Resettlement Areas must have an open canal distribution system. For paddy irrigation, the lowe st order canal should have a wate r level, or command, 15 to 20-cm above the rice field. Therefore 10-cm contours are required. Consequently it is impossible to prepare accurate cost estimates for open canal systems with 5 m contour interval maps. Similarly, for the supply channels required for conv eying water from the low reservoir elevations to a pump station sump, it is difficult to accurately estimate the canal excavation depths and volumes. 22.8.2 Soils and Irrigation Potential Soils are of major importance for assessing i rrigation potential and de velopment requirements. Information on the soils in the area s is limited to a few samples and ge neral observations with no detailed mapping available. As stated previously, paddy rice requ ires soils with a significan t clay content to reduce the percolation rate. It has been assumed that paddy areas are found in the individual sites adjacent to the farm plot areas. 22.8.3 Location of Village Housing The exact locations of the village housing areas with in the Resettlement Areas ar e not as yet known. In the smaller areas with undulating terrain, for example northern Area 8, the location of the housing is important. Similarly for a large village popu lation such as Ban Nakai Tai in Area 2. It has been assumed that housing areas are clustered and kept separate from farm and paddy irrigation areas for community reasons. However some villagers may wish for their houses to be located next to their farm plot. Alternatively many of the villagers w ill wish the village to be located alongside Road 8B and the Resettlement Road for increased trade an d passenger services from passing vehicles. The village housing area has been estimated, based on the Pilot Village layout , at 0.07 ha per household for housing and access roads plus 2.0 ha per village for the school, market, workshop, clinic, community center and rice mill. On the maps shown, the housing , farm and paddy land ha s been combined (apart Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 26from Area 18). The exact location of houses and other buildings will be decided after to pographic survey and mapping and in consultation with the resettlers. 22.8.4 Route of Road 8B Road 8B, from Ban Oudomsouk to Ban Thalang, will be inundated after reservoir impoundment. It will be relocated to pass through, or south of, the central and northern resettlement areas. There will be large bridge constructed over the Nam Theun at Ban Thalang. South of Ban Oudomsouk a similar design standard access road will be constructed for the c onstruction of Saddle Dams and to the Resettlement Villages. Road 8B will be a Standard B two-la ne road of formation width 7 m. The final total right of way will be more than 20 m and in places over 40 m when considering side drains, shoulders and cut and fill slopes. The roads alignment is likely to be adjusted during construction, which is not due for completion until December 2007. This inherently gives problems for the detailed planning of layouts for small 100 x 50 m farm plots or 40 x 40 m paddy plots in the smaller resettlement areas in undulating terrain, particular the northern areas 7, 8, and 13. A road cutting through the center of an irrigation area will increase costs through: Pipe or canal lines will have to be conveyed under the road by the construction of culvert or siphon structures; The culverts and siphons will have additional hydr aulic head loss thus affecting the design of the system upstream of the structure. Thus, the road construction and irrigation construc tion will have to be closely coordinated in these resettlement sites. 22.8.5 Land Availability Land is available for the irrigation systems and villa ge housing areas at all the sites except at Area 13. After reservoir inundation Area 13 will become a smal l peninsula divided by the relocated Road 8B. South of the main irrigation area there is ridge that will pr event irrigation distribution to the most southern part. However Area 13 is adjacent to the Nam Theun deep channel and the farmers will have good access for fisheries. Consequently it is likely that the Ban Th alang villagers will concentr ate on fisheries and there will be less demand for irrigation. The available land is tight in the following areas: Area 11, Ban Sop Phene. This area is undulating and gravity distribution from a central header tank will not be possible to two high spots to the east and southwest (and these will thus be managed as rainfed plots; Area 7, Ban Nong Boua Kham. This area is also undulating, irregular in shape and cut by the relocated Road 8B. The villagers chose Areas 7 and 7a because their predominant occupation is cattle production with the view to use the large adjacent drawdown areas for cattle grazing. Consequently Area 7a is far from low reservoi r elevations and for irrigation development, will require a long length of supply canal with deep cu ts and excessive excavation volumes. Area 7a is also small and has not been considered for irrigation; Area 2, Ban Nakai Tai. This is the largest sc heme with 194 households and 157 ha is required for the new village and irrigated land. 22.8.6 Preliminary Cost Estimates Preliminary cost estimates for the reservoir re settlement schemes and the Nam Pan Scheme in Bolikhamxai Province have been pr epared. The estimates are based on outline designs prepared from 1:25,000 scale maps and will change after topogra phic survey and mapping, soil surveys and the preparation of detail designs and drawings. Some comments on this subject are as follows: Supply canal excavation: This may reduce through refining the canal alignment through lower elevations not shown on the maps such as unmarked natural drainage lines. It will increase if the locations of the natural low reservoir areas are fa rther than the El. 538 contour than shown on the Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 27maps. Then the supply channel will have to be longer. Also the costs w ill be increased if the excavation encounters strata of hard rock that ca nnot be ripped by a bulldozer and blasting is required. Pontoon pump station: This should not have significant change. Steel delivery pipes: The steel pipe estimate is about 16 percent of the total cost and is a significant item. Regarding length, the worst case has been taken. If the pipeline route passes through more undulations not shown on the maps, then more bends will be required and earthworks and concrete quantities will increase. If during detail design the pipeline is found to be too long, and also affecting pump station costs too much, then el evated header tanks, located nearer the pump station, will be considered. Header tanks and stilling basins: If these are located at ground le vel and not elevated, then there should be little change. Anyway, an increase in th ese estimates will not significantly increase the overall cost estimate. Pipeline and canal distribution systems: These are the least accurate estimates as there is a combination of field crops and rice requiring different irrigation layouts and water requirements. The estimates can increase significantly if the irrigation areas as shown on the preceding maps have to be more spread out than shown. For example there may be unsuitable soils within the areas shown and a system has to be more spread out thus increasing conveyance costs. If the topography of a particular site is found to be not suitab le, then perhaps secondary pumping is required. 22.8.7 Scheme Expansion to Accommodate Growing Populations The irrigation systems should have the potential for expansion to accommodate growing populations after resettlement. With open channel canal systems canal discharges can initially be increased by increasing flow depth and reducing the freeboard. Later it can be increased by remodeling either by increasing the depth or bed width. With pump and buried pipe schemes, it is more difficult and expensive. As stated previously, land for expansion is available at most sites with the exception of Area 13. It is tight at Areas 11,7 and 2. In engineering terms, the systems can be expanded in the following ways: Supply Canals A 1 m bed width is sufficient for much larger schemes. Pump Stations Pumps are typically replaced every fifteen years. They can be replaced with larger pumps. Delivery Pipes Steel delivery pipe diameters will be conservatively designed. They can accommodate larger discharges without undue increases in velocity and head losses that would affect the pump discharge. Header Tanks The volume of the header tanks may ha ve to be increased if the buffering storage proves to be insufficient resulting in frequent switching off of the pumps or overflow wastage. Pipe Systems Branch lines can be extended. Main lines are more difficult. Plastic pipes, correctly installed, can last fifty years. If the main lines need increased discharge, then extra parallel pipes will be required. 22.9 PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATES 22.9.1 General Preliminary cost estimates for the reservoir resettlement schemes and the Nam Pan scheme in Khamkerd District, Bolikhamxai Province have been prepared. Th e total estimated cost for the reservoir schemes is US$2,948,400 and the Nam Pan scheme is US$400,000, a total of US$3,348,400. The average cost per hectare for the reservoir schemes is around US$3,900 and for Nam Pan is US$2,700. For the reservoir Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 28schemes there is a variati on from around US$3,200 at Area 19, one of the larger areas, to around US$8,160 for Area 16, which necessitated an extra dam and spillway for the Pilot Village Scheme. 22.9.2 Changes to Cost Estimates After Detail Design After further topographic survey an d investigations and detail design the estimates will change. Some comments on this subject are as follows: Supply canal excavation: This may reduce through refining the canal alignment through lower elevations not shown on the maps such as unmarked natural drainage lines. It will increase if the locations of the natural low reservoir areas are fa rther than the El. 538 contour than shown on the maps. Then the supply channel will have to be longer . Also if the excavation meets strata of hard rock that cannot be ripped by a bulldozer and blasting is required, then an increased excavation unit rate will be required. Pontoon pump station: This should not have significant change. Steel delivery pipes: At about 13 percent of the total cost of the reservoir schemes, this is a significant item. Straight lines of pipe have been assumed, however if a pipeline route passes through undulations not shown on the maps, then extra bends are required and earthworks and concrete quantities will increase. If the pipeline is found to be too long, an d affecting pump station costs too much, then elevated header tanks, loca ted nearer the pump stati on, will be considered. Header tanks and stilling basins: If these are located at ground le vel and not elevated, then there should be little change. Elevated tanks will be more expensive. However an increase in these estimates will not significantly incr ease the overall cost estimate. Pipeline and canal distribution systems: These are the least accurate estimates as there is a combination of field crops and rice requiring different irrigation layouts and water requirements. Survey and mapping of the areas are not complete and the areas may be significantly more undulating than shown on the maps. The estimates can increase significantly if the irrigation areas as shown on the preceding maps have to be more spread out than shown. For example there may be unsuitable soils within the areas shown and a sy stem has to be more spread out thus increasing conveyance costs. If the topography is found to be significantly more undulating than assumed, then perhaps secondary pumping will be required. Consultations with villages - both thos e which will have gained experience in the first three schemes ) and those from other villages - will also be a crucial aspe ct of review and improvements to the designs of irrigation systems, and especially for the on-farm distribution systems. 22.10 FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS REQUIRED 22.10.1 General The following surveys are required for the identification of the most suitable areas for irrigation development and the detail design of the irrigation schemes: Topographic survey and mapping including establishing bench marks and control points and the leveling of spot heights to establish contour lines; Soil survey and mapping to determine soil ty pes, fertility and infiltration criteria; Geotechnical investigations to determine the nature and strength of lower ground horizons. For the resettlement schemes, the geotechnical investigations are limited to the alignment of the supply channels as there are no weirs or dams involved. These investigations are limited to determine if rock excavation is required or not, and to determine if the proposed side slopes of 1:1.5 are suitable in deep excavations and need to be increased. Consultation with Resettlers and village participation is an integral part of the general planning and design process. Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 2922.10.2 Village Consultations There will be further consultation with the Resettlers. With regard to irrigation development, this is required to: For the villages that all households do not wish to move together, Sop Ma, Phonsavang and Ka Oy. Determine exactly how many households wish to move to individual area; Further defining the preferred exact location of the village housing. For example, whether it is adjacent to Road 8B or the reservoir boundary. This is important in all areas, but particularly for the sites where the area is limited such as Area s 13 and 7. Also there will be access roads to the housing area and the location of future roads will affect the design of the irrigation distribution system; They will have knowledge of the area, perhaps limited in some cases, and th e locations of the farm and paddy areas may be further defined; Once the maps are prepared, the farmers will part icipate in the preparation of the layouts, particularly when there are alternative layout options available. 22.10.3 Topographic Survey and Mapping Detailed terms of reference for the survey and mapping have been prepared, and include the following requirments: Permanent bench marks are primar y control points. There will be at least four bench marks per area and six in the larger areas. They will all be located above El. 538; A closed traverse survey is required to locate the coordinates of the bench marks and establish a series of secondary control points. These can be wo oden pegs. The traverse will be located as close to the El. 538 contour as possible; A density of 25 spot levels per hectare for the preparation of contour maps; Maps are prepared on a scale of 1:5,000. Contour lines are drawn at 0.5 m intervals. For detailed village and irrigation planning, maps are prepared to a 1:2,000 scale. In the undulating areas 0.5 m contour intervals are drawn. In the flat, gently sloping areas where canal systems are required, 0.1 m intervals are required; The reservoir survey and mapping contracts will in clude the installation of beacons demarcating the reservoir full supply elevation of El. 538. The beacons will be of 1.5 m long concrete posts painted white. The first topographic surveys where undertaken in early to mid 2003 (Ban Ph onsavang and Oudomsouk) and surveys in the remaining plateau resettlement si tes, and Nan Nam Pan, will be undertaken from October 2003 to March 2005 22.10.4 Soil Survey and Mapping To arrive at a reasonably accurate determination of the agricultural potential of the soils in the different areas for the different crops, soil surveys and mapping are required before detailed planning. Also infiltration tests are required, particularly for identifying paddy areas but also for estimating canal infiltration losses and determining whet her canal lining is required or not. 22.11 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AND EXTENSION SERVICES 22.11.1 Operation and Maintenance The Resettlers currently have limited experience wi th irrigated agriculture and practices. However, they are now gaining this experience in Ban NongBoua (Pilot Village) and will the also in Ban Bouama and Phonsavang. NTPC TA will train villages - both cl assroom and in-field - in both irrigation system management, operation and maintainence and in irrigated agriculture water use (this is already underway in Ban NongBoua). Chapter 22: Irrigation System Planni ng for the Plateau Resettlement Area November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 30Irrigation scheme operation and maintenance (O&M) activities are vitally important to ensure an equitable supply of water to all scheme areas and scheme longevity, and the NTPC TA will provide training and support to address this issue. Funds to cover O & M cost s, amd GoL staff participation will be covered by the \"Social and Environmental Remediation Fund\" (SERF). The maximum fund amount is US$ 7,500,000 made up of US$ 300,000 per annum fo r 25 years. Of this, US$75,000 per annum has been indicatively allocated to the maintenance and repair of the pump stations and system as a whole, and a subsidy on the cost of electricity.. The maintenance of the on-farm irriga tion facilities and the system operati on is the responsibility of the farmers. Maintenance activities for buried pipe system s are less than required for canal systems. Activities include the flushing out of pipelines, while for canal systems, canals and drains need to be cleaned and repaired. The pump stations must be kept clean and the pumps regularly greased. The flexible hoses and electric cables require attention as the pontoon will be constantly moving with the varying reservoir elevations. The main operational item is turning the pump off and on so that each farm plot within the system has an equitable water supply sufficient for crop growth. In the undulating areas it is important that not too much water is applied as this may cause soil erosion problems. All the farmers receiving water from either the same header tank, or main canal or main pipeline will receive assistance with the formation of a Water User s Group. When there is more than one group they will join together to form a Wate r Users Association. A typical Grou p and Association have a Chairman, Secretary, full-time Pump Operator and Water Mast er/Bailiff and Treasurer. Th e Treasurer will become critical after the 25 years of SERF when the villa ges will have to pay for there own power and pump station costs. The Group or Association will receive trai ning in the dynamics of irrigation including crop water requirements and soil moisture parameters. Assistance will be given with the preparation of operational timetables. There will be some initial prob lems but after a couple of irrigation seasons the Group should be able to able to achieve optimum scheme operation and irrigation efficiencies. The schemes are not large and do not cover more th an one village. Consequently no significant O&M problems are envisaged. Similarly, after a couple of seasons, the Group or Association should be able to distribute on-farm maintenance activities such as canal cleaning throughout the beneficiaries within the Group. 22.11.2 Extension Services As stated previously, the Theun Du ane Demonstration Farm and the Pilo t Village Irrigation Scheme have been established. Both are located on areas of sandy soils and by the time of full resettlement and reservoir impoundment, there will be considerable ex perience gained and an agriculture knowledge-base for the areas established. Chapters 21, 6, 7 and 27 (Agricul ture and Livestock Schedule) provide details on the extension service and support to be provided to the villagers. These service will be provided rather intensively during the relocation and transition period, and phased out gradually to normal levels.. The Agricultural Development Program includes the following strategies: Soil fertility improvement through increased application of organic matter Institutional support through Government organizations; Identifying suitable cropping patterns; Organizing the marketing of fruits and vegetables; The training of farmers in irrigated rice production techniques. The above strategies are already being practiced at the Ban Nong Boua Pilot Village ( a report of which is due in early 2005); ********** * * * ********** Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 iCHAPTER 23 FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT FOR NAKAI RESETTLERS Table of Contents 23 FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT FOR NAKAI RESE TTLERS.............................................1 23.1 INTRODUCTION ............................................................................................................................... ..1 23.1.1 Current Forestry Situat ion..................................................................................................... ........................ 1 23.1.2 The Resettlement Area an d Forest Re sources..................................................................................... ....... 1 23.1.3 Forestry Development for Improv ed Livelihoods an d Incomes............................................................. 3 23.1.4 Strategy for Resettler Forestry Development .................................................................................... ......... 3 23.2 VILLAGE FORESTRY EXPERIENCE IN LAO PDR ..........................................................................4 23.3 LEGAL BASIS FOR VILLAGE FORESTRY AT NAKAI PLATEAU ......................................................4 23.4 PLANNING PRINCIPLES AND FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN......................................................6 23.4.1 Forestry Development and Manageme nt by Villagers, for Villa gers....................................................... 6 23.4.2 Sustainable Management of Natural Forests for Timber Produc tion ..................................................... 7 23.4.3 Log Marketing and Wood Pro cessing.............................................................................................. ............ 8 23.4.4 Forest Improvement with Loca l Species.......................................................................................... of NTFP ......................................................................................... ........ 9 23.4.6 Conservation of Soils, Water Resource s, Biodiversity and Scenery....................................................... 10 23.5 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE NAKAI PLATEAU VILLAGE FORESTRY PROGRAM ...................10 23.6 COMPONENT 1: INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT .......................................................................10 23.6.1 Technical A ssistance........................................................................................................... .......................... rk .......................

Social Development Plan - Volume 2 123 FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT FOR NAKAI RESETTLERS 23.1 INTRODUCTION 23.1.1 Current Forestry Situation Timber and other forest products are significant sources of revenue at the Nakai Plateau. However, the current administrative and management arrangements are such that local communities receive little direct benefit, especially from commerc ial forestry operations. Village rs have legal rights to 5 m3/family of timber to build houses for newly established families, but they are not authorised to engage in timber harvesting for commercial purposes. Individuals are sometimes involved in commercial logging and sawmilling operations as workers or tree spotters . Forest resources are, however, important for households, providing for rural energy needs (fuelw ood for cooking and resin for lighting), fodder for livestock, fencing, non-timber forest products (N TFP), wildlife, and timber for housing and tools estimated at around 1 m3 per year per household. While PM D ecree 59 (2002) and implementing MAF Regulation 0204 (2003) have reformed the role of villagers and their benefits from commercial timber harvesting in production forest areas, the NT2 resettlement program is considered a special case, and the GOL has allocated, via PM Decree 193, the whole forest area on the southern side of the Nakai reservoir as a Resettlement Area to be used by Nakai resettlers as a community forest for sustainable commercial harvesting and timber utilization. 23.1.2 The Resettlement Area and Forest Resources The defined resettlement area is 20,692 hectares, of which 18,106 hectares (o r 88 %) is classified as forest land that is highly variable in terms of composition and volume. The other 2,600 hectares is to be reserved for resettlement and agriculture. The Resettlement Area forests have been identified as belonging to four main forest ecotypes: Dry Dipterocarp, Dry Evergreen, Mixed Deciduous, and Mixed Broadleaf and Pine (including some areas of pure pine) Mixed broadleaf and pine is the most common. Pinus merkusii (mai pek) is the local pine species. The hardwood and Anisoptera robusta (mai bak). A forest inventory was carried out in 2001 1. A full list of the main tree/timber species found is presente d in Table 23-1 to Table 23-4 below.

Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3Logging and shifting cultivation have in the past heavily degraded much of the forested land. After excluding: (a) contiguous areas wi th low stand volume (i.e. <80 m3/ha) in about 7,793 ha - degraded production forest, (b) inaccessible an d steep forests of about 4,723 ha, an d (c) present and future areas for resettlement and agriculture of about 2,586 ha, only ab out 5,590 ha of the 18,106 ha forested land can be considered for commercial production in the short to medium term. The results of the 2001 inve ntory area and available volume analyses are: Table 23-5: Forested Land in the Resettlement Area by Forest Ecotype Stocked, production forests Degraded production forestForests on steep slopes All land in Resettlement Area Forest ecotype Area (ha) Volume (m3/ha) Area (ha) (no disaggregated area or volume data for these forest zones) Area (ha) Volume (m3/ha) Dry Dipterocarp - - 310 310 35 Dry Evergreen 1,108 157 2,576 3,684 126 Mixed Deciduous 263 107 and Pine it has been determ ined there are some 17,000 cubic me ters of commercial wood on degraded production forest lands and 5,100 cu bic meters on project construction lands. 23.1.3 Forestry Development for Improved Livelihoods and Incomes The development of organized community forestry on the Nakai Plateau has good potential to provide diversified income and employment opportunities. For example, by practicing sustainable forest management, the communities can harvest up to 6,000 m 3 annually of timber on a sustainable basis from the 5,590 ha of production forests, obtain addition al incomes from controlle d, well managed forest grazing and farming domesticated non-timber forest products. 23.1.4 Strategy for Resettler Forestry Development The NT2 Project is required to ensure that PAP's part icipate in the planning and implementation, and then obtaining financial benefits from commercial forest operations conducted in a sustainable manner. This will require the establishment and training a Bo ard of Management to ap prove all investments and operating budgets and organize village support and participation in planning and implementation of the various forest activities. To achieve this, the practice of village forestry will institutionalised by establishing the Nakai Plateau Village Forestry Association (NPVFA) as the Board of Management, and developing its capacity to administer the NPVFA, manage forest resources, and ru n forestry business enterp rises on behalf of the PAP's. This approach to forest land and resources development and management by a well trained local forest organization (NPVFA) working with village based fore stry groups under individual village community control, is expected to achieve the following outcomes: 1. Increased off-farm employment and incomes in th e Resettlement Area through sustainable forest management, harvesting, and processing of forest products; 2. Regular incomes to resettled households in the form of annual dividends, with any reserves to be set aside to support other community or forest based enterprises; Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 43. Organization and support provided for participatory planning and zoning of stocked and degraded forest lands at village level, to enable multi purpose management an d activities such as controlled forest grazing and fodder tree and grass crop establishment; 4. Participatory planning and technical and financia l assistance to domest ic NTFP development; 5. Self-sufficiency provided in timb er, fuelwood, and wild NTFPs; and 6. Watersheds protected, especially in steep areas, and conserving biodiversity, both in situ and in specially zoned areas, as well as sites of scenic, historical, and cultural significance. 23.2 VILLAGE FORESTRY EXPERIENCE IN LAO PDR A customary form of community fore st and land-use management alread y exists amongst all the villages on the Plateau, as in most of the Lao PDR, resulting from a mix of traditional village practices based on ethnic and spiritual beliefs, village regulations, and formal and inform al cultural norms on the one hand, and GOL policy and regulations on the other. At the vill age level, these rules usually differentiate between locals and non-locals, and define th e roles and responsibilities of indivi duals in relation to sharing of community resources for various purposes. Village management rules are generally consistent with government policies and regulations. This village management of community resources may be more appropriately termed as \"village forestry\" since entire villages are involved in and benefit from forestry within their village boundaries, rather than any single interest group. In the last ten years experience in organizing village s for forestry development has been developed in Lao PDR. In Khammouane Province itself , village forestry has been introduced in a number of villages by a GoL - World Bank funded Project (FOMACOP) and the Japanese Overseas Volunteer Corporation (JOVC), the latter including a village in Nakai Pl ateau (Nakai Neua). The FOMACOP model provides guidelines for organizing a village forestry associati on (VFA), training villagers to run the association, providing village work teams with sk ills to conduct sustainable forest management operations, formulating and implementing a forest management plan, and utilizing the benefits from forestry for the welfare of members and for village developmen t. A similar model approved under PM Decree 59 is now being implemented in four provinces as part of the WB/FINNIDA/GOL Sustainable Forestry and Rural Development Project, aimed at sustainable management of production forest areas. Thus, there are systems and procedures for forest management and for organizing village forestry associations that have already been proven to result in sustainable forest management (SFM) by several independent assessments (e.g. a SGS pre-assessment fo r forest certification, an Indufor assessment for testing the draft National Criteria and Indicators of SFM, a MAF assessment of village forestry, and a World Bank post-evaluation of FOMACOP). However, none of these models includes the participation of villages in post harvest processing and marketin g as planned in this special case in the NT2 Resettlement Area 23.3 LEGAL BASIS FOR VILLAGE FORESTRY AT NAKAI PLATEAU Government policy promotes village participation in forest ry management and acti vities. PM Decree 102 (1993) recognizes village administrati on as a formal level of the govern ment with rights and duties to implement policies at the village level. The Forestry Law (1996) recognizes the v illage as the grass-roots level of a four-tiered forestry admi nistration that includes the national, provincial , district, and village levels. The law states that village authorities have the ri ght and duty to develop specific regulations that are \"appropriate to the actual conditions of the village\". Decree No. 59/2002/PM, providing for implementing the Sustainable Ma nagement in Production Forest Areas (PFA), states that \"Village Fo restry Organizations shall organize the villagers' participation to implement all sustainable production forest management activities within the scope of their capacity with FMUs under outlined instructions and regulations\". Such activities include demarcation, land-use planning, pre-harvest inventories and tree marking, management planning, monitoring and control, harvesting activities, log sales and receipt of revenues and other development activities consistent with forest management agreements and plans\" (Article 8.4). However, due to the need to provide resettling villagers impacted by the NT2 project with a guaran teed source of income, the GOL has decided to enact Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 5specific legislation and regulations to enable the Resettlement Area forests to be commercially managed by the resettling villages, as a special case.

One of the first steps in organizing the NPVFA has been the drafting and approval of its Article of Associations ( direct translation from Lao version being 'Rules and Regulations') which were formulated in a participatory manne r in 2003. An English translation of this document is attached as Appendix L-1. A 70-year Forest Management Contract will be drafted and signed jointly by the NPVFA, Nakai DAFO, PAFO, and the Khammouane Provincial Administ ration. This contract will provide for the rights and obligations of NPVFA and those of Nakai DAFO and PAFO. A guide for such a Forest Management Contract may be the 50-year contracts developed by FOMACOP. A Contract duration of 70 years is considered both (a) consis tent with the Land Law (2003) and (b) be sufficient to provide incentive to villages to regenerate and manage the forest for the long term production of hardwood and (quality) softwood timbers, which may take at least 50 to 70 years to reach harvestable maturity. The NPVFA Articles of Association , and proposed Forest Management Contract will be to include the duties and rights of villages required under PM Decr ee 59 and MAF implementing regulation to cover all aspects of forest management , rather than the village ro le merely being a labour force as outlined in MAF Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 6Regulation 535 and PM Orders 10 and 15. Specifically, the NPVFA will have the sole rights to harvest and sell timber and NTFP from the allocated forest, provided this is done in a sustainable manner. Sustainable forest management is the main ob ligation of NPVFA, which will be undertaken by carrying out planning, forest management (including forest regeneration and stand improvement), protection, and conservation activities. 23.4 PLANNING PRINCIPLES AND FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN A Forest Management Plan will be developed by the NPVFA, assisted by DAFO, PAFO and NTPC TA, and updated every five years. This plan w ill provide for the long-term management of the Resettlement Area forests and their timber and non-timber resources. A more detailed annual operational plan for forest management and utilization (and allocation of a quota) will be formulated as the implementing plan, based on more detailed annual pre-harvest inventories. A set of planning principles which have guided the drafting of the NPVFA Articles of Association and will continue to be used in the Resettlement Area forest manage ment planning and utilization are proposed to provide a basis for assessing the suitability and feasibility of actions planned to meet the forestry development objectives, as follows: \u0099 Forest development and manageme nt by villagers, for villagers; \u0099 Zonation and sustainable management of natural forests for timber production and other forest uses; \u0099 Wood processing into timber, semi-finished and finished products; \u0099 Support to individual village committee organizations; \u0099 Planning and development of domesticated NTFP where appropriate and financially feasible. \u0099 Promotion of strategies and methodologies for controlled forest grazing. \u0099 Forest plantation development with local species, if and where appropriate and financially feasible; \u0099 Conservation of the resource base of wild NTFPs; and \u0099 Conservation of soils, water resour ces, biodiversity and scenery. The Management and Operations Plans will be impl emented through a NPVFA Logical Framework for its Business Plan that also includes other activities described later in this report. 23.4.1 Forestry Development and Management by Villagers, for Villagers The Resettlement Area and its forest resources have been legally allocated to villagers who will be affected by the NT2 Project on the Nakai plateau2. The object of management of this forest area is geared mainly towards providing sustainable employ ment, income, and other benefits to the affected villagers. Village forestry, together with land and forest use planning and allocation, will be the main vehicle for securing tenure for villagers and the leading role of villa gers in forestry develo pment and management. Village forestry at Nakai Plateau will see the (affected) villagers as managers of the forest resources that have been allocated to them. As forest managers, they will: Collect the needed information (e.g. through forest inventories); Formulate specific policies for sustainable forest management; Prepare plans to carry out those policies; and. Implement plans and make operational decisions. At first the villagers may have limited capacity to un dertake all these activities, and outside help will be provided to develop sustainable forest management systems and procedures, trai n the villagers to apply 2 Decree on the Approval of the Allocation of the Resettlement and Forest Area to People and Village Organizations Affected by the Nam Theun 2 Project for Carrying out Forestry Business Activities. No. :37/PM April 12, 2002 Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7them, and guide the villagers until they are able to do the work them selves. Thus the Nakai DAFO, aided by NTPC TA, will provide technical assistance to NP VFA in all phases of forestry development from organizing the NPVFA, formulating a forest management plan, training villagers, and overseeing village forestry work. 23.4.2 Sustainable Management of Natural Forests for Timber Production Sustained yield is an important foundation of sustainable forest management. It means simply that the annual harvest volume from a forest must not exceed the annual growth rate (or yield) of commercial species, where annual yield is expressed as the me an annual increment (MAI) in stand volume after accounting for mortality and other drain from the timber resources. Sustained yield forest management will be applied specifically in production forests, wh ich together with forest plantations will be the only forest zone where commercial timber pr oduction will be allowed to take place. The adoption of such a sustained yield forest manage ment principle is the only way to ensure that timber production related employment would be sustained and that timber revenue (and thus dividends) would also be sustained or even increase over time , assuming increasing real timber prices. Sustainable management will require that the 18,106 ha of forested land in the Re settlement Area is zoned for into five main forest management zones/types, following the generally accepted categorization in the Lao PDR, as follows: (Well stocked) production forests. These will be composed of stands with volume of at least 80 m 3/ha and whose structure contains a naturally occurring proportion of small, medium, and large trees. Logged-over forests containing more than 80 m 3/ha but mainly in small and medium trees, as well as inaccessible and steep forests, will not be zo ned as production forests. Regenerating production forests. These will generally be a low-volume forest containing less than 80 m3/ha usually as a result of logging, but still containing g ood tree numbers of required species. Stands in this zone will be protected so that in ti me they will increase in stand volume and tree sizes and can be re-zoned as production forests. Protection forests. Regardless of stand volume, fo rests in steep slopes (generally exceeding 25\u00b0) and on the edge of water course's will be zone d for protection of soil and water re sources, as well as of wildlife that has sought refuge in th ese less accessible slopes. Conservation forests. While it may not be necessary to zone conservation forests within the production forests - as Lao PDR already has a considerable network of National Protected Areas (NPA) and the Resettlement Area itself is surrounded by two NPAs - conservation corridors connecting them the NPAs or other sections of particular value may be identified and zoned as conservation forests. In addition, inaccessible areas will also serve the function of a co nservation forest as they provide refuge to wildlife that has retreated from disturbed areas. Degraded forests, which may be converted to other land use purposes. Extremely low-volume forests with poor potential for natural regeneration into a production fo rest will be zoned as degraded forests. In the Resettlement Area, these forests usually result from shifting cultivation, excessive logging, and wind throw in logged-over stands. Permitted uses of degraded fo rests could include, subject to technical and financial viability studies, plantation of native species and do mesticated non timber fore st product development, and controlled grazing, and development of sustainable rainfed agriculture . Zoning of the forest area for the different propos ed uses involving a high level of local village involvement will be an integral part of forest ma nagement planning. For the purposes of this SDP, however, the area of current prod uction forests has already been estimated (from the 2001 forest inventory at 1% sampling intensity) to determine the level of employment and income that could be expected from forestry in the Resettlement Area. The results show that production forests would likely cover only about 5,590 ha after excl uding logged-over, steep, and in accessible forests and proposed settlement areas. Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 8 Table 23-7 shows the estimated sustainable annual harvest per ha from the production forests after deducting an allowance for logging damage and stand de velopment from the Mean Annual Increment (MAI) of commercial trees. For optimum stand growth, heavier harvests than shown should be made in dense dry evergreen forests bringing th e average stand density down from 157 m3/ha to say 130 m3/ha. Stands with volumes of 120-140 m3/ha have been shown in FOMACOP areas to grow faster than stands with volumes of 140-160 m3/ha. Based on a sustainable harvest rate of 1.2 m3/ha for hardwoods and 1.5 m3/ha for pines over the 5,590 ha of production forests, annual harvests of about 8,000 m3 could possibly be sustained. However, for budgeting and income forecast purposes, a s econd conservative annual harvest estimate of 6,000 m3 could also be used to calculate cost and returns, which will also provide a sensitivity analysis in terms of resource availability.

(3) Commercial trees in DE and MD is abou t 70-75% of total volume, MS about 90%. (4) Allowance for logging damage is 20-33% of logged volume. The rest of the allowance is a rese rve (left uncut) to improve the stand density (0.0 m3/ha for DE and MS, 1.1 m3/ha for MD). Silvicultural decisions , including the timing, intensity and method of harvesting, regeneration, and timber stand improvement, will be different for hardwoods and pines. Hardwoods generally occur in mixed, uneven-aged stands; pines often occur in pure, even-aged stands that co-exist with hardwood stands in the mixed forests in the Resettlement Ar ea. While a tree selection system is suitable for hardwood stands, mature pine stands are generally ha rvested by the seed-tree method or by clear cutting in patches, which are then regenerated naturally by seed bearing cones on the ground or from trees in surrounding stands, or by tree planting if natural regeneration fails. 23.4.3 Log Marketing and Wood Processing The generation of sufficien t annual incomes and dividends from the utilization of forests of the Resettlement Area (to meet the targ et of the NT2 Project) requires that the NPVFA will not only sell logs, but whenever possible and economic, will also transf orm the logs into timbe r, or semi-finished and/or finished timber products. Thus, the NPVFA may either: Option 1: Sell raw logs; Option 2: Primary conversion of raw logs and selling sawn wood - locally, possibly regionally; or Option 3: Secondary and tertia ry wood processing, and selling locally or exporting finished products. Under current Lao practice, Option 1 involves: A pre-harvest inventory to determine the species an d volume of timber available for harvesting; Securing a harvesting quota; Pre-selling standing timber; Harvesting the pre-sold volume of the agreed species; and Completing the sales of logs at a second landing. This practice aims to avoid the risk of harvesting timber that ultimately could not be sold, and would just decay and perish. [Note that this does not seem to have been the practice followed previously on the Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 9Nakai plateau, where there is a lot of timber cut bu t not collected, and thus lies decaying in-situ]. Sub- options include: (a) Selling standing timber by letting the buyer do the logging and payment of royalties, taxes, and fees; and (b) Conducting logging and final sales at a second land ing; receiving full payment for the logs; paying royalties, taxes, and fees; and releasing custody of the logs to the buyer. 23.4.4 Forest Improvement with Local Species Planting of local species will be employed mainly as a means to assist natural regeneration in harvested hardwood stands and to fully regenerate harvested pi ne stands in cases where natural regeneration fails. Conversion of natural forests to plantations will gene rally not be done. There ar e certain cases, however, where forest plantations may be established. An exampl e is where an under-stocked pine stand is in grave danger of wind throw. The remaining trees might be cut down and the area might then be converted to forest plantations of fast-growing species, should this option be assessed to be technically and economically viable. Alternatively, the area may be repl anted with pine seedlings. This may be seen as a pine plantation development; it may also be seen as simply artificially regenerating a naturally occurring pine stand. In any case, plantation development would be done, if at all, in scattered, small patches that would blend well with natural forest stands, rath er than as large contiguous units. This is not only good forestry practice in a generally natural forest area; it is also being encouraged in one of the criteria for forest certification by the Forest Stewardship Council. Subject to NPVFA consideration of the costs and benefits of FSC certification, this may form part of the strategy for forestry development in the Resettlement Area. In forest improvement work more detailed financial evaluations of different species suited to the available sites at different management regimes are required to justify NPVFA investments from its forest enterprise earnings. Substantial data is already available in the region to assist such evaluations. 23.4.5 Conservation of Resource Bases of NTFP The following NTFPs are collected for loca l use and consumption on Nakai Plateau: Rattan and bamboo shoots, which are cooked or sold; Bamboo and rattan for house construction and handicraft; Vegetables from 40 or more types of leaves from trees, shrubs, and herbs; Fish and other water animals like frog, shrimp , soft-shelled turtle, crab and mollusk; and Wildlife, including mammal species, bird species and reptile species, regularly eaten as a more importance source of protein than livestock. NTFPs for commercial use fall into four categories: Plant exudates (kisi, po heuang/my gaedtsana); Medicinal and condiments and Tree chouang, pos a). In the late 1990's, NTFPs were the most important source of cash inco me (41%) compared to livestock (32%), and off-farm employment (28%). In 1997, villa gers from five surveyed villages ranked kisi resin (14%) and fish and frogs (14%) as the most importan t NTFP (5%), and mushrooms (4%). Food products are more numerous and considered more important (56%) than non- food products (44%). The resource bases of NTFP include all forest ecotypes and zones, although the amount and type of NTFP vary by forest ecotype and zone. Current NT FP collection sites include those that would be Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 10flooded, and once resettled, villages would need to relocate their NTFP colle ction sites. Aside from flooding, over-collection and logging pose a threat to the resource bases of NTFP. Monitoring, assessment, and control are necessary to prevent over-co llection. The threat posed by logging is especially true when high-intensity logging is practiced, but no t when low-intensity, low-impact logging is practiced. 23.4.6 Conservation of Soils, Water Reso urces, Biodiversity and Scenery A significant portion of the Resettlement Area lies in the watershed of the future Nakai Reservoir (the rest is in the watershed of the Nam Katang. Forestry operations, if improperly done, could contribute to silting of the proposed reservoir. Thus, it is important to ensure that the soils an d water resources in the Resettlement Area are conserved by means of a number of measures that will be described in the forest management plan, the most important of which will be restricting logging operations to the dry season. The Resettlement Area is also bounded by the Nakai Nam Theun NPA and the Khammouane Limestone NPA, which are connected by corridors that include, or pass close to, parts of the northern and southern ends of the Resettlement Area. Wildlife often wanders from the two NPAs to the forests in the Resettlement Area. It will be important to ensure th at forestry operations in the Resettlement Area are done in a manner that minimizes disturbance to wildlife and their habitats. Low-intensity, low-impact logging can be designed to mimic nature in terms of intensity in the natural death and regeneration of trees, and has been found to cause minimal changes in forest structure and species composition. Thus, it would be appropriate for use in harvesting the production forests in the Resettlement Area in terms of its minimal disturbance of wildlife habitats. The Resettlement Area is located along the southern rim of the future reservoir. Once completed, the reservoir and its surroundings would provide scenic sites for outdoor recreation and would be an attractive destination for tourists. Forestry operations should therefore be done in a manner that would conserve the value of these scenic sites. Measures will be included in the forest management plan for this purpose, foremost of which is the application of low-intensity, low-impact logging and encouragement of natural regeneration of harvested stands. 23.5 MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE NAKAI PLATEAU VILLAGE FORESTRY PROGRAM To attain the forestry development objectives given in Section 23.4.1 on the basis of the planning principles given in Section 23.4, a number of activi ties will be implemented vi a the four programs or components of the Nakai resettlement forestry program: (1) Institutional Development; (2) Natural Forest Management; (3) Forestry Business and Enterprise Development; (4) Forest Improvement with Local Species. 23.6 COMPONENT 1: INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT Institutional development will include: \u0083 Organizing the NPVFA, in which all resettler villag ers have the right to be members, and a village forestry committee (VFC) and forestry work teams in each village; \u0083 The provision of Technical Assistance (TA) - mainly national, but also some regional and international TA, by NTPC, thru the start-up and training phases of the program; and \u0083 The gradual development of the capacity of villa gers and staff to administer the NPVFA and its forest management, utilization and marketing operations. 23.6.1 Technical Assistance Technical Assistance (TA) will be provided by in two parts: Short term TA support in the first 6 months to establish management and administration systems, and design, plan, procure and install income generating capital plant and equipments to secure early cash flows; and Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 11 Long term support to training programmes over a 3 year period for the gradual development of the capacity of villagers and staff to administer NPVFA and its forest mana gement, utilization, and marketing operations. These training programmes are outlined in Section 23.6.6 covering the capacity development and forest and forest in dustry training systems to be implemented.

Eligible affected families, which are those that have been registered before the cut- off date on 1 October 1998 or have subseque ntly grown from registered families, have been given opportunity to apply for and be enlisted as members of NPVFA. An Articles of Association and By-Laws has also been formulated via a participatory proc ess, and will be ratified by the enlisted members followed by an election of officer s and the formal approval of the NPVFA organization by the Governor of Khammouane. Th e By-Laws will be further developed as NPVFA incorporates to it the policies and regulations pertaining to its administration and the sustainable management and utilization of the forest. Figure 23-1 illustrates the organiz ational structure of NPVFA. The General Assembly of all villages is on top of the structure of NPVFA. The General Assembly will have two categories of members: (a) families and (b) individual family members (husband, wife, and unma rried children and close relatives living together as a family). A member family will be entitled to a single vote on matters brought to the general assembly for decision, as well as to a single share in the profits of the association. Individuals from a member family are entitled to seek employment in NPVFA operations, as well as to form their own member family after they get married. 23.6.3 Village Forestry Committees: To ensure better participation of member families in decision making and individual members in various activities, they will be orga nized into their respective Village Assembly and involved in NPVFA activities through their respective Village Forestry Committee (VFC). Thus NPVFA will essentially be an aggregation of village assemblies and their VFCs. A VFC will be composed of 5-8 vill agers depending on the size and pref erence of the village. It will be headed on concurrent basis by the village chief , who had already been elected by the village and who will also represent the village in the Board of Management. The other members will be appointed by the village chief after their confirmation by the village asse mbly. These members will include at the minimum a Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 12secretary , an accounts officer , and a village forester . The secretary will keep minute s of meetings of the VFC and take charge of records keeping. Th e accounts officer's primary respon sibility will be bookkeeping and safeguarding the cash and ot her assets of the village entrusted to th e VFC. The village forester will manage the different forestry work teams of the village. Deputi es or assistants may be appointed for each of the above-mentioned officers. 23.6.4 Forestry Work Teams Each village will organize forestry work teams to do the different forest management and utilization activities assigned by NPVFA to the village. Work teams will be organized for conducting forest inventory, tree marking, access track clearing, controlling logging and second landing operations, post- harvest assessment, regeneration and timber stand improvement, forest plantation development, forest protection, etc. Work team membership will not be mutu ally exclusive; in practice a team may be formed from another team, e.g. a tree marking team from the forest inventory team, to facilitate transfer of work related information from an activity to the next activity. NPVFA will also organize teams or crews whose member s will come from or represent each village. For example, an annual forest operations planning team will be form ed consisting of village foresters. Sawmilling crews will have villagers from different villag es as members, but a village will not have its own sawmilling crew. 23.6.5 Managerial and Technical Staff A professional manager will be hired by the Board of Management to plan and run the regular activities of NPVFA, provide management assistance to the VFCs, su pervise the village foresters, and look after the different business enterprises of NPVFA. The mana ger will organize his/her own management staff including a secretary, treasurer/cashier, accounta nt/bookkeeper, property officer/buyer, and office assistants. Managers and technicians will also be put in charge of running wood processing an d other enterprises, e.g. sawmilling, timber treatment and tertiary processing operations, as well as in timber chain-of-custody certification requirements. Villagers will be hired after training as technicians and even as managers if they are capable. The different managers will report directly to the NPVFA manager. As well, a marketing staff will be organized to take ch arge of all market related concerns, both buying inputs and selling processed produc ts. The staff will, however, focus on export marketing of processed wood products. 23.6.6 Compensation and Audit The villagers constituting the VFCs are entitled to compensation and other benefits at a rate to be determined by the Board of Management, including a sa lary for those who will be working full time, e.g. village forester. As well, the Board of Management will determine the rate of compensation and other benefits for the managerial and technical staff and wage rates for work teams. Each VFC will be transparently operated and subject to annual operations assessment and accounts audit by NPVFA, which in turn will be tr ansparently operated and subject to annual operations assessment and accounts audit internally by its Board of Inspection as provided for in Regulation No. 484/KM.GOV of 13 June 2002. In addition, NPVFA will be subject to an external audit by a provincial or other selected auditing organization. .

Activities to achieve this will be strategically guided by a Business Development Plan and Logframe that includes a training program and a long but sustained learning-by-doing process. Business planning and management training will be largely dealt with by NTPC and its contract specialists. The process of building up the capacity of NPVFA will be made possible by means of support provided and nurturing by NTPC, the RMU, Nakai DAFO, and Khammouane PAFO. The following discussion illustrates how capacity building will be done throug h training and immediate application of knowledge and skills obtained from training. Training approach In general each development activity will be preceded by systems develo pment and training. A multi-stage, modular, learning-by-doing training system will provide training of pr ovincial and district staff and villagers at the Nakai Plateau. Training will be multi-s tage involving training of staff followed by training of villagers. Training will be modular, and knowle dge and skills learned for a given module will be immediately applied in actual practice by villagers under staff supervision (l earning-by-doing) before another module is learned. The integration of systems development, training and application in actual operations is described in the following steps of a development-training-application cycle: Stage 1 - Systems Development: Systems and procedures for the given activities will be developed by experts in the field. This will generally take about a week (longer for some topics, e.g. forest management planning). At the same time, the experts will work with NTPC and DAFO traine rs to prepare for the training activities. Stage 2 - Training of Di strict forestry staff: In stage 2, relevant experts or NTPC or PAFO trai ners will conduct training of district staff on the activities and their systems and pro cedures. In general training will in clude two activities, one from one component and another from a different compon ent. For example, training on enlisting NPVFA membership (Component 1: Institutional development) may be combined with training on pre-harvest inventory (Component 2: Forest management). A district staff training course will generally last a week or more including a practicum in one village. District staff members will be grouped into teams and each team will be assigned a number of villages. In general, these training sessions will be conducte d, at least initially, at the Nakai District Forestry Headquarters. A participatory forest ry expert will usually conduct the training, assisted by NTPC staff during organizing and conducting. The entire set of topics for capacity building will be introduced subset-by-subs et in successive training sessions. Field application of a subset will be done be fore training moves to the next subset. This way learning is reinforced by immediate practice. Modules will be selected for a particular training session such that they can be covered in 4-5 training-days (for example: a module on forest inventory, plus a module on VFC organizing). Stage 3 - Training of village teams: Under the supervision of NTPC/PAFO trainers, the te ams of Nakai District fo restry staff will conduct training of village work teams assigned to them. Tr aining will be conducted either in the villages, or villagers may be asked to go to Nakai District Fore stry Headquarters for training. If conducted in the villages, training will be organized first at a lead village as a practicum for the training of district forestry staff. A participatory forestry expert may supervise th e training at the lead villages, for example. Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 15The trainees may be the VFC or a forestry work team (e.g. forest inventory team), depending on the topic. The same topics as in Stage 1 are covered but simplif ied (e.g. more techniques/procedures, less concepts), so that villagers could absorb the lessons well, an d addressed to the appropr iate team (e.g. VFC for administrative topics, forestry work team for forestry work topics). Stage 4 - Application in actual operations by the village teams: Under the supervision of district staff, village wo rk teams will apply the knowledge and skills obtained from the training to conduct the given activities. In case of difficulties, the district staff will provide technical assistance. A given activity may take several weeks to comple te by village teams. In this way, lessons learned in Stage 3 will be immedi ately applied by the village teams under fo restry staff supervision, for at least the first day or two. After th e forestry staff trainers leave the village, the village teams will continue the work by themselves. For exam ple, the VFC conducts furt her meetings; the forest inventory teams complete the forest inventory. At the end of the fore stry operation, the village work team together with the supervising staff will prepare a report for mo nitoring purposes. Stages 1 to 3 will generally take a month or less to do. Stage 4 should commence immediately from Step 3. When required a certain time lag should be allowed between the start of two consecutive development- training-application cycles to ensure that training and application resources are not overwhelmed by too much demand for work and/or time. The same steps w ill be undertaken when the activity is repeated the following year. However, the focus will no longer be on learning how to do the ac tivity, but to consolidate the experience of the previous year and to incor porate the lessons from the experience to improve performance in doing the activity. Training topics The following lists illustrate the topics that will be introduced during training . The list will be further developed as implementation of the training program proceeds. Typical training topics for the VFC/VFA administration: Organizing the village for forestry ad ministration and forestry operations; Conducting an election of officers; Participatory rural appraisal; Conducting committee meetings; Conducting village assembly meetings; Recording minutes of meetings; Preparing reports of meetings and forestry operations; Budgeting; Bookkeeping; Internal audit of financial transactions by VFC and work teams; Simplified personnel management system; Procurement; Simplified inventory management; Internal monitoring and control. Typical training topics for forest mana gement, harvesting, and utilization operations: Land-use mapping; Land-use planning; Forest inventory for management planning; Division of the forest management area into annual coupes; High conservation value forest assessment; Forest management system for diff erent forest types and resources; Long-term forest management planning; Pre-harvest inventory; Annual forest operational planning; Timber scaling and grading; Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 16 Preparing for forest harvesting; Control of forest harvesting; Post-harvest assessment; Forest regeneration by natural means and by tree planting; Nursery and plantation operations; Forest stand improvement; Conservation of high forest values; Forest protection from fire, man, and other agents; Forest products utilization; Primary, secondary, and tertiary processing of forest products. Training schedule A training schedule taking into account the seasons in the year, operational requirements, and synchronization with NT2 project de velopment will be developed. The above topics will be combined into modules, the modules combined into subsets for introduction in a sequence of training sessions, and the training sessions scheduled in stages as indicated above so that all topics are eventually covered. This will take about three years after which training will be mainly refresher courses. Training resources Since training is immediately followed by application in actual practice, preparation and procurement of resources will ensure the require ments of both the training se ssions and actual operations. Training venues The Nakai District Forestry Headquarters provide a suitab le venue for the training of forestry staff, as well as for occasional training of villagers (e.g. VFC memb ers). At the village, the village temple, a large house (usually belonging to the village ch ief or a VFC member), or village meeting hall (to be built by the project) could all serve as training venue. Equipment and tools Adequate equipment and tools will be provided to the staff and village teams during training. These tools will then be handed over to the village teams, who w ill use them in actual operations. Mobile white boards combined as a poster stands will be provided to each te am of trainers, and visual aids for training sessions will be produced beforehand, but also during the actual conduct of the training. 23.7 COMPONENT 2: NATURAL FOREST MANAGEMENT Sustainable forest management will be implemented following the participatory formulation of a long- term Forest Management Plan and recurrent Annual Operational Plans for the Nakai Plateau Forest Management Area (NPFMA). The Forest Management Pl an will be reviewed and updated every five years. The NPFMA will likely be divided into two sub-FMAs: (i) North-western Resettlement Area Sub-FMA; and (ii) South-eastern Resettlement Area Sub-FMA. This will facilitate the participation of village teams in participator y sustainable forest management, considering that the new location of villages will be sp read over the length of the Resettlement Area. Each of these two sub-FMAs will be further divided into annual coupes for harvesting and stand improvement operations in a way that will also facilitate village participation. Natural forest management involves some activities which cover all of the n atural forests, and some activities which are specific to specific forest manage ment zones, whose boundaries will be delineated as part of the Forest Management Plan. 23.7.1 FM Activities to Be Conducted in All Zones: A number of activities will be conducted regard less of the forest mana gement zone, such as: Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 17 Forest protection. Forest protection will take place throughout the year, but will be focused in the dry months when forest fires, clearings for shifti ng cultivation, and other illegal activities are more likely to occur. Lookout towers will be built in strate gic places to spot occurrences of forest fires. Fire fighting teams will be provided training in fire fighting techniques, provided equipment, and will be on call in case of occurrences of forest fire. Regular forest protection teams will, however, be organized and assigned territories to patrol, monitor, and control any occurrences of fire, clearings, and other illegal activities. Soil erosion. Sites that are actively contributing to the silting of the reservoir will be mapped and prioritized for design and application of eros ion control measures. Soil erosion control will, however, mainly be applied as part of forest management operations. For example, construction of logging roads will be minimized. If built, they will be properly sited and designed to minimize soil erosion and siltation of the reservoir. Control of poaching of wildlife. NPVFA will coordinate with prot ected area staff in the control of poaching of wildlife. Trapping and hunting of wildlife for trade purposes in the Resettlement Area will be banned. In addition, to minimize hunt ing for food, villagers (ie, NPVFA members) will be encouraged to focus on the raising of poultry and other livestock, and will be supported to maintain livestock health. Management of collection of NTFP. NPVFA will protect the Resettlement Area against collection of NTFP by outsiders. It will also m onitor collection of NTFP by its members and use the monitoring information to regulate collection and protect the resource bases of NTFP. 23.7.2 FM Activities in Conservation and Protection Zones Forest management in the NPFMA w ill combine commercial production wi th conservation activities in both planning and implementation to ensure mi nimum impact of production activities on high conservation values (HCV) existing in the area. Th e NPFMA is likely to contain the following HCVs: Some concentration of biodiversity owing to its location between two National Protected Areas. Landscape level forests, since it has over 18,000 ha of relatively contiguous forests although already disturbed by past human activities. Threatened ecosystem, i.e. native pine forests which are no longer as abundant in Lao PDR as before. Most of the Resettlement Area and its forest are actually part of the watershed of the Nakai reservoir. Areas fundamental to basic needs of local communiti es, e.g. NTFP collection sites, livelihood bases, as well as spiritual and cultural sites. Management actions to maintain the HCVs will be preceded by identificati on and mapping of the different HCVs and will consist of one or a mix of the following approaches: Exclusion of specially designated conservation and protection zones from commercial production. Where commercial production activities are allowed, the use of low-impact, low intensity methods. Limitations imposed on the type and methods of human activities depending on the site and its inherent characteristics and importance as a home of the given HCV, e.g. hunting restrictions. Monitoring of HCVs and the effectiveness of management actions in maintaining HCVs using easy-to-implement methods. 23.7.3 FM Activities for Regenerating Forest Zones Regenerating forests are those that are in the process of restoration from damage caused by past human activities, mainly logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. The natural site potential of these forests is such that if left alone long enough they would revert back to their former productive condition. Forest protection from further human activities is therefore the main management activity associated with restoring these forests. Forest pr otection is a minimum-effort, mini mum-cost action but could reap maximum returns. Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 18 Forest restoration methods, e.g. assisted natural regeneration, are being developed in many countries including Lao PDR through research and development (R&D). The aim is to find ways to make premium species that used to grow in abundance, e.g. dipt erocarp and rosewood species, get re-established and growing well. Several R&D results ha ve been published over the years; what is generally slowing down commercial investments on forest restoration is the uncertainty of financial recovery considering the long-term growing periods involved vis-\u00e0-vis the low-cost measure of simple forest protection or the short-gestation measure of conversion to fast-growing plantation. Thus, forest management activities for regene rating forests at the N PFMA will be limited to: Delineation of the regenerating forest zone on the map and demarcation on the ground as practicable. Forest protection especially from human activities. Monitoring of forest condition through permanent sample plots. Inviting international and national research institutions, e.g. NAFRI, to conduct R&D trials at NPFMA. 23.7.4 FM Activities for Production Forest Zones Forest management of production fore st will initially be conducted in the 5,700 ha or so of forest that have currently been identified as we ll stocked. In 20 years or so, the re generating forest will progressively be included in the stocked production forest zone and management regimes. Forest management activities specific to the production forests will include the following: (i) Pre-harvest inventory. A forest inventory of the immediately following year's harvesting coupe will be conducted consisting of a 100% inventory and ma pping of large trees (i.e. >50 cm in diameter), a 10% sampling of small to medium trees (10-50 cm in diameter), and a 10-plot sampling of regeneration per sub-compartment of the annual coupe. (ii) Forest operations planning. Based on information from the pre-harvest inventory, a forest operations plan for the immediately following year will be formulated. The plan will include a list of trees to be cut, a logging plan, and a plan for regeneration, timber stand improvement, forest plantation development, protection, and other operations. (iii) Securing harvesting quota. A request for quota will be made based on the list of trees to be cut and submitted before mid-June of each year to PAFO for consolidation and endorsement to MAF/DOF. Approval of the quota is usually d one in October of each year. The NPVFA will require formal conditions contained in its commu nity forest concession agreement for the GoL to provide a minimum available log vo lume of 6,000 cu.m. per year from the concession and exclusive utilization rights to the concession area. (iv) Tree marking. Once the quota has been approved, tr ees to be cut in the next dry season will be marked. Seed trees to be left uncut will also be marked. (v) Forest road building or clearing access tracks. Generally no earthmov ing is required to build logging access tracks in the flat to rolling terrain in the Resettlement Area. It is enough to manually cut small saplings along the access track; the logging truck then takes care of blazing its trail along the manually cleared direction. Fore st road building will, however, be required for main access roads and in steeper parts of the production forest. (vi) Control of logging operations. Village work teams will direct loggers to the trees marked to be cut ensuring that no other trees are cut, mark the log number on the logs to be transported to the second landing, and record those logs. (vii) Second landing operations. Village work teams w ill also control operations at the second landing ensuring that the logs are properly recorded, scal ed and graded by forest officers, and transported out only with proper documentation. An agreement will be required with GoL to locate the second landing at the sawmill entrance gate with logs measured by forest officers whenever practical on Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 19truck. Measurement at this point for sale and purc hase of logs will substantially reduce logging and transport costs and avoid the risk of substantial volume losses that have o ccurred in the past. (viii) Post-harvest assessment. Post-har vest assessment will take place just before the rainy season to assess how logging was conducted and to collect information for planning subsequent regeneration and timber stand improvement operations. (ix) Assessment of stand growth and yiel d. In the absence of growth and yield information specific to Nakai, the long-term forest management plan and the annual forest operations plans for the early years will be formulated on the basis of stand gr owth and yield information collected outside Nakai. A more accurate growth and yield information for the Resettlement Area will be obtained by establishing and re-measuring annually for 5 years (then once every 5 years thereafter) an adequate number of permanent sample plots (at least 50). Once they are available the information will be used in revising the forest management plan and formulating subsequent annual forest operations plans. (x) Natural regeneration, tree planting and timber stand improvement. Both hardwood and pine stands will be regenerated naturally following appropriate silvicultural systems, e.g. tree selection system for hardwoods and seed tree system for pines. Plan ting of nursery-raised pine seedlings in areas where natural regeneration fails will be done usin g natural patterns and a ssociations with other species in a way that will restore the natural forest ecotype rather than turnin g the site into a pine plantation. In other forest ecotypes, assisted natural regeneration using indigenous species will be done in sites where the number of regeneration is inadequate. Timber stand improvement will also be done in logged-over stands to promote the growth and development of the residual tree crop. (xi) Forest conservation imbedded in different forest management operations. Operations affecting the soil, water, and biological resources of the forest that are conducted before, during, and after harvesting of timber and NTFP will conform to a set of conservation rules. For example, logging will conform to low-intensity and low-impact rules in every step. 23.7.5 Forest Certification and Chain-of-Custody Certification The NPVFA will apply for certification of its forest management operations by the Forest Stewardship Council, a leading and international ly well-accepted forest certification organization. This will enable NPVFA to produce FSC-certified wood for a growing pr ocessing industry that manufactures certified products for the EU, Japan, and American markets. Thus , forest certification will ensure that in addition to domestic markets, export markets that can offer hi gher prices will be availa ble for the products of NPVFA. To obtain forest certific ation, NPVFA will apply to become a member of the Khammouane Sustainable Forest Management Group , a soon to be FSC-certi fied group (in mid-2004) based at th e Provincial Forestry Section. As a member of an FSC-certified gr oup, the NPVFA will be entitled to sell FSC-certified wood. In future when NPVFA is able to manufacture wood products for export, it will also secure an FSC chain-of- custody (COC) certification of its processing operations so that its processed wood products will be acceptable to export markets th at require certified products. The scheduling of the implementation of forest certification and COC certification activities, which will start only after the salvage logging required during th e construction period from year 2005 to 2007, will follow the general timeframe presented below: \u00be 2007 Q1 - Apply for membership of pool of the Khammouane SFM Group; \u00be 2007 Q1 - Assessment for membership to be conducted by Group auditors; \u00be 2007 Q2-Q3 - Corrective actions to close ou t any pre-cond itions to membership; \u00be 2007 Q4 - Accepted as member of the certified pool of the Group; \u00be 2008 Q1-Q2 - Producing certified wood; \u00be 2007 Q4 - Apply for a COC certification an FSC-accredited certifie r, e.g. SmartWood auditor; \u00be 2008 Q1-Q2 - Corrective actions to pr e-conditions to obtaini ng COC certification; Chapter Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 20\u00be 2008 Q3 - Obtain chain-of-custody certification and start producing certified processed products. The NPVFAs forestry management and business operati ons, as described in this Chapter 23, make it especially well positioned to be able to obtain fo rest certification. Factor s which will facilitate the certification of the NPVFA and its activities include: The establishment and operations of the NPVFA have and will continue to be in compliance with relevant national laws; The community forestry plan is consistent with the customary land tenure and use of the forest in the resettlement area, in that all villages will continue to gather NTFPs and firewood, while commercial timber extraction was not previously a legally documented right or customary activity of the villagers; The participatory, inclusive and transparent organization of the NPVFA - an association managed by villagers, for villagers; The forest management plan will explicitly include (a) the conservation of biological diversity and ecological functions, and (b) measures to enhance environmentally sound multiple benefits accruing from the forest, especially water resources, NTFPs, biological diversity and soil conservation. Part of the plan will include the main tenance of critical forest areas and other habitats; The forest logging and other operations will be un dertaken in a manner to avoid or minimize any potential adverse environmental impacts; The forest management plan explicitly includes the monitoring - pre and post harvest - of the management areas; and The forestry management, harvesting and processing plans will, as a matter of course, be developed with the direct participation of the villa gers, via the village forestry committees. 23.8 COMPONENT 3: FORESTRY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE 23.8.1 Forestry Business Licence's Enterprise development covers all forestry business activities from harvesting to processing of forest products into sawn wood, semi-finished and finished wood products, with chemical treatment of low density timbers for prevention of insect and fungal attack. The NPVFA will apply for and be granted at least three types of business licences: 1. Logging and log transport business licence : 100 % NPVFA. 2. Log processing or sawmilling business license : 100% for both the pe rmanent sawmill and wood treatment plant. 3. Timber processing and furn iture factory business licence : Financial analyses and other management consider ations indicate it would be best to lease part of the sawmill site to an appropriately qualified and experienced company to purchase part of the sawmill output to process into other products to supply to specific external markets. This business will be developed in two phases: The Transition or Construction Phase in which salvage logging in Project Lands and areas for resettlement housing and intensive agriculture will be the main, if not the only, forest harvesting undertaken in the Resettlement Area during this period. Post-Construction and post-COD, the long term phase, in which the production forest in the Resettlement Area will be selectively ha rvested for sustained yield production. 23.8.2 Transition or Construction Phase Forestry Business The foundation for attaining the long-term, effectiv e, economic and sustainable forest management and wood processing will be built up during the transiti on or development phase. This phase will be devoted mainly to (a) institutional development and training, (b) producing the timber with preservative treatment and processing sawn wood that is needed to construct houses for and access external markets for better prices, and (c) establishment of the infrastructure and equipment for short and longer term production. Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 21 An important assumption is that only timbers salvaged from Project Lands, or those purchased from the salvage logging operations in the reservoir , village resettlement and intensive farming areas would be used during this first 3 year Phase. It is assumed that th e sustainable forest manage ment and utilization in the Resettlement Area will only start in earnes t in the last year of this period. The main types of activities that will be un dertaken during this first Phase include: Establishment of the NPVFA Logging and Transportation Unit, with equipment and staff; Establishment of fixed sawmilling fac ilities and log handling equipment; Installation of a wood preservative treatment plant; Installation of wood processing facilities that include log handling and ma nufacturing equipment, for the production of quality finished products to customer specifications. Salvage logging from Project (construction) Lands in the NT2 Resettlement Area; Operation of a fixed sawmill and wood treatment plant; Operation of a wood processing plant in a joint venture. These activities will provide an opportunity to v illagers to obtain hands-on experience in logging, sawmilling and secondary processing, and provide an income and funds accumulation, which will be reinvested in the forestry business and other community projects, independent of support from the NT2 Project, for the long term. 23.8.3 Long Term Sustainable Forestry Business The second, long term phase, will be implemented under a management plan for sustainable forest production that requires the full development of the capability of NPVFA and its VFCs, village work teams, and staff. The forest reso urces of the Resettlement Area w ill be sustainably managed with the forest operations being FSC-certified; and the fore stry business enterprises of NPVFA will be fully operational to ensure a significant contribution to the generation of income and employment for the resettlers. This phase includes the following considerations: The 2004 to 2007 (construction and transition period ) aims to develop the required capacity and experience in management,) logging (mainly sa lvage), sawmilling and simple treatment and processing. It is expected this will allow afte r 2007 a full commercial utilization of annual timber harvests, provide substantial profit margins from the sale of processed wood products, and generate further employment for the resettled families. Subject to further investigations, a long term contract could be negotiated with a recognized added value wood processing and export marketing enterpri se with adequate funding sources to operate at the sawmill site buying and utilizing sawn NPVFA timbe r. Apart from financial ri sks, in the short to medium term the demands on NPVFA management will be considerable in setting up and running its core activities effectively. Given the developmental status of the local communities and the demands of change, the additional technical and managerial demands of value added processing are complex and direct involvemen t by NPVFA management could pr ovide a major exposure to investment risk. Chain-of-custody certification of the processing fac ilities so that combined with a certification of its forest operations, NPVFA and its partner will be ab le to market certified wood products to EU, US, and other markets. 23.8.4 Design Considerations fo r Transition and Long Term Harvesting and Wood Processing On the assumption Government of Laos will appr ove NPVFA's three business licence applications and access is gained on a long term basis to the indicated wood volume available, the effective development of a commercial forest based industry enterprise will be influenced by five key factors: Log wood qualities, Government log taxes, operating pr oduction levels, markets, and management control. Dealing with these separately: Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 22Log quality: The forest resource has already been exploited for the better quality tree species of good form and dimension in the area designated for harves t management by NPVFA. This will result in general terms: Poorer quality logs will have lowe r sawmill conversion factors to sawn wood due to form, smaller log size and defects, and hence higher unit sawn output production costs. Over 60% of the available resource is relatively lo w density pinewood and some hardwood species. In local markets these have limited acceptance due to insect and fungal stain attack, and sell at low prices, usually for construction formwork. Some clear boards free of blemish are used in lower cost local furniture manufacture. This high percentage of low va lue local market wood (eit her in log or sawn form) makes achievement of a profitable wood industry ente rprise virtually impossible due to the high volume of low unit value sales. The best option currently available is to introduce th e now standard international practice of chemically treating with preservatives the wood species with low density but good structural properties, to allow them to compete for the traditional end uses in building th e higher value durable local hardwoods are used for. Preservative treatment of lower density timbers is now in standard use in other co untries where availability of high quality naturally durable hardwoods is declining, or in some cases, stopped. Wood Resource Taxation Costs: Log taxes payable to the Government on low and medium density timber proposed to be harvested by NPVFA are signif icantly higher than prices currently being received for wood of similar quality, on average, by forest owne rs elsewhere in Pacific Rim markets. To provide an indicative guideline of regional market values, Free on Board (FoB) values for Malaysian and Indonesian hardwoods and southern Pacific ports for pinewood adju sted for shipping rates to equate to log exports from Vietnam to South Korea or Japan are summarized in Table 23-8 below. Table 23-8: Log Market Value & Cost of Production Summary Prices Costs and Returns Medium Density Hardwoods (Ply Grade): $/m3 Pinewood to $140 $70 harvesting, transport & ship loading costs $60 $60 Net Income $40 to $55 $10 to $20 Log tax average (all log grades) $61 $51 Margin for Management Costs, Profits, Dividends and Risk -$21 to -$16 -$41 to -$31 For this reason, in general local indu stry practice, the natural forests in Laos are selectively harvested for a small number of higher density high value species and, where they occur, pine trees of large diameter and straight form suitable for high streng th plywood and furniture manufacture. This means it will be very difficult to obtain net log revenues after taxes and oper ating costs, on the high percentage of low and medium density logs if they are marketed for sale as logs via Vinh or Da Nang ports in Vietnam or on the local domestic market. Operating Production Levels: After considering the issues of lower market prices and high taxes for low density wood products, annual production targets based on a minimum harvest level of 6,000 cu.m will have to include consideration of the following de mands, which in general terms are not being met by the industry in Laos: The high overhead costs for management to deal with substantial Government regulatory and planning consent and FSC requirements associated with implementing sustainable forest management; The direct costs of a substantial forest improvement and management program; and Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 23 The dividend expectation of over US$ 100 per household per year, indicating that disposable net earnings of over US$ 250,000 annually are required to service dividends, ca pital replacements and community projects. Markets: Achievement of the market prices indicated later in financial analyses is critical to achievement of earnings targets. In the immediate future domestic sales prospects are good if satisfactory supply contracts can be entered into with NTPC for suppl y of rough sawn construction grades for cement formwork and preservative treated and finished housing grades. International and local markets are also satisfactory for the small quantities of high density wood products planned for production. Development of high value export markets for pine wood also has good potential if boards are finished properly to quality specifications. Further work is required in the short term to verify market price assumptions and trends for the product out-turn. The short to medium term prospects are very poor for obtaining profits from sale of low density pinewood and hardwood logs. Management Control: There is weak managerial ca pacity present at Nakai to ensure effective planning, direction and controls are in place to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the substantial capital investments to be made to achieve long term earnings targets. The approach required to capacity development and training has been described in section 23.6.7 above. Initially, external appointments will be needed to key management positions and a phased approach to training, both of the Board and the management staff, over a 3 year period. Strict co mmercial disciplines will be required in operations management under the guidance of a business plan and logframe that will be put in place at commencement of operations. Currently most wood based enterprises in Laos are usually small, private family owned business with relatively low overheads. In comparison, in order to best serve its shareholder interests, the NPVFA is more corporate in nature with a small size operation servicing higher overheads on a proportionate basis. Therefore a substantial input into training in planning and risk management, and discipline in achieving productivity targets is critically important. 23.8.4 The Enterprise Operations Design Logging: A minimum logging production target of 6,000 cu.m . per year is needed in a 100 day dry season commencing at beginning of December each year. Five crews each with nine men producing 60 cu.m. per day are needed to achieve this target. Primary extraction units will be \" Lotsalao \" winch trucks working on 500 metre radius settings to supply first landings. Thes e units are supported by a small bulldozer for access road upgrading and extraction spur tracking formation and an excavator with dump truck for road repairs. A grapple forked loader is placed to support first la nding loading of log transport trucks for an average 10 km haul to the second landing at mill yard for Government measurement for taxes. Sawmilling: The basic mill design comprises two horizontal breakdown saws in parallel to cater for the wide variation in sawlog dimension, particularly from salvage areas. These will feed four circular resaws before wood passes through an anti-s apstain bath onto size sorting tabl es before stacking and filleting. Roller transfers will be installed for all wood flow line s and double shifts operated to improve capital unit productivity, and also allow most sawing and treatment of low density timbers to be completed the dry season. This approach to labour utilization will allow workers additional time to assist cropping their household farms and animal hu sbandry in the wet season. The mill will be designed to allow the installation of an additional production line if the horizontal breakdown saws have insufficient throug hput capacity or excessive downtime. Wood Preservation Treatment: Wood treatment of pinewood and other non durable low density hardwoods that comprise over 60% of the volume (4,000 cu.m.) to be harvested allows substitution, in terms of both volume and price, of medium density construction hardwoods that are becoming less readily available. This also allows species previously considered non co mmercial to be utilized, thus leaving post harvest forest ecological conditions favourab le for regeneration of commercial species. Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 24A pressure treatment cylinder, vacuum and pressure pumps and chemical storage tanks will be installed with a capacity to treat 2500 cu. m. minimum of sawn wood a year The sawing and treating of this lower density wood is prioritised in the dry season operation, as major losses could occur in the wet season. The timber treatment plant also allows treatment of small diameter roundwood for fence posts. These can have a 50 year service life for use in controlled livestock grazing areas. Added Value Processing: Only a small log volume (about 500 cu.m.) of high density durable species are expected to be available for sawing, drying and re-machining timber prior to machining processing to higher value end products such as furniture, doors and windows as the initial outputs targeted to meet the needs of the of the NTPC resettlemernt project building development. Kiln drying of wood has been considered. However experience will be obtained with airdrying and the volume likely to be available before consideration can be given to purchasing a kiln dryer. Most plant and equipments required for the operations will be purchased second hand for two reasons: Purchase prices of new products are too high for a viable investment for the low planned production levels. There is substantial excess saw milling and logging equipment capacity in Laos. Some of this capacity should be bought, refurbished or overhauled and relocated to a more favourable production site with re gular volume supplies. 23.9 COMPONENT 4: FOREST REGENERATION AND IMPROVEMENT Left alone, the 7,793 ha of degraded forest will rege nerate naturally and gradua lly recover a full forest cover and its productive potential, but it will not be able to contribute any production and income to NPVFA members for a long period of time (at least 50 years into the future). To accelerate forest restoration, the degraded forests will be either (a) subject to an assisted regeneration program, or (b) some may be converted into forest plantations with local species suited to the production of both timber and non-timber forest products. Assist ed regeneration (see section 23.7.3) will be the preferred option, and is already underway. However, plantations would be beneficial if they were proven to be technically and financially feasible based on a proper selection of intended sites, products, species, and markets. Technical and financial evaluation s will cover the following topics: Survival and growth of a number of local species in different sites; Plantation management regimes to optimize growth and development of local species; Market and pricing study of different plantation products; Financial feasibility of forest plantations of different species, pr oducts, and markets. Incorporation of livestock grazing into forest management ( silvipastoral systems) will also be considered for forest restoration, to deal with the likely pressures to be caused by loss of grazing areas during reservoir formation. 23.10 INDICATIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN Chapter 27 presents an indicative implementation plan for the four main components of the forestry program. As discussed, the plan is generally based around two phases; (a) A Development or Transition Phase, covering the period from Preliminary Works through Financial Close until completion of physical villa ge relocation and the NT2 Project's construction; in which mainly salvage logging is undertaken in the Resettlement Area Project Lands; and (b) Long term Sustainable Forest Management Phase. Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2523.11 FINANCING PLAN 23.11.1 Costs The main costs involved in the operation of the NP VFA and its forest manageme nt and forestry business activities will include the following items : Capital Costs; construction of offices, and purchase of office equipment; purchase of survey and forest protection and management equipment and vehicles; purchase of logging and transportation equipment; construction of a sawmill factory and purchase an d installation of log handling sawmilling and wood treatment equipment; and construction of a wood processing and furniture factory, purchase of wood processing equipment. Recurrent Operational Costs; Payment of salaries of NPVFA permanent staff; Payments to Government staff for admini strative or support services required; Payment of salaries and per diems to v illagers undertaking seasonal work; and Operation and maintenance of logging, transportation, wood processing facilities etc. Resource Costs; These relate to payment of Government log taxes and other charges (development and re- forestation levies) on logs harvested. Adjustments have been made for local experience with log grade out turns to be expected containing a high er proportion of lower quality logs due to the previous logging history of the area. No provision is made for the payment of the Go L reforestation levy as the NPVFA will be paying for the costs of forest reha bilitation and improvement. No changes are required for GoL log tax rates on logs with high density wood . However, in the case of logs with low and medium density, special tax rates will be negotiated with the Government of Laos: In the first three years start up phase wher e uneconomic harvesting conditions are present, a $10 per cu.m. administration levy will be paid . Afte r harvesting starts in the fourth year in better stocked stands retained for sustaina ble forest management in the fo urth year log taxes will reflect open regional market conditions and allow profits from the investment to be made. Realistic tax rates of around 35% of present levels will be adopted , being $16 per cu. m. for low density hardwood and pinewood and $25 per cu. m. for medium density hardwoods. Taxation: Surplus income over revenue in each operating year is treated as not assessable for income tax prior to distribution of dividends and support to comm unity projects. The basis of this assumption is that the NPVFA is a non-profit organizati on and dividends paid are tax assessable in the hands of villagers. 23.11.2 Sales Revenues All logs are to be sawn. Sawn wood sales revenues are based on Thakhek and Vientiane retail rough sawn prices less the freight cost differential from Nakai. Pr ices have been adjusted for value added by planer / gauging boards and framing grades and upgrading end use properties by timber treatment. Average sales values that can be expected are summarized in Table 23-9.

Table 23-10 summarizes the net financial forecast results, for each investment option, with provision for a US$ 100,000 annual dividend to affected households after the close of the se cond financial year. The results show that: Harvesting and marketing of logs only is unprofit able due mainly to the high percentage of low density hardwood and pinewood species. Harvesting of a minimum of 6,000 cu. m. of lo gs a year, followed by sawing and preservative treatment is the most favourable option. under this option, if the project is permitted to operate under normal private sector management and operating conditions, reasonably strong cash flows can be expected, due in particular to the favourab le financing conditions proposed as part of the hydropower project impact compensation and mitigation measures and strong sales demand opportunities. A project internal financial rate of return of 61% is indicated, and this potential return would have to be considered the minimum necessary to justify the investments required after considering the commercial management and institutional risks associated with operating rural enterprise businesses in Laos. Harvesting ,sawing and treatment with added value processing to doors and furniture etc. is the next best option with a potential return of 32%. This could possibly be developed by a joint venture with an experienced partner once the sawmill operation was well established. If no taxation conce ssions are available a minimum log harves ting level of 8,000 cu.m. is required with sawing and timber treatment. The investment return of 11% is a margin too low for local investment risk, and the volumes are not likely to be achieved. 23. 10. 4 Financing Financing of the operations of the NPVFA will come from two main sources, over two main periods of time, as follows: (a) finance provided by the NT2 Project , as start up funds and TA, during the first 3 to 4 years operation of the NPVFA, which is also the NT 2 construction period and the Projects Lands salvage logging period; and (b) self financing , whereby some of the profits of the operation of the forestry business of the NPVFA are re-invested in capital and operating cost of the company. NPVFA initial financing of equipment and other capital works requ ired will be $0.9 million in the first year. An additional $0.4 million short term operating expenditure advance would also be required in the first year to eighteen months to cover short term fi nancing requirements and this should be repaid from sales in the first 2-3 years operation s as annual cash flows stabilize.

The NT2 Project, via the Concession Agreement an d the Social Development Plan, is committed to providing start-up funds and short term operating capi tal to NPVFA. These funds are allocated via budget line S (Provision of Livelihood Equipment) and budget line O (Community Forestry Program). These funds will be provided mainly in the first year of th e NPVFA to support salvage logging on Project Lands in the Resettlement Area, and to support processing of these timbers for production of semi-finished and finished timber products to be pu rchased by the NTPC to be used in construction of resettler villager housing and other resettlement infrastructure such as schools and offices. In addition, the NTPCs resettlement offices will provide c onsiderable technical assistance to the NPVFA for both forestry management and forestry business activities. Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 28 The provision of financial and TA su pport from the NT2 Project mainly during the first year will enable the profits generated by the NPFVA during the first 3 to 4 years operation to be invested in its bank account or applied to repayment of operating expenditure advances. Then, starting in the fourth year of operation, the investment and operation costs of the NPVFA will be financed directly from the NPVFAs own funds, from profits generated during the first 3 to 4 years of salvage logging, and after that from the sustainable logging and forestry business. The disbursement or use of the NPVFAs profits will have to be the subject of an annual business plan approved by the Board of Directors. Decisions will have to be made as how much to reinvest on capital, equipment and facilities, how much to pay for operating costs to ensure fair salaries, and ensure adequate maintenance of equipment. And most importantly, besides these cost, the NPVFA is mandated to provide an annual dividend to all the resettling population. 23.12 BENEFITS 23.12.1 General Benefits The benefits expected from the community forestry development and business management are as follows: Maintenance of a good cover in the forest areas which form part of the watershed of the NT2 Project; Positive changes in the fo rest stand structure leadin g to higher productivity resulting from sustainable forest management based on appr opriate silvicultural systems; Protection and conservation of biodiversity and the resource base for NTFPs that form an important part of the livelihood sy stems of the resettlers; No requirement for high-chemical input monoculture forest plantations; any decision to go into forest plantation in degraded (e.g. salvaged) areas to be based on further evaluations; Better use of forest reso urce and timbers through timber treatment for wider uses and higher prices. Proper maintenance of an already existing network of logging roads keeping them from deteriorating and from contributing to soil erosion and sedimentation of the reservoir; Providing for an active role of villagers thus de veloping their human resource potential, as well as assisting in developing sustainabl e social structures through NPVFA; Generation of employment and income for the resettlers on a sustained basis, as well as timber and NTFP needed for household and village use and ra w materials needed for the development of the local and national economy; and Provision of an annual dividend to all relocated families on the Nakai Plateau, the actual amount depending on the profits generated by the business operations of the NPVFA, and these profits depending on the effectiveness of harvest, processi ng and marketing of commercial forest resources. 23.12.2 Employment Table 23-11 provides a preliminary es timate of over 100,000 work days annually that could be generated from commercial forestry development operations (not including NTFP and fu elwood collection). The level of employment would be less if forest plantation development were not found to be profitable and thus not pursued. It should be understood that this analysis of labour requirements is indicative only at this stage.

The FIPC forest inventory of the Resettlement Area is based on a 1% sampling intensity. The estimated 5,590 ha of harvestable forest or the st and volume (estimated average of 151 m 3/ha) may turn out to be less in practice. The latter would result in a lower annual sustainable harvesting rate than previously estimated. Experiences elsewhere has shown that an nual harvest based on more accurate pre-harvest inventories would generally turn out to be lower th an the sustainable harvest volumes estimated in the forest management plan. Removal of non commercial species will assist re duce this risk .The adoption of a 6000 cu.m. annual cut instead of the theoretically available cut of 8000 cu.m and sawing and treatment of species currently considered no n-commercial, will reduce this risk The 5,590 ha of harvestable forests includes about 700 ha of dry evergreen forests on the northernmost part of the Resettlement Area. Only a part of this area was included in the FIPC forest inventory. Furthermore, the area has no existing roads and its acce ssibility needs to be assessed. There is a risk that the area may not be economically accessible by road . However, selective logging with elephants may be a feasible alternative in this area. NPVFA will require a joint-venture partner who can pr ovide the needed wood pr ocessing and exporting know-how. This, however, may not be required if the NTPC provided TA can transfer technology and skills in the required timeframe. Export markets for wood products are increasingly demanding raw materials from certified sustainably managed forests. Thus, th e NPVFA must become a member of th e Khammouane Sustainable Forestry Group or be certified on its own, or it may not be able to export its wood products to the EU, US and East Asian markets that pay pr emiums for certified wood. Chapter 23: Forestry Development for Nakai Resettlers November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 30 As the main response to the abov e risks, the following measures will be introduced in the plan: \u0099 Annual pre-harvest inventories at 10% sampling in tensity with a 100% enum eration and mapping of large trees (>40 cm DBH) will pr ovide an accurate assessment of timber resources in the area. \u0099 A logging and accessibility assessment of the northernm ost part of the Resettlement Area is planned in the dry season of 2007. The assessment will includ e the location of a pre liminary line for forest roads and a 3% inventory of th e forest in accessible areas. \u0099 NPVFA will make the necessary prep arations to be able to obtain FSC certification of its forest management and chain-of-custody operations eith er through the Khammouane Sustainable Forestry Group or on its own. ********** * * * ********** Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 iCHAPTER 24 NAKAI RESERVOIR FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT Table of Content 24 NAKAI RESERVOIR FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT ...1 24.1 INTRODUCTION ...........................................................................................................1 24.2 CURRENT FISHERY AT THE NAKAI PLATEAU ...............................................................1 24.2.1 Demographic and Gear and Methods ....................................................................................................... ..................... 2 24.3 PRE- AND POST INUNDATION Habita ts................................................... 7 24.3.2.4 Water quality.................................................................................................................. .................. 8 24.3.2.5 Increase and of a long-lasting anoxic ep ilimnion .......................... 9 24.3.2.6 Changes ion Due to Habita t Altera tion.........................................14 24.4 COMPARATIVE RESERVOIR FISH CATCH ANALYSIS .................................................... 14 Nam Ngum Reserv oir, Lao PDR....................................................................................................

household data from 1998 of 864, which in 2009 throug h natural increase would be 1,196 households. Recently, the baseline data has been updated and the base year used is now 2003, as this is the revised cut- off date for eligibility in the various livelihood progra mmes. Thus, the number of eligible households for the fisheries programme is currently 1,100 for 2003, which in 2009 is antici pated to be around 1,315. This number has not yet been in corporated in the chapter.. The management model presented in this chapter (basically co-management among stakeholders, with the fishing effort and fish sales unde rtaken by each household, as th ey chose) will be reviewed and a community company model (whereby all commercial fi sh catch is control be a community company - and all commercial fishers would be company staff) w ill be reviewed and taken into consideration, based partly on the success of the commercial community forestry management and partly on consultation with villagers on the Nakai Plateau. A final decision w ill only be taken a couple of years before COD. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 124 NAKAI RESERVOIR FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT 24.1 INTRODUCTION The Concession Agreement of the Nam Theun 2 Hydroe lectric Project identifies the need for the preparation of a Fisheries Development and Management Plan for sustainable fisheries in the reservoir. The overall rationale is to devise a reservoir management program that can sustain itself by meeting all costs of production, provide secure income to enti tled beneficiary fishing associations and gradually improve the fish stock to ensure a stabilized production rate (1,000 - 2,000 tons/year) 5 to 10 years after impoundment. In the year 1998, a total number of 1,115 households lived on the Nakai Plateau. By the time the reservoir will be filled in 2009 there will be 1,196 households el igible for the Fisheries Program. The Nam Theun 2 Resettlement Action Plan for those households identi fies the livelihood options for resettled households. Apart from livelihood sources such as forestry, agriculture and other employment opportunities, reservoir fisheries will form an important option. In th e resettled villages, reservoir fisheries will form an important source of animal protein for household consumption; contribute to additional household cash income; and provide employment opportunities both in actual fisheries and fish trade. This proposed fisheries management plan is based on (a) analysis on likely environmental conditions and (b) comparative analyses of fish yields with other hydropower storage reservoirs and ongoing reservoir management practices in Northeast Thailand and Lao PDR. The proposed Reservoir Fisheries Development and Management Plan identifies the potential income from reservoir fisheries for resettle d households using different fish yield scenarios. It proposes reservoir fisheries development activities and a management framework, together with a work plan and cost estimates for actual fisheries management. A series of documents regarding Nam Theun 2 Hydroel ectric Project address the fisheries aspects of the future reservoir. The main documents used for the development of the Reservoir Fisheries Development and Management Plan include the draft Environmental Management and Action Plan (EAMP), Reservoir Water Quality Model (Centre for Water Research), Fish surveys made by Maurice Kottelat, the Social and Environment Management Framework and Operation Plan (SEMFOP), the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), and Preliminary Reservoir Fisheries and Ma nagement Plan (Matsalle r, 2002 then Schouten 2003). 24.2 CURRENT FISHERY AT THE NAKAI PLATEAU 24.2.1 Demographic and Ethnic composition The total number of households at the Nakai Plat eau was 1,115 in 1998 with a population of 6,320. Of these households, 864 have been identi fied as eligible for taking part in the Fisheries Program (see Table 24-1). Villagers not eligible are those either moving out of the area (from the Tai villages Ban Nam Nian and Sop Hia) or are not reservoir area resource user s (most villagers in Ban Ou domsouk). The number of eligible households is with the curre nt estimate of population growth rate of 3.0 % per annum expected to rise to 1,196 in year 2009 when the re servoir is expected to be full. The ethnic composition of the population at the Nakai Plateau is rather diverse with five main ethno- linguistic groups: Bo, Brou, Tai, Sek and Vietic. 24.2.2 Livelihoods Agriculture activities and livestock raising currently make up the main part of the livelihood of the population at the Nakai Plateau, contributing 65 % of their income (see Figure 24-1). Various types of wages and donations contribute 15 % to the livelihood and fishing 10 %. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2 Figure 24-1: Sources of Liveliho od on the Nakai Plateau, 1998 Agriculture and livestock 65%Wages, Rice for Work, 15%Fishing 10%NTFP 6%Wild handicraft 2% Source: 1998 Census and Socio-Economic Survey. Both the available documentation and a recent field survey do not indicate any full-time commercial or intensive fishing practice in the area. Virtually all fa milies living near Nam Theun waters engage to some extent in subsistence fishing, and some sell their ex cess catch, as the opportunity arises. Some households living close to the river or wetlands own small fishing boats. According to the socio-economic survey, 84 % of the households at Nakai Plateau are fishing 1. Sixty percent of the catch is consumed whilst forty percent is sold. If access to markets is possible, particularly large fish are rather sold than consumed. Fish are sold to middlemen who supp ly the local markets of Nakai and Lak Sao. The catch is highly diversified, whic h is reflected in a great variety of gear (see below). Apart from fish, other aquatic animals are also harvested on the Nakai Plateau, such as local varieties of crabs, frogs, molluscs, turtles, snakes , lizards and insects. 24.2.3 Fishing Gear and Methods Records on fishing practices among the villagers living on the Nakai Plate au are sparse and anecdotal (e.g. in some of the recent IUCN Reports, 1999, 2000). Ther e is a countrywide pictorial drawing account on traditional fishing methods carried out by IUCN in 1997. Most of the fishing methods (or modified versions) recorded in this publication were veri fied in a field survey during 2002 (see Annex 24-1). 1 The survey had an overweight of respondents from small villages with relatively high level of fishing. The figure is therefore a maximum.

Hook & Line: 1 mm nylon line, many lines are set overnight (sunset to sunrise) parallel over a bamboo pole fixed in river bank, each line ca. 100 m long, fi tted with single hook (purchased) size # 14 to 7; bait is small live fish, frogs, earthworms; no floater is used. Main fish caught are large predatory fish like Clarias, Pangasius, Mystis, Tor Fish Traps: Cone-like long baskets (1 m) with narrow trapping collar. Traps are insert ed either in specially constructed fences damming shallow waters, swamplands and irrigation channels. Traps are also inserted in outlets of paddy fields. Main species ca ught are air-breathing fish living in paddy fields (e.g. snakeheads) and eels. Hand-operated lift net: Fine-mesh-sized sheet of about 1 m2 is mounted with 4 strings to a pole of 2-3 m length. The sheet is submerged and cautiously lifted in regular interv als. No bait is placed in the sheet. The lift net is operated mostly by women an d children in shallow wa ters, paddy fields, small creeks and pools, during daytime and in early evening hours. Cast Net: only used occasionally, former generations used this type more. Self-made out of nylon filament, rim fitted with small iron chain. Cast nets diameter vary according to place of use (shallowness) from 3 to 6 m. Main fish caught are small cyp rinids and all kind of small swampland fish. Frog Traps: Basket-like traps made out of bamboo (30 cm length), with narrow collar that is smeared with fish chop to attract frogs into trap; used predominantly in wet season in shallow swamp depressions. Traps are exposed during night time and collected early next morning. One person sets 30-50 such traps. Scoop nets and plunge baskets are rarely used (by women and children only) to catch small fish in shallow ponds and paddy fields when becoming rain-flooded. Damming/fencing small creeks is regularly done at the beginning of the wet season. Commonly, fish are diverted along the barrier into cone-shaped fish baskets made of bamboo. Self-made harpoon has been recorded in one village only. The harpoon is used from river bank during dry season. Fish luring is sometimes in practice (brush park method, with circular net fencing), in deeper ponds near Ban Bua Ma). Shell collection : Performed only occasionally by women. Species collected in river banks (sandy shallow banks, using a rake) are freshwater mussels. The use of fish narcotics and explosives was not repo rted in any of the villages visited; however, there were accounts that these methods were sometimes used at the time of logging activities on the Nakai Plateau and the adjacent NBCA. To summarize the findings from the 2002 field surv ey covering 7 villages adjacent to the Nam Theun River the following preliminary observations and conclusions can be given: The traditional fishing methods used by people living in the Nakai Plateau have a remarkable level of diversification. In average each household living in the vicinity of floating and permanent waters employs about 5-6 different types of gear. There seems little variation or specification for gear among the distinct Lao ethnic groups living on the Nakai Plateau. There is specific fishing gear used pr edominantly by men and women/children. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 5 Seasonally, hand collection of both small fish and invertebrates (e.g. aquatic insects, worms, gastropods and bivalves) is dome manually, by women and children. There is no traditional 'partition ' of fishing grounds; everyone ap pears to utilize all water bodies that would warrant some yield. Fishermen confirm that they do not fish in an area where another fisherman has already set his gear. In contrast, women, together with children, usually make groups to fish in shallow ponds and creeks nearby the settlement. Group fishing (e.g. cast-netting) is practiced on occasions where large quantities of fish is needed (e.g. for community festivals and rites). Range of fishing area is up to 10 km for those fishermen operating with boats, depending on availability of outboard/inboard engine and financial sources (for fuel). Most set fishing methods (e.g. traps, fences, gill nets, hook & line) are pu t in place at sunset, and collected next morning after sunrise. There are some indications for unsustainable fish ing methods, although the use of explosives reportedly has diminished after the halt of logging operations on the Nakai Plateau. There were no accounts related to theft of gear (a problem commonly reported among fishermen at Nam Ngum Reservoir). IUCN (2001) reports that the \"fis h stock in the Nakai area has b een significantly depleted\". As everywhere in the Mekong River Basin, fishers tell th e same story: daily fish catch has declined. And the fishers are right. The main reason for declining fish catch is the increase of fishing efforts by a growing population, and the increased access to markets. Fishers used to fish only for household consumption, but presently most fishers can trad e fish for cash as well. On the Nakai Plateau, there may be some other reason s for declining fish catch. One of the reasons may be the temporary fishers who come camping in groups for a couple of weeks to fish and hunt. Such camping groups often fish with ex plosives. During the years that Nakai Plateau was logged (until 1999) there was an increased demand for fi sh, and also an increase d fishing intensity by loggers who frequently used explosives. One village, a couple of kilometr es upstream from the dam is located along the Nam Theun at a large and extremely deep pool. At the da m site in 1996 explosions could be heard at regular intervals from destructive fisheries at this village an d various spots in the river stank of rotting fish, indicating destructive fisheries. If destructive fishin g is still going on, the amount of fish and the number of fish species can be affected, decr easing the opportunity for establishment of fish populations during the inundation of Nakai Plateau. Establishment of fisheries regulations through a co-management process as well as extensive awareness campaigns will avoid such situations. 24.3 PRE- AND POST INUNDATION ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS 24.3.1 Pre-Inundation Sampling and measurements of water quality indicate that the Nam Theun River has water quality conditions favourable for aquatic life. Nutrient levels are low. During the rainy season, turbidity increases. There is no evidence that the Nam Theun or its tributaries receive polluting agents. Water quality after inundation will depend largely on removal of vegetation. Extensive areas are flooded in the wet season and at large areas, wetlands are formed for part of the year, or even the whole year. The inundated wetlands are inhabited by a number of fish species adapted to stagnant water conditions. Maurice Kottelat identified some 60 fish species in the entire Nam Theun / Nam Kading Rivers (including headwaters). Fish species found in the wetlands mainly belong to the families of Clariidae, Osphronemidae and Channidae. All are able to breathe air at the surface enabling them to survive in oxygen poor, stagnant waters. The plateau areas of wetland are of biodiversity valu e, especially for water birds, of which many have significant interactions with other a quatic life, either as predators of fish or as competitors for food. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 624.3.2 Post Inundation The main features of Nakai Reservoir are summarized in Table 24-2. Table 24-2: Salient Features of the proposed Nakai Reservoir. Morphology and Technical Specifications Catchment Area 4,013 km2 Reservoir Area at FSL 450 km2 Reservoir Area at MOL 82 km2 Full Supply Level 538 masl Active Storage at FSL 3530 million m\u00b3 Planned dam closure/beginning of filling Year 2007 Anticipated duration of filling 7 months Mean annual flow 251.1 m\u00b3/s Average retention time 6.4 months Maximum depth (at dam site) 48 m Average depth 7.1 m Draw down 12.5 m Protective measures (screens) at intake tunnel not planned Fish ladder at dam site not planned Biological features Type of vegetation that will be submerged Secondary dry evergreen / deciduous forest, grasslands, and cultivated lands, bamboo groves, seasonal and permanent swamps Above-ground organic matter 40 tons C/ha Soil organic matter 66-97 tons C/ha Estimated total amount of organic matter submitted to decomposition 110 tons C/ha Number of fish species recorded in Nam Theun/Nam Kading 60 Number of potential endemic fish species 1 (Tor ater ) Main Fish predators (Mammals, Birds) Fish eagles, ospreys, kingfishers, fish owls, otters, fish eating cats 24.3.2.1 Sedimentation In the Nam Theun River, the suspended material is predominantly fine silt and clay particles, whereas in the channel bed and banks there is an in creased percentage of sandy material. Losses of live storage have been estimated by Moto r Columbus (1987) at 800,000 m\u00b3/year, while the most recent survey conducted by SMEC2 (1998, 2002) assumes a liv e storage loss due to accumulated sediment deposits in the range of 423,000m\u00b3/year at worst case scenario assumptions. The latter assumption would anticipate a total of 16,900,000 m\u00b3 annual siltation depo sit in the active storage zone of Nakai Reservoir. This scenario predicts a live span for the reservoir of 188 years, whereby the level of the dead storage zone would be reached in only 29 years. The most likely rate of annual sediment load at the dam site is estimated between 249.000 and 292.000 tons 3 which will likely be a maximum due to the management of the watershed via the SEMFOP. 24.3.2.2 Vegetation of the Nakai Plateau Submerged vegetation has major implications for reservoir fisheries, as the nature and volume of residual plants left in the reservoir determine for many years (up to 3 decades) the water quality and aquatic bio-productivity. Tree stumps represent important obstacles for fishing and navigation, thereby creating potential risks for accident and lo ss of nets and fish. Finally, emer ged hollow trees will create small stagnant water pouches that will be come mosquito-breeding sites. A study carried out on the Nakai Pl ateau by NTEC (2001) recorded 150 different plant species of which 78 were taxonomically identified. Pine trees ( Pinus merkusii ) made the bulk of volume distribution, being 58 %. The vegetation that will become submerged by the Nam Theun Reservoir is a mix of savannah-like bushy and herbal following wide-spread slash-and-burn activities; 2 2002. Collect ion and Assessment, Hydrology Review No.5, May 2002 3 No data could be obtained on the sedimentation volume and life expectancy of the Nakai Reservoir, assuming the most likely scenario. For operative fisheries planning, however, it is assume d that the live span of the dead storage zone will significant ly exceed 30 years. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7 lowland semi-evergreen plants (mostly herbs and bushes); degraded and non-degraded dense forest, being a mix of broadleaf and coniferous species. The dominant element is pine trees ( Pinus merkusii ), which apparently cope well with the vegetation evolving after bush fires; riverine bordering bamboo groves, interspersed with large Lythracean trees and small herbs as undergrowth; swampland vegetation (marsh grasses)4; single individuals of large dipterocarp trees left intact in agricultural fields or swamplands; homestead gardens harbouring a mix of fruit and vegetable plants, including coconut palms; and small areas of rice fields in depre ssions and upland rice plantations. Seven plant species or group of species (5 % of the total plant biomass volume) were identified as being very durable against degradation, i.e. they will remain in the reservoir 7 to 25 years. The last species to decompose would be Dalbergia and Pterocarpus . The dominant pine trees have a predicted durability of 1 to 4.5 years before they become biologically decomposed. Climbers and vines (8-10 %) as well as all small shrubs and herbs are anticipated to decompose during the first two years of impoundment. From a fisheries management point of view it is vital to minimize, from the beginning, the risk of high level biodegradation and rapid deterioration of water quality, which will invariably have negative consequences for fish production and thus the livelihoods of reservoir fishers. A selection needs to be made between different options for the treatment of the residual biomass before impoundment. It seems necessary to analyse the envi ronmental impacts of different scenarios for the vegetation-clearing program. The environmental impact examination should make recommendations based on the following management options: vegetation will be removed at maximum possible level, including the agreement on the prevailing mode of extraction (thereby minimizing the risk of high biodegradation and eutrophication during the first years of impoundment); partial removal (selecting tall trees and durable plants) and to leave all bushy vegetation to stimulate local eutrophication and serve as initial fish nurseries; assess positive/negative impacts on the option to burn part of the remaining vegetation prior to inundation, and just before the onset of monsoon rains (and subsequent washing out most of the carbon-laden minerals and nutrients). Special prec aution measures need to be developed to avoid and mitigate impacts on local w ildlife prior to burning actions; select appropriate mechanical clearing methods to avoid excessive erosion and exposure of unsuitable soils; Plan for enhancing habitats in sanc tuary areas where selected vegetati on will be left to stimulate fish breeding and shelter. Whatever mode of pre-impo undment clearing will be selected, timing will be crucial to maximize benefits and minimize negative environmental impacts. 24.3.2.3 Reservoir Bed Morphology with Reference to Fish Habitats Upstream of the site of the dam construction (at Keng Kuk rapids) the Nam Theun river meanders on the gently to NE sloping Nakai Plateau in a succession of relatively slow flowing pools and rapids. Along this gradient, the substrate varies from sand and gravel to rock. Extensive areas are flooded in the wet season and some more or less perennial wetlands on the main plateau and deep pools are found in the zone between Ban Thalang and the dam site . The inundated wetlands are inhabi ted by a number of fish species adapted to these (low oxygen and high nutrient) condit ions, such as catfish, snakeheads and a number of small air-breathing species. The wetlands disappear rapidly after the rainy season. The EAMP has estimated the riverine water surfa ce area during the dry season bein g approximately 850 ha of pools and 10 ha of rapids. 4 These wetlands are of high biodiversity value, especially for water birds of which many have significant interactions with oth er aquatic organisms (e.g. competitors and/or predators for small fish, molluscs and lower inverteb rates, and for aquatic weeds). Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 8 Once the Nakai Reservoir goes into operation the ex tensive shrinking of the reservoir during the dry season (from a surface of 450 km\u00b3 to 100 km\u00b3) will invariably have dramatic effects on the aquatic habitats, depending on local topography, residual bioma ss and relative length of exposure to air, insulation and water. There is uncertainty on the effect of this draw down on the overall biodegradation rate. Being dependent on the nature of decomposable organic material and a variety of climatic, hydro-chemical and hydro-physical parameters, it will be necessary to have a water qualit y monitoring program in place once the reservoir is filling up. During the rainy season the draw down zones in the NT2 will become substantially overgrown with macrophytes, grasses and reeds. The appearance of this vegetation type will instantly trigger the spawning activity of most fishes to become adapted to these conditions. The spawn and juveniles will extensively use the freshly inund ated and nutrient-rich gra ssy areas for feeding and shelter. This area will also provide essential food re sources for both herbivorou s and detrivorous fish. The findings of the fish survey conducted by Kottelat, (1997) and staff from the Department of Livestock and Fisheries (K. Roger, pers. comm. ) support this hypothesis. Provided there is no man-made disturbance, this condition of fresh and relatively good water quality above the newly inundated shallow ar eas will last approximately until l ate September and give sufficient time for natural replenishment of the fish stock. When the water level starts to drop, water quality may increasingly become less favourable due to prolon ged bio-degradation, algal development, increased of well-oxygen ated and oxygen-poor wate r strata. Nonetheless, conditions are assumed still to be co nducive for good fish production, pa rticularly for plankton-eating fish (e.g. small clupeids and a variety of carps) who seem have to adapted all too well in the Nam Ngum Reservoir in the past years (Mattson et al., 2001). The NT2 resettlement program foresees livestock raising in the draw down area, suggesting testing and utilizing water plants as additional fodder, and to acquaint buffaloes to graz e on seasonally newly establishing vegetation in receding draw down areas. Provided that these ideas will materialize, such activities need to be carefully monitored as they w ill have subsequent effects on the local fish ecology: Firstly, the dung deposited by the buffaloes in the draw down areas will be beneficial to soil fertility which will locally stimulate the growth of aquatic plants af ter submergence. Secondly, an abundant number of small pools and depressions will be left from the tram pling marks of buffaloes on the soft soil. This will create temporary microhabitats for small air-breathing fish as well as for a large number of insects meeting ideal breeding conditions. These insects, respectiv ely their larvae, will furnish large quantities of insectivorous fish, but will also cons iderably increase the risk of wate r-borne diseases, mainly malaria and dengue fever. 24.3.2.4 Water quality The Centre for Water Research co ntracted by NTEC in 1997, made quantitative predictions on the expected water quality in the proposed Nakai Reservoir, investigating the processes affecting above and below ground biomass, thermal stratification vs. circulation affecting oxygen distribution, nutrient influx from watershed, projected phytoplankton blooms. The study also screened the quantitative impact from logging and related degradation in the surrounding areas. Applying numerical simulation models, the CWR study found that the NT2 basin will each year be thermally st ratified from late spring to autumn; vertical temperature gradie nts will be largest in depth from 5-10 m. With the average reservoir depth being 7 m there will always be sufficient potential fo r the water bodies in the different sub-basins to become stratified over a couple of months; Stratification starts with the rapid raise of inflows with the onset of monsoon rains; during this period, nutrient and chlorophyll a levels would reach moderate levels; Stratification would weaken toward the end of th e rainy season, coinciding with less solar energy input; Immediately after rainy season, fu ll circulation will occur, while overall water temperatures will decrease; during the following period of 3-4 months, high oxygen levels are to be expected of up to 9 mg/l, with good water transparency and low nutrient and chlorophyll a levels; Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 9 The reservoir is highly sensitive to changes in th e sediment and nutrient influxes resulting from various land-use practices in the catchment area; and Winds and currents lead to the re-suspension of bed sediments in shallo w areas where they will affect turbidity and bio-productivity. Periodic events of anoxia (dissolved oxygen < 2 mg/l ) are likely to occur in deeper water layers during strong stratification conditions. The events are pred icted to affect only 1% of the total water volume at this specific situation. Anoxic condit ions are forecasted to last 5 to20 days) and likely to be confined to depths below 513 masl. Anoxic conditio ns affecting the entire basin are ruled out due to strong periodic re-oxygenation during circulation events. Mixing is al so favoured by the shallo wness and morphology of the basin, plus the fact that the prevailing NE or SW monsoon winds blow more or less perpendicular to the elongated basin. The CWR study assumes that strong winds will not force poor quality bottom water to the offtake site. Aeration and destratification may not be possible solutions to low Dissolved Oxygen concentrations in the reservoir. The installation cost of destratifiers in North Pine Reservoir in Australia was USD 13.9/ha at FSL, and the operation costs were USD 2.3/ha/month. If these costs are extrapolated to Nakai Reservoir, the installation costs would be more than USD 0.5 million, and the operation cost would be USD 1.2 million/year. Thus, it would appear that even a high annual Nakai Reservoir fish yield of 45 kg/ha cannot offset the costs of aeration and destratification. CWR's computer simulations indicate that the inter-basin exchanges between the three sub-basins of Nakai Reservoir are sufficient to eliminate thermally induced local poor water qu ality from lower strata. However, the water quality modelling did not take fully into account that wa ter quality will not be homogenous over the propos ed reservoir and that there are distin ct zones, which will be taken into account in the development of reservoir management and the fisheries program. 24.3.2.5 Increase of nutrients and development of a long-lasting anoxic epilimnion 5 In the hypolimnion, hydrogen sulphi de may be generated due to the ano xic conditions that will exist in this area of the lake in the first two years, particularly during periods where thermal stratification occur. High oxygen concentrations (approx. 9mg/l) occur each year as the reservoir cools and homogenizes. Precipitation of sulphide with iron is a common process and negates the production of gas in the hypolimnion. If gas is formed in the hypolimnion it will be rapidly detoxified by conversion into iron sulphide as it diffuses into the epilimnion. Acco rding to the EAMP (2002) and the modelling studies carried out by CWR (1997) the guideline value of 0.2 \u00b5g/l of H 2S will be met at the surface off-take. The decay of residual above- and below-ground bioma ss, the thermal stratification inhibition of oxygen transport from the surface to depth, oxygen and nutrient loading from the inflowing rivers, phytoplankton dynamics and the detailed circulation patterns leading to differential residence times within the NT2 basin were identified by CWR (1997) as th e dominant processes likely to affect the reservoir water quality. This study also evaluated the dominant phytoplankton characteristics and conditions likely to result in algal blooms during the periods of dam construction (year 1), reservoir filling (year 2), elevated levels of terrestrial biomass decay in the reservoir (years 1-3) and the subsequent seven years. The water quality monitoring program and the fish/fisheries monitoring program should reveal the extent that these process occur and their affect on the fisheries, and thus fish catch of the villagers. 5 Sources: EAMP (2001), CWR (1997, 2000) Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 10 Figure 24-2: Map of Nakai Reservoir at Full Supply Level - 538 m.

New species may appear finding conducive c onditions and better utilizing the new ha bitat resources, wh ile others cannot cope with these changes and therefore will become ex tinct. The development of water quality will largely determine the quality and quantity of fish populations, particularly when the dead storage water layers undergo large fluctuations. In cases where the active storage layer is well mixed by well-oxygenated waters from the watershed, as in the case of Nakai Reservoir, there is good potential for development of large and diverse fish populations. Many fish species presently found in the wetlands of Nakai Plateau are expected to adapt to reservoir conditions. Comparing the presently occurring fish sp ecies in the Nam Theun/Nam Kading with the fish species found in Nam Ngum Reservoir (Lao PDR) and reservoirs in Northeast Thailand (see Annex 24-2), at least 31 fish species are expected to be able to adapt to Nakai Reservoir conditions . 24.4 COMPARATIVE RESERVOIR FISH CATCH ANALYSIS To obtain an indication of how much fish can be harvested annually from Nakai Reservoir, comparisons have been made with hydropower reservoirs in the Mekong River Basin that bear similarities with Nakai Reservoir 7. Each hydropower reservoir has unique bio-physical features all relating to water quality, water quantity and aquatic ecology. However, a comparison between hydropower reservoirs can provide predictions of annual reservoir fish catch scenarios for the future Nakai Reservoir, particularly if main reservoir features are similar. Hydropower reservoir fish yields are also highly correlated with existing reservoir and catchment management practices, actual fishing pressure, man-made interventions such as upstream water uses, and water pollution. All comparative data have been taken from records published by MRC (compiled by Bernacsek, 1997), for Nam Ngum, while additional data has been ex tracted from Schouten (1998) and the ongoing MRC/DANIDA Project. 24.4.1 Nam Ngum Reservoir, Lao PDR The MRC/DANIDA Study of April 2000 reports total fish landings from Nam Ngum Reservoir of 6,833 t in 1998 against 1,470 t in 1987 (see Figure 24-6, belo w). Statistics from the local Fisheries Office show catches between 200 t in 1991 and 1,500 t in 1982 and 1997. These differences are based on different sampling methods where the official statistics are ba sed on figures from the official landing site at Ban Seng Savang collected by the monopoly fish trader company. The figure might be affected by under- reporting in order to limit taxes the company is paying for the right to trade, and is certainly not including local fish consumption or fish trad e through other (unofficial) market ing outlets in the reservoir. The 1998 figure does attempt to estimate these factors and th e main figure is based on catch per unit effort sampling on all gear types used in the reservoir. The figure is given with the error margin 4,283 - 9,383 tons. An increase in reservoir fish catch does not necessarily mean an increase in value of reservoir fish catch. Large sized predatory species may fetch a price of USD 2 - 3 per kg at the landing place, but small species low in the food chain may fetc h only USD 0.20 - 0.25 per kg. 6 According to Kottelat (1996) species likely to disappear from rapids and riffles belonging to the families Balitroridae, Sisoridae and Gobiidae. 7 No comparative analyses are made with hydropower reservoirs in Africa and South America, due to the great differences in natural occurrence of fish species and likely differences in the ways of utilization of aquatic resources between these countri es and mainland South East Asia.

However, the total annual reservoir fish catch was ro ughly estimated at 1,496 tons , including an estimated 695 tons for fish locally co nsumed (Schouten, 1998). While the Nam Ngum Reservoir with 477 km2 and the future Nakai Reservoir have a similar reservoir water surface area at Full Supply Level, the Nam Ngum Reservoir has a considerable higher average depth and also a much higher reservoir water surface area at Minimum Operation Level than Nakai Reservoir. Thus, at Full Supply Level of the reservoir, the Nam Ngum fish yields have been reported to be somewhere in the range of 33 - 143 kg/ha. 24.4.2 Ubolratana Reservoir, North East Thailand Ubolratana reservoir bears a number of similarities to the future Nakai Reservoir with respect to shallow depth and its draw down (see Table 24-3). The annual reservoir fish catch undergoes considerable fluctuations in consecutive years. The reservoir, includin g its fisheries sector, has been intensively studied. An important lesson to be learnt from this reservoir relates to the predicted and actual change in fish species: 89% of the fish fauna found during pre-impound ment conditions are still pr esent in the reservoir, although a much larger change in species composition after impoundment had been predicted by Environmental Impact Assessments. In fact, the total number of fish species increased by 30%. Ubolratana reservoir is one of the few reservoirs where fish catch data have been collected immediately after dam closure. Therefore, this reservoir allows some insight in obtained fish yields during a long continual period. In contrast to many smaller reservoi rs, fish yields gradually increased during the first years after impoundment. This effect might by due to the gradual increase in number of reservoir fishers in the years after impoundment. Catch statistics show also a considerable fluctuation in annual fish yields. The average reservoir fish catch is measured at 1,800 to ns. Mean stabilized annual fish yield in Ubolratana is recorded to be around 44 kg/ha at Full Supply Level.

The average reservoir fish catch is measured at 539 tons. Mean stabilized annual fish yield in Sirinthon reservoir is recorded to be around 18 kg/ha at Full Supply Level.

Mean Depth, Maximum Depth, and Draw Down are important parameters that indicate the potential reservoir water volume with low water quality through stratification of the reservoir. In a reservoir with low Mean Depth and low Maximum Depth, less negative impacts on annual fish production and fish catch by reservoir stratification can be expected. Reservoir elevations give an indication of air temperatures and consequently of water temperatures of the epilimnion of the reservoir. Reservoirs with high water temperatu res will have a higher fish production than reservoirs with low water temperatures.

Construction of all dams of the reservoirs mentioned in Table 24-3 was complete d before 1975. Thus, a mean stabilized annual reservoir fish yield at Full Supply Level represents the average annual reservoir fish catch over a period of years. An important feature of the future Nam Theun 2 is the small water su rface area (approx. 100 km 2) at Minimum Operation Level. The Nakai Reservoir area fluctuates from 450 km2 at Full Supply Level (FSL) to 100 km2 at Minimum Operation Level (MOL) (see Table 24-2). Thus, the water surface area at MOL is 8 (Apart from the main bio-physical parameters of above di scussed hydropower reservoirs as Nam Ngum, Ubolratana, and Sirinthorn, the bio-physical parameters of two smaller hydropower reservoirs (Chulaphon and Nam Phung) also located in the Mekong Basin in Thailand are included in Table 24-3. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1822 % of water surface area at FSL. The maximum annual fluctuation in water surface area will influence fish production in the reservoir and consequently infl uence annual reservoir fish yields (see also Table 24-4, below). Ubolratana Reservoir in Northeast Thailand has a similar decrease of water surface area as Nakai Reservoir. Its surface area decreases from 410 km 2 at FSL to 125 km2 at MOL (30 % of the surface area at FSL). Of the other 4 reservoirs mentioned in Table 24-3, no data are available of the reservoir water surface area at Minimum Operation Level. Obtained annual reservoir fish yields in the 5 rese rvoirs range from 18 to 150 kg/ha at Full Supply Levels. Whereas the high figure from Nam Ngum might be valid it is difficult to compare with figures from other reservoirs due to different methods of sampling. As the Ubolratana Reservoir has characteristics most similar to the Nakai Reservoir, a more detailed analysis of this reservoir is warranted. Table 24-4 s hows the main bio-physical reservoir parameters, the actual obtained annual fish yield of Ubolratana Rese rvoir and the proposed fish yield scenarios for the future Nakai Reservoir. The main difference between Ubolratana Reservoir and Nakai Reservoir is the elevation. The difference in elevation between the two reservoirs is 356 meter. This means a difference of approximately 3.5 o C in air temperature, and co nsequently in water temperature of the epilimnion. Growth rate of fish in Nakai Reservoir will be lower than in Ubolratana Reservoir. However, a deep reservoir as Chulaphon, located at an elevation of 759 masl, 221 meter higher than Nakai Reservoir still obtains mean stabilized fish landings of 30 kg/ha.

Taking into consideration the differences and similarities between the 5 mentioned hydropower reservoirs and the future Nakai Reservoir, three different scenar ios are for the purpose of planning proposed to predict the possible range of annual fish yields of Nakai Reservoir. Low (15 kg/ha), medium (35 kg/ha), and high (45 kg/ha) reservoir fish yield scenarios all fall in the range of actual obtained annual fish yields of existing regional hydropower reservoirs. This range of fish yields will be used (in the present management plan) for the estimation of possible income from the Nakai Reservoir fisheries, the numbers of fishers that could be sustained by the reservoir, and budget requirements of this Reservoir Fisheries Management Plan.

These cover environmental (water quality and fish species diversity), socio-economic (fish consumption, degree of commercial fishing, trade environment and price of fish) and management conditions (access to the fisheries resources). 24.5.1.1 Water Quality Maintenance of good water quality is of great importance for a high reservoir fish yield. Biomass removal before inundation will improve reservoir water qualit y, particularly during the first few years after inundation. During the construction phase, the cons tructors' working camps should not pollute water with wastewater or solid waste. The potential impa cts of water pollution during operation should be monitored in terms of changes in water qua lity. The likely sources of pollution are: fertilizer and pesticide use in the village irrigation schemes; intensive livestock raising along the reservoir and in the draw down zone of the reservoir; tourism development; wastewater discharge and solid waste di sposal at the relocated villages; and fish culture in cages. A water quality monitoring plan is being implemented for the NT 2 Project Area including the Nakai Reservoir and downstream area to monitor potential impacts on fisheries and aquatic biodiversity in the reservoir. Pollution monitoring ultimately leads to decision-making regarding the necessity of management interventions. The Centre of Water Research (1997) predicts that water quality of the deeper parts of the reservoir will not be favourable for aquatic life during the annually recurring stratification periods. Apart from bad water quality of the hypolimnion at areas of the reservoir that are deeper than 10 meters, water quality is considered good for fish production. However, the Centre's predictions are valid only for a matured Nakai Reservoir. Predictions of reservoir water quality during filling of the reservoir and during the first years after impoundment are not made. There does not exist any reservoir water qu ality model that is able to predict water quality during filling and during the fi rst years after impoundment. Thus, in an effort to ensure reasonably good water quality in the first fe w years after impoundment, residual biomass (above and under ground) at Nakai Plateau must be removed as much as possible, particularly in those reservoir areas that will be permanently inun dated during reservoir operation. Another prerogative for favourable reservoir water qua lity conditions for aquatic life will be compliance with the existing construction schedule. As occurred in Nam Leuk hydropower reservoir in Lao PDR, the reservoir was filled when the transmission lines were not yet installed. The reservoir stayed filled for a longer period than planned without any possible water exchange during the dry season. Even with cutting and burning of biomass before inundation, Nam Leuk Reservoir turned anaerobic from the bottom up until only 30 centimetres from the su rface. These anaerobic c onditions of the reservoir caused fish kills inside the reservoir, while downstream fish kills occu rred several times after st art of power production. Even though the water quality is expected to be favourab le for fish production, it should be said that it is not possible to get accurate figures on fish yield until actual water quality measurements are made during the first years after dam closure. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2124.5.1.2 Fish Species and Timi ng of Dam Closure A total number of about 60 fish species have been identified as presentl y occurring in the Nam Theun/Nam Kading River. By comparison with the fish species occurring in the existing Nam Ngum Reservoir, the number of fish species presently occurring in the Nam Theun River that will be able to adapt to reservoir conditions and establish po pulations will be at least 31 (see Annex 24-2). From a fisheries point of view it is important to plan the final dam closure between the months of July and October. During the month of June after the first rainfalls of the wet season, many fish species migrate for spawning from the Nam Theun main stream upstream to small streams, lakes and ponds, rice paddies and floodplains. Some of these upstream migrating fish species migrate downstream again in July while the majority migrate downstream again in October/November. If the dam closure takes place between July and October, a larger number of fish will be trapped in the reserv oir, including fish larvae and juveniles. This will benefit the production of fish during the firs t years after inundation and will accommodate a higher expected fish yield during thes e first years than if the dam was closed at another time of the year. Experience from other regional reservoirs shows that the reduced number of species may be an artifact created by inappr opriate schedule (Bernacsek, 1997). The occurrence of fish species and fish populations at specific locations in the Nam Theun/Nam Kading River fluctuates during the wet and dry seasons. At specific locations a nearly complete turnover of species occurs in the fish catch. Since the fish surv eys in the Nam Theun have been carried out during the dry season only, dam closure in the period from July to October might ensure entrapment of more species in the reservoir than the presently estimated minimu m number of 31 species that can adapt to reservoir conditions. By choosing the right time for dam closure, the potential exists for es tablishment of more fish populations in the reservoir and consequently higher potential for a healthy reservoir fishery. During construction phase, a drain in a proposed cofferda m at the dam site will discharge water from the Nakai Plateau downstream to Nam Theun via a tunnel. Many fish species do no t pass or migrate through tunnels; however an open channel will not affect fish migration, although water velocities in excess of 2 m/sec in the period from beginning June to Se ptember, may prevent fish passage up the tunnel 9. The preferred option for healthy reservoir fisheries th erefore is the closure of the dam between July and October, together with drainage of water from the Nakai Plateau through an open channel in the cofferdam during construction phase. There is no evidence that the introduction of exotic fish species by stocking hydropower reservoirs will raise reservoir fish production or increase reservoir fish yields. On the contrary, introduction of non- indigenous fish species from hatcheries and nurseries may even lead to introduction of fish diseases or predators, affecting potential reservoir fish yield. However, the introduction of the indigenous fish species, Clupeichthys aesarnensis (Pba Keo), could form an exception to this stocking practice. While in the Nam Theun/Nam Kading the presence of Pba Keo has not been confirmed, it is an im portant reservoir species in Nam Ng um and other reservoirs such as Sirinthon in Thailand, where it can form up to 60 % of the total annual reservoir fish catch. Pba Keo is a fish species occurring in the main water column as a filter feeder. Pba Keo does not depend on feeding in the littoral zone or the bottom of the reservoir. While Pba Keo does not establish large populations in rivers, it apparently does occur in rivers, as proven by the existence of Pba Keo in Nam Ngum and Sirinthon Reservoirs. To achieve high reservoir fish yield it is important that the whole water column of the reservoir will be made productive. In the large volumes of reservoir wa ter only pelagic fish species (fish species occurring in the water column) such as Pba Keo can establish populations. As a result of establishment of Pba Keo fish populations, other fish species will thrive in pelagic zones by predating on Pba Keo. 9 Most fish species can swim against a water flow with velocities not exceeding 2 m/sec, if the distance at which such velocities occur is short. If the length of the drain will be more than 40 meter, so-called rest chambers should be built at 10 meter intervals in the drain, where fish can gather and rest before swimmi ng upstream again. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 22If it is decided to introduce Pba Keo to Nakai Rese rvoir, such a step should follow the FAO guidelines for fish introductions. 24.5.1.3 Access to Reservoir Fisheries Resources Limiting people's access to fishing grounds is an important tool to avoid (i) over-fishing, (ii) fisheries conflicts, and (iii) unsustainable fisher ies practices. By limiting or managing the number of fishers, a high reservoir fish yield can be sustained through a co-manag ed fisheries program. Therefore, it is proposed to limit the amount of fishers in the reservoir to \u0099 those households of the fully relocated villages \u0099 non-relocated villagers who are eligible to particip ate in the fisheries (and other livelihood programs); \u0099 persons not currently residing on the plateau, but currently travelling to the plateau to fish Table 24-1 page 3 details the villages and the number of households for each village at the Nakai Plateau, which will be resettled before impoundment as well as two villages that are loc ated close to the future reservoir, but that will not need to be resettled. The Forest Law (1996) of Lao PDR st ates that: unless restricted for na tional interests (e.g. defence and mineral resource extraction), all natural lake and rive rine systems are subjected to unrestricted public access. The law allows traditional utilization of aquatic resources and fishing of non-restricted species for family consumption and other traditional uses. However, the Concession Agreement between the Government of Lao PDR (GoL) and the Company includes a detailed agreement on the Fisheries Development Program: A program to ensure that the Reservoir is productive for fisheries will be implemented after the villages have been established. All boats located in the Reservoir will be registered in order to control fishing and the use o f access to the Reservoir for access to the NBCA . To support sustainable fisheries of the Nakai Reservoir, it will be essential to limit access to fishing grounds to reside nts of the proposed 12 relo cated villages and certain eligible villagers from the two non-relocated villages. If, after a number of years, the reservoir shows a high sustainable fish yield that can accommodate a higher number of fishers it can be considered to al low a higher number of fishers to have access to the reservoir. On the assumption that only the relo cated villagers and villagers from the two non-relocated villages are eligible to register as fishers in the Nakai Reservoir, then in th e year 1998, the maximum number of potential reservoir fishing households was 933. The first year of fishing after inundation of the reservoir is estimated to be 2008. With an exis ting population gr owth rate of 2.2 % at the Nakai Plateau, the number of fishing households is growing accordingly. Table 24-5 shows the predicted number of fishing households in the years 2002, 2008, 2009, 2018, and 2028. Using an average household size of 5.5, the total number of potential fishing household members is estimated. Table 24-5: Number of Potential Fishing Hous eholds and Population between the Years 1998 and 2028, Assuming an Annual Population Growth Ra te of 3.0 % in 1998-2010 Falling to 1.8 % in 2028. Year 1998 2002 2008 2009 2018 2028 Number of Households 864 population rate is assumed to be cons tant at 3.0% through the init ial years up to 2010 when the first benefits of the new livelihood programmes are being experienced. Experience has in many cases shown that increased wealth is followed by a lower number of children. The population growth rate is therefore exp ected to gradually fall to 1.8 % per year in 2028. 24.5.1.4 Creation of a Resettlement Area in Close Vicinity of Ban Thalang Ban Thalang at the north western end of the main reservoir presently hosts the biggest group of fishers. From a fisheries development point of view it would be desirable to leave Ban Thalang to the extent possible at or near the original location. Reasons are as follows: Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 23 There is good potential for fish production in two sub-zones of the Nakai Reservoir that will become inundated downstream of Ban Thalang, the larger one following the main river bed of the Nam Theun until the dam site, and the smaller one branching to NE from Ban Thalang, following the river basin of Nam Xot. Construction of fish landing facilities includin g supplementary infrastructure would greatly reduce the transport distance and operating costs for fisher people active in the above described sub-basins. Surveillance, patrolling and monitoring will be facilitated for these sub-basins10 when infrastructure and utilities are provided at th is location (Ban Thalang). Road links11 will be upgraded between the Nakai Plateau and Lak Sao. This linkage will facilitate and stimulate the fish marketing towards Khamke ut District in Bolik hamxay Province. Villagers indicated that th ey wish to remain in th eir traditional environmen t and agriculture. Many villagers of Ban Thalang have their gardens oppo site the river at locations which will not become submerged at FSL. 24.5.1.5 Fish Consumption In the Nam Theun/Nam Kading River, the average fish consumption per person per year is 60 kg. With an average household size of 5.5, the average annual household consumption of fish is 330 kg/household/year. The fish used for consumption is generally caught by a household member. To sustain household fish consumpti on of 330 kg/household/year, the aver age daily household fish catch should be 0.93 kg/household/day. Despite that fisher s complain about declinin g fish catch, such an average daily household fish catch is still realized in riparian villages of the Nam Theun/Nam Kading, even at locations that are impacted by the existing Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Project. 24.5.1.6 Three Types of Fisher Households Two variables will be important for th e level of fishing intensity in whic h villagers will engage themselves: Experience with fishing. Households which used to live along the Nam Theun River, are more experienced in fishing, than households that liv ed on the Nakai Plateau away from the Nam Theun River. An indicator of this is the prox imity of the village to a main river. Location of the relocated village in relation to the reservoir. Living closer to areas of more perennial water will make it easier to go fi shing than living further upstream. Based on these variables, three types of households ca n be identified and their relative share of the fish landings estimated for planning purposes (see Table 24-6): Type 1 : Households predicted to fish only for consumption (around 9 %); Type 2 : Households predicted to fish for consumption and additional income (part time, commercial, around 41 %); Type 3 : Households predicted to fish for consumption and income (full time, commercial, around 50 %). At the Nam Ngum Reservoir all households fish for consumption, but only 10 % of the households are fully engaged in commercial fishing. In those househol ds, sale of fish forms near ly their full cash income. For other households on the Nam Ngum Reservoir, fishing provides not only food on the table, but also some additional cash income. In the 12 new and two non-relocated villages at Nakai Reservoir the current plan estimates that there will be about 52 % of the 1,196 households who only fish for consumption. This ty pe of household will be found in all villages but will dominate in villages alread y located close to the future south western reservoir shore line. Part-time or seasonal commercial fishers will amount to around 40 %. Many of these will be households from villages currently located upstream of Phon esavang to be relocated at the new villages of 10 The establishment of larger sanctuaries will be most likely in these two sub-basins. 11 Bridge at Ban Thalang, followed by an all-weather road including bridges and culverts to Nam Nian. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 24Phonesavang, Sop On / Ka Oy, Ka Oy / Done, and Ka Oy / Khone Khen. The villages located at this upstream area of the reservoir can fish only in shal low reservoir areas that fall dry during the months of May, June and July. Full time fishers will mainly come from the new villages of Hat Khamphan e / Sop Ma, Sop Phene, Thalang and Sop Hia. These fishers will make up arou nd 8 % of the total number of reservoir households. The number of each fisher category will be verified once the reservoir is up an d running, its productivity confirmed and villagers have chos en their favoured livelihoods. 24.5.1.7 Competitive Fish Trade Environment It is assumed that private companies or individuals w ill trade reservoir fish in a competitive manner in open market conditions. 24.5.1.8 Price of Fish The market price of fish per kilogram depends on size and species. Large sized fish fetch a higher price than small sized fish. In Lao PDR, so me fish species of large sized fish fetch a price at the landing place as high as USD 2.5/kg. However, reservoir fish in the region include the small sized Pba Keo that is caught by night using lamps and lift nets. The price of Pba Keo is low, approximately USD 0.25/kg. The price of fish presently bought from fishers downstream of the future Nakai Reservoir in Nam Theun River is approximately USD 0.80/kg. Thus, on the assumption that 40 % of the re servoir fish catch will be worth USD 0.25/kg and the other 60 % of the reservoir ca tch will be worth USD 0.80/kg, then the average price of reservoir fish at the landing place will be USD 0.58 /kg. The validity of this estimate is backed up by monitoring data of fish landings and fish trade in Ubolratana Reservoir during the year 2001, which estimate the average price of reservoir fish as USD 0.60/kg. Thus, calculations of value of future fish landings of Nakai Reservoir are based on the assumption of an average price of reservoir fish of USD 0.6/kg at the landing place. The average price of fish at market places in Lao PDR fluctuates around USD 1-2/kg. Consequently, fish traders will have sufficient margin to transport fish ov er long distances, and even to provide fishers with ice to maintain quality of fish for consumers. Main fi sh markets for the future Nakai Reservoir fisheries produce will be Thakhek, Lak Sao and other large towns in Lao PDR not too far from the reservoir. Export to Thailand and possibly to Vietnam are other possible market opportunities. Due to inflation of the Lao Kip, traders are eager to sell fish to Thaila nd against the harder currency of Thai Baht. A lively fish trade across the Mekong River from Lao PDR and Cambodia to Thailand already exists.

Total of eligible fishing households does not necessarily add up to the same as the sum of total for each household type as calculations are based on extrapolations including decimals. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2624.5.2 Scenarios for Fish Catch, Consumption and Trade Using above-mentioned eight assumptions regarding (i ) water quality, (ii) fish species, (iii) access to fisheries resources, (iv) maintaining the fishing village of Ban Thalang, (v) fish consumption, (vi) typology of fishing households, (vii) competitive fish trade en vironment and (viii) price of fish, four different reservoir fish yield scenarios are considered for pl anning purposes. The medium scenario is used for detailed budgeting. 1. Start up scenario, at year 2008, the first ye ar after inundation; 5 kg/ha at Full Supply Level; 2. Low annual reservoir fish yield scenario; 15 kg/ha at Full Supply Level; 3. Medium annual reservoir fish yiel d scenario; 35 kg/ha at Full Supply Level; 4. High annual reservoir fish yield scenario; 45 kg/ha at Full Supply Level. Scenarios 2 to 4 reflect a realistic range of yields based on experience from comparable reservoirs (see Table 24-3). Using these four fish yield scenarios, the size of tota l daily fish consumption and total daily fish trade by the fishing households can be calculated. This has been done in Table 24-7 for the years 2008, 2009, 2018, and 2028. 24.5.2.1 Start Up Scenario Due to the new situation in which households move in to a new village and a new house, grow agriculture products on new land under irrigation, planting frui t trees, raising livestock more intensively, utilizing forest products and timber in a sustainable manner, it might be expected that ho useholds will not find the time and the opportunities to fully prepare new fishing gear and boats, and adjust to fishing in the newly identified fishing grounds in the reservoir. The change from river fishing (or no fishing) to reservoir fishing by almost 1,200 households will take time. At Ubolratana Reservoir it took three years before fishers were able to raise their fish catch to a mean stabilized yield. Therefore, it is assumed that due to both (a) the time required for fisheries and other livelihood adaptation, and (b) the potential risk of bad water quality in the first year after inundation, the fishing yield during the first year after inundation will be low, at around 5 kg/ha at Full Supply Level, covering mainly household fish consumption. During the first year after in undation, fish landing places at each village will have to be established and fish traders will need ti me to assess their opportun ities and needs for their trade facilities, including ice plants. 24.5.2.2 Medium Yield Scenario Fish catch at the reservoir will increase, when fishing households have boats and fishing gear arranged. At that moment in time, the appropriate fish landing places together wi th access from the villages to the landing places should be established. Fish traders have to set up their distribution system and ice plants become operational. Then, only after these structures ar e in place, the total fish catch of Nakai Reservoir is estimated to be approximately 1,575,000 kg/year. Such an annual fish catch will have an estimated value of USD 945,000. Fishing households will consum e a large part of this fish catch. In the year 2009, the second year after inundation of the reservoir, the average daily amount of fish caught for consumption by all 1,196 fishing households w ill be 1,085 kg/day with an estimated value of USD 651/day. The remaining part of the fish catch will be tr aded by the fishing househol ds to traders that daily distribute and collect ice and fish to and from th e fishers. Such traders may be middlewomen that transport ice and collect fish by boat (as at Nam Ngum Reservoir), but due to the access road that will be constructed between the reservoir villages at Nam Theun 2, middlemen and middlewomen may also transport fish and ice by motorcycle or by car. It is estimated that in 2009 traders will collect 3,230 kg of fish per day on average, equivalent to USD 1,938 at the landing place. The wet season fish catch may differ from the dry seas on fish catch both in weight and value, or the fish catch may drop during the time of the year when the re servoir destratifies and turns over. During this time of year, the reservoir level is high and fish may be di stributed over the total water volume of the reservoir, making it difficult to catch fish.

However, due to the annual popu lation growth (though expected to fall from 3.0 to 1.8 %) at Nakai Plateau, the maximum number of fishing households will have increased from 1,196 in 2009 to 1,784 in 2028. Thus, the amount of daily fish consumption by the fishing hous eholds will accordingly increase from 1,085 kg with a value of USD 651 in 2009 to 1,618 kg worth USD 971 in 2028. Consequently, the daily amount of traded fish may decrease to 2,697 kg with a value of USD 1,618 in 2028. On an annual basis , the fish trade in the medium yield scenario is expected to reach 1,179 tons of fish worth USD 707,000 in 2009 (see Table 24-8). With the incr easing population, the trade will slowly fall to 984 tons worth USD 591,000 in 2028. For the average hou sehold this trade will be equivalent to USD 1.6/day and USD 1.4/day, respectively, on top of th e value of fish consumed in the household (USD 0.5/day, see Table 24-9). The table assumes that all households are involved in fish trade and that they share equally in cash income from trade. However, if it is assumed that villagers will fish with di fferent levels of intensity (see Section 24.5.1.6) then the 593 households fishing for consumption only (50 %) are expected to catch 0.9 kg fish/day in 2009 worth USD 0.5 in a medium fish catch scenario (s ee Table 24-10). The 41 % (or 495 households) who are fishing part time will catch 5.9 kg fish day/day with a value of USD 3.5. Full time fishers, who amount to 9 % (or 108 households), will in this scenario ca tch 8.3 kg fish/day with a value of USD 5.0. 24.5.2.3 Low Yield Scenario and Need to Limit Access In a low fish yield scenario, the va lue of daily fish trade will be USD 459 in 2009, declining to USD 139 (231 kg fish) in 2028. This shows the general prob lem of limited resources utilized by a growing population. In a period of 20 years, the reservoir (under a low fish yield scenario) hardly provides additional cash income anymore to the fishing househol ds. There is only little fish left in the reservoir for trade. Not long after the year 2028, household consum ption of fish will decrease, because of the limited fish yield of the reservoir. At this stage, fishing households might become desperate to get fish for food on the table. Consequently, there is a likely increase in fishing efforts, possibly leading to over-fishing. Due to over-fishing, ultimately the annual fish yield of the reservoir will decrease. In such a situation, fishers invest more money to catch less fish. Fishers will try to catch it all, lo sing more in the process. Such a potential catastrophe may occur much earlier than 20 years after inundation if the number of fishing households is allowed to be higher than the propos ed limited number of fishing households or if the reservoir fishery is poorly managed. Such an example shows the need to develop and support reservoir fisheries management that allows th e fishing community to divide the limited aquatic resources in an appropriate manner, to a growing human population. If open access fisheries are allowed in the reservoir, th en no fisheries management plan is likely to be successful in the long term. Thus, successful rese rvoir fisheries management at Nakai Plateau has to include limited access of fishers. Additional awareness raising of what sustainabili ty of reservoir fisheries mean should be an integral part of reservoir fisheries management. 24.5.2.4 High Yield Scenario However, if assuming a high fish catch scenario of 45 kg/ha/year, which is similar to Ubolratana Reservoir, the value of fish traded will be USD 2,678/day (4,463 kg fish) in 2009. With increased consumption by the growing popula tion the trade will gradually decrease to USD 2,358/day (3,930 kg fish) in 2028. 24.5.2.5 Consumption or sale of fish Table 24-7 has assumed that fish consumption by the fishing households stays constant over time. It may well be possible that fishers prefer to trade fish fo r cash income and therefore reduce their own fish consumption in lieu of cash income. The table has also assumed that the price per kilogram fish consumed is the same as the price per kilogram fish traded. This is of ten not the case as villagers might have specific preferences.

Firstly the more likely scenario, where villagers eat cheap fish in th e household in order to sell the more expensive fish. The average value for fish sold will therefore increase from USD 0.71/kg in 2009 to USD 0.80/kg in 2028. The second scenario has villagers giving equal pref erence to cheap and expensive fish. The average value of fish sold will increase only s lightly from USD 0.60/kg in 2009 to USD 0.62/kg in 2028. Lastly, a more hypothetical scenario, where villagers prefer to eat expensive and sell the cheap fish. In this case the average value of fish sold will drop from USD 0.49/kg in 2009 to USD 0.41/kg in 2028.

The resettlement program is expected to improve existing household economies by increasing opportunities for both subsistence food production and for increased cash income through a number of livelihood options, including. reservoir fisheries; sustainable commercial management of the resettlement area forest; irrigated agriculture; small and large livestock raising; an non-farm employment and small business opportunities. The development of each of these options will be supported by a range of activities, including training, physical support and institutional de velopment. In the case of rese rvoir fisheries development, the activities that will be supported by the project will include; assistance and training of fishing households in preparation of fishing gear, in boat building, and in the operation and maintenance of boats, motors and gears; conditional provision of boats, with motors for commercial fishers, through Reservoir Fisheries Association; assistance to fish traders in procurement of ice plants, trucks, motorcycles; basic infrastructure such a fish land ing places at each relocated village; assistance with zoning and demarcation of villa ge fishing zones and fish sanctuaries; and assistance to develop co-management aimed at a sustainable and healthy fisheries. 24.6.1 Basic Fishers Equipment To earn the predicted income from fish catch for bo th consumption and sales, households have to obtain fishing equipment such as boats, paddles, outboard mo tors, fish baskets and fish ing gear. Recurrent costs are repairs of gear and boat, fuel and ice. Fishing gear Reservoir fishing gear differs in material and dimensi ons from the fishing gear presently used at the Nakai Plateau for river fisheries. Training courses in prepar ation of reservoir fishing gear will be organized for the resettled households, and as part of the training al l households will be eligible to receive fishing gear, the type and size dependant on their intended use - the major use categories being subsistence, semi commercial and full time commercial. On the a ssumption that 1,196 households will be involved in fisheries in 2009, the required contribution from th e project will be in the order of USD 59,800 (@ USD 50 per household). Fishing households will themselves be expected to co ver the costs of operation, maintenance, repair and depreciation costs of fishing gear, fish ba skets, and fish processing equipment. Boats and Outboard Motors Only few fishing households at the Nakai Plateau have already a boat with engine (roughly 10 % in 1998 12) and fishing gear. However, their boats and fishing ge ar are more suitable for river fisheries than for reservoir fisheries, and it can be assumed that most reservoir boats will want improvement if not replacement. 12 As mentioned previously, the survey had an overweight of respondents from small villages with relatively high level of fishing . The figure is therefore a maximum. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 33It is estimated that 108 out of the 1,196 households (9 %) in 2009 will be fully engaged in professional fisheries. These households will be trained in build ing large wooden boats (w orth about USD 200 each) and provided with an 8 horsepower outboard motor (worth about USD 560). An estimated 41 % of the resettled households may need a smaller boat of (worth USD 80) and a 5.5 horsepower long tail outboard motor (worth USD 420). The remaining households (5 0 %) will need a boat with a paddle costing USD 80. The total budget requirement will be about USD 376,000. This budget estimate is based on the price of finished products. Fishing households are expected to build their own boats, which will lower the costs, but they w ill be supported in this in terms of timber, tools, glues etc. Outboard motors will rema in the property of the Reservoir Fisheries Association, and fishers would then rent the motor for a nominal fee from the Association provided they have registered and obtained a fishing and boat licence. Other households may opt for self-financing a boat with outboard motor, or may decide to build a boat themselves. By consultation of resettled households and an inventory of boats and outboard motors presently in use and their suitability the budget should be adjusted. A special reservoir night fisheries using lamps and lif t nets may develop, depending on establishment of fish species as Pba Keo in the reservoir. Such night fisheries will bear differen t costs. Night fishing is carried out by full-time professional fisheries (as is the case in Nam Ngum Reservoir) or by entrepreneurs (as in Sirinthon Reservoir) investing in large scale fi sheries equipment, and hiring personnel. This second method, however, may not be an option if the rese rvoir fishery is reserved only for the resettled population. The RMU/DRWG will manage the gran t to the Reservoir Fishers Association for boats and outboard motors. Land and forest should be allocated to resettled villages to obtain timber for boat building. Fishing households will cover costs of operation, maintenance and repair of boats and motors. 24.6.2 Ice Plants and Vehicles for Fish Traders To allow fish traders to set up their competitive busi ness in time, loans will be facilitated via commercial banks to cover the initial investments required for tr ucks, motorcycles, boats, and ice plants. The potential loan requirements are estimated as follows: One 5 ton truck: USD 15,000 Three 1 ton pick-up trucks: USD 30,000 Five motorcycles: USD 7,500 Two ice plants USD 45,000 Fish traders may decide to self finance these necessary investments. Thus the total loans required for fish traders should not exceed USD 97,500. Fish traders will cover operation, maintenance and repair costs of ice plants and vehicles. 24.6.3 Village Fish Landing Places At each of the 12 relocated villages, a fish landing pl ace will be constructed wher e fishers land their boat and where fish traders can buy fish. The fish landing places may be at the proposed inlet channels of the village irrigation schemes to overcome the problem of draw-down, which still need s to be considered in relation to site selection an d design of the landings. The landing place facilities will probably consist of wo oden poles for boat mooring, concrete steps up (in the order of 12m vertical height), a concrete slab with drain, and a simp le shelter where fish will be sorted, put on new ice in baskets and protected against sun an d rain. Access roads to the fish landing places and irrigation pumps will be provided under the irriga tion or the village infrastructure budgets, and is indicatively budgeted at USD 90,000. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 34The NTPC together with the Resettlement Manage ment Unit (RMU) and the District Resettlement Working Groups (DRWG) will be responsible for desi gn and construction supervision of fish landing places. Village Fishing Groups (VFGs) will be responsible fo r maintenance and repair costs of access roads and fish landing places. 24.6.4 Labour Requirements - Task of Fishers In deciding to focus on reservoir fisheries as a livelih ood, a resettler family must first consider the labour, and skill requirements of reservoir fish eries (other factors to consider in clude the relative productivity or profitability of the new livelihood opti ons). While it is intended to deve lop skills, if and when required, the labour availability of each family is relatively fixed. The main fisheries tasks which require input of family labour include; making paddles, fish baskets and fishing gear; maintenance and repair of fishing gear; building, maintenance an d repair of boats; maintenance and repair of outboard motors; actual fishing; and fish sale to middlemen and traders. 24.6.5 Fish Processing In Lao PDR, fish processing mainly consists of drying fish for trade and of making fermented fish paste (Padek ) for household consumption. At Nam Ngum Rese rvoir, many riparian villages have large fish drying racks to dry Pba Keo. Dried Pba Keo from Nam Ngum reservoir is distributed all over the country for sale in food shops. Even in Oudomsouk at Nakai, Pba Keo from Nam Ngum Reservoir is for sale. If Pba Keo establishes a fish population in Nakai Reservoir, it can be expected that fishing households will also be involved in fish drying. If the composition of fish species provides the opportunity, reservoir fisheries management should provide support to fish processing activities as drying, salting and smoking for trading purposes and for the preparation of fish paste for household consumption. However, at Ubolratana Reservoir in 2001, only 0.6 % of the total annual fish landings of approximately 1,800 tons are estimated to have been processed 13. There is no indication that larger fish processing facilities for making fish filets, fish sticks, or fish sauce are commercially fe asible at existing large hy dropower reservoirs in the Mekong Basin. 24.6.6 Aquaculture Nam Ngum Reservoir has a long history of trials and errors in the development of cage culture of fish. Until 1997, none of the trials had pr oven profitable. In 1997 the first ca ges for culture of snakehead fish, Channa micropeltes (Pba Dto), were established. The cages were stocked with juvenile snakeheads caught in the reservoir, and fed with Pba Keo, also caught in the reservoir. The latest count of the number of snakehead cages in Nam Ngum Reservoir was 60. The culture of snakeheads has proven to be a commercially sound operation at Nam Ngum, but it remains unsure if Pba Dto and Pba Keo will establish populations in Nakai Reservoir. If both species will establish populations then a number of 60 floating cages may provide full employment for up to 10 househol ds. Such aquaculture activities need investment, mainly of cage construction and floaters. Operation costs can be high in labour to provide fish feed and to operate the cages. Involved households need to wait for about 8 months before they may expect cash income from selling the raised snakeh eads. Typically, cage culture is for entrepreneurs who dare to invest in time and are prepared to manage cages for 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The development of cage culture should also be treated carefully because of potential pollution problems in the form of sedimentation underneath the cages and general eutrofication. Over-fishing of Pba Keo and Pba Dto for stocking of cages will also form a risk. A strict licensing of cage culture activities with a review of feasibility and potential of pollution pr oblems should avoid problems found in Vietnamese reservoirs: in the 240 hectare Ea Soup Reservoir in Ce ntral Highlands, cage cult ure developed rapidly but was followed by a high mortality of fish. It is reco mmended not to allow cage culture of exotic species, 13 This figure, however, might exclude fish processed away from the reservoir. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 35because of possible impacts on reservoir fisheries by introduction of exotic species and fish diseases. Aquaculture activities will need to be evaluated an d, if considered feasible , licensed. A research and development component of reservoi r fisheries management will advise on the potential of aquaculture activities in the reservoir. There is also an option for seasonal pen fish culture in the reservoir. If such a venture is promoted, it is important that pens are set up prior to inundation with the bottom edge buried to prevent the invasion of predators. In any case, actual aquaculture activities should not start before maturation of the reservoir, i.e. between 5 and 10 years after inundation. 24.6.7 Fish Trading Trade of landed reservoir fish w ill provide employment and income op portunities at Nakai Reservoir. In Nam Ngum Reservoir a monopolist fish trader who pays for trading rights to the Province of Vientiane buys fish landed at the landing place in Ban Seng Savang. About 15 to 20 middlewomen distribute ice from the traders' ice plant to the reservoir villages, bu y fish and bring them back to the landing place. At the landing place, the fish is sorted, put on fresh ice, loaded on a truck and distributed to the markets, mainly in the city of Vientiane. Fish sorting, ice ma king, ice packing and transport involve at least another 10 people in daily work. At Nakai Re servoir access roads to all villages w ill be provided, and landing places will be constructed at each relocate d village at the inlet canal of the village irrigation sc heme. Therefore, the distribution of ice and access for traders will be le ss difficult than in Nam Ngum Reservoir. At Nakai Reservoir, probably a total number of between 15 to 20 people will be involved in fish trade, including entrepreneurs, drivers, ice plant workers, admini strators, and middle(wo)men . A credit scheme is proposed to help fish traders setting up their busine ss. The credit scheme will cover the main investment costs for fish traders, i.e. ice plants and vehicles (motorcycles, boats, pick-up trucks, trucks). See Annex 24-3 for details on fish marketing around the Nakai Plateau. For fish trading, it is recommended that the resettled households, particularly those involved in fishing, be consulted on whether they would like to establish a fishing cooperative that would also be involved in trading. If this is found to be acceptable, the cost tables would need to be revised to accommodate this recommendation. Some members of the cooperative may thus be engaged in trading as their main livelihood. However, lessons should be learned from the fishing cooperative at Nam Ngum Reservoir in the 1970s. One main problem was that they obtained a fixed and very low price for their catch. At Nakai Reservoir, it is planned not to fix the price of fish. 24.6.8 Other Employment Opportunities Other business and employment opportunities re lated to the reservoir fisheries include: selling, building, and repairing boats; selling, repairing fishing equipment; selling and distributing fuel; selling and repairing ou tboard motors; and boat transport services. Under competitive open market cond itions, these activities will be taken on by entrepreneurs and craftsmen either as small en terprises, full time or part-time jobs. Resettlers themselves will be encouraged and facilitated by loans and training to engage in these activities. During construction of the dam v illagers could be involved in clearing of biomass; clearing of debris from the reservoir water surface; installation of demarcation signs; and construction of fish landing places. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3624.7 DEVELOPMENT OF RESERVOIR FISHERIES MANAGEMENT Inadequate reservoir fisheries management generally leads to an increase in the amount of fishers and fishing gear, decrease in catch per un it effort, and reduction of large size d fish, leading to an increase of cost per fishing household and possible reduction of annu al reservoir fish yield. Such a possible decrease in benefits for fishing households should be av oided by the implementation of appropriate co- management of the reservoir fisheries. 24.7.1 The Concept and Basic Processes of Co-Management Since fishers control their own investments and their own fishing effort, control of efforts can only realistically be realized through community based or co-management approaches. The distinction between these two approaches mainly lies with the degree of government involvement. Hence, management of the resources lies predominantly with the resource users in a community based approach, whereas in a co-management approach the management and responsibilities are shar ed between the users and government authorities. Natural resources of the scale and importance of the Nakai Plateau and the Nam Then 2 Reservoir will naturally fall un der a co-management approach. The MRC Fisheries Program defines co-management as \" A formalized process of sharing of authority and responsibility by government and organized user groups in decentralized decision-making aiming at improved, participatory and democratic, resource management\" . The community feeling of ownership of the resources is crucial to the success of the fisheries management. This has several implications: Rules and regulations should be developed by the fishing community in consultation with the fisheries authorities. The latter should mainly provide support and guidance. The fewer and simpler the regulations the better. Unrealistic targets are not likely to be met. Supervision and enforcement of rule s and regulations should be carr ied out by, or in collaboration with, the fishing community; If people or companies from outside the reservoir community are allowed to engage in exploitation of the fisheries resources, the community's stewardship feeling towards the resources will deteriorate as will compliance towards rules and regulations; Reservoir fisheries co-management can be combined wi th natural resource conservation. The advantages of such a combination are: Enhanced enforcement of fisheries rules and regu lations with the particip ation of more eyes and ears, as well as arms and legs; Reservoir fisheries generating a financial profit with which environmental awareness and conservation activities potentially can be financed; and Joint monitoring, which will avoid over harvesti ng and will support adaptive management to guarantee sustainable resource use. Thus, aquatic habitats and aquatic resources can be protected and managed, while fishing households at the same time make a sound financial profit. The Reservoir Fisheries Developmen t and Management Plan proposed will have a timeframe and budget of only 10 years, starting 1 year before dam impoundment and ending 6 years after completion of dam construction. After this 10-year period, revenues from reservoir fisheries should pay largely for its own management. Garret Hardin (1968) in ' The Tragedy of the Commons ' observed that few management systems of common areas such as grasslands and water-bodies can provide solutions resulting in sustainable utilization. However, if there is restricted access to grasslands and water-bodies, then there is a defined community utilizing its natural resources. Thus if access of fish ers to Nakai Reservoir is limited only to eligible households, then the reservoir is not anymore a 'common', but can become a jointly managed area by a well defined community. In co-management of reservoi r fisheries, fishing households will obtain a sense of ownership and subsequently develop responsibilities , which will be essential to utilize aquatic resources in a sustainable manner. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 37In another analysis of fishers' behaviour, Steve Jones (1999) in ' Almost like a whale, the origin of species updated ', states: \"Fishermen are close to the wild and act - like any predator - only in their own short-term interests. Politicians try to control them, but almost always fail.\" Thus, instead of forming a large fisheries management bureaucracy that almost always fails, the Reservoir Fisheries Management institutions proposed here and the Technical Assistance team will train and build capacity of the reservoir fisheries community. Institutional staff and Te chnical Assistance should make them selves largely obsolete within a timeframe of 6 years after inundation of the reservoi r. After these years of monitoring, capacity building, training, awareness creation, and community developm ent, the reservoir fishers and the Village Fishing Groups should take care of the main part of management activities of reservoir fisheries. A reservoir fisheries management office run by (a Rese rvoir Fisheries Unit under) the District Agriculture and Forestry Office will remain to assist the reserv oir community in monitori ng, environmentally sound reservoir management and sustainable utilization of aq uatic resources. The proposed reservoir fisheries plan will not change wolves into sheep, but will ch ange predators (as Steve J ones defines fishers) into gamekeepers. Management systems developed from within and by the participants generally work better than introduced systems (Sollows and Hartmann, 2002). Interventions should build on exis ting practices. In the case of Nakai Reservoir, the management of fisheries resources should take into account existing river fisheries management as well as management of other natural resources, e.g. forestry and water. A co-management approach could involve, among other activities: participatory setting of realistic reservoir fish catch targets; participatory delineation and management of fishing zones; participatory fish catch and fisheries effort monitoring; participatory development and enforcement of fishing rules and regulations; and regular contact between fishers (or their representatives) and other st akeholders, e.g. other reservoir users, relevant government aut horities and electricity company. In addition, awareness campaigns and training sessions could be made available to villagers on issues like fish breeding patterns, sustainable fishing practices and conflict resolution. Only issues which are relevant to the stakeholders should be included in th e co-management process. Villagers can easily be over-burdene d with issues for which they do not see the relevance and the fisheries management is less likely to succeed. Finally, fisheries co-management, including training and awareness creation, is a good tool to increase equity, accountability, transparency and sustainability. 24.7.2 Lessons to be Learnt on Fisheries Management from Nam Ngum Reservoir According to field discussions held at the Nam Ngum Reservoir 14, the following issues are frequently raised in local fishing associations meetings: poor organization level of the fishing associations; from fishers' viewpoint there is an unsatisfacto ry price system, prices being determined by a monopolist fish trader; need for improving the e xisting marketing chain; continuation of illegal fishing practices (23% of villages), such as dynamite15, impermeable firecrackers in combination with light fishing for sa rdines, air suction pumps and spear guns used by divers, drifting gill nets; insufficient surveillance and control; 14 Two site visits to the landing site at the dam jetty were made in 2002, a boat trip to Ban Xai Oudom (meeting the deputy villa ge chairman) and personal communication with experts from the MRC working with the Reservoir Fisheries Development Program in the Mekong River Basin. 15 There are obvious signs that on local fish markets, increasi ngly fish are offered that have been killed by explosives. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 38 theft of gear, reported by 40% of villagers, with subsequent poor means of conflict resolution; loss of gear (entangling in remaining subm erged vegetation) and loss of fish stock; outside fishers (mostly remaining unregistered) intrude into fishing areas allocated to local associations; insufficient level of perception of sanctuary concept; insufficient provision of fishing gear to fishing households; inadequate timing of provision of fishing gear to fishing households; insufficient training in cage culture; and insufficient exchange of common fishing experience. It seems that at Nam Ngum Reservoir adverse and undesired activities take place at significant level, and that the level of organization and extension service for local fishing associations gives ample scope for improvement. These issues have been taken into consideration while designing the Reservoir Fisheries Development and Management Plan for Nakai Reservoir. 24.7.3 Zoning and Regulations Fishers will quickly learn the fishing skills and the beha viour of fish. They will know in which part of the reservoir to get the highest catch and which time of the day and year to get them . They will also become skilled in applying the gear most efficiently. Whereas th is is ideal for any fisher, the interest of the entire fishing community calls for regulati ons on how, when and where to fi sh. This interest is based on obtaining and maintaining a sustainable yield so also fishers in the future will be able to benefit from the fisheries resources. 24.7.3.1 Indicative Fishery Zonation To manage the reservoir resources and protect the technical structures of the hydropower installations it is necessary to design and agree on specific zones for the Nakai Reservoir. Zoning of the future Nakai Reservoir may be an important tool that will enable the reservoir manage rs to regularly adjust protection measures and decide on a number of site-specific interventions. The establishment and surveillance of sanctuaries, in combination with a possible short term or seasonal fishing moratorium, is vital for securing the survival of the reservoir's fish stock which ot herwise would become rapidly depleted if continual fishing would be allowed in areas of high fish concentration, especially during dry season. Production and protection zones should be identified, based on the following criteria: data from hydro-biological and fisheries surveys and other research information, to ensure adequate size, location and nature of fish sanctuaries to sus tain production and naturally replenish fish stocks; sufficient fish production for nearby fishing communities; distance from resettlement sites, to reduce fishing effort costs; distance from main landing site; limiting loss of fishing gear (e.g. entangling of nets) in submerged trees, and avoid fish loss due to \"ghost fishing\" effect; providing access and opport unities for fishing; facilitate navigation activities; security considerations; reflect practicalities relating to verification and surveillance; and maintenance work and protect technical installations. Likewise, the period where certain activities will be al lowed in each designated zo ne will be determined in accordance to the above criteria. This will lead to the establishment of a number of sanctuaries and the introduction of site-specific fishing moratoria. The established reservoir and its immediate surroundings can indicatively be divide d into four major areas, which could form a basis for zonation of recommended fishing activities. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 391. The 'main reservoir' zone is the area upstream from Ban Thalang, receiving some 85 % of the water flowing into the Nakai Reservoir: This zone will be subject to high inflow rate of good water quality, short retention time, and wi nd- and wave action. Few islands w ill remain in this area at FSL. This part of the reservoir should be open for fishing . However, deep pools from the original bed of Nam Theun and wetlands might host high numbers of fish during the dry season; therefore a restriction should be put on fishing in these areas. 2. The 'western reservoir' zone between the narrow neck at Ban Thalang and the dam site. This area has some deeper sections (> 20 m) and at FSL an average depth of 11 meters. Many islands and isthmus areas will remain even during FSL. As this area is more densely vege tated, residual biomass may result in higher biodegrad ation rate after submer gence. This zone will receive 15 % of the water flowing into the reservoir by tributaries. Being more protected against winds and with deeper water depth, this water body will experience less mixin g. During 8 months per year of stratification of the reservoir, the hypolimnion will not have favourable water quality for aquatic life. The hypolimnion forms a significant part of the water volume in this area of the reservoir. There is risk of growth of submerged water plants. The area w ill be part of the corrido r between two National Biodiversity Conservation Areas. A few sites will ha ve sufficient water throughout the year to allow fishing (see page 22). 3. The 'Nam Malou' zone forms an appendix to the reservoir. The area is a relatively isolated embayment that is linked to the second zone by a narrow neck at the point where the Nam Malou flows into the reservoir. The entire area is shallow (average 6 m). It will fall dry for a long period each year. Fishing could be permitted in this area. 4. The 'northern tributary embayments' , where the various tributaries to the north and east of the reservoir, including the Nam Theun, flow into the main basin. This zone will likely develop into important spawning areas and corridors for upstream migrating fish at the beginning of the rainy season. It is therefore recommended that fishing is not permitted in this zone. The zoning process needs to take into account the surface morphology (partly hilly) and the large seasonal fluctuations in the rese rvoir level, resulting in an estimated 350 km 2 of drawn down area developing at the end of the dry season. This temporary zonation should be agreed and established before inundation. Nevertheless, the zonation will be updated 2-3 years after dam closure based on identification of fish species and ecology, and fishing gear used once the fish population is established. The criteria for establishment of fish sanctuaries shall include: surveillance practicalities; far distance from settlements; high degree of durable vegetation left; and high degree of emerging vegetation that will impede navigation and setting of nets. Downstream from the Nakai Plateau - in the Nam Theun / Nam Kading an d its tributaries - each village has established its own fishing zone and fish sanctuary. Fishers take responsibility for enforcing fishing rules and regulations in their own village fishing zone. Outsiders are allowed to fi sh in village zones, but are fined when fishing rules and regulations are not respected. Destructive fisheries in the Nam Theun / Nam Kading watershed are only noticed outside villa ge fishing zones, where peer control does not function because of a lack of sense of ownership. Such fishing rules and regulations relating to stretches of river are actually fairly common throughout Lao PDR. The challenge will be to develop such a system to be effective in a reservoir. Thus in addition to the macro-zonation of the Nakai Reservoir, it may be required to further divide the reservoir into village fishing zones. Each riparian v illage or group of villages w ill establish their own fish sanctuaries at incoming tributaries and will be responsible for enforcement of fishing rules and regulations within their fishing zone. Village fishing zones and fish sanctuaries will be de marcated. If such peer Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 40control is an effective tool for the enforcement of fish ing rules and regulations, it will be both sustainable and cost-saving on additional patrolling by th e Watershed Management Protection Agency. As some relocated villages will not ha ve easy access to the reservoir in the dry season the demarcation of the village fishing zone should be draw n in full agreement wi th the villagers. To demarcate the boundaries of the NT2Watershed/N BCA, reservoir village fishing areas and fish sanctuaries, signs need to be located. In the deeper parts of the reservoir, an 8 meter or a 14 meter long concrete pole with a sign may be needed. An 8 meter long concrete pole costs USD 75 and a 14 meter long pole costs USD 360. Other demarcations may consis t of wooden poles with a sign, signed trees, or painted rocks. Equipment and instal lation costs of demarc ation are roughly estimated at USD 32,500. Management of Protect ed Zones will reduce (i) depletion of n atural resources by households who are hunting or gathering, or (ii) exploitation of forest resources for boat building and preparation of fishing gear. For boat building and preparation of fishing gear, areas should be allocated for fishing households to obtain timber, tree branches, bamboo, reeds, resin and brushes. By zoning of land uses, areas can be identified for relocated villages to collect (i) timber for house and boat building, (ii) fuel wood, and (iii) material for preparation of fishing gear. The Reservoir Management Authorities (WMPA, NTPC, RFO, RMU/EMU) together with the relocated villages will be responsible for zoning and demarcation of village areas and fish sanctuaries. Repair and maintenance for the signs related to the NT2Wat ershed/NBCA will be the responsibility of WMPA. Repair and maintenance of the villag e fishing zones and the fish sanctu aries will be the responsibility of the VFGs. 24.7.3.2 Access to the Fisheries Resources and Licensing All villagers resident in the 14 reloca ted villages will be eligible to obtain the right to fish in the reservoir. Those villagers in the two non-relocated villages who traditionally ha ve used the natural resources in the area will also be eligible. After inundation in 2008, the total number of eligible households is estimated to be 1,161 (see Table 24-5 page 22). Based on various experience from other national re servoirs the Department of Livestock and Fisheries (MAF) favours a system of fishing pe rmits that would only allow registered fishers to utilize the aquatic resources of the future Nakai Reservoir. The advantages of such a system are obvious: A permit system will create return s, although it is recommended to consider a scaled system over the first years starting with a small fee reflecting the lower catch. At a later stage it may be worth considering a classified system based on th e catch records of different fisher groups. Knowing the exact number of fishes, including their means of operation and registered catch capacity, allows better planning for regulations and catch quota. Registering the restricted use of fish resources wo uld ensure that those people being affected by relocation would be the only direct beneficiaries. Devising a system with well-visible license number s or plates on the fishing boats would facilitate patrolling and make enforcement more efficient. The disadvantage of a license system is the relative large bureaucratic ef fort to implement, and the initial difficulties of local people to unde rstand and accept a permit system that is against their traditional practice. Both aspects need to be addressed in the resettlement program combined with an awareness campaign to explain the requisites for fisheries ma nagement, emphasizing the need of controls and surveillance. It is recommended to consider a license fee for all ty pes of recreational fishing activities in the Nakai Reservoir. Applicants for any type of aquaculture and research 16 in the Nakai Reservoir shall also obtain a license. 16 Exempted are the regular monitoring program conducted by NTEC and the WMPA Wildlife Program. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 41 The licensing system should be gear-based so larger and more effective gear would require higher fees being paid. The fishing, fish collection and navigation li censes will be issued to elig ible persons in line with the policies and system recommended by the PAF O and WMPA. The fishing, fish collection and navigation licenses should be obtainable in the Main Fisheries Management Office as well as in the Sub- Offices at the landing sites. Permits for research are to be obtained through the WMPA and/or PAFO offices. The licence fees would be used to pay for surveilla nce and fisheries regulati ons enforcement of the reservoir as well as for the management authority. People from the resettled community could be selected for surveillance-related jobs. All fee establishment and management arrangements should be determined through consultation with those who would be involved in fishing in the reservoir. The Reservoir Management Authority, or one of it s member agencies (RFO), will be responsible for consultation with households for the registration of boats and the licensing of fishing in the reservoir. All data of license applicants, together with gear used and relevant persona l particulars will be stored in the RFO fisheries information system. 24.7.3.3 Indicative Rules and Regulations The fisheries management plan needs to avoid over-fishing in the reservoir to avoid a situation as in Nam Ngum Reservoir, where there has been an unlimited influx of people. Nam Ngum Reservoir fishers presently need more than triple the amount of gillnets than in the late 1980s to catch the same amount of fish. When catch per unit of effort decreases, fi shers spend more money and labour to catch the same amount of fish. Due to increased fishing efforts, the size of fish caught also decreases. This example illustrates that when appropriate rese rvoir fisheries management is not in place, revenues from reservoir fisheries and net income of fishing households move into a downward spiral. Thus the need for rules and regulations, and their actual enforcement. The households that have obtained licenses should fish according to basic reservoir fishing rules and regulations. Such rules and regulations need to includ e the prohibition of destructive fishing practices, such as; use of explosives and poisons; electrical fishing; motorized trawling or push netting; blocking off fish migration to and from streams and rivers by dams, fences or nets (i.e. maintaining fish sanctuaries); and emptying pools and ponds by pumping or by using buckets. The rules and regulations will also refer to the non- access of unregistered and unlicensed fishers to the reservoir, and a prohibition of the hunting of other fauna in and around the reservoir, unless specifically permitted. Within each fishing zone, specific rules and regulati ons will be formulated to address issues such as: closed fishing season; restrictions on type, size, and amount of fishing gear; and restrictions on the catch of certain aquatic species, such as turtles (Pba Fa), otters, and aquarium fish. The responsibility for formulation of these reservoir fi shing rules and regulations will rest jointly with the WMPA, the RMU, and the fishing households. The WMPA will also be responsible for fishing activities inside the NBCAs by villagers, to ensure .limited im pact of these activities on the downstream reservoir fisheries. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 42 Villagers in the NT2 Watershed / NBCAs shou ld not receive reservoir fishing licenses. Regulations regarding land based ac tivities related to fisheries will also be required. For example, appropriate management of agricultur al activities together with polluti on control will limit drainage of fertilizers and pesticides into the reservoir. It will al so avoid potential pollution from intensive livestock raising in the drawdown zone an d on the edges of the reservoir. Forestry management will reduce landslides on steep slopes, erosion and rapid run off, resulting in minimization of reservoir sedimentation. To specifically avoid eutrofication of the reservoir, pollu tion control will also need to address the potential impacts on the reservoir of domestic wastewater, tourism development, and cage culture of fish. Eutrofication of the reservoir could result in the proliferation of floating or submerged aquatic vegetation, adversely affecting power generation as well as fisheries. A separate water quality monitoring program, including pollution control, will propose management activities to su stain high reservoir water quality and healthy fisheries. 24.7.3.4 Enforcement of Regulations While enforcement by an authority and its staff is the usual method of enforcement, peer control is possibly a better and more effective alternative to the costly enforcement of rules and regulations by police and military. At present, peer control has prov en to be successful at do wnstream locations in the Nam Theun / Nam Kading and its tributaries, where each village has its own fishing zone. If approved by the fishing community this model could be used at the reservoir as well. Villagers often feel the need to call on support from government au thorities. Villagers usually find it difficult to impose sanctions on fellow villagers. Hartmann and Campelo (1998) found in Brazil that the most common support needed by fishers from the government related to enforcement of fishing regulations. Thus , if the model does not meet support among fishers a reservoir wide model s hould be applied. This will involve mutual control and enforcement at village level backed up by the local auth orities (DAFO, local police). 24.7.3.5 Fisheries before and during Construction To allow the entrance of as many fish species and as many fish to the Nakai Plateau, the two following recommendations are made. If destructive fisheries are still goin g on at the Nakai Plateau, then this should be stopped as early as possible (preferably even before construction phase) through awareness campaigns and enforcement in a collaboration between government agencies and the pr oject. Permissible fishing practices should be popularised from the start of the project with awareness campaigns. During construction, workers of the construction camps should not be allowed to fish in the neighbourhood of the dam site or on the Naka i Plateau. Dynamite will be available at the construction sites and its use would need to be carefu lly controlled to prevent blast fishing. 24.7.4 Organisational Framework The organization chart in Figure 24-11 shows the linkag es between village fishers and the other groups or agencies concerned with reservoi r management or utilisation. Village Fishing Groups (VFG) Assistance and support will be provided to develop an d strengthen Village Fisher Groups. All members of a village who are engaging in part time or full time commercial fishing will be required to be a member of a VFG. Subsistence fishers can opt for membership as well. The VFG will manage village fisheries revolving fund s (e.g. for outboard motors), be responsible for maintenance of fish landing paces and for the dissemination of rules and regulations regarding reservoir fishers. This will include responsibilities specific to th e management of any reserv oir zone allocated to a particular village to manage. All reservoir fisheries development and management init iatives should be made in consultation with the VFGs. Regular meetings will be held before, during and after the dam construc tion to incorporate the views and problems raised by the reservoir community. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 43 Figure 24-11: Organisation Chart for Reservoir and Fisheries Co-management. Reservoir Fishers Association Support in terms of advice will be given to establish an association of the reservoir fishers, made up of each VFG. This association will represent full time, pa rt time and subsistence fishers. The association will form the link between the fishers, the Government authorities managing the reservoir, and the NTPC. It will form a small secretariat and receive contributions from the fishers for administrative purposes. There should be regular elections for the secretariat. An important and early activity for the association is to formulate fishing rules and regulations together with the RFMO and the Reservoir Management Division within the Watershed Management and Protection Authority. Zoning and demarcation of village fi shing zones and village fish sanctuar ies will be a joint effort between the Village Reservoir Fisheries Association, the RFMO and RMD. Reservoir Fisheries Management Office (RFMO) The District Resettlement Workin g Groups will form RFMO within DAFO. RFMO will work and cooperate closely with the Reservoir Management Division of the WMPA. The RFMO will be responsible for infrastructure and mana gement of basic fisheries facilities such as loans and credits. Infrastructure includes design and constr uction of fish landing places. Other responsibilities of RFMO, in close cooperation with fishing households and the Reservoir Fisheries Association, VFGs, and WMPA, include: formulation of fishing rules and regulations; registration and licensing of fishing households and household members; contribute to demarcation of village fishing zones and fish sanctuaries; monitoring of daily fish catch; and training and awareness creation. Watershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA) The Watershed Management and Protection Authority is responsible for the management of the NT2 Watershed/NBCAs, including the corridor (the wester n reservoir zone). One of the major tools for successful protected area management is the identification of buffer zones and the subsequent management of resource use in these zones. The Nakai Reservoir will be a priority area for buffer zone management. Management of access of fishers to the reservoir, and zonation and demarcation will form a major role in buffer zone management. Nakai District Governor/CabinetReservoir Management Authority EONTPC Tourism WMPA Reservoir Fishers Association Wild + Plant Life ConservationVillage Fishers GroupsDAFO Reservoir Fisheries Management Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 44 In close cooperation with the RFMO, RFA and the VFGs, the Reservoir Management Division of WMPA will carry out the following reservoi r fisheries management activities: zoning and demarcation of the NT2 Watershed/NBCA and corridor; assist in formulation of fishing rules and regulations; monitoring of land and water use, water-weeds and other flora development; and coordinating and disseminating the information gained from water quality and hydro-meteorological networks of the NTPC. NTPC Following filling and throughout the operation peri od, the Nam Theun 2 Power Company (NTPC) will be responsible for: reservoir inflow measurement and rainfall measurement; reservoir outflow planning and measurement; water quality monitoring; measurement of sedimentation rate; clearing debris from areas adjacent to the dam and intake structures; and animal rescue. It is expected that the resettler villagers will play a key role in this task as both labour and guides. Human Resources The provision of training for villagers and RMU/DR WG staff at various stages of the co-management process will be an important factor in its successf ul implementation (see Section 24.7.8 below for an outline of expected training of fishers and government staff). However, co-management is by no means a panacea to all problems and difficulties of fisheries management. Co-management largely depends on the attitude and capacity of staff of the involved agenci es. The willingness of staff to work in the field and good communication skills of staff with resettled households are crucial fa ctors for the success of reservoir fisheries management. 24.7.5 Managing the Fish Species Diversity during and after Impoundment The native fish fauna is highly specialized, with 18% of endemics (Kottelat, 1996). These species will certainly come under significant st ress with the dramatic changes in th e aquatic system. The problem will be compounded if exotic fish enter the system, as these usually tend to be much better adapted to reservoir conditions. These species will not only comp ete for food and habitat, they will disturb the indigenous ichthyofauna in many wa ys, and they certainly will also intr ude into the watershed tributaries where ecological damage will contin ue. Unfortunately, there is no sc ientific analysis on the specific impacts of newly introduced species in comparable reservoirs. Training the DAFO staff and launching awareness campaigns among the resettlement villages would be the appropriate measures to control the introduction of exotic fish species in the first years. It is anticipated that a special study will be carried out once bio-productivity and fish stocks have come to a stabilized stage (3-5 years after impoundment) that will identify the possibilities and potential impacts of newly introduced exotic species. In summary, the following management options have been selected to maintain the fish species diversity: allow maximum number of fish species to enter the reservoir basin before closure, i.e. schedule dam closure at the peak of the rainy season; Regularly monitor the fish species biodiversity an d the gradual adjustment and evolution of single species17, and adjust accordingly the management options; 17 Referring to the experience from Na m Ngum Reservoir, where a small freshwater clupeid became the dominant species. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 45 Enhance known fish habitats in sanctuaries, e.g. by inserting permanent brush parks or collecting boulders in locations close to an inflowing tributary; Control the introduction of non-endemic fish species; and Allow (at least during the first decade) cage culture of only endemic species in the reservoir such as Tor, Bagarius, and Mystis. 24.7.6 Introduction of Species There are at least 31 fish species presently living in the Nam Theun that are likely to establish populations in the Nakai Reservoir (see Annex 24-2). This is a su fficient basis for a healthy fishery and there is no reason to introduce exotic fish species. The potential benefit for such an introduction is by far outweighed by the potential threat of diseas es and decline in biodiversity. 24.7.7 Monitoring of Fish Catch and Adaptive Management Planning With consistent monitoring, an adaptive management of aquatic resource use will make it possible to guarantee the sustainab ility of the fisheries. For appropriate fisher ies management it is essential to monitor fish catch by species and quantity by fisher, time and location of fishing, as well as per fishing method and gear. Of each fish species, at least the number of fish in the catch and the size and weight of each fish will need to be monitored by sub-sampling. If the life cycl e of each fish species is known, monitoring data will form the foundation for proposals for adaptive management interventions to guarantee sustainable fisheries. Fishers develop a knowledge base through their daily fisheries experience, observation and \"monitoring\". Such a knowledge base may include valuable information regarding fish catch, fish species composition of catch, fish migration, wildlife and vegetation, biod iversity, hydrological regi me and water quality. The knowledge base existing in communities is very valuable for the formulation of fisheries management interventions, including protection measures for aqu atic habitats. Monitoring of fish catch by fishers themselves is often much more reliable than monitoring by specific data collectors. Fishing households can fill in forms, recording their da ily catch, which fish species, what si ze, and what weight. By providing fishers with measuring tapes, scales, photo flipcharts of fish species, paper and pencils, daily household fish catch can be monitored. Not only should fishers be asked to fill in the forms they should also be involved in the design of forms as scientists and technicians are likely to omit issues which are relevant from the resource users' point of view. If fishers also give information on where and how fish are caught and with what amount of fishing gear, sufficient info rmation will be provided to measure the total fishing effort and to arrive at an estima te of the reservoir fish yield. At Nakai Plateau, however, illiteracy is high. Not all fishing households w ill be able to fill in fish catch monitoring forms on a daily basis. Therefore, fish catch needs to be monitored by (i) selected fishing households, (ii) members of VFGs, an d (iii) fish traders. Additional interviews with remaining fishing households will enable extrapolation of selected monitored fish catc h data to the whole reservoir. If necessary, Lao language training and basic adult education will be offered to those involved in monitoring and other fisheries management activities. 24.7.8 Training and Awareness Creation To avoid over-fishing, a cautious approach needs to be taken by firstly setting a target or quota for realistic annual reservoir fish yields, and then convincing fishing households of the reservoir community to limit their fishing efforts to this target, in order for them to be cost effective. Thus, training and awareness raising of the fishing co mmunity will be important management to ols for the maintena nce of catch per unit effort and income of relocated households, as well as general management of the reservoir and its fishery. Also Government staff from various agenci es involved in the fish eries management will be offered training. The following training courses are anticipated for the fishers. Initially, a training needs assessment should be carried out to assess the actual knowledge and skills on fishing and fisheries management. Formation of Village Fishing Groups (including Communication Skills and Working Procedures); Formation of Reservoir Fisheries Association; Boat Building, Operation and Maintenance; Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 46 Fishing Gear and Techniques, and the operation and maintenance; Reservoir Fisheries Management (including Sustainable Fishing Practices and Conflict Resolution); and Fish Catch Monitoring. Training courses envisaged fo r Government staff include: English Language and Computer Skills; Fisheries and Fish Biology in the Nakai Reservoir; Catch Monitoring and Applied Fisheries Research; Fish Disease Identification and Control; Surveillance, Patrolling and Enforcement; Community Development and Participatory Approaches; and Fish Catching Skills. Also this list needs revision once the collaborating staff has been identified and an assessment of their training needs has been made. 24.7.9 Research and Development The research and development component is coordinated with the WMPA and Environment Management Unit (EMU). Biological research activities will include i. Fish ecology and breeding patterns to be used for updating the zonation and regulations; ii. Aquaculture feasibility studies, incl uding fish culture in cages, cult ure of prawns and mussels. Actual aquaculture activities should not commence befo re licensing by the WMPA and not until the reservoir has matured. iii. Feasibility analysis on the construction of weirs at inlets and their possible interference with the availability of water quant ity to the powerhouse. iv. Immediately after inundation of the reservoir, a m onitoring program should be undertaken to assess if pelagic fish species are establishing fish populations. If not, the stocking of Pba Keo from the Nam Ngum Reservoir could be considered as a sound alternative. Research on the socio-ec onomic and institutional side should include v. Cost-benefit analysis of the fishery for various types of fishing households, and vi. The performance of the fisheries co-managemen t. An outcome will be recommendation to ensure enhanced involvement of the fishers in d ecision making on reservoir related issues. 24.8 WORK PLAN AND BUDGET 24.8.1 Work Plan Activities and Staff Scheduling The Reservoir Fisheries Development and Management Plan covering de velopment of fisheries livelihood options as well as development of reservoir fisheries management is presented and discussed in the present report. The activities to be implemented are presented in a time schedule in Chapter 27. The work plan distinguishes between: office construction and installation. formation of local management bodies; training of fishers as well as Government staff; zoning and regulation; credit facilitation; monitoring; and research and development; and aquaculture activities, if required; Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 47Staff required for these activities include Government staff as well as Technical Assistance seconded by NTPC. An indicative time schedule is given for the staff positions. 24.8.2 Budget A total of US$ 500,000 has been allocated for the Rese rvoir Fisheries Development Program, and this will be used to fund activities as summarized in Table 24-11 below. Cost estimates are made for the management of the reservoir and fisheries over a period of 5 years (before, during and after dam construction). Year 1 is the completion of the dam and start of inundation. Year 2 is the completion of reservoir inundation and therefore the Commercial Op eration Date (COD). The full budget is presented in Chapter 28. Table 24-11: Summary of Annual Budget Allocati on for Reservoir Fisheries Development from Various Budget Lines.

A field survey was carried out 8-13 June 2 002 by the following three participants: Lee, Phaylee Vongsouk, Technician, NTEC; Khamphet Roger, Officer, Dept. of Fisheries, Min. of Agriculture & Forestry; Michael Mastaller, Fisher ies Consultant, NTEC. Methodology applied Structured interviews were conducte d following the outline given below. 1 Fishing tradition and possession of boats History of village - fami ly tradition as fishers Total number of households Number of fishing boats Number of total outboard engines (hp, operation condition) Main fishing areas 2 Fishing methods and main species caught Which family members are involved Fishing efforts: Schedule, number of people involved per fishing effort Seasonal fishing effort and harvest Main species caught Minor aquatic species collected, incl. specific methods 3 Fishing being livelihood component Average monthly catch Estimate of proportion consumed / sold Average monthly income from fishing sales 4 Marketing Aspects Products sold, local prices paid by middl emen to fishers, as per different fish Spoil of fish Traditional processing Direct sale, to whom Sale and dependency on middlemen Women's involvement in fi sh processing and trade 5 Concerns and Problems / Perception of villagers Observations on fish ecology / trends in stock development and perceived causes Is CPUE decreasing due to environmental changes Is catch decreasing due to man-made im pacts (e.g. destructive fishing methods) Theft of gear, accidents, drowning records Other concerns 6 Perception of the NT2 Project , in relation to additional income opportunities from fishing Account on former contacts by NTEC personnel, verification of consultation Has this particular household been as ked about its preferences (e.g. fishing) Perception of catch diversification and establishment of sanctuaries Perception/ prospects of becoming involved in fisheries development program Information and facilitation need s to train household/fishermen Interest and willingne ss to become engaged in aquaculture program Main prospects and concerns in view of the NT2 Project Rapid Appraisal Methods were applied by contacting village head and/or his deputy, and by simultaneously inviting the present neighbour househo lds (both men and women) who regularly engage in fishing. Apart from the interviews held with the villa ge chiefs, information was also collected by: Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 51 visual inspection of the village, inspection / demonstration of fish ing gear used by villagers demonstration / explanation of species caught, including CPUE verification of ongoing fishing activities in the field, species encountered on fish markets and during transport Findings from the survey covering seven villages are presented below. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 52 Name of Village: Sop Phene Field visit on: 09-06-02 Name of Village Chief or Representative: Mr. Don 1 Fishing tradition and possession of boats History of village - ethnic distribution Old village, all families belong to Bo ethnic Total number of households, fa milies, population 52 HH, 45 families Number of fishing boats Number of total outboard engines (hp, condition) / Main fishing areas Up-and downstre am near village, max 5 km distance, at no distinct customary location) 2 Fishing methods and main species caught Which family members are involved Everybody goes fishin g after having completed work in garden/ paddy fields Fishing efforts: Schedule, # of people involved per fishing effort Men go fishing with boats using (I) gill nets, (ii) h ook and long line, (iii) cast nets; some go from time to time in nearby swamps to collect frogs and small aquatic animals Seasonal fishing effort and harvest People mostly engage in upland rice cultivation, after 3 or 4 p.m. they go fishing to Nam Theun River, Main fishing methods used The fishing methods described in this village ar e more or less identical to those employed in all other villages visited in the Nakai Plateau Gear is described in order of importance and harvest : Gill Net: average 50x2.5 m, Japanese Nylon and Polythene, mesh size 1 to 1.5 cm, sheets are bought in Thakhet; Main species caught are carps and catfish, pangasius, bagriids Hook & Line: 1 mm nylon line, many lines are set overnight (sunset/sunrise) parallel over a bamboo pole fixed in river bank, each line ca 100 m lo ng, fitted with single hook (purchased) size # 14 to 7; Bait are small live fish, frogs, earthworms, no floater used; Main fish caught are large (sale) predatory fish like Clarias, Pangasius, Mystis, Tor Fish Traps: Cone-like long baskets (1 m) with narrow trapping collar. Traps are inserted either in specially constructed fences damming shallow waters, swamplands, irrigation channels and outlets of rice fields. Main species caught are air-breathin g fish living in paddy fiel ds (e.g. snakeheads) and eels. Hand-operated lift net: Fine-mesh-sized sheet of about 1 m2 is mounted with 4 strings to a pole of 2-3 m length. The sheet is submerged and cautiously lifted in regular in tervals. No bait is placed in the sheet. The lift net is operated mostly by wome n and children in shallo w waters, paddy fields, small creeks and pools, during daytime and in early evening hours. Cast Net: used occasionally only, former generations ha d used this type more. Net is self-made out of nylon filament, rim fitted with small iron chain. Cast nets diameter vary according to place of use ((shallowness) fro 3 to 6 m. Main fish caught are small cyprinids and all kind of small swampland Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 53 fish. Fish narcotics and explosives are not used Frog Traps: Basket-like traps made out of bamboo (30 cm length), with narrow collar that is smeared with fish chop to attract frogs into trap. Used predominantly in wet season in shallow swamp depressions. Traps are exposed during night time and collected early next morning. One person sets 30-50 such traps. Shell collection : Performed only occasionally by women. Species collected in river banks (sandy shallow banks, using a rake) are freshwater mussels. Main species caught Catfish in paddy fiel ds (traps), carps in river net fishing,; each river-fisherman catches about 4-5 kg consumable fish/day (with gill net, set at sunset and lifted at sunrise, 6.a.m.) Minor aquatic species collected, incl. methods Frog s (wooden, baited basket traps), or manual catch 3 Fishing being livelihood component Average monthly catch and estimated income from fishing sales n.a. Estimate of proportion consumed / sold 40% / 60% 4 Marketing Aspects Products sold Some 40% of catch is sold, 60% consumed by HH spoil of fish none Traditional processing Dried fish (hun g on string, sun dried, sometimes salt and/or natural insect repellent added) Direct sale, to whom To one middlemen coming regularly/da ily, if weather condition allows, per motorcycle from Nakai Sale and dependency on middlemen Only very few take loan from middlemen (insignificant number) Women's involvement in fish processing an d trade Only women sell to middlemen; women often bargain price set seasonally by mid dlemen 5 Concerns and Problems Observations on fish ecology / trends in stock development and perceived causes Ecological river conditions remain unchanged good with regard to water quality over the past 40 years. At this time, harvest for subsistence was su fficiently managed by cast netting. There is no observation that the sizes of fish caught are not diminishing; equally there is no indication that the species composition has changed over the past decades. Is CPUE increasing due to environmental changes Yes, harvesting similar amount needs now 30-50% longer time Is catch decreasing due to man-made impacts (e.g. destructive fishing methods) First reason: too much competition due to increased no. of population Second: formerly fish was exclusively caught for consumption, now there is increasing demand for fish on sale and transport to markets Explosives were reportedly (occasionally) used by loggers at the time they were operating in the area. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 54 Theft of gear Almost unknown Accidents, drowning records No records 6 Perception of the NT2 Project, in relation to additional income oppo rtunities from fishing Account on former contacts by NTEC personnel, verification of consultation Consultation took place, first in 2000, then in 2001, where 5 hous eholds expressed th eir strong wish to take up fishing activities under the RAP. 15 HH want to engage in livestock, 25 are yet undecided. Has this particular household been asked about its preferences (e.g. fishing) Yes, however only few households in this village ha ve already decided to take up fishing as major activity. Main concern is lack of skill - vill ager demand training and gear (outboards) Perception of catch diversification and establishment of sanctuaries Not expressed, needs to be explained Perception of becoming involved in fisheries organization program Need to be informed first about details and op tions; Villagers were told that there will be a \"Fisheries Committee\" who will provide training. Interest and willingness to become engaged in aquaculture program Villagers know about \"training centre\" in Nam Ngum Project, which they want to visit. There is interest once training is supplied. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 55 Name of Village: Thalang (= Signo) Field visit on: 09-06-02 Name of Village Chief or Representative: Xiang Keo Khamphila 1 Fishing tradition and possession of boats History of village - ethnic di stribution After-war settlement for refugees of different ethn ic groups, established in 1988 at Nam Theun River crossing \"bridge\" site. Note: the entire area bears significant marks from bombing, and half- shells of bombs are commonly used as trough for on ion cultivation. Total number of household s, families, population 57 HH, 58 families, 310 persons Number of fishing boats 57 ( needs to be verified !) Number of total outboard engines (hp, operation condition) 5-11 hp Honda, total number in village: ca 25 (village chief has one HONDA 11 hp). Main fishing areas Up-and downstream near village, max 5 km distance ,at no distinct customary location) 2 Fishing methods and main species caught Which family members are involved Everybody goes fishing after having completed work in garden / paddy fields. Fishing is perfo rmed without arrangement who is \"allowed\" to fish where. Everybody chooses daily his new place, max. 5 km away from village. Fishing efforts: Schedule, # of people involved per fishing effort Men go fishing with boats using (I) gill nets, (ii) hook and long line, (iii) cast nets during dry season only; some go from time to time in nearby sw amps to collect frogs and small aquatic animals Two gill net have been observed in the village with 9 resp. 12 cm mesh size, the latter being 100 m long. Net mending is made by men only. Seasonal fishing effort and harvest Fishing makes some 50% of daily activities Main species caught Catfish in paddy fi elds (traps), carps in river net fishing Minor aquatic species collected, incl. methods Frog s (wooden, baited basket traps), or manual catch 3 Fishing being livelihood component Average monthly catch and estimated income from fish sales n.a., income may be in the range of 100.000 -350.000 Kip/month Estimate of proportion consumed / sold Not quantifiable: At certain days almost all is consumed, while on other days a major p art is sold to middlemen. 4 Marketing Aspects Products sold Spoil of fish Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 56 Traditional processing Cat fish is dried fish (hung on stri ng, sun dried, sometimes salt and/or natural insect repellent added); Fish fermenting (4-6 months in jar, wet-salted), when mixed with sticky ri ce, used by locals while working in farmlands; generally, all processed fish is not sold. Direct sale, to whom 5 different middlemen from Lak Sao vi siting the village, daily, 2-3 at regular intervals from Nakai (during dry season). Sale and dependency on middlemen Only very few take loan from middlemen (insignificant number) Women's involvement in fish processing and trade Only women sell to middlemen; Fish are sold to customary middlemen, but there i s n o \" b u y e r obligation\". Prices are market/demand driven. Women often bargain price set seasonally by middlemen e.g. catfish 7.000 Kip/kg, carp 5.000 Ki p/kg. During dry season, these prices increase to catfish 10.000-15.000 Kip/kg, carp 7.000-8.000 Kip/kg (last season prices) 5 Concerns and Problems Observations on fish ecology / trends in stock development and perceived causes There is no regulation, there is also no regulation about mesh size for different type of gear. Fishermen do not know or appreciate regulation to confine fishing to certain areas or period. Is CPUE increasing due to environmental changes More catch effort is perceived, when compared to say 10-20 years ago Is catch decreasing due to man-made impacts (e.g. destructive fishing methods) First reason: too much competition due to increased no. of population Second: Since 1988 there is increasing demand for fish on sale and transport to markets Third. There are more middlemen coming to Thalang than say 10 years ago.

One villager demonstrated his self-mad e harpoon after having seen a similar model in Thakhek market. An elder villager recalls his fathers using \"kan phu\" roots for stunning fish in small pools and creeks. Main species caught Catfish in paddy fields (traps), mainly for sale (10.000 Kip in dry season/ 6.000 Kip in wet season); carps gill-netted in river mainly for elf-consumption Minor aquatic species collected, incl. methods Frog s (wooden, baited basket traps), or manual catch 3 Fishing being livelihood component Average monthly catch and estimated income from fish sales Between 1.5 and 5 kg/day in average. The largest catch ever reported by one fisherman was approximately 25 kg/night. The average income pe r month is estimated by fishermen as 300.000 to 500.000 Kip during both dry and wet season, (less ha rvest in dry season is compensated by higher prices) Estimate of proportion consumed / sold 75-90% 4 Marketing Aspects Products sold Only occasionally large catfish Spoil of fish n.a.

Fish Species Recorded in Nam Theun Observed in Nam Ngum Reservoir Observed in Reservoirs in N-E Thailand Adaptability to Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 68Fish Species Recorded in Nam Theun Observed in Nam Ngum Reservoir Observed in Reservoirs in N-E Thailand Adaptability Bernacsek, 1997). Key: * Species are only known from downstream of the inundation area Species not observed in reservoir Species present in reservoir - Unlikely to adapt to reservoir conditions -- Not adaptable to reservoir conditions + May adapt to reservoir conditions ++ Adaptable to reservoir conditions An extensive fish survey of the Nam Theun/Nam Kadi ng by Maurice Kottelat was carried out during the dry season. Since fish species composition of fish ca tch changes with the season , it should be assumed that the total estimated number of fish species (according to this survey) that can adapt to reservoir conditions is a minimum estimate. The fish species identified in Nam Ngum Reservoir and in reservoirs in Northeast Thailand have not been identified with updated taxonomic names. In both Thailand and for the Nam Ngum Reservoir, fish surveys mostly used outdated taxonomic names for fish species. Only those fish species occurring in Nam Ngum and Thai reservoirs with the same names as used by Kottelat have been included in the table. From the table it can be concluded that a minimum of 31 fish species will be able to establish populations in Nakai Reservoir. Thus, there will be the potential for healthy reservoir fisherie s, without the need for releasing exotic fish species. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 69Annex 24-3: Extracts from Study on Fish Marketing Production and trends The construction of Nakai Reservoir is anticipated to generate a substantial natural fisheries resource, the RAP calls for the exclusive exploitation of this reso urce by resettled communities. The Reservoir Fisheries report estimates an annual reservoir fish catch of between 675,000 and 2,025,000 kg per annum with an average of 1,575,000 kg. This mid-range catch level equ ates to some 4.3 tons per day. Of this it is estimated that in 2009 some 1.1 tons will be consumed per day by fishing households leaving a surplus of 3.2 tons for sale. This equates to an annual sale of some 1,183 tons with a farm gate value in excess of USD 700,000 at Kip 6,000 per kilo 18. This value is considered to be below current farm gate prices for wild fish which are, on average some 9,500 kip per k ilo. At this, perhaps more realistic pricing level, projected annual production is lik ely to result in farm gate sa les in excess of US$ 1,000,000. Strong market demand exists for fish in Laos and indeed the sub-region as a whole. Natural fish stocks are unable to supply sufficient qua n t i t ie s to m e e t s uch dem a n d an d, a s a result, fish farming is developing rapidly in Laos. Most commercial-scale fish farming is undertaken using floating cage (usually for Tilapia) and pond (usually for catfish) culture techniques. Khammouane Province is no exception to the national trend and by 2002 there were a total of 377 fish cages in operation with a total stock of just under one million fish, mostly Tilapia. The co mmercial raising of pond catfish has also commenced in Khammouane with much of this, as well as the Tilapia, production being exported to Vientiane. Commercial scale aquaculture in Khammouane Province is now well established and continues to attract investment. Between FY 2001 and FY 2002 the number of fish ra ised through cage culture rose by some 80%19 indicating the strength of demand for even less preferred, cage raised fish. Market types A proportion of fish caught in the Mekong and the lower reaches of its tributaries are sold directly into the Thai market where prices, particularly for larger fi sh, are higher. The extent of such sales is hard to determine but occurs on a micro-level scale with individual Lao fisherman selling to their counterparts from Thailand as well as to on-shore buyers. No form al fish export structures currently exist in either Thakhek or Paksan for sales to Thailand. The marketing system for fish varies by location and at their most simple have fishing households directly selling their catch in local markets. In areas with pr oduction surplus traders from major market centres such as Thakhek will undertake daily purchase trips and either sell the fish to consumers directly or sell on to market based traders. Key nodes in the fish trade include bridges and ferry crossings (e.g. Old Mahaxai town). Fish prices appear to be highly variable by location with remoter locations having lower farm gate prices. Commercial fish farms sell at the farm gate to local retailers and also transport live fish to Vientiane markets for sale to retailers. In areas where significant catches occur, smaller an d lower value fish are frequently processed either though drying or fermenting into Padek . Prices and volumes There is a strong market preference for wild fish ov er cultivated fish, with wild fish commanding a substantial price premium. Wild fish prices per kilo are, on occasion, double that of farmed fish. CPI data on fish prices are difficult to interpret because species types are not clearly defined. It appears as though prices for farmed Tilapia have not increased over the last three years in Vientiane while in Thakhek they have actually fallen slightly. In cont rast, catfish has increased in price by 20 % in the last three years in Vientiane, and by 70 % in Thakhek although it is not clear if this is farmed or wild fish 20. 18 Average price used in the report is USD 0.6/kg. 19 Khammouane Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office, Statistics Department. 20 Given the centrality of fish in the Lao diet it is clearly impor tant that the NSC revise and clarify fish types in their upcom ing revision of their surv ey instruments. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 70Fish from Nam Ngum are viewed by some consumers as less tasty than river fish and as such the fish catch from Nakai Reservoir may not command market prices equivalent to that achieved by seasonal wild fish. Wild fish capture is seasonal in n ature and market prices reflect this. Fishermen in villages adjacent to the Nam Theun on th e Nakai Plateau are reported ly selling large fish for 8,000 kip/kg, substantially lower than the price of 20-25,000 kip/kg that such fish could command at the Thakhek market. Figure 24-12: Retail Comparisons, Dried Fish There is a strong tradition in lowland areas for processing of fish, most notably by drying and fermenting (to produce Padek ) . S m o k e d f i s h i s a l s o available in Thakhek markets but in lower quantities. Retail prices for dried and fermented fish show significant variation between Thakhek and Vientiane (see Figure 24-12 and Figure 24-13). Figure 24-13: Retail Price Co mparisons, Fermented Fish Table 24-13 below provides details on retail and farm ga te fish prices per kg in Thakhek. Prices clearly vary considerably by size and type with larger fish commanding higher prices. Fish with skin as opposed to scales are also preferred by consumers an d command higher retail and farm gate prices 21.

Table 24-14 provides an estimate of the total market for fish in Vientiane and Thakhek. Because of the nature of this data and the season during which it was gathered, total annual quantities indicated may be somewhat of an over-estimate of actual sales. Table 24-14: Estimates of Market Volume Estimated Market Estimating the scale of the Thakhek market for fresh fish is complex and varies substantially on a daily as well as seasonal basis. At time of study the scale of this market was estimated by fish traders to be in the region of 1-1.5 tons per day 22 for wild fish. Future scenarios The future Nakai Reservoir catch is predicted to be subs tantially higher than the present total sales of fish in Thakhek (1-2 tons per day). A significant development of marketing channels for Nakai produced fish can be predicted. Such channels are likely to develop apace with production levels. A small quantity of fish is currently being traded from certain Nakai plateau vi llages to larger market centres. Present traders may form the initial basis for the marketing of Nakai Reservoir fish when production develops. In the longer term it is anticipated that Nakai and/or Thakhek based traders will emerge specializing in the trade of Nakai Reservoir fi sh. There are a number of likely scenarios that may develop as a result of the substantial predicted natural fisheries in Nakai. (i) It is highly likely that Nakai fresh fish will be exported from Khammouane Province to Paksan, Savannakhet and possibly Vientiane. Sales across the border to Thailand are also likely if permitted by Lao and Thai authorities. Such exports could be on a relatively large scale. Because of the relatively small distances involved, fish could realistically be in th e Nakon Phanom market (Thailand) within six hours of capture. (ii) Given the scale of production envisaged it is likely that there will be a proportion of unsold fish each day, particularly smaller and lower value fish. Apart from those fish used for household consumption, these fish provide an opportunity for household (or possibly commercial level) processing: sun dried, smoked or fermented into Padek . Existing fish traders based in Thakhek, and potentially current Nakai based traders, are likely to take rapid advantage of the new trading opportunities that present themselves as a result of the NT2 fish production. The primary, and initially major, ma rket for NT2 produced fish will be Thakhek. Secondary markets are likely to be those in closest proximity and would incl ude Paksan and Savannakhet. As reservoir production rises and progressively satisfies local demand it is an ticipated that an increase in the trade of fish to Thailand will occur. Depend ing upon the actual production levels ac hieved it is quite possible that some of the Nakai Reservoir catch, in part icular larger, higher value fish, will reach the Vientiane market. Some small quantities of fish are currently being exported from Lak Sao to Vietnam. It is possible that NT2 fish could likewise be exported. As has occurred with the va luable large livestock trade in Nakai it is likely that district authorities will seek to earn taxation revenue from the fish trade. There are a number of ways in which such revenue may be generated. If the model adopted for the livestock trade is followed it would result in a Nakai based fish traders association being established which would pay a flat rate monthly fee to the District Taxation Department for the exclusive rights to market fish pr oduced on the plateau or to charge other traders for 22 Lak 3 fresh food market only was estimated to be approximately 1 ton per day. Chapter 24: Nakai Reservoir Fisher ies Development and Management November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 72such rights. The establishment of such monopolistic tr ading systems, even if on ly for fixed terms, has a number of possible negative impacts: inhibits development of the private trade sector lower trader competition leading to depression of farm gate fish prices. reduces district taxation income There are also however, potential positive impacts that could result from the higher volumes traded by a single association or company that are less likely to occur in a scenario with a number of small scale individual traders. These advantages could include: The establishment of ice production facilities for th e transportation of higher value fish to remoter, yet more lucrative markets, no tably Thailand and Vientiane. The management of bureaucratic regulations concerning formal trade to more lucrative markets, notably Thailand. The establishment of commercial small-scale proce ssing facilities for the utilization of smaller, lower value fish. Irrespective of the nature of future marketing chan nels, data gathered strongly suggests that the marketing of Nakai Reservoir catch will not be problematic even at high level pr oduction estimates. However, the development of market structures takes time and there may be a time lag between production levels and marketing channels. This is, however, not expected to be significant. Table 24-15 summarizes and presents the scenario and scale of the major short term opportunities and risks for market oriented production of fish from the Nakai Reservoir. Table 24-15: Market Op portunities and Risks Market Opportunity Market Risks Scenario Strong local demand in Thakhek, processing and inter-provincial trade possible. High value / kg, private sector will rapidly seek to take advantage of opportunities presented. Potential risk of monopolistic trading association being established reducing competition amongst traders and depressing farm gate prices. Scale High Low - Medium Market linkage recommendations Market penetration on the Nakai has, to date, been weak. This will change rapidly with improved transportation networks and the influx of construction crews. It is recommended that NTPC include a market acceleration program within its resettlement action plan to achieve the following objectives: Monitor market trends on an ongoing basis so as to ensure that production promoted on the plateau is in line with market demands. Facilitate trader interest in the plateau's production through a vari ety of mechanisms including the establishment of partnerships with existing trading companies for possible contract farming type arrangements. Support the development of local traders on the plateau to take advantage of trade opportunities that exist and thus retain as much of the financial benefits of this trade within the plateau area.

It has not yet been revised to take into account the (slightly) revised livelihood planning that is now incorporated into component chapters, especially the flexibility required in the development and management of the currently degraded forest areas in the Resettlement Area and in the drawdown zone, and in the management of large livestock herds. Following agreement on the strategies proposed in thes e comments, this integration of live lihoods chapter will be revised. This chapter has also not yet been revised to incorporate the change in eligibility cut-off date, to reflect that the 2003 census, and not the 1998 census, is now the cut off date from the Plateau resettlement program. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 125 LIVELIHOOD INTEGRATION AND IN COME SCENARIOS - TRANSITION TO STABILITY 25.1 INTRODUCTION 25.1.1 Summary of Current Livelihoods The objective of the resettlement planning is to ensure that the affected households are able to successfully establish viable livelihoods in their new villa ge locations. The effect of the inundation of over 40 percent of the Nakai Plateau will be the loss of a large portion of the land currently used by the villagers for agriculture, livestock gr azing, gathering of forest products and hunting. Surveys conducted in 2002 revealed that there were 91 ha of rainfed (wet se ason) rice and 35 ha of dry season, irrigated paddy fields on the Plateau, plus about 434 ha of upland rice. Maize, cassa va and vegetables are grown on 86, 49 and 4 ha, respectively. However, yields from these areas are usually very poor, due to flood and/or drought damage to the wet season crops, and elephant damage to the upland fields and dry season paddy crop. A survey in 1996 revealed th at only 17 percent of house holds produced enough rice for year round consumption and 13 percent had rice deficits for over 8 months in the year. This finding was supported by the 1998 census survey that foun d total production of both wetlan d paddy and upland rice cultivation provides less than 10 percent of the total household consumption needs. This dire situation continues to this day, and it is for this reason that many plateau families rely on gathering of NTFPs for sale to buy rice, or exchange for rice. Thus, the (plateau) affected people have not traditionally depended upon a single source of income for their livelihoods. Asid e from rice cultivation they have subsisted on livestock, fishing, hunting and gathering of forest products, and to a small extent on wage employment. The resettlement of the affected villages is th is seen as an opportunity for improving their food security through a range of new livelihood opportunities. 25.1.2 Livelihood Options for Plateau Resettlers As described in previous Chapters, the resettlers on th e Nakai Plateau will be able to choose from a range of livelihood options that the NT2 project will support, commonly referred to as the 5 livelihood options, which can be described as: 1. Agriculture : Wet and dry season cropping, with irrigation water pumped from the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir (as described in Chapters 21 and 22); 2. Livestock : Livestock raised on a mixture of feed-crops or forages grown on the irrigated areas, and grazing under the forest of the resettlement area and the drawdown zone (described in Chapter 21); 3. Commercial Community Forestry in the resettlement area fore sts, including management and harvest of the natural forest, reforestation of degraded forests and prim ary and secondary wood processing (as described in Chapter 23) provid ing both employment to some families, and dividends to all; 4. Fisheries: Subsistence and commercial fishing in th e newly created Nam Theun 2 Reservoir (as described in Chapter 24); and 5. Non-farm employment: Waged or self employment in a range of activities such as small shops, repair and fabrication shops, handicrafts, primary produce trading and construction labour. 25.1.3 Integration - Scenarios of Adoption of Livelihood Options Earlier resettlement planning us efully distinguished between (a) Basic livelihood package: irrigated agriculture land (0.66 ha per family) and an annual dividend from the NPVFA, which will be made available to all households; and (b) Optional livelihood enterprises : fisheries, forestry employment, livestock raising and of-farm employment, which will be adopted by households to different extents, for different purposes. It is the objectives of this chapter to analyse how and which of these livelihood options are adopted by the resettlers. This is a complex task as any particular family may chose from one, two or all of the livelihood Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2options, and it will adopt these options in various ways - subsistence to commercial and to various degrees - depending on a number of factors, see Section 25.1.5 below. For the purpose of this predictive analysis or mode lling of future livelihoods, a combination of a range of agriculture and the other livelihoods is consider ed, as \"Household Livelihood Mixes\", which are a combination of the following. 11 Whole Farm Scenarios (Crops and Livestock) X 3 Fisheries options X 2 Forestry options X various off-farm (wage/employment ) options 25.1.4 Key Terminology The complexity of this predictive livelihood analysis and modelling re quires that some key terms are first clarified, as follows: Whole Farm Scenarios (WFS) are those 11 mixtures of crops and animals that provide a range of the types of animal and cropping systems that that the resettling families may eventually, after some years of testing, decide to adopt for the 0.66 ha of irrigated crop land provided to them (see Chapter 21); Household size categories (household categories), divides the population, for the purpose of predictive modelling, in 5 categories of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 person households; Household Livelihood Mixes (HLM) is the combination of options which a household may adopt, and on which the income pr edictive modelling is undertaken; Household Livelihood Mix (HLM) Examples is a series of combined livelihoods options for each household size category presented as examples in the models; Livelihoods refer in the context of this analysis only to food and income components of livelihoods; Transition Phase is that period of time from the start of relocation (and the start of hydropower related construction) to the time that the reservoir is full and most construction has finished, a period in which focus will be on relocation, an d not all livelihood options will be possible (e.g. irrigated agriculture an d commercial fisheries); Stability Phase: the period after transition when all livelihood options become a possibility, and villagers have adopted the mix of livelihood whic h they are likely to continue into the medium term, at least. 25.1.5 Key Considerations in Livelihood Option Integration Chapters 21, 23 and 24 detail the resources available and the technical requirements of the 5 main livelihood options, and the expected productivity or range of productivity of each enterprise. However, the choice or adoption of one, some or all of these of these options will not be the same for each family. From the point of view of a resettling family , the key considerations in choice or adoption of a livelihood activities will, depend on factors such as: (a) Family size (household size category): Family size and composition dictates the amount of labour available as well as the basic income requirement; (b) Experience to date in any of the livelihood activities. For example, some households may be riverine fishers already and thus adapt better to reservoir fisheries, or some may be good wet and/or dry season paddy farmers and thus more easily adapt to intensive agriculture; (c) Employment skills: Some members of a family may already be experienced, as tree loggers, carpenters, machinery repairs for example); Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3(d) Resource opportunities pres ented in or near each new village location. Some village resettlements locations - chosen by the villagers themselves, ma y provide better fishing opportunities, or better grazing areas, for example. From the point of view of resettlement planners , the key considerations in planning for and predicting how villagers may chose and ad opt a mix of livelihoods are: (a) Income targets . The Project developers and the GoL must ensure that resettling villagers attain a certain level of income - the total of cash and im puted income, by year 4 and then year 8 or 9 after relocation. Thus, the income from a wide range of livelihood mixes must be analysed; (b) Feasibility of any livelihood mix, which relates to both ( a) social feasibility, or human factors such as family size, skills, and (b) tech nical feasibility which relates to yields, quality of yields, cost of inputs and returns of marketing; (c) Financial support required to develop the mix of livelihoods The other consideration - for both villagers and planers, is the timing or phasing of the adoption and then integration of the livelihoods. This is important for two reasons: (i) not all of the livelihood oppo rtunities will come on stream, or be available at the same time; and (ii) the period or actual relocation and construc tion of the NT2 Project itself will create temporary income generating opportunities, which could either interfere with the smooth adoption of the long term resettlement options or complement the gradual adoption of the resettlement options, at least two of which will not be available anyh ow until construction is compete. 25.2 INCOME TARGETS FOR LIVELIHOOD INTEGRATION The NT2 Project is committed to ensure that 5 liveli hood packages, which effectively is compensation by way of rehabilitation (increase for many families) of in come, for inundation of villagers on the plateau will enable villagers to produce food and income to certain target levels. These target income levels are specified as a commitment in the Concession Agreement as follows: Household Income Target - to be achieved by each household in all villages no later than four years after relocation of the village. The greater of: (A) the then National Rural Poverty Line per capita multiplied by the number of persons in the household (in 1997/98 the NRPL per capita was 236,616 Kip per year or 1,305,647 Kip for an average household of 5,518 pers ons, equivalent to USD 837 1; and (B) 1,420,800 Kip per person multiplied by the number of persons in the household (in 2002/03 this was equivalent to US$ 761 for an average household of 5.518 persons2). The figure was defined in October 2002 and will be updated regularly based on the inflation rate as calculated from the CPI published by NSC. Village Income Target - to be achieved by all villages no later than seven years after relocation of the village. The greater of: (A) the then National Average Rural Income per capi ta multiplied by the number of persons in the village (in 1997/98 the NARI for an average ho usehold of 5,518 persons was 1,946,404 Kip per year3, equivalent to US$ 1,243. However, in 2002/03 the NARI for an average household of 5,518 persons was 8,210,784 Kip per year 4, equivalent to US$ 797); and 1 Using the average monthly exchange rate for the period March 1997 - February 1998 of 1,565 Kip/US$. The rate is an average of the parallel and official rates (1,628 Kip/US$ and 1,502 Kip/US$, respectively (For calculations on exchange rates, see Anne x 25-2. Source: National Statistics Centre)). NRPL figures for 2002/03 will be released by May 2004. A simplified NRPL has been made by NSC for year 2000 of 80,000 Kip per month per capita or 5,297,280 Kip per year for an average household of 5.518 persons, equivalent to US$ 668. Average mont hly exchange rate for 2000 is 7933 Kip/US$. 2 Using the average monthly exchange rate for the period Ma rch 2002 - February 2003 of 10,299 Kip/US$ (average of parallel and official rate). 3 191,066 Kip/month/HH (@ 6.5 persons) x 12 months x (5.518/6.5) persons/HH. The figure refers to rural households with access to road. Source: The households of Lao PDR, NSC 1999. 4 124,000 Kip/month/capita x 12 months x 5.518 persons/HH.

Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 4(B) 2,131,200 Kip per capita multiplied by the number of persons in the village (in 2002/03 this was equivalent to US$ 1,142 for an average household of 5.518 persons). The figure was defined in October 2002 and will be updated regularly based on the inflation rate as calculated from the CPI published by NSC. The Village Income Target is an aggregate measure at village level, using the National Rural Average Income and total number of people in the village to calc ulate the target for the entire village. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that each and every pers on in the village will reach the national average rural income for the village to reach this target. However, no person or hous ehold will experience a level of income below the National Rural Poverty Line. Furthe rmore, it is the policy of the Project that no household will fall below their pre-relocation income level. The income targets are seen as minimum figures, and it is expected that some house holds and villages will exceed these targets.. The timing for achieving the household and village income tar gets will be established, and set to start for each village as that year of re location of the individual village5. As of 1998, the average household income of Nakai Plateau families was abou t US$ 449 per year, which was well below the national poverty line. Thus, the aim is to lift household income to at least the National Poverty Line by end of year 4 after relocation, which is a significant step. This represents a challenge in the remote area of the Nakai Plateau where the best available farming land will be lost through inundation and where current farming practices are below subsiste nce level. However, the income targets will be quite feasible as the objective is not to attempt to impr ove current livelihood systems but rather support the development of a range of new (albeit related) enterprises, based on the new resource opportunities presented by the project, the support to purchase of agricultural and other inputs, and the provision of technical assistance and other services. The income targets are by nature floating and depending on the national figures for the Rural Poverty Line and the Average Rural Income as well as the Lao Kip - US Dollar exchange rate. To enable comparison of the potential incomes for livelihood scen arios for the various household size categories the Household Income Target (o ption B) and Village Income Target (option B) (per household) are presented in Table 25-1. It is apparent that th ere is a big gap of a factor 2 from an annual income of US$ 449 for the average household to the target set for end of Year 4.

Exchange rate and thereby income targets will be updat ed regularly.Household Category 25.3 HOUSEHOLD SIZE CATEGORIES Possibly the main constraint or factor determining the range of livelihood activities that any particular family will or can undertake is the availability of labour within the household. 5 For example, a village relocated in 2005 would aim to achieve the household income target in 2009 and the village income targe t in 2012. Another village relocated in 2007 will aim to achieve the household and village income targets in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 5In order to make a comparison of th e livelihood opportunities that will be available, a simple system of categorising the households has been devised based up on five major types. These are based on the actual distribution of household sizes at the Nakai Plateau in 1998 (see Figure 25-1). Large households with a total of 10 persons comprising the husband and wife together with one child (less than 13 years old), two teenage children, two adult offspring as well as three other adults, one of which is an elder. This would equate to 7. 25 labour units per day and a total of 2,175 person days per year6. Larger households with eight persons, consisting of a husband and wife together with a young child, two teenage children, an adult child as well as two other adults, one of which is an elder. This would equate to 5.25 labour units and would pr ovide a total of 1,575 person days per year. Average households with six persons, which would consist of the husband and wife together with two young children, a teenage child as well as an elder person. This would make a total of 2.75 labour units and a total of 825 person days per year. Smaller households with a total of four persons being the husband and wife together with two small children making a total of 1.75 labo ur units and 525 person days per year. Small households with only husband and wife who also would represent 1.75 labour units and 525 person days per year7.

Other family types exist, e.g. female (or male) headed households. However, demographic data suggests that the female head in such househo lds is typically around 60 years of age and therefore not likely to have small children to support. It is mo re likely that she gets support through adult working children and extended family ties. The likely composition of these households and their labour resources are presented in Table 25-2, where the labour ability for the various household members has been valued. It is obvious that the larger households have more labour resources available. This will have implication for, which and how many activities the household members can be involved in. 6 Labour units are computed as follows: Husban d 1.0, wife 0.75, teenage ch ild 0.5, elderly 0.5 and othe r adults 1.0 person units per day for a total of 300 days per year. Even though children unde r 13 years often contribute their labour to the economic activit ies in the household, a model cannot include them as they ideally should be attending school. 7 The difference between the Smaller Household and the Small Household lies in the income requirement.

A number of enterprises have been selected for the resettled households based upon an Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7evaluation of the natural resources and taking into account the socio-economic and cultural background of the people and the economic environment in which they will be operating. The objective is: To ensure that the people are able to derive a reliable income in order to achieve and sustain the expected standard of living by en gaging in activities that are within their capacity, taking into account th e availability of the resources on the Nakai Plateau and the type of enterprises that they are already engaged in. Given the resources of the affected households, it w ill not be feasible for each household to take up every one of the above activities . They will be able to choose among these livelihood elements and in the case of crop production there will be many different cropping patterns, covering both wet and dry season, which can be adopted and providing a range of income levels. Intensification of both crop and livestock production will be dependent on providing enhanced extension and other support services through the District. The Resettlement Budget provides funding for enhancing the capability of the support services as well as the hiring of additional field workers who can directly support the resettled households8. 25.4.1 Food Security The identification of alternative livelihood opportunities recognises the need to give adequate priority to meeting the basic household food requirements. Due to the socio-cultural significance of rice, the desi gn of each resettlement village agriculture area will strive to include small land areas that are suitable for wetland paddy cultivation as well as the main areas for terraced upland farm plots. However, the current situation with rice production on the plateau is that rice is mainly derived from the shifting cultivation of upland rice, and even this (combined with the small area of paddy) only produces about 20 % of the total population subsistence needs 9, the duration of the rice deficiency ranging from 5 to 12 months. The remainder has to be purchased from outside sources by the sale or trading of gathered products. As it is common for the households to purchase or barter their products in return for the rice required for household consumption, the idea that a livelihood is not based on rice production is familiar to most plateau families. What is not familiar is the need to produce or harvest in a managed system - rather than gather - those produce, which they must trade or barter for rice. During the initial resettlemen t period it will be essential to ensure that all households have sufficient rice for their subsistence needs. This will be achieved through Food for Work support during the land clearance, contouring and terracing operations as well as the cultivation of the first cycle of upland crops. 25.4.2 Crop Production At present the affected households do not engage in intensive upland cropping on their homesteads. They mainly grow fruit tree crops and food crops like cassava, maize, taro and sweet potato that are substitutes for rice and are at the same time less labour intensive. There is very little vegetable production. This allows them more time to engage in their traditional livel ihood activities like hunting, gathering, shifting cultivation, caring for their livestock (mainly buffalo) an d some unskilled employment. In the resettled villages it is inte nded that a more reliable income fr om forestry, wage employment and fisheries, supported by extension services, will engender a greater degree of interest by the households in a more sedentary farming system focusi ng most of the resources onto the individual permanent farm lots. This system envisages upland cro pping in the wet season together with some dry season cropping under irrigation to produce a range of legumes, vegetables and fruit for consumption but mainly as cash crops. Each household will be provided with an irrigated farm of 0.66 ha. It w ill be terraced, and be suitable for growing crops, and possibly rice, in the wet season with supplementary irrigation, and probably a smaller area of dry season irrigated crops and vegetables. To guide livelihood and income planning, Activity 8 See Chapter 7 for a description of the district level institutional capacity building program. 9 See Chapter 21 for detailed description of existing rice production practices. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 8Models and Gross Margin Budgets10 have been developed for a wide range of individual crops which have potential in the resettlement area, including; Cereal Crops - Irrigated Paddy, Upland Rice, Maize and Maize intercropped with Black Beans; Legumes - Black Beans, Mungbeans, Peanuts and Soybeans; Vegetables - Cabbage, Broccoli, Chilli, Carrot, Eggpla nt, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Onion and Garlic; Industrial Crops - Coffee, Tea; and Fruit - Water Melon, Mango, Lychee, Jackfruit, Guava, Pineapple and Banana. These crops have been combined into a total of 11 WF Ss for the 0.5 ha area (alongside the 0.16 ha of irrigated paddy), which will be provided to each re settled household, as shown in Table 25-3. The WFSs provide examples of increasing intensification of the cropping pattern in both wet and dry season through the introduction of increased areas of grain legumes and vegetables and in some cases larger areas planted to a range of fruit trees. Two of the WFSs consider the introduction of industrial crops, namely coffee (WFS 3.1) and tea (WFS 3.2). In most of these WFSs it has been assumed that traditional backyard livestock raising will be continued alongsi de more intensive crop production. There are also two WFS that feature a larger area of irrigated rice in preference to other upland crops, which may be feasible on some farm plots in relative flatter areas (such as Don, Khon Kaen, and Nakai villages (Model 4.1 and 4.2). However, the financia l returns from irrigated rice do not make a major contribution to the household incomes. The Gross Margin Budget for the production of irrigated paddy in both the wet and dry season shows that the 0.16 ha area can generate an income of US$ 56.25 and 62.50 during the wet and dry season, respectively (not in cluding labour costs). This will apply to the first three post-resettlement years to villa ges where irrigation is al ready in place when fu nding is provided to cover the cost of all inputs. Subsequently, when fa rmers have to bear these costs, the Gross Margins declines to US$ -6.63 and -0.38, respectively.

Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 9Even on optimistic rice yield assumptions of 3 tonnes per ha, the 0.16 ha area will produce only 480 kg of paddy and a total of 1 tonne if grown in both seasons. This would meet approximately 70 percent of the annual household food requirement. This in itself w ill represent an impr ovement in the situation of most households with a significant reduction on the number of months with rice shortages. However, for most families their initial yield levels ma y be lower and the adoption of dry season irrigated paddy production will take place over the first three years. During these early years le ss than half of the annual food requirement can be satisfied. This will inevitably me an that there will be a tendency for households to continue to plant upland rice on a part of their farm plot to maintain their food security. The transition away from upland rice production will be promoted through the extension system and households will be encouraged to diversify into upland cash crops to en able them to purchase more of their rice for food. The provision of direct support by the Project to the resettled house holds for seed, fertiliser and other inputs during the first three years of resettlement for each village will prov ide the mechanism for the extension system to promote this transition process. 25.4.3 Livestock Production All the affected households own some livestock; how ever, the distribution is very skewed. Most households have buffalo and the current average is ov er four buffaloes per household. Cattle are less common on the Plateau. All households have at least one pig and usually some poultry also. These are all raised under traditional practices wi th few, if any, external inputs 12. On the assumption that the relocated households will wish to retain their livestock when th ey move into the new areas and every effort must be made to assist them in maintai ning and improving their livestock quality and productivity. The main concern will be with the buffalo and cattle si nce most of the existing grazing areas will be lost with the inundation of the reservoir. There appear to be four options for these large animals: Providing alternative feed supplies for the buffalo and cattle through an improvement in the grazing under the forested areas. Within areas that have been cleared, or partially cleared, establish grazing areas through the introduction of improved grasses and legumes. Making some use of the drawdown areas for dry season grazing with the possibility of introducing pasture species into the areas with shallow water depth that can survive the periodic inundation during each wet season. However, the potential impact of intense manure deposits on the water quality should be considered. Establishing pasture and legumes on the farm lots th at will generate forage to satisfy at least 75% of the dry matter vegetative requirements of the animals using a cut and carry feeding system. Thus, there will be a need to improve the feed supplies since the stocking rate will increase to 1 animal per 4 hectares, or, with a 25% increase in large animal populations, 1 animal per 3.2 hectares. Stocking rates of this order are considered close to the sustainable long term carrying capacity of the area. A further increase in the livestock numbers or a decrease in the f eed supply is likely to result in a degradation of the natural resource base and the income that can be derived from both livesto ck and forestry related activities. The WFS that features intensive buffalo or c attle raising (WFS 5) predicts that the 0.5 ha area of the farm lot can generate sufficient dry matter yield to satisfy the requirements of 2 animals assuming that around 25% of their feed is throug h natural grazing in the forested areas. This will clearly present a problem given the high number of buffaloes owned by some families. Whether they will be prepared to devote their entire farm lot to the production of forage is uncertain, and a further uncertainty would be whether they will be prepared to pr ovide the fertiliser for the forage crops to ensure that they attain the required levels of dry matter production. Undoubtedly, in the short term there will be a need to put a great deal of effort into improving the grazing in the forested or partially cleared areas, and also to investigate the possibility of exploiting the grazing areas in the drawdown zone. The present herd of a pproximately 4,500 buffaloes represents approximately 3,000 adult animal equivalents which would require about 10,000 ha of gr azing area. The latest forestry 12 See Chapter 21 for a full description of the existing livestock production. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 10inventory estimates show that this area is available as cleared forest in the resettlement area but it will require a substantial effort to improve the grazin g resource on this large area of forest land. However, without this benefit the households may have to move their livestock further away in order to find adequate grazing. In addition, the existing practice of bringing buffalo and cattle up onto the Plateau during the lowland rice growing season could exceed the carrying capacity of the available grazing area. Thus the inundation of the plateau may have further impacts on large animal production in the lowland parts of the province. Currently chickens and pigs and some ducks are kept in the villages and these livestock forage in the open and occasionally receive household scraps. Their productivity can be raised if feed supplies are increased, improved breeding stock is introduced and, most im portantly, animal health services are strengthened. Improving animal health care should be the first pr iority prior to any further attempt to improve the breeding or feeding regimes. 25.4.4 Forestry Within the resettlement area, the natural resource endowment of the forested areas has the potential to constitute a source of income for the resettled househol ds from the outset. The forests in the designated resettlement area are within the administrative bound aries of the villages to be relocated. The families from these villages already use these forests to some extent. However, the villages have previously had no involvement with the commercial logging of these forests. After inundation the resettled households are to bene fit from the proceeds of the logging activities through the establishment of the NPVFA that will pay each (member) household a dividend of at least US$100 per year. This is designed to be a form of co mpensation for the loss of th e traditional lands and to provide an incentive to limit the co llection and harvesting of non-timber products to sustainable rates. This approach will thus contribute materially to improving their living standard and to good natural resource management. The gathering of NTFPs is limited to specific sites with in the forested areas and is expected to diminish in importance very quickly and constitute a much smaller proportion of future household income. The resettlement area contai ns approximately 20,000 hectar es of land classified as forest out of which an estimated 5,600 ha currently contains harvestable volumes that could be utilised through village forestry activities. The yield from this fore st is estimated to be about 8,000 m 3 per year over at least the first ten years. The area has native pine ( Pinus merkussi) and hardwood resources, as well as rattan and other potentially commercial products. With improved management the growth of the softwood and hardwood forests on the Plateau could be increased. Of the available 20,000 ha, it is propos ed that only 5,600 ha be utilised for sustainable logging in the shirt to medium term, in conformity with the 2001 forest resource inventory. Additionally, some 1,400 ha will be cleared for village sett lements, farm plots, paddy and roads. The remainder (about 13,000 ha) would be available for protection, grazing, collection of NTFPs on a sustainable basis, and enrichment planting. The NPFVA will have a crucial role to play in all of these activities. The measures proposed for managing the timber output include harvesting at a rate of 1.2 m 3 per ha per year in the hardwood areas and 1.5 m3 per ha per year in the softwood areas. Labour resources will be required for the conduct of per-harvest inventories, forest operations planning and tree marking. The actual logging operations would be preceded by access road and track clearing, followed by second landing operations and measures to control the logging. Measures to ensure regeneration would include post- harvest assessment and assisted natural regeneration, forest stand improvement, forest plantation (if feasible) and protection. All of these activities wo uld provide potential labour opportunities, which is estimated at 46,445 person days per year which would earn on average US$3 per day 13. This represents just over 40 person days per household per year for the resettled population and an annual income 13 See Chapter 23. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 11contribution of around $120. Clearly the opportunities for paid temporary labour in support of forestry activities will make a relatively minor co ntribution to their potential livelihood. The two nurseries that are established, one in the north and one in the south, will require some labour for operation and maintena nce, and the sawmill, wood processing an d sales will also generate significant labour demand. There will also be tasks involved in each village with the administration of the NPVFA. These activities will require labour of a permanent n ature and will total 61,800 person days over the course of the year. On the basis of 300 working days per ye ar this will actually benefit around 200 persons in total, which is 20 percent of the resettled households. The average rates for this semi-skilled permanent labour will be of the order of US$150 per month. Th us the contribution of permanent labour to the resettled households is potentially greater than that from temporary employment. 25.4.5 Fisheries The productive capacity of the new reservoir will de pend on a range of factors such as water quality, nutrients area, depth and th e adaptability of the indigenous fish sp ecies. However, the indications are that the water quality and reasonable nutrient levels will be present during the initial filling and at least around 30 local fish species will adapt to the new lacustrine conditions. By 2009 there will be 1,185 households that may be involv ed with fisheries and th ey will be competing for an assumed annual catch of 1,575 tonnes 14 valued at US$ 945,000, which wo uld equate to an average of about US$ 900 per household. However, not all households will wish to enga ge in fisheries with the result that those who do become more involved will benefi t substantially from this enterprise with very favourable returns to labour compared with other co mmodities even after allowing for fuel, oil and ice purchases. The majority of the households (assumed to be 50 percent) will simply become subsistence fishers who will catch an average of 0.9 kg per day 15. Their fishing activities will amount to about 3 hours per day which would equate to approximately 10 person days per month. The other large group comprising 41 percent of the households will beco me part-time commercial fishers who will devote more resources to fishing with daily catches of 5.9 kg and they would be expected to spend at least 150 person days per year fishing. Finally, there will be a small group, assumed to be 9 percent of the ho useholds, who become more involved with fisheries on a full time commercial basi s. Their daily catch would be of the order of 7.8 kg and they would spend around 300 pe rson days per year fishing. It is recommended that commercial fishing is onl y started once the reservoir has filled up and fish populations have established. Low effort fishing to cover home consumption, however, can take continue in the main water areas. 25.4.6 NTFPs and Hunting The households to be resettled derive some of their total household income from NTFPs and the hunting of wildlife. While the creation of the reservoir may affect these sources, it is reasonable to expect that they will continue to pursue these activities in the rema ining forest areas of the plateau. However, for the purposes of livelihood income projections it is ex pected that the income fr om these sources will not increase so that as a proportion of the total household income they will decline in importance. It is expected that villagers will pursue this activity in their spare time and in times of excess labour. 25.4.7 Small-scale Business, Craft and Trade Most villages will also establish a range of businesse s, crafts and trades. The types of enterprises will depend on the actual demand. A list of likely enterp rises has been identified below with estimated numbers and profit (see Table 25-4). 14 Studies by SEATEC and Lao PDR Department of Livestock and Fisheries on the Nam Ngum Reservoir, which is of same size as Nakai Reservoir at FSL, show producti on levels around 1,400 tonnes per year. 15 See Chapter 24. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 12The more dominating enterprises are expected to be small shops selling products from town (estimated daily profit US$2.80) and basket/m at handicraft (US$ 0.80 or 0.20 fo r quarter of a day). Others may include tailoring and sewing (US$ 2.00/day) and small re staurants/refreshment shops (US$ 10.00/day). In the Household Livelihood Mix Exam ples, it has been anticipated that it will be the large and larger households who will take on the business and craft/trad e, mainly because they have available labour resources. It is estimated that there will be a total of 121 business units with an average profit of US$ 4.67/day for 300 days per year. In addition, there will be a total of 195 units of crafts / trades earning in average US$ 1.57/day in an average of 161 days per year16.

He re it is estimated th at it will take up the average time of a quarter of the day. 25.4.8 Employment The NT2 Project, the timber industry, the fishing indu stry, transportation and ot her services, trading and other entrepreneurial activities, Pr otected Area management and tourism will all require the engagement of full time staff, as skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled labour. However, not all of these opportunities will be fully av ailable to the resettled populations since these will not have the necessary skills to exploit all of these opportunities or the available spare labour. There will be three categories of permanent employment: Nam Theun 2 Project related employment the NTPC will be responsible for the maintenance of the reservoir, particularly the control of logs and trash, maintenance of the water supply systems and part of the road to the dam site, and this will require a number of semi-skilled and unskilled staff; NTPC installations; NTPC and the WMPA will require driver s and boat drivers and boats men; and staff of the NPVFA. Government jobs school and nursery teachers; grounds maintenance staff and guards; drivers; nursing assistants; 16 Basket and mat making is estimated to occupy only 75 days per year. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 13 WMPA offices will require guards an d ground maintenance staff; and WMPA drivers and boats men. Private jobs employees of tourism companies; employees of traders; and employees in small shops, etc. 25.5 PHASING - TRANSITION TO STABILITY The development of the new livelihoods will, in most cases, take some time/yea rs to develop, for two main reasons; (a) resource availability: not all the resources for the new livelih oods will be available at the time of actual relocation. This relates mainly to the fact that villagers will be relo cated some 2 to 3 years before the reservoir is full. Thus, the reservoir fish eries and irrigated agriculture enterprises cannot be initiated until that time. (b) ethnic minority adaptation: the resettlement strategy recogn ises that the change in villager livelihood activities must be unde rtaken gradually, to enable villa gers to become accustomed and skilled in the new enterprises. This means that the productivi ty and economic returns of the enterprises may not be fully realis ed until villagers have become fu lly adapt at these enterprises. In addition, the period during which the villagers will be actually relocating and starting to undertake the new livelihood enterprises will also be the period of construction of the NT2 Proj ect, and as the plateau resettlers are relocating in the general vicinity of the NT2 Project, the creation of temporary income generating opportunities may be a si gnificant influence. For some familie s it may interfere with their focus and smooth adoption of the long term resettlement live lihood options, but for most families it is expected to complement the gradual ad option of the resettlement livelihood options, of which at least 2 will not be available anyhow until construction is compete. This period of relocation, initiati on of some of the livelihood options and development of skills, in parallel to the construction of the NT2 Project, is termed the transition period or phase. As shown in Table 25-5 this period is indicatively identified as that 5 year period from Financial Close (soon after which the full relocation process will occur), up until about CoD, a year after most NT2 Project construction activities have finished, and the initiation of the irrigated agriculture and fisheries livelihood enterprises. As Table 25-5 depicts the phasing of the core livelihood options together with the additional opportunities during the specific labo ur opportunities during the transition/construction phase. This is compared with the relocation prog ram to illustrate how the phasing of the resettlement enables the households to avail of livelihood opportunities. There is no suggestion that every household will be en gaged in every one of these activities. They will set their own priorities taking into account their available labour resources. As noted above, during the Transi tion Phase the livelihood model will be implemented according to when resources and infrastructure become available (e.g. irri gation system, reservoir for fisheries). Consequently, the benefit from livelihood options in terms of income can not be realized yet when certain resources are not yet available. For this reasons, families will have to seek income from other activities in order ensure adequate incomes, and especially to at least the National Poverty Line. Therefore, supporting measures will be required, and a range of other opportunities facilitated to bridge any gaps, as follows. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 14Table 25-5: Timing of Liveli hood Options in Comparison with Resettlement Program FC to FC+1 to FC+2 to FC+3 to Core Livelihood Options Agriculture Rainfed - wet season Iirrigated - dry season Livestock Forestry Temporary Labour Permanent Labou r Fisheries Subsistence Part time Commercial Full time Commercial Business, Crafts and Trade Transition / Construction Phase specific activities > Reservoir biomass clearance > Charcoal, wood and NTFP collection from reservoir > Reservoir logging labou r > House timber sawmilling > House construction labour > Agricultural Land Develoment > Other food for work opportunities > Construction : Unskilled Labour Transition Phase Stability Phase Note: Year 'FC+1 to FC+2' has been used as representative year for the transition phase and year 'C OD to COD+1' as representati ve for the stability phase. 25.5.1 Access to Existing Resources For as long a physically feasible access to defined sections of NBCA for non-destructive collection of NTFPs should be allowed. Although this activity in most cases will be a continuation of present practices, such permissions should be reco gnised in the Watershed Plan. 25.5.2 Large Animal Raising While it is recommended that villager s continue to raise large animals for as long as possible until the reservoir is flooded, villagers will al so be encouraged to progressively sell their animals, e.g. for the constructions workers, which will facilitate the gradua l decrease ultimately required due to reservoir flooding. 25.5.3 Reservoir Area Biomass Utilisation Villagers should be granted formalis ed access to utilise the biomass in the reservoir area. This will cover charcoal production, harvesting of small timber for firewood, NTFP collection, grazing of livestock, etc. Exploration of new uses and markets fo r NTFPs will be encouraged / supported. 25.5.4 Employment in Reservoir Logging Activities Removal of the trees in the reservoir area will be granted to companies. The NPVFA could be one of these. The work will involve se mi-skilled and unskilled labour. 25.5.5 Payment for Labour on Resettlement Activities Skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled la bour will be needed for activities like, house construction, land preparation and irrigation development. 25.5.6 Employment in NT2 Project Construction Activities Under Lao PDR labour laws, and as reflected in the Conc ession Agreement, priority is to be given to Lao workers over foreign labour. Where foreign labour is em ployed it is to be limited in number and duration and a detailed scheme must be estab lished for the transfer of skills to Lao workers. As a general rule, all unskilled labour will be offered to Lao people, and Nakai Plateau residents will be given first priority. Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 15Undoubtedly the greatest opportunit y for employment of th e resettlers will be through unskilled labour that will be required during the five year construction period. It is estimated that a total of 1,500 person years of labour will be required, which equates to an average of 375 labourers per year over the four year construction period. Thus, at least one in three hou seholds could have one adult male member fully engaged for the five year period earning for the hou sehold up to US$450 per year. This would represent a substantial contribution representing in many ca ses exceeding the estimated cash income from the agricultural from their farm plots. 25.5.7 Production of Food for Labour Force There will be a demand for food by those constructi on and other labourers not residing permanently in the area. This will cover: dry seasons vegetables from Nong Boua and Bouama villages; wets season vegetables and crops; forest vegetables; large livestock; as the large livestock herds on the Plateau would have to be reduced, these could generate big profits, which could be banked or pu t into productive use by the villagers. NTPC will establish an abattoir; and small animals - chickens, ducks and pigs. Rice will be brought in from outside, as present production on the Plate au cannot even meet the demand of villagers. 25.5.8 Rice Support The project will provide each househol d with rice to meet the gap between the target income for a specific year and the actual income from all sources for the duration of the transition. The draft Resttlement Committee Regulation Number 5 stipulates that: At the time of the move to the new house in th e new village, each household will receive 55 kg of rice for each person in the household. Six month later, each household will again receive 55 kg of rice for each person in the household. The two allocations together will amount to 50 percent of the person's estimated annual rice consumption. Households categorized as vulnerable by the RM U, according to data on record, will receive two allocations of 70 kg of rice for each person in a vulnerable household; this is a 27 percent higher allocation. 25.5.9 Forest Association Resource Dividend Sustainable logging at the Plateau will only take plac e after completion of the construction of the dam. During construction most logging will be salvage loggi ng on project lands and new agricultural areas. The NPVFA will be in charge of cutting the trees on Project Lands in the Resettleme nt Area. NPVFA will also play a role in logging and timber preparation for construction of resettlement houses. Income from this will provide a dividend of a minimum US$ 100 per year. 25.5.10 Family Fund Management The flow of resettlement allowances and other cash funds will be managed by opening household bank accounts. Initially, these will be through micro savi ngs and credit schemes, but later these will be formalized by the establishment of an official savings bank in Nakai by 6 months after financial close. Thus, the transition from a before-reservoir to an af ter-reservoir economy will not be abrupt, but will be gradual for a wide range of activities. This will make it possible to continue to maintain some existing income sources while at th e same time developing new ones. This integrated approach should reduce risk. 25.6 INTEGRATION OF LIVELIHOODS Depending on labour resources available, past experi ence, skills and resources available, each household will develop their own livelihood sy stem (combination of livelihood options or Household Livelihood Mix) by choosing a set of economic activities. For the purpose of analysis and predicting future livelihood Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 16outcomes a set of 220 Household Live lihood Mix'es have been develope d. These have been derived by combining: 11 Whole Farm Scenarios, based on variations in agriculture and livestock components X 2 Timing Scenarios X 2 Household Livelihood Mix Examples X 5 Household Size Categories; In Table 25-6, the examples have been outlined by combining the Whole Farm Scenarios (see page 7) with other activities within the fisheries, forestry, sma ll-scale enterprise and construction sectors with due consideration to labour availability within each household size category. There are different levels of intensity for each sector: Agriculture and livestock High level Low level Fisheries Subsistence Part time commercial Full time commercial Forestry Temporary employment Permanent employment Charcoal making and NTFP collection The examples are divided into a Transition Phase and a Stability Phase. The reason for this is that villagers only after some time get accustomed to the new farming, fishing and forestry practices. Furthermore, the project withdraw it's support and some employment opportunities will cease after the Transition Phase. Clearly these are only an attempt to depict some of the possible livelihood mixes that will be possible.

In addition, the retu rns to labour should also dictate the way in which household allocates its available labour to specific activities. An analysis has been made of the monthly labour requirements for each of the WFSs to determine how feasible each of these would be for the five household categories. Figure 25-3 presents the monthl y surplus labour for each of the 11 Whole Farm Scenarios (agriculture and livestock) for each of the five household size categories in Stability Phase. It is immediately apparent that the sma ller and small households will have labour shortages for 3 months in WFS 6 (intensive duck raising with cereal/legume/veg etable production). This will limit the income of these households, not only from their agricultural production but also from other potential livelihood activities. For the other activities (option 3, 4 and 5 on Page 1) the model has assumed that each household will be engaged in activities according to their labour supply. The possible number of households taking part in each of the main components of livelihood options 3, 4 and 5 is shown in Table 25-7. This is compared Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 18with the estimated labour requirement or capacity of that activity. It is seen that for e.g. Permanent Forestry Labour the model example is incorporating up to 309 households whereas the number of jobs is estimated at 105. Similarly for Full Time Commercial Fisheries, where the model is expecting up to 323 households whilst yield calculations are based on only ar ound 100 households. However, it should be said that the figures mentioned are maximum figures and that for both examples; households will have two choices (plus others not mentioned in the model). This shows that the model needs to be improved to include more examples. More importantly, monitoring of households uptake of the various livelihood options will show where there are technical, financial as well as extension rela ted constraints and the Project together with DAFO will follow with technical (and where feasible) financial assistance.

In Stability Phase (Year 6) the highest Return to Labour is obtained through the WFS 4.1 - slightly higher for Low Input Scenario (US$ 4.10) than High Input Scenario (US$ 3.96) while the lowest is obtained by WFS 4.2 (US$ 1.03 in either input scenario). Commercial fishing (part time and full time) yields Returns to Labour within this range (US$ 1.40/day and US$ 2.00/day, resp ectively), whilst employment in the Forestry Sector (especially as permanent staff) gives a significantly higher return (US$ 6.82/day). Business is also expected to give a high Return to Labour (US$ 4.67/day), while crafts and trades normally has a lower Return (average US$ 1.57/day).

However, for individual months small and smaller households do face labour shortages, especially with HLM 6 in Stability Phase (see page 17). Large and larger households have large unspent labour resources. It is the challenge of these households and of the Project to put these into productive use with the limited resources available within the household and the natural environment. 25.8 ASSESSMENT OF INCOME GENERATION POTENTIAL The composition of activities within each Household Size Category as shown in Table 25-6 is presented for each HLM in Figure 25-4 to Figure 25-13. This includes two examples for Transition Phase and two for Stability Phase. The profit marg in (gross margin) for each HLM as well as the labour requirements are listed. 25.8.1 Total Income In the Transition Phase , HLM 1.3 (intensive cereal/legume/vegetable WS production with livestock) attains the highest total income in both Example 1 and 2 for all household categories except small households (e.g. US$ 1,054 and US$ 926, respectively fo r average size households). The small households fare slightly better with HLM 6 (Intensive duck raising with WS cereal production). Chapter 25: Livelihood Integration and In come Scenarios - Tran sition To Stability November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 22 For the large and larger households there is not a bi g variation between the various HLMs as agriculture and livestock makes up a relatively smaller part of the total income. The big labour force enables these household categories to engage in other and more profitable activities, especially forestry labour and business. The lowest incomes are obtained by HLM 6 for smalle r, average and larger households in both examples (e.g. US$ 721 and US$ 652, respectively for average si ze households) and for large households in Example 2. In the Stability Phase , the highest incomes are obtained throug h HLM 4.1 (irrigated paddy with legume/ vegetable/water melon production with livestock) in Example 1 and HLM 6 (intensive duck raising with cereal/legume/vegetable production) in Example 2 fo r all household categories (e.g. US$ 1,451 and US$ 1,603 respectively, for average size households). The lowest incomes for both Example 1 and 2 are obtained by HLM 4.2 (irrigate d paddy with legume/vegetable producti on with livestock, e.g. US$ 859 and US$ 608 respectively, for average size households). In HLM 4.2 paddy farming takes up a high percentage of the land 4,600 m2 and is grown in WS and DS. Paddy farming is usually not very profitable in Lao PDR but the model is included here as the activity has high cultural value for many farmers. 25.8.2 Meeting the Income Targets All household categories have income surplus in the Transition Phase , i.e. income above the current Household Income Target (B) in both Example 1 and 2 (see Fi gure 25-14). However, in the Stability Phase , the average and smaller households with HLM 1.1, 3.2, 4.2 and 5 in the present model do not manage to provide an average share to the Village Income Target (B) in either example. Furthermore, average households with both examples and smaller ho useholds with Example 1 have income deficit for HLM 1.2, 1.3 and 3.1. Finally, th ere will be income deficit for av erage households pursuing HLM 2.1 (Example 2), average and smaller households following HLM 6 (Example 1) and small households with HLM 4.2 (Example 1). Small households do in general - ac cording to the model - have income above the targets, except for HLM 4.2 in Example 1, as mentioned above. Large and larger households by far exceed the Village Income Target (B) in Example 1 where the household is engaged in business and craft / trade and in Example 2 where a household member has permanent employment in the Forestry Sector. Large households are dependent on many and/or relative larg e sources of income to sustain their household. The fisheries and forestry sectors provide such oppo rtunities as do small-scale business enterprises. Estimates on total income, income surplus/deficit an d labour surplus/deficit are compared between the two Examples, the Transition and Stability Phase and five Household Size Categories for each HLM in Annex 25-1 .

These include: Risks of adverse impacts associated with actual relocation processes and potential community discord; Risk of impoverishment relating to difficulties in adapting to a new livelihood system and resource base; Potential exploitation by others during and subsequently to relocation; and Possible conflicts within or between communities or with government agencies over access to resources. Certain measures already have and will continue to be taken to mitigate these adverse effects. Most important in this respect, is the ongoing participatory consultation process that has actively involved villagers in decision-making, and keeping them well informed at all times. Ac cording to a number of recent anthropological stud ies on resettlement, the 'familiar, is an essential aspect in minimizing possible negative consequences in relocating populations. Because the distance involved in moving the villages on the Nakai Plateau is not great, and because it involves relocation within a familiar habitat and usua lly within traditional and administrative village boundaries, the psychological and socio-cultural stress issues should be more manageable. Most villagers have shown a willingness to relocate to new sites and are attracted by the prospect of an improved lifestyle. Certain measures will be taken to avoid the possible adverse effects on social structure and cohesion due to the social, psycho logical and socio-cultural demands of relocation. Villagers will be involved not only in the decision making process but w ill be kept well informed at all times by means of PCPD visits as described in Chapter 4. In addition, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) techni ques have been used to fa miliarize village leaders and the community at large with the Project and to solicit their opinions and expectations. Many aspects, such as house design, conducting ritual procedures involved in moving houses and villages, and village layout have already been incorporated into resettl ement planning. The villagers will be involved in deciding actual site locations and the sites of ho use plots and gardens and this should contribute significantly to reducing any possible psychological and social stress related to the relocation. PRA techniques are outlined as part of PCPD in Chapter 4 and are presently being employed for the Pilot Village Relocation program. In the longer term, there are also a number of posit ive social effects that will ensure that the displaced population derives benefits directly from the Proj ect, and these aim to improve the present poor conditions on the Plateau. Signific ant benefits will accrue to village rs as a result of improved living conditions and improved economic welfare of households and communities due to additional educational opportunities, improved health conditions and empl oyment opportunities, an d the enhanced livelihood options for resettled villagers. Additional benefits include: 1. Improved transportation in the form of roads to each new village site. This will allow villagers access to markets and opportunities for work outside the village proper. 2. Enhanced water based transporta tion systems on the Reservoir. 3. Improved housing for the villagers who decide to opt for a new house. It is predicted that most will prefer the new houses since the majority of houses in the area are co nstructed of bamboo and are in poor condition. Those wh o decide to keep their present st ructures will be provided with support to relocate at the new village sites. Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 24. Every village will have better access to schools an d health services. Most villages at present do not have schools which function and none ha ve good access to health facilities. 5. Opportunities to learn new skills to improve agricultural production, whic h should result in greater food security in the form of produce (field-cro ps, rice and livestock) and income generated from the sale of fish and timber. 6. Improved services (water, electricity, health, and ed ucation) which will make a significant difference in day to day living. This will be especially noti ceable in the domestic sphere that is the prime concern of women. 26.2 STRENGTHENING OF COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS Probably the biggest current weakness in existing communities is a genera l lack of self reliance. Villagers are not used to making decisions about their own future, managing common resources, or taking joint action to improve their welfare. The ongoing PCPD and the participatory methods used to date for planning the relocation process are already having dramatic effects in this respect. By participating in planning and decision-making, local ca pacity is being raised, new skills are being learned, and villagers are beginning to see the benefits of coop eration. The advances already made in this respect, will greatly assist in reducing the potential risks of social upheaval community dysfunction associated with relocation. In many cases, existing community structures can be moved directly with the relocation, as community composition will not change. In th ese instances, village chiefs, deve lopment committees, women's groups, traditional support systems, etc. can continue to function as before. In resettlement villages involving the consolidation of mo re than one community, some adjustment will be necessary, and this will be supported by the RMU, with NTPC TA assistance for organizing community discussions, village meetings, fair and open elections, et c. In consolidated resettlement villages, existing support systems and kinship groups will be largely ma intained by allowing individual families choice in house location and who their neighbors will be. The development of a single, cohesive and harmonious community will be facilitated by th e provision of physical infrastruc ture such as a meeting hall where community meetings and informal gatherings can take place, schools wher e children will make new friends and parents will meet, and markets where all members of the community will meet and talk. All resettlement villages will need to make joint decisions about the management of community resources in the resettlement area. This will require new commu nity groups, structures and institutions to be established, developed and strength ened. These management systems w ill be required at two levels. First, at the village community level , including committees for: village re settlement, village forestry, village fisheries and reservoir management, irrigation water use, and other functions such as production or marketing support. Second, at the level of the entire resettlement area for inter-community decisions mainly on reservoir management and community fore stry. These various instit utions are essential to ensure the successful resettlement of village s into new locations an d livelihood systems. 26.2.1 Village Administration, Resettlement and Development All resettlement villages will become officially reco gnized administration units and have the rights, powers and responsibilities that go with this. The traditio nal Village Administration Committee (VAC) will be enhanced to a Village Resettlement Committee (VRC) and will after resett lement also work as a Village Development Committee (VDC). The VRC will have an el ected Village Chief who is in overall charge of village affairs. He/she is supported by one or two de puties (depending on village size) who are responsible for finance/tax and socio-cultur al affairs, respectively. These structures and positions, where they already exist, will be transfer red with the relocation. In cases where new resettlement villages are created by the co nsolidation of two or more existing villages, new elections (which are normally held every 2 years, anyway) will be held to make these appointments. During the transitional resettlement period, the vill age administration is actu ally termed the Village Resettlement Committees (VRC), who represents the community in regard to relocation issues. The VRC is responsible for village administration, and for all intents and purposes is al so the village development Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 3committee. As resettlement proceeds, ad hoc committees will be formed to deal with specific issues such as housing, finance (relocation allowances, etc), villa ge facilities, etc. Foll owing the transitional resettlement period, the VR C will most likely transf orm into the Village Deve lopment Committee (VDC), which will work closely with the village administr ation (if not actually the same as the village administration) and be responsible for not only village administration but also i ssues related to continued village development.). The members of the VRC/VDC will typically include: Village chief; Deputy Village Chief; LWU; The Lao Youth Union (LYO); The Lao National Front for Construction (L NFC) which includes the village elders; Village teacher (represe nting formal, non-formal and nursery Coordinator; Village Livestock Agent / Coordinator; Forestry Coordinator; Fisheries Coordinator. In the case of the NT2 Resettlement Areas, the village rs livelihoods will be based on the utilisation of an unusually large number of shared or community re sources. This will require the VDCs to focus on the management and development of a range of livelihood specific community resources, especially: reservoir fishers; resettlement ar ea forestry; irrigation; and drawdown zone grazing and agriculture. Thus, a range of livelihood specific co mmunity institutions will have to be developed, at both the village and whole resettlement area level, to deal with issues arising from resource management. 26.2.2 Reservoir and Fisheries Management Although the NT2 reservoir will be a va luable resource for resettled familie s, it will be used for a number of potentially competing and conflicting purposes by a wide variety of stakeholders. These multiple uses include power-generation, transport, conservation, fish ing, tourism, agriculture (drawdown area) and other recreational and income related purposes. In order to manage these diverse functions, a Reservoir Management Coordination Authority (RMCA), comprising representatives of all the major stakeholders, will be established to formulate policy and take all ma jor decisions in regard to reservoir management. It is essential that the diverse need of all resettlement villagers are fully represented in decisions taken by the RMA. To achieve this, a Village Reservoir Management Associatio n (VRMA) will be formed at the Resettlement Area level, comprising members of all village groups or commit tees formed to ensure sustainable and effective management of livelihood activities which rely on the reservoir or its resources. This Association will represent the combined interests of all resettleme nt villages in regard to reservoir management decisions by the RMA. For the VRMA to effectively represent member interests, which in some instances may be at variance to the interests of possibly more influential groups, it will require significant capacity building and support. At the village level, groups with interests in the rese rvoir and its resources will most likely be formed into Village Fisheries and Reservoir Ma nagement Committees (VFRMC), es tablished to promote reservoir- based activities within the community, including fishing, drawdown-area grazing, recession cropping, duck raising, and transport and tourism-related activities . The VFRMCs will thus represent village interests at the level of the entire resettlement area in re gard to reservoir management through the VRMA. Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 4The various institutions and diverse groups with an interest in reservoir management will need to be linked and organized if they are to effectively cooperat e in the best interests of all reservoir stakeholders, and a representation of these possible links and groups possible is presented in Figure 26-1. Figure 26-1: Possible Organizational Li nkages between Reservoir Stakeholders 26.2.3 Nakai Plateau Community Forestry Under PM Decree 193, resettlement villages have be en given the sole rights to the management and utilization of the forest resources in the resettlement area . To ensure their productive and sustainable management the Nakai Plateau Villa ge Forestry Association (NPVFA) has been established. The NPVFA will be controlled on behalf of an assembly of resettlement member families through their elected village representatives. Professional manage ment and technical staff will be hired to run the day to day business of the association. In the early years of operation, the NPVFA will be provided with intensive technical support by the RMU and Provincial and District Forestry Offices. Following capacity development, their main functions will be to make policy decisions in rega rd to the conduct of forest inventory and replanting programs, formulating sustainable management policies, developing appropriate operational plans and managing the processing and marketing of timber and wood products. A full description of the resettlement community commercial forestry program, the organizational and management structures, and the responsibilities of the NPVFA are provided in Chapter 23, and illustrate d below in Figure 26-2 (extracted from Chapter 23). At the village level, Village Fore stry Committees (VFC) will be estab lished to promote village forestry- based activities and represent village interests in regard to the management of the plateau forestry program through the NPVFA. It is anticipated that VFCs will become involved in issu es related to commercial forestry business, NTFP management, forest grazing, etc. on behalf of their village. VFCs will receive technical and management training prior to resettlement and during the first few years of commercial operation of the community forestry program.

They will also deal with user complaints and investigate reported cases of water theft or other abuses of the syst em. The WUG will also represent the village at the reservoir level in instances where issu es may arise relating to the drawing (pumping) of waters from the NT2 reservoir for use in village irri gation systems. The WUGs will receive technical and management training and support during the early years of resettlement and irrigation system operation and management. 26.2.5 Community Savings and Loans Groups Community savings and loans schemes will be introduced in all resettlement villages as an institutional mechanism to assist in the transition to a market economy. For many households, the new livelihoods following resettlement will be their first experience wi th managing money. This is obviously of economic relevance, but also important from a social perspective as the availability of cash has the potential to introduce a number of social evils such as gambling, alcohol-abuse, etc. The purpose of these savings loan groups ( orm sap) is to develop basic money management skills , demonstrate the benefits of saving and investment, and provide a source of credit to resettle d households for use in cases of family emergencies. 26.2.6 Other Groups Other community support institutions will be established according to local conditions and perceived needs of the villagers. These might include women's gr oups to promote the social and economic interests of women, production groups through which produ cers of a common commodit y can provide technical and material support to other members, marketing groups for the joint marketing of produce (for example fish, NTFPs, etc.), village school committees to su pport and guide education according to community needs and aspirations, and other groups, as necessary. 26.3 LABOUR ISSUES At the family level, each family will have to decide how to best utilize their la bour resources. In rural Lao families, both the male and female family heads are fully involved in livelihood activiti es (food and income generating activities). Children may also be involved to varying degrees, depending on age, time spent at school etc. Older, post-school aged children who have not yet married to form their own family usually contribute just as much labour as family heads. Ca re of younger children, house building and tool making or repair are the major non-income or food generating activities undertaken. The resettlement plans offer of a range of livelihood options that will challenge resettlers, in that the type of labour skills required are relatively new, and in that they will have to chose which activities best suit their current or potential future sk ills and availability. In addition, the transition period during the construction and operation of the NT2 Project will have significant impacts on the labour demand for skilled and non-skilled workers, which should increase dramatically during the 3 to 4 year construction period. There will be additional oppo rtunities in the service sector duri ng this time, some of which may carry into the long term. 26.3.1 Construction Labour Opportunities High expectations for employment as non-skilled labourers have been expressed during many of the consultations with villagers. Many welcome and support the Project hoping to acquire positions during the construction phase. Some villagers are familiar with wage labour since logging companies have employed a small number of villagers over the years. In a rural economy that is in the process of being monitorized, employment opportunities are seen as a potential means of quickly improving one's standard of living. As explained in Chapter 3, the Lao Labour Law provides for priority being given to Lao over foreign workers, provided that the quantity and quality of the labour force is comparable. There are also provisions for training, and the stipulation that the supervision of recruitment procedures be the responsibility of a nominated GOL agency. One responsibility of the nomin ated agency is to prepare and implement a Lao Labour Preference Plan before recruitment for the Project commences. Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 7 An estimated that at least 3,000-4,000 semi or un-s killed workers will be required during the peak construction period, although these will be distributed over the three main construction areas (Nakai Dam, Plateau and downstream (Gnommalat) areas. On the assumption that about 800 semi and unskilled workers are required on the Plateau du ring the main years of construc tion, about 373 of these could be filled by resettlers. The remaining labour - mainly se mi skilled and skilled - will be recruited from outside the area. It is in the interests of the construction contractors to employ local people, not only for the possible savings in not having to provide accommodation an d facilities for outside workers but also to establish good relations with the local communities. Th e number of full time positions in the operational phase that could be taken by resettlers could range from 20 to 50 (on the Plateau only). Not all able-bodied resettlers will want employment on the Project due to unfamiliarity with this type of work and other priorities, not least building one's house and developing one's farm plot. Experience from the Nam Theun Hinboun Hydropower Proj ect indicates that there will be hi gh interest initially, but, being unfamiliar with a disciplined work routine and the hard work, many will opt fo r the flexibility of selling agricultural produce or engaging in other service sector activities that can be combined with the agricultural cycle and social priorities. It is excep ted that families along the road with more diversified economies (not solely dependent on agriculture) and with a generally higher percentage of lowland families who are literate and more experienced in work ing as labourers will find employment during the construction period. It is possible that employment during the construction period might reduce the time spent on developing other aspects of the new livelihood options in terms of available labour input. This aspect will be monitored, and action taken accordin gly to encourage families to balanc e their short and long term labour inputs and income potential. 26.3.2 Livelihood development and long term non-farm labour During resettlement site preparation, the resettlers will be encouraged to contribute their own labour on a remunerated basis in order to create familiarity with the new site, to foster responsibility and attachment through the establishment of a new home, and to provide a source of transitional income. It is important for resettlers that the process of relocation is a gradual one, allowing social, psychological and cultural adjustment to their new surroundin gs. Labour requirements for the development of new farm lands to full production are outlined in Chapte rs 19 and 25. It is estimated th at approximately 750 person-days (250 labour days over a three-year pe riod) of labour will provided by ea ch resettlement household as paid project labour, at the rate of about 2/3 average daily wage, and usually paid in rice. If it is paid for in cash, it will be paid into a village bank. This labour, an d its income component, is incorporated into the development model of the live lihoods of the resettlers. It is difficult to estimate the number of households that will derive a portion of their incomes from off- farm employment but the integrate d livelihood scenarios presented in Table 25-4 is presenting a calculation of figures. 26.4 POVERTY A survey of the 1998 economic situation on the Plateau reveals that the average income per household is only US $450, compared to the Lao poverty line set at US$ 837 in 1997/98. The target family income for resettled households is initially this National Poverty Line, with a longer term target of raising average village income to the national average for rural areas. 26.4.1 Multi-dimensional Aspects of Poverty The World Bank's Report on Poverty Alleviation through Agricultural Projects (Economic Development Institute, WB) states that poverty is \"multi-dimen sional\" and involves more than focusing on income levels. Poverty alleviation also involves health, educ ation and access to resources to improve the standard of living, the so-called \"human development index.\" Part of the resettlement plan for the Nakai Plateau involves providing improved infrastr ucture (roads), health care (dispensaries and access to medicine and medical advice), schools and other social facilit ies such as domestic water and electricity. Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 8A recent study undertaken by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), titled Participatory Poverty Assessment in Lao PDR (June 2001) confirms this mult idimensional aspect by means of an extensive assessment of the whole country using participatory methodologies. The main findings of this report reveal that poverty is measured by villagers in terms of absence of rice suffici ency (food security) and the number of livestock (a source of cash income). Other si gnifiers are availability of arable land (shortened fallow cycles), water supplies, poor he alth facilities and lack of labour. These conclusions mirror in many respects the situation on the Nakai Plateau and confirm the importance of sustainable livelihood systems of the SDP strategy. 26.4.2 Poverty and Resettlement The present social situation on the Plateau is poor with high mortality rates, a lack of proper medical facilities, few schools that operate an d only logging tracks and trails as a means of getting to towns where there are markets and medical help. The resource ba se is deteriorating due to increased population pressure and unsustainable use of natural resources an d previous logging activities on the Plateau. All villages acknowledge a gradual decrease in forest re sources (damar resin, rattan and edible roots) and declining yields of rice. The underlying problem is a lack of money and skills to overcome the difficulties caused by the poor soils, flooding and a shortened cycle of fallow period for swidden fields. In the case of the Nakai Plateau, the balance between the human population and available natural resources, including rainfed rice production, cannot be sustained in its present form. For the population on the Plateau to improve its st andard of living, new mean s of livelihood must be found, regardless of the NT2 Project. Resettlement includes a significant addition to existing livelihood systems through the addition of incr eased fisheries, forestry, and employment opportunities. Even though these are not completely 'new' livelihood systems, th ere are nevertheless new elements and variations of existing livelihood systems. Hence, training and management will be required in order to make these systems work. In addition to dealing with gene ral income and quality-of-life pove rty issues, the SDP attempts to explicitly identify particularly vulnerable groups such as female headed households, the elderly, the poorest of the poor. The intention is to provide all Potent ially Vulnerable Households (PVH) with additional support. Monitoring systems have been designed to identify PVH groups, provide special assistance and to track their progress in regard to poverty alleviation objectives. The approach, implementation strategy and monitoring considerations for resettlement, livelihood improvements and service improvements conform to World Bank Operational Directive 4.15 on Poverty Reduction. The SDP confirms to government policy concerning poverty reduction, \"promoting growth that makes efficient use of labour\" and \"enabling the poor to respond to opportunities to improve their well-being\" through the livelihood proposals in Chapters 22-25, and a detailed consultation process and incorporation of concerns as outlined in Chapter 4. 26.5 GENDER There is a clear division of labour based on gender on the Plateau and in the surrounding project areas, and this reflects the position of women in Lao society in general. It appears that men hold practically all positions of authority, undertake most of the activities that bring them into contact with other communities outside the village as well as doing a ll the heavy work. Women are much more household and village oriented both occupationally and socially , and thus have more limited exposure to the outside world than men. This makes them particularly vulnerable to resettlement into a new location. Female mobility appears to be restricted by the realities of frequent pregnancies, nursing and minding children, and being responsible for housework and kitchen gardens. Even so, women are more economically active than men when it comes to buying and selling and many walk a considerab le distance to local markets to trade for rice. In general, women are in charge of the household economy and control family cash spending. While women have ideas and concerns that differ from men, they are reluctant to express their opinions, partly because women themselves view decision making as the prerogative of male villagers and partly Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 9because they fear being ridiculed. Lack of female ed ucation and organization fu rther reduces their ability, or their own perceptions of their ability, to take part in community decision making. Few girls receive more than a minimal amount of formal education, if any at all. National statistics show significantly lower female enrolment rates in highland schools than in lowland schools (Country Report on Women in the Economic Development of the Lao PDR, 1996). This is probably only of relative validity in the project area since literacy rates are low for both sexes. Girls take responsibility for minding younger children and other household chores at an early ag e. Female education is not considered important because most girls will marry young, bear children an d remain responsible mainly for household tasks that are not viewed as requiring formal learning. Thus, the existing limited educational opportunities are reserved largely for boys because they are expected to deal with the outside world and increasingly need to acquire skills to procure employment and deal with outside authorities. Given the constraints on female mobility, lower levels of education and a general reluctance to be involved in decision making, all of the women in th e village will be targeted during the resettlement. 26.5.1 Gender Resettlement Strategy There are two complementary approaches to gender / women in development: the equity approach, which aims to improve women's decision-making powers in relation to men, and the anti-poverty approach which concerns special programs for women with the goal of improving their socio-economic conditions. Both approaches give women more control over their own time and money. In this context, there are a number of aspects of the SDP Projec t that directly affect women that encompass both approaches. 1. Improved labour opportunities in the resettled villages: Most of th e work, such as caring for vegetable gardens, small livestock and plots of cash-crops in the vicinity of the house have traditionally been women's responsibilities. With improved agricultur al methods and better yields, there should be more food for the family grown near the household (money saved) and possibly surpluses which can be sold in local markets (m oney earned). However, these improved opportunities can lead to increased workloads for women, creating additional burden and causing greater stress. The gender dis-aggregated monitoring system for labour will enab le any trends of this na ture to be identified and amelioration measures taken. 2. Labour opportunities in forest management : Caring for seedlings and weed ing in the community forests will provide women with another source of income . This income could go directly into the household budget. In the resettled BPKP village, Ban Jat San, it was mostly women who did the work on the nearby plantation. 3. Clinics: The greater availability of medical facilities will give women access to medicine and proper advice on a range of topics which affect their lives . Women are responsible for the sick, the infirm and elderly as well as the care of young children. Improved access to medical facilities will be an important improvement and can save money and time, as well as the obvious improvements in pre- and post-natal care. Awar eness raising and the provision of family planning advice will be undertaken in all resettlement v illages in conjunction with LWU. 4. Schools: The introduction of more schools will allow more children between the ages of 5 and 12 to attend. This will relieve mothers of some of th e childcare burden and a llow them more time for income generation activities. Convenient access to schooling is also expected to lead to greater opportunities for girls. Coupled wi th the provision of nursery scho ols, which will re duce the burden of care for younger siblings, this is expected to lead to higher female school attendance rates. These will be monitored, and awareness raising and co unselling will be undertak en with recalcitrant families. 5. Availability of clean water : The introduction of convenient dome stic water supplies in resettlement villages will have a positive impact on all memb ers of the community, bu t especially women and children. Hygiene standards and consequently he alth will improve and the time-consuming burden of carrying water, usually an activity of women and young girls, will be significantly reduced. Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 106. New Roads: Improved transportation is beneficial to both men and women but has a special importance for women since they make most of the trips to the market to purchase food and supplies and to sell agricultural and forest products. Again this will improve women's economic earning power, most of which goes directly to caring for the needs of the family. These benefits would allow women to earn more money by means of reducing the time spent within the confines of the domestic sphere and its reliance on men for cash income. Money earned goes for the most part to improving the lot of the family such that development for women means development for the next generation as well. The Lao Women's Union (LWU) will pl ay a key role in ensuring women are equal beneficiaries of the development of the Nakai Plateau. A representative alre ady exists in each village, although how active they are varies considerably. These representatives need to be mobilized and trained to guide development on the village level. The LWU will play a key role in pr e- and post-relocation activities in such areas as vegetable gardens, health care an d other aspects of livelihood traini ng. Village Resettlement Committees will consist of at least one member of the LWU, and the LWU is also represented on the staff of the Resettlement Management Unit as Deputy Manager. 26.6 EDUCATION Under the SDP, three types of educational support are en visaged: (i) nursery and cr\u00e8che-type facilities, (ii) primary and secondary schooling, and (iii) adult education and vocational training. 26.6.1 Nursery Education Nursery facilities will be provided in every resettlement village to impr ove the welfare of infants and to relieve their parents of the task of ch ildcare during the day at busy times. Infant education and the development of early life sk ills in an appropriate environment is now known to be critical in determining later development potential. It is important that toddlers and infants interact with their own age group during the critical period of developing inter-pers onal communication skills. Currently, many plateau infants are denied this opportunity as they are cared for by older siblings, elderly relatives or left to their own devices in a small field-hut, while their parents work on their swiddens. It is therefore pr oposed to establish nursery fa cilities, either as part of the village primary school or independently in each rese ttlement village. Nursery arrangements wi ll also include some form of cr\u00e8che facilities for the very young, manage d by the village women's group, with the assistance and support of the LWU. The cr\u00e8che and nursery facility will be equipp ed (through SDP funding) with such items as educational toys, bedding and mosquito-nets for aftern oon naps, first-aid kits, support for school-lunch and other essentials. Young mothers will be trained in basic nurs ery teaching and mana gement techniques, who could then continue to supervise the infants on a rotational basis after SDP support ends. By means of the village nursery/cr\u00e8che facilities, not only will resettled infants be provided with an appropriate environment for early development, but their parents w ill have time to undertake other livelihood tasks during the day. The expected resu lt being that they will be more likely to provide additional 'quality-time' with their young family in th e evenings when they are free from other worries and responsibilities. 26.6.2 Primary and Secondary Schooling In many villages on the Nakai Plateau, schools are not functioning proper ly due to the lack of adequate facilities, the difficulties of recruiting properly qua lified teachers and the low sa laries offered. Attendance rates are generally low, particularly among girls of school-age, and only about a third of the population have any schooling at all. Although, in theory, every official village should have its own school, in some villages, primary schools have no t operated at all for a number of years. There are some notable exceptions to the general rule, in particular the comparatively large schools in Oudomsouk and Nakai Neua villages, demonstrating that, with proper fac ilities and qualified staff, a good education can be offered as a 'Basic-Right' to all children. Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 1126.6.2.1 Primary Schools Under the SDP, a primary school w ill be constructed, equipped and s taffed with qualified teachers in every resettlement village. Where possibl e, teachers will be recruited from the District and the resettlement villagers themselves. This will be made facilitated by the adult ed ucation programs and the improved secondary schooling to be provided under the SDP, which will raise lo cal capacity levels. These etahcers will be more in touch with local cu lture and the future livelihood needs of their pupils and are more likely to remain in their positions. Scholarships for approp riate candidates from the resettled population for further education and teacher-training will be consider ed as a means of supporting this longer-term goal. The attendance of school-age children, particularly girls, will be closely monitored so that problems of natural or enforced truancy can be identified earl y, and ameliorative measures and support provided. Awareness-raising programs for parents on the importance of schooling will be conducted and community involvement in each village school will be encouraged by holding pare nt-teacher meetings, and through the formation of village school committees. The role of these committees, very much like a board of community school governors, will be to offer suppor t to the village school, pr ovide feedback from the community, and give guidance on educational concer ns and the needs of the community in regard to schooling. Dependent on the wishes of resettled v illagers, consideration will be given to integrating the proposed village meeting halls with the school building, thus providing a number of potential advantages: Promoting stronger links between the community and the school and making it a center for community activities. Providing the school with additional facilities that can be used periodically, as required. Providing a location for information dissemination and awareness programs through notices, posters, etc. with access to school children and the general public alike. Savings in both school and meeting hall construction costs. Involving village schools in community development in itiatives has proved extremely successful in other parts of the Lao PDR and across the region. The villa ge school is a valuable community resource, it usually has the best educated members of the community as teachers, it has adequate buildings and land resources, and most importantly, it provides a dir ect communication channel to virtually every household in the village, through the school children themselves . School-based livelihoo d development activities have the potential, not only to provide a valuable co mmunity service, but also to teach the school children necessary future livelihood skills, of ten more locally-appropriate than literacy and numeracy skills. Under the SDP, adequate facilities and land areas will be provided for a variety of school-based livelihood development programs. These might include agriculture trials and demonstrations to test new crops or improved varieties, testing and comparing differen t composting techniques to encourage the use of organic fertilizer, IPM trials to develop pe sticide-free crop protec tion measures, etc. 26.6.2.2 Secondary Schooling The resettlement needs for secondary education are more difficult to assess than for primary schooling. Only four percent of the resettlement population have any secondary schooling at all, and the numbers attending high-school, college and university are neglig ible. It is the intention of the SDP to improve this situation by the provision of improved access to secondary schooling. Further surveys and studies will be conducted to obtain information on future required needs, existing secondary school facilities, and the potential to either expa nd or improvement of e xisting facilities and/or by the establishment of new schools. Based on the outcome of these studies, access to an d the quality of secondary education opportunities for the younger generation of the resettled population will be improved. In addition, steps will be taken to ensure that the type of secondary education offered will be made more relevant to the new livelihood needs and employment opportunities for resettled school-leavers. The aim is to view the current school- age population as the future teachers, nurses, agri cultural extension agents, vets, community forestry management staff, etc. who will serv e the livelihood needs of the resettled population. In this respect, the Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 12school-based livelihood development program propos ed for primary schools has added relevance and importance, and will be modified and implemen ted at the secondary school level as well. 26.6.3 Adult Education and Vocational Training Formal education levels in adults are even lower than they are for the young age groups. This poses a considerable risk for the resettlement process as a whol e, as many of the adults making the key decisions on behalf of their families and comm unities have had little or no school ing and may be illiterate and lack basic numeracy skills. Compared to an average of 31 percent of the entire rese ttlement population having had some formal education, only 7 percent of household heads have had any education at all. It is for this very reason that the SDP has adopted a participatory planning approach from the outset. Although the approach has enabled people of any educational level to participate, it has made the planning process a slow one. Nevertheless, the participatory approaches and tools used have had a capacity development effect on the pa rticipants involved. The result is that key decision makers in the resettlement population now have a much better understanding of the issues involved and have developed many new skills for analyzing information an d making appropriate decisions. Th is participatory approach will continue throughout the entire resettlement period and is expected to lead to further, ongoing capacity development. 26.6.3.1 Adult literacy Education support to the adult population will include a program to raise literacy and numeracy levels in the general population, by providing training in readin g, writing and basic arithmetic to all adults who are interested. This will begin with an awareness-raising program emphasizi ng the importance of these basic skills in the new livelihood systems that resettlement will bring, and explaining the type(s) of training on offer. One possible option that is being considered is to use the school-based community development program approach described in the preceding section on Primary Schools. Under this scenario, school children would be asked to repeat some of their lessons with parents in the evening. Appropriate books, teaching aids and specially modified materials woul d be developed and used for such a program. This approach has a number of potential advantages: Adults are more likely to be receptive to informal training in their own homes compared to formal courses with their peers where they may be embarrassed of making mistakes in public. Lessons learned by schoolchildren during the day will be reinforced by additional exercises in the evening. It would help to promote family unity and harmony by bringing households together for a common task in the evenings. It would reduce costs and allow lessons to occur at a time of the day when people are free from routine livelihood activities. Some of the community group activities described in Section 26.2.1 will also cont ribute to raising literacy and numeracy levels in the resettled adult population. For example the training provided and the skills developed under the propose d village savings and loans program is expected to add significantly to arithmetic and simple accounting ability. 26.6.3.2 Livelihood training A range of livelihood focused training courses are planned under the SDP in support of the livelihood options provided to resettlers. In ge neral, orientation and training will be provided to all, based on their interest. For the major economic activities (i.e. agricult ure, livestock, forestry and fishing) training will be provided at village level as many villagers are likely to embark on these. Also training in savings and credit will be provided to all interested villagers. For more specific activities (e.g. weaving, wickerwo rk, food processing, mechanics), where there is a limited market for the product, villagers will have to select, which field they will focus on taking into consideration the amount of support given to each village as well as the market. Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 13 Table 26-1 presents examples of the type of training courses that might be offered to community specialists under each general livel ihood type. Emphasis will be placed on the integration of training activities across different livelihood components. For example, non-farm carpentry training will be offered to make best use of the timber produced by the forestry livelihood option; plumbing and electrician training will be provided to facili tate local repair and maintenance; an d non-farm fish processing training will be offered to increase the value of fish caught from the reservoir.

Savings and loans Micro-credit 26.7 CULTURAL HERITAGE 26.7.1 Archaeological, Cultural and Historical Aspects There are no known archaeological or historical sites in the area to be flooded by the NT2 reservoir. No evidence of prehistoric human habitation and no stone implements or other indications of Paleolithic or Neolithic habitation have been found. A detailed Physic al Cultural Resources Survey will be carried out in 2004 to confirm these initial findings and make any additional recommendations. Due to the mobility of the population on the Plateau and the disrup tion caused by war and invasion, there are very few items of archaeological or historical importance. There are several temples constructed of wood, stupas made of stone or concrete, gravesites and the remains of the foundations of a hunting lodge built by a Lao viceroy and located near the present location of Ban Nakai Tai. In the case of village temples and stupas, adequate measures will be taken for their transportation to new village sites or new buildings of at least a similar qua lity and value is constructed. The present temples at the villages of Ban Done, Ban Khone Khen and Ban Boua Ma are not in good condition, and it is expected that these village s opt for new buildings. Stupas and other religious structures such as spirit houses (simple structures made of bam boo and thatch) for village spirits ( phi muang , phi thiem and phi mau ) may be moved by the villagers themselves. There are local rituals and procedures for moving such objects and adjustments to schedules such as the selection of an auspicious day for commencing the relocation that will be made. The allowance of US$ 15 per person during relocation includes the costs of rituals (sacrifice of small pig or chicken and jars of rice wine for celebrations for the spirits) when leaving the old village and entering the new one. Similar measures and ritual observances may be necessary regarding appeasing spirits of deceased relatives at gravesites, although this does not seem to be the practice among the majority of the villages on the Plate au. Consultations with villagers and ri tual experts revealed that it is not necessary to remove bones from gravesites as long as the correct rituals are performed. Measures will Chapter 26: Social Developmen t and Community Strengthening November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 14be taken not to locate new houses near gravesites or any other spiritually important locations such as places where spirits are believed to reside. Measures will be taken to avoid locating houses close to the foundations of the old hunting lodge, on which a school is now located. This site will not be inundated by the reservoir. The same measures will be taken for all project construction lands, incl uding campsites, access roads, spoil tiles and quarries. 26.7.2 Cultural and Religious Property Recovery and Relocation Recovery and relocation of the few moveable archaeological and historical artefacts from the Ban Nakai Tai area and other communities (e.g . Buddha images) will be completed in conjunction with provincial and district Culture and Informat ion Offices. Consultations and negotiations will be carried out to determine culturally acceptable relocation to nominated sites. The historical artefacts near Ban Nakai Tai may not have to be moved but can be integrated in to the new village in the immediate vicinity. According to villagers in consultati on meetings, it will not be necessary to relocate village cemeteries, on the condition that appeasement rituals for relocation of village spirits ( phi muang ) are held. The villagers have indicated that all items that may be regarded as 'cultural property' will be easily incorporated in the move with their other belongings. This includes small Buddha statues that are kept in the local temples or in houses. Appropriate protective and/or salvage measures will be adopted if any archaeologically significant properties are uncovered during the NT2 Project construction phase. ********** * * * ********** Chapter 27: Scheduling of Plateau Resettlement Program November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 iCHAPTER 27 SCHEDULING OF PLATEAU RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM Table of Content 27.1 INTRODUCTION - BASIS OF SCHEDULING ....................................................................1 27.1.1 Linkage to Hydropower Construction Schedule................................................................................... ........1 27.1.2 Social Cons iderat ions.......................................................................................................... ...............................2 27.1.3 Duration of Re settlement....................................................................................................... ...........................3 27.2 INSTITUTIONS ............................................................................................................. 3 27.2.1 Resettlement Mana gement External M onitori ng............................................................................................................ ...............................4 27.3 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL SERVICES SCHEDULING ........................... 4 27.3.1 Community Development and Income Support ....................................................................................... ....4 27.4 HEALTH PROGRAM SCHEDULING ............................................................................... 8 27.4.1 Resettlers' Heal th Program ..................................................................................................... ..........................8 27.4.2 Regional Health Program ........................................................................................................ ..........................8 27.5 RESETTLEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE SCHEDULING ...................................................... 8 27.6 RESETTLEMENT LIVELIHOODS SCHEDULING ............................................................13 27.6.1 Forestry Development Program................................................................................................... ..................13 27.6.2 Agriculture and Livestoc k Developmen t Program .................................................................................. ....17 27.6.3 Reservoir Fisheries Developmen t and Management Program...................................................................23 List of Tables Table 27-1: Schedule of Key Hydropower Construction Activities Relevant to Plateau Resettlement, and of Key Plateau Resettlement Programs. ......................................................................................................... .................................................... 2 Table 27-2: Timetable of the Main Acti vities of the Community Development Program.............................................. ..................... 5 Table 27-3: Timetable of the Main Acti vities of the Resettlement Infrastructure Program........................................ ......................... 9 Table 27-4: Timetable of the Main Acti vities of the Community Fo restry Development Progra m..................................... ............ 14 Table 27-5: Timetable of the Main Activi ties of the Agriculture and Livestock De velopment Program. ............................. .......... 18 Table 27-6: Timetable of the Main Activi ties of the Reservoir Fisheries Developm ent and Management Program..................... 24 Chapter 27: Scheduling of Plateau Resettlement Program November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 127 SCHEDULE OF PLATEAU RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM 27.1 INTRODUCTION - BASIS OF SCHEDULING 27.1.1 Linkage to Hydropower Construction Schedule The timing of implementation of the social and rese ttlement activities on the Nakai Plateau is closely related to the timing and scheduling of hydropower construction activities. Current planning is that Financial Close would be achieved on 31 April 2005, although the notice to pr oceed on main construction activities1 would be issued on 1 April 2005, that the dam would be closed around May 2008 and then full COD around October 2009.t . The key or main reference date of the construction ac tivities for the plateau resettlement process is the date of closure of the Nakai Dam , as all affected villages and dwellin gs on the plateau must be relocated before that date. The construction schedule specifies that the Nakai dam would be closed 37 months after start of construction, which will be 37 months after 1 April 2005. Thus, the Nakai Dam is planned to be closed on or about 1 May 2008, which is th e start of the 2008 wet season (see Table 27-1). Other construction scheduling dates of importance to resettlement and social development include: (i) Date of closure of the coffer dam , the crest height of which will be 520 EL. In a normal rainfall year the diversion tunnel shou ld be able to handle all of the Nam Theun wet season flow, and thus the coffer dam will not overflow. In these years, the small reservoir created at or below 520 EL by the coffer dam would not pose any problem to the dwellings of current plateau villages. However, in a year of above average rainfall the diversion tunnel may not be able to handle all of the Nam Theun wet season flows, and the coffer dam would overtop (and thus construction impeded) for a period of days, weeks or (improbably) months. When the coffer dam overflows, the elevation of water at the coffer dam would be > 520 EL, possibly up to 525 EL in a very wet year. In this case, the (temporary) reservoir created by the coffer dam and its overflow would create a reservoir which could slightly flood the dwelling ar eas of some villages (the bulk of which are above 526 EL, except for Ban Sop Hia) and the agri cultural fields of some villages. Flooding of the Nakai Plateau and fields already o ccurs in some years, and as long as people are fully informed of the possibility of increased flooding or flooding for a longer period than usual due to this coffer dam, then this issue may not be a trigger for earlier relocation per se. Notwithstanding this, it is planned to resettle the lower villagers - those that may be affected by increased level or duration of seasonal flooding due to the coffer dam - as the first group of villages (see Chapter 19). (ii) Dates that new plateau resettlement area roads are constructed. The NTPC, through its HCJV, will build a new road from Oudomsouk to Talang (and onwards) and this road will be the new access road for village s relocated to the north of the central town of Oudomsouk. If these northern v illages can be relocated and deve loped using the current, not this proposed new road, then the date of construction of the new road is not so significant. In any case, at least the alignment of this new road must be known to resettlement planners so that the layout of the new village housing and agricultural plots ca n be consistent with access to the new road. The same issue applies to the NTPC/HCJV construction of the road running south from Oudomsouk to access the southern saddle dams. (iii) Dates of backfilling with spoil and saddle dam construction in Oudomsouk village. A considerable area of the current Oudomsouk village is below 540 EL, and dwellings or buildings below this line would have to be relocated. Thus, to assist in this problem (of loss of land in Oudomsouk village, the District centre), it is pr oposed that many of the areas below 540 EL in Oudomsouk village will be backfilled with spoil fr om the excavation of the headrace channel and 1 PCA or Preliminary Construction Ac tivities started in November 2003. Chapter 27: Scheduling of Plateau Resettlement Program November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2intake tunnel. The actual date that such spoil is deposited will be crucial to the date of relocation (and re-establishment) of buildings - houses, shops, some public buildings - in Oudomsouk village. (iv) Date of dam closure and reservoir im poundment, May 2008 and October 2009 respectively. before dam close and filling of the reservoir, full irrigation (expect for three small systems) and the reservoir fisheries activities cannot be initiated. However, some irrigation cons truction will need to be undertaken and completed prior to inundation, while the header tanks and on-farm systems can be undertaken after. Building of fish landings etc would be undertaken only after filling and emptying of the reservoir for at least one cycle. Table 27-1 below presents an overview of some of the key hydropower construction dates and how plateau resettlement activities will be scheduled in relation to the hydropower construction dates. Table 27-1: Schedule of Key Hydropower Cons truction Activities Relevant to Plateau Resettlement, and of Key Pl ateau Resettlement Programs.

For example; (a) As many of resettlers' new livelihoods - fisheries and irrigation - depend on the water and fisheries resources of the Nakai Reservoir, re location before reservoir filling w ill mean that the initiation of these new livelihoods will initially not be possble. From this point of view, delaying relocation as close as possible to reservoir filling may be pr eferable (although not necessarily feasible). (b) The location of the new villages will be closely linked to the constructi on of new roads in the resettlement areas, and thus coordinating relocation with the construction of these access routes would be necessary. (c) The start of construction will see the influx of large numbers of people onto the Nakai Plateau, mainly in and around Oudomsouk town, and possibly along the construction routes of the new routes north (to Talang) and sout h (to saddle dams). These people will create two, potentially opposite, impacts or opportunities: (c.1) the influx of people will create markets for produce, and job opportunities. The plateau villagers may wish to take advantage of these better opportunities, and th ey may be able to do this more easily if they were resident in their new relocation sites, in which case they would (a) be producing at least wet season crops, and (b) closer to job opportunities. Thus, from this perspective an earlier move would be preferable. Chapter 27: Scheduling of Plateau Resettlement Program November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3(c.2) on the other hand, this inflow of peoples and markets will most lik ely cause some social pressures. Trying to establish a new village and new livelihoods within th e context of this new social environment may cause problems. From th is perspective a delay in relocation may be preferable. However, as construction will continue for a time after the start of reservoir filling, it may not be practical to avoid to period, and thus this is not considered as a factor for the timing of resettlement. (d) A major consideration for resettlement implementation is the logistic, technical and social ability of villagers in the 15 villages to, in parallel, develop new villages ands new livelihoods. It is planned to move all the villages (except Ba n Nong Boua) in the two years immediately following Financial Close. The NTPC and the RMU are now developing the required logistical and managerial organisation, while the villagers involvement in public consultations to date, and the on-going preparatory community development activities on-going should ensure that they have the absorptive capacity to participate effectively in this schedule. 27.1.3 Duration of Resettlement Any discussion on resettlement scheduling should consider; (a) the date of starting; and (b) the date of finishing of the resettlement - End of Resettlement - which is more than just the finish of relocation, but related to the esta blishment of sustainable resettled villages and livelihoods. The Concession Agreement (Schedule 4, Part 1, clau se 2) provides a definition of the Resettlement Planning Period, and this may be slightly modified to read \" .... that period in which plans are developed and finalized, which will commence some months or years prior to occurrence of Financial Close and finish when all those plans and activities are finalised, which may occur some y ears after Financial Close for certain activities..\" Similarly, the Resettlement Implementation Period may be modified to read ... \"... the \"Resettlement Implementation Period\" being the period for the implementation of resettlement act ivities, which will commence on the date of actual commencement of key activities of th e resettlement process, being (a) for plateau relocation, the year on which any vill age is actually relocated, (b) for any livelih ood activity, the year in which that live lihood activity should commence, and (c) for any other activity, the date on which the first activity in that pr ogram is commenced, providing that the Resettlement Committee has approved or provided its non objectio n to the commencement of that resettlemen t activity......and which will end when the RC is satisfied, on advice from the Panel of Experts, that the Resettlement Objectives and Resettlement Provisions have been achieved\" . It is the intention of the Project th at these Objectives and Provisions w ill be achieved within a period of eight to ten years (depending on the actual achievement of livelihood targets), commencing at Financial Close, and extending to some five years after COD. It should be noted however, that even after the end of the Resettlement Period per se, the NTPC has committed to the provision to th e GOL of US$300,000 every year (ca lled the Social amd Environment Remediation Fund - SERF budget), for the full 25 year Operating Period as defined by the Concession Agreement. This program budget is to ensure the maintainence and operation of resettlement infrastructure and to implement any further programs required to ensure the sus tainability of livelihoods of the resettled villagers. 27.2 INSTITUTIONS 27.2.1 Resettlement Management Unit The GOLs Resettlement Management Unit (RMU) and the other GOL agencies it supports and coordinates (the District Resettlement and/or Compensation Working Groups, and the Provincial level Resettlement Committee) were originally envisaged to operate for 8 years, from Financial Close to COD plus three years. However, the RMU, the DRWGs and th e RC are active now, befo re Financial Close, will now continue to about 5 years after Commercial Operations Date. Chapter 27: Scheduling of Plateau Resettlement Program November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 427.2.2 Resettlement Office As for the RMU above, the NTPCs Resettlement Office (RO) was also originally envisaged to start operations at Financial Close, but has actually been in operation for more than a year prior to Financial Close. 27.2.3 External Monitoring A team or agency will be employed by GOL to cond uct in independent external monitoring. This team will be engaged and active for the approximately nine year Resettlement Implementation Period, starting at Financial Close and continuing thru to about five years after Financial Close. 27.3 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL SERVICES SCHEDULING 27.3.1 Community Development and Income Support Community Development and Social Strengthening activities have commenced prior to Financial Close, in order to prepare GOL staff and villa ger institutions. The activities w ill increase (reach a peak) duration during the actual relocation, and will continue for the duration of the whole resettlement period. The community development program has four (4) major components, as follows: (i) General community development and social strengthening of the ethnic communities and indigenous organisations on the Nakai plateau, including: village resettlement committe es formation and training, mainly between October 2001 and October 2003, while participator y development of planning w ill focus from 2004 to 2006, as required and in parallel to the reestablishment of villages; resettlement site and livelihood consultations, starting before Financial Close and continuing until no longer required; the implementation of cultural and spiritual heritage plans, focused mainly around the time of actual relocation; the training and support to other community organisations, such as Lao Women's Union, the youth organisation and the Lao National Front for Construction, which have already started and will continue until about five years after Financial Close; the establishment and operation of v illage savings and loans facilities. (ii) Support to the development of, and training in off-farm income generating activities, a program which will be conducted at a medium leve l throughout the Resettlement Period. (iii) The provision of rice support (also called income support) to villagers, if required, and food support for vulnerable families is planned for the whole Resettlement Period. However, it is expected that this program will focus on the transi tion period, and thus be less required or active during the second half of the period. (iv) The provision of formal and informal education for ethnic minority plateau resettlers throughout the nine to ten year Resettlement Period.

Social Development Plan - Volume 2 827.4 HEALTH PROGRAM SCHEDULING 27.4.1 Resettlers' Health Program A range of public health related activities will be developed to address health issues of the plateau resettling populations. While activities will be focused on the relocation and the construction periods, the medium and long term will see the conduct of monito ring, and response programs to address any health problems which may arise from the water resource deve lopment aspects of the NT2 Project, or from the slight change in lifestyles that will be experien ced by the ethnic minorities on the Plateau. 27.4.2 Regional Health Program The Regional Health Program is being developed to address non-plateau resettlement health issues. It will focus initially public health activities during and rel ated to the construction period. It will then establish a monitoring and response program to address any health problems which may arise from the water resource development aspects of the Project, especial ly along the Downstream Channel and along the Xe Bangfai. The detailed scheduling of the Health programs is undergoing finalisation. 27.5 RESETTLEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE SCHEDULING Prior to and just after Financial Close, topographic surveys of relocation site s will precede the detailed design of the layout of village house and farm plots. Sites will then be cleared by the villagers themselves. Unexploded Ordinance will then be surveyed and clea red from all resettlement areas. This survey and clearance effort will depend on the level of contam ination, and for planning purposes, areas of light, moderate and heavy contaminated land will be identified. It will take place mainly in the two year period starting at just before Financial Cl ose and continuing until about FC+2. Roads and drains will be designed and constructed, an d actual house and agricultural plots marked in the field. The next step is the construction of the house 's. Those villages relocating only a short distance can opt to remain in their original village while their new houses are being construc ted. However, for distant villagers who want to be involved in the construc tion of their own houses, or whose villages may be affected by the coffer dam, a move to the house plots just prior to house construction would enable them to participate in the final design process, and then the construction of the houses. Village water supplies, mainly groundwater and rainw ater prior to the filling of the reservoir, will be developed at the same time as house construction. The construction of the electricity network, and then connection to it will occur just after house constructi on. The construction of a permanent domestic water supply will be undertaken after reservoir filling.

Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1327.6 RESETTLEMENT LIVELIHOODS SCHEDULING The scheduling of the initiation and then implementation of the various resettlement livelihood programs presents considerable challenges. Firstly, the Nakai Reservoir will not be operation for some 2 to 3 years after actual relocation, and thus those activities rely ing on waters of the reservoir - irrigated agriculture, fisheries - cannot be initiated unt il full reservoir inundation and operation. Secondly, some activities will require either (a) considerable testing of technologies, or (b) considerable institutional development and strengthening, which will extend the period of implem entation. Thus, each resett lement livelihood activity has its on specific activity scheduling, as detail in sections 26.6.1 to 26.6.3 below. 27.6.1 Forestry Development Program Due to (a) the lag in initiation of those livelihoods dependant on reservoir filling, (b) the availability of forestry resources now, and (c) the requirement for se mi-finished forestry products during the relocation period, it has been decided to initiate the forestry prog ram as a matter of priority.. This will also ensure an income and an activity base for the newly relo cated villagers during the transition period. Thus, the following community forestry activities have already or will soon be planned and initiated: Training of the Nakai Plateau Forestry Village Association, VFC, workers etc: FC onwards; Plantations of native species, and regeneration: FC-1 Salvage logging on Project Lands: FC-1 to FC+2 Sawmilling and secondary processing (windows, doors, furniture etc) - for resettlement villagers houses: FC-1 to FC+3 Selective, sustainable logging, and sawmillin g and secondary processing: FC+4 onwards (before this time there will be too many lo gs from the reservoir clearance operation.

While some villages may open their land and plant upla nd rice crops just before FC, the implementation of managed and sedentary agriculture can only follow the full development of the agricultural land and plots. However, except for three small villages (NongBoua, Bouma an d Phinsavng), from FC to FC+4 years, agriculture can only be undertalenin the wet season, as until FC + 4 (at the earliest) there will be no Nakai Reservoir from which to pump water. The activities and schedule for this program is therefore: Wet season agriculture: FC to Livestock Raising Program: FC+1 onwards.

Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2327.6.3 Reservoir Fisheries Development and Management Program Under the current schedule for the dam constructi on, the Nakai Dam will be closed by May 2008. It is estimated that it will take at least a full rainy se ason for the Nakai Reservoir to fill. Depending of the actual closure of the dam, this could mean up to 1 \u00bd year. However, if the dam is closed at May 2008, it could be almost filled by October 2008. Following filling of the reservoir, and depending of th e timing of this closure and filling, it could from 1 to 4 years before a new fish population has been es tablished. Thus, due to the vulnerability of the fish population through the time of establishment, it is recommended that only subsistence fishing is allowed in the first year after dam closure. The activities and scheduling of the Rese rvoir Fisheries Program will include: Office construction and installation: COD-1 to COD+1 Formation of local management bodies: COD-1 to COD+1 Training of fishers as well as staff: COD -1 to COD+5 to COD+6 Monitoring: COD onwards Research and development: COD - 1 onwards, and Aquaculture activities, if required: COD+5 onwards; Thus, the program covers a total of 7-8 years from COD-1 to COD+6.

However, surveys, studies and investigations carried out since signature of the Concession Agreement have led to changes in the implementation and disbursement sc hedule and amounts, and the budget has increased si gnificantly. The Budgets described here re flects these changes. The budget described in summary below includes only the external or \"CA costs\" of the various social programs, and does not include the considerable funds allocated by NTPC to the staffing, TA and organizational costs borne by NTPC for defining, implementing and monitoring these programs. This chapter summarises budgets (mainly) of the Nakai plateau resettlement components of the Social and resettlement (SDP) program. It does not include budg ets of two other important, which are considered in other volumes in the SDP, namely: Downstream Areas Development Plan and Compensation Framework (incl. Xe Bangfai) : Vol. 3 Project Lands Resettlement and Compensation framework: Vol. 4 The corresponding budgets are descri bed in their respective volumes. 28.2 TIMING OF EXPENDITURE The timing of expenditure has been revised compared to CA, to take into account the updated relocation planning as described in Chapter 1 and 19 of the SDP. It is anticipated to complete resettlement activity before the 2007 rainy season (2 years after Financial Cl ose), which will provide appr oximately one year time contingency before the reservoir impounding. The End of Resettlement Period ( ERP ) being the attainment of sustainable resettler livelihoods, is conservatively targeted for COD+5 years (8 years after relocation), but dependent on POE certification. The Concession Agreem ent will be modified accordingly. 28.3 FIXED SCOPE AND FIXED BUDGET The Concession Agreement also details the commitmen t of the Company towards GoL to consider the Resettlement Budget as consisting of two general types, as follows: Fixed Scope , for the budget classification of an obligat ion appearing in this Part, means that such an obligation is of the type referred to in clause 30.7(a)(ii) of the Concession Agreement for which the estimate or budget is for internal Company budgeting purposes only and that the physical quantities and quality levels of in frastructure and equipment as contemplated under this Schedule are based on. Fixed Amount , for the budget classification of an obligation appearing in this Part, means that such an obligation is of the type referred to in clause 30.7(a)(i) of the Concession Agreement as being \"limited by cost\" so that the financial liability of the Company, when performing that activity itself or when funding the GOL if the GOL elects to perform that activity, shall be limited to the indicated budget amount. Thus, in the case of budgets which are \" fixed scope \", the cost estimate in the budget is indicative only, and the Company will be resp onsible for the provision or completion of all studies, planning and actions, in compliance with international standard s (unless otherwise defined in the CA). This will include for instance the provision of housing, equipments and infrastructures, as well as UXO survey and clearing, surveys relocation, etc. Chapter 28: Summary of Platea u /Reservoir Resettlement Budget November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2 I n t h e c a s e o f a \"fixed amount\" the cost estimate shows the budget limit within which the activity is expected to be carried out. 28.4 BUDGET SUMMARY Table 28.1 below summarizes the external costs of the various social programs to be funded by the Company (except Project Lands and Downstream areas, cf. Introduction), for the various phases of the project: before COD, during construction, and during operation.

The summary budgets are base d on more detailed activity based budgets, developed by NTPC's SRD (RO). Values are in US Dollars for semester s starting May to October for semester 1 (S1) and November to April for semester 2 (S2). The reason for the this is that Financial Close (FC) is expected in April 2005 and so each semester of financin g is counted from May 2005 on wards. Thus each year show n on the tables actually includes 2 months from the previous year viz. November and December. 28.5.1 Studies and Surveys (Development Stage) This activity is described in SDP, Chapters 10 and 19. The development of the Social and Resettlement component of the Proj ect started in 1996, and continued up to 2004.

These actions are under the jurisdiction of GOL. Th is Appendix sets out the methodology and results of the above actions having been carried out. An overall Provincial Census was planned by the Lao authorities in the second half of 1998, GOL therefore planned the timing of the specific notification and registration census for Nam Theun 2 for October 1998. All the above events and activities were carried out un der the jurisdiction of GOL, with the work carried out by Provincial and District staff with technical assistance from the National Statistics Center and logistical assistance from the RMU and NTEC. H-2 N OTIFICATION AND CUT-OFF DATE GOL was requested to issue formal notification to the Plateau households that it intends to create a reservoir on the Plateau and that consequently most households may have to be relocated and compensated. The formal Notification prepared by GOL (see below) stated that GOL intended to change the land use in the reservoir area and that this required that inhabitants vacate the area at some time in the future. Adequate compensation and replacement opportunities would be provided to those affected. Those taking up residence in the area after notification (the cut-off date) would not be eligible to receive compensation and resettlement. The effective date for the Project as a result of the Notification having been served is October 1, 1998. The Village Chiefs were actively involved in ensuring that all village households received the Notification (in Lao) and understood it. The Chiefs used a mast er list on which each household signed that they had been notified. Appendix H: Nakai Plateau Notification, Registration and Socio-Economic Survey November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2 (English Translation) Lao People's Democratic Republic Peace Independence Democracy Unity Prosperity Khammouane Province No. 0191/Gov.KM 15 September 1998 NOTIFICATION With reference to the decision of the Lao PDR Government approving NTEC to develop and build the Nam Theun 2 Project. With respect to the creation of the water reservoir of Nam Theun 2 Project. With reference to the notific ation of the Prime Minister's Office No. 2574/PM dated 11.09.98. The Governor of Khammouane Province hereby notifies the population affected by the proposed water reservoir of NT2 Project as follows: 1. Under the Land Law of 1997, the State may take back in the public interest, lands that are being used by individuals under an assigned or traditiona l basis (Article 63). Under such circumstances, the State must provide appropriate compensation (Article 70). 2. This NOTIFICATION is intended for all individu als currently living or wo rking in the proposed reservoir below elevation El 539. 3. All individuals under paragraph 2, please take note that the Government w ill use these lands for the purpose of creating the water reservoir designated under paragraph 2 and w ill pay compensation for the loss and damages incurred according to the NT2 Resettlement Policy adopted by the Government. 4. All individuals living or working in the reservoi r as of 01 October 1998 will be eligible for compensation in accordance with the NT2 Resettlement Policy adopted by the Government. Those individuals who came to live in the reservoi r after 01 October 1998 will not be eligible for compensation. 5. All individuals affected by the proposed reservoi r will be registered by Nakai District Authority on behalf of Khammouane Province Authority and in collaboration with the Resettlement Management Unit for the purpose of establishing eligibility and determ ining affected assets. 6. The filling of the proposed rese rvoir is not expected to take place until 2003; there is therefore sufficient time to make adequate provisions for alternative living and working arrangements. 7. This notification will be delivered to affected in dividuals by Nakai District Authority on behalf of the Khammouane Province, will be posted in public places in the vicinity of the proposed reservoir, broadcast by the local radio station and published by other mass media. 8. Any questions regarding this NOTIFICATION shou ld be addressed to the Nakai District offices. 9. This notification is issued to provide advance information on the intention of the Government to proceed with the Nam Theun 2 Project, subject to all necessary approvals being obtained. Thakhek, 15 September 1998 The Governor Note: A similar notification took place in Bolikhamxay Province. Appendix H: Nakai Plateau Notification, Registration and Socio-Economic Survey November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3H-3 REGISTRATION The purpose of the registration is to make an accura te count (census) of the persons living on the Plateau and the assets they own that would be affected by th e Project. Registration establishes eligibility and provides a firm basis on which entitlements can be established and resettlement costs calculated. On the Plateau, three categories of eligible persons, as noted in Chapter 10, are: households living inside the reservoir that require relocation households living outside the reservoir but deriving benefits from land inside the reservoir households living outside the reservoir that may be affected by the Project The reservoir affected area is de fined as the area below El 539. The registration record ed household information and fixed assets of 1,160 househo lds. The purpose is to provide a basis on which to establish which households are eligible for compensation and what their entitlements would be. It provides detailed inform ation on the composition of households, record their fixed assets and establish whether or not the househol d chooses to remain on the Plateau or proposes to leave and accept cash as compensation. In additi on, the number of household members, the dwelling structure and house sizes are impo rtant information for village layout and the actual relocation. For future identification, a village letter and house number was aff ixed to each house registered. In Ban Oudomsouk and in Ba n Phonphanpek, which incl udes the village of Ban Jat San, the registration survey allowed planners to identify which households are affected, and how they are affected. It was necessary to distinguish which households are re lying on the land for their livelihood, based on topographic information th at has been verified in July 1998, and which households are merchants, officials and wage earners. Table H-1 shows the type s of information that was collected at the time of registration. Registered households were issued a registration and identity booklet showing the information that has been collected. This was signed by the household and the RMU. The registration made an accurate count of the households (and the persons that constitute each household) and the assets that would be affected by the Project for which compensation would be required, either in cash or in kind. On the basis of this information, eligibility and entitlements are to be determined. The census team used a form (in Lao) for each hous ehold as per Table H-2. Each household head signed one of these forms. Data from these forms was then copied into three booklets: one for the householder, one for the RMU and one for the District. The RMU an d the District have both signed each booklet. The village chief and each household signed the th ree booklets upon distri bution of the household copies. This distribution wa s completed by October 2000. H-4 S OCIO -ECONOMIC SURVEY With the RMU visiting all Plateau hou seholds, this opportunity will be us ed to carry out a baseline socio- economic survey to collect informatio n on households that will suppleme nt the information collected for registration purposes. Together, the data w ill establish the reference point for monitoring. The socio-economic survey collected additional inform ation beyond that collected for the registration by way of a sample household interview survey. This information established baseline conditions on the Plateau, against which future change can be measured. The survey gives a representative picture of the ac tual socio-economic situation on the ground. A random selection of the houses was made from village maps before carrying out the survey. For residents absent during the survey, the clos est adjacent house was chosen to fill the quota. All households were surveyed in villages and hamlets of 10 or less househo lds. For villages of 10-24 households, 50% were Appendix H: Nakai Plateau Notification, Registration and Socio-Economic Survey November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 4included in the sample, and 25% were included in th e sample for villages with more than 25 households, according to the survey design. In Table H-3 the actual sample size is indicated, showing that 311 house holds were included in the socio- economic survey. This is 26.8% of the households on the Plateau, and includes some non-affected households in Ban Oudomsouk and Jat San. The contents of the socio- economic survey was divided into sections dealing with non-fixed assets, food sources, income sources, health, ed ucation and issues. An outline of the contents of a socio-economic data is in Table H-4. All information collected by means of Registration and Socio-economic Survey was processed and stored electronically by the RMU. Registration data form th e basis of individual household files which will be administered by DRWG and RMU. H-5 O VERVIEW OF FINDINGS There were altogether 1,160 households and a total of 6,319 persons included in this Registration Census and Asset Count. The form shown as Table H-2 was signed by each household and shows the data compilation sheet used subsequently to transfer field data into the household booklets and RMU/NTEC computer database. At the time of registration a village and house identification number was physically attached to each house for future identification an d administration purposes. Table H-5 shows the registration results by villa ge, in comparison to previous survey results. Due to the combined effects of addi tional elevation surveys and the registration census, plus the fact that the Army Village of Ban Nong Boua Kham is now d eemed to be included, th e estimate of the total number of affected households has increased to 886. The actual total number of persons living in those affected households was 4,889 for an average household size of 5.518 persons. The computer database that has be en developed on the reservoir popul ation has been utilized to extract relevant information and analysis that will assist further implementation planning. The RMU/NTEC electronic database is available to all interested parties such as GOL Ministries, researchers, NGOs and Development Agencies, for the purpose of furthering the knowledge of health, education, gender, ethnicity and overall developmen t issues regarding the Nakai Plateau population. Data from affected households was examined against ni neteen criteria considered to indicate at least a potential for vulnerability during the actual relocation process and re-establishme nt of livelihood activities. They are based on gender, age, handicaps, comparative income levels, small households, non- Lao and any shortage of able-bodied working age male s in the household. These households will receive special attention from the RMU during the development phase, for instance through the provision of paid laborers to assist in the relocation and re-establishment phases. The socio-economic database for the sample of hous eholds and the census data was used to prepare a 1998 socio-economic profile of the affe cted reservoir population that can serve as the baseline for future monitoring as well as for further implementation planning. In total, 319 households were selected out of a registered total of 1,160 for a sample of 28 percen t. Of these 319 households, 251 were determined to be affected by the Project. Sampling was also carried out for 8 affected households in Ban Nam Nian but the results from this trading village were excluded from income calculations because they were quite atypical. The sample is consider ed adequate for the purpose of establishing a benchmark database on pre-project conditions that can subsequent ly be used for monitoring purposes. Appendix H: Nakai Plateau Notification, Registration and Socio-Economic Survey November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 5 An analysis of affected household incomes (Tables H-8) indicates that in nominal Kip terms, incomes have increased from Kip 462,000 in 1996 to Kip 1,628, 784 in 1998. However, given the rapid inflation over this period, real incomes have not increased in this proportion. Nevertheless there appears to have been a significant increase in plateau residents' average incomes, albeit from an extremely low base. The variability between villages is shown in Table H-9. It seems also that the proportion of total income accounted for by self-grown products consumed has increased somewhat over the last two years which could be an indication of an increasing re liance on the subsistence mode of living. There could be several reasons for this apparent increa se in income. Perhaps mo st likely is the fact that the October 1998 surveys were more methodically executed than previo us surveys and certainly included the widest range of potential income sources. There is also a possibility that there may be an increased utilization of the resource base in an unsustainable manner. The im portant issue however is that the October 1998 survey has been ca rried out with a sufficiently high level of care that it can serve as a base for current planning and future monitoring. H-6 S OCIO -ECONOMIC PROFILE The sample size for the Socio-Economic Survey covers 26.8% of all the households to be relocated on the Nakai Plateau. There is much variation in th e households in terms of composition and economic activities. It is difficult to describe a typical v illage or average household. However, a brief profile is provided below in order to give some idea of the main characteristics of the people inhabiting the Nakai Plateau. The majority of households on the Plateau consist of parents and children but a significant number include other family members as well such as daughters-in-law and othe r relations. Most households live nearby relatives and for the most part kinship ties are patrilineal. Most people are from the Plateau and marry within a short distance fr om their village, although inter- marriage between the various ethnic groups is common. The population is young with the average household cons isting of more children than able-bodied adults. As with the composition and size of households, th e income variability is high, both among members of villages and between villages. This difference seem s to depend on a combinat ion of location on the Plateau, village size, ethnic group and proximity to natural resources. Howe ver, village leadership, education levels and recent history of migration also play a role. Differences in household income depend on family size and access to resources. The majority of people practice a mix of 'folk Buddhism' and local animist traditions consisting of beliefs in territorial spirits, nature sp irits and ancestors. Most household he ads and women are illiterate. School attendance is irregular at best, except for roadside villages, with childre n frequently assisting their parents in clearing swidden, harvesting rice or collecting NTFPs. Most houses have been constructed using traditional materials, that is wood, bamboo and thatch or shingles for roofing. Lighting consists of oil lamps. Water sources are natural springs and nearby rivers and only large villages have regular access to potable water sources throughout the year. Livelihood systems vary greatly but there are common characteristics. The average household has a mixed economy consisting of swidden upland rice, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, fishing, livestock raising and selling of forest products (NTFPs an d wildlife). Having a number of live lihood elements provides a safety net since variation in weather, flooding, scarcity of particular resources, livestock epidemics and other factors, mean that survival necessit ates several sources of livelihood. Again there are very large differences between individual household and villages on the Plateau. Appendix H: Nakai Plateau Notification, Registration and Socio-Economic Survey November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 6H-7 C ONCLUSION Given the fact that it is difficult to describe a typi cal household, consideration for the range of household types is important. This is especially the case when considering the relocation and its possible effects on vulnerable households, that is households without able- bodied adults, with elderly, with female household heads, ill or with infirm members. It will be important when monitoring and interpreting statistical results always to consider the range of responses or data Appendix H: Nakai Plateau Notification, Registration and Socio-Economic Survey November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7H-8 N AKAI DISTRICT CENSUS AND SURVEY Table H-1: Outline of Registration Form Contents REGISTRATION A) Household Information 1.

Social Development Plan - Volume 2 1I-1 O BJECTIVES The main objective of establishing demonstration fa rms was to test the assu mptions in the livelihood model and options before resettlement activities are started. It is necessary to demonstrate and document carefully and precisely the livelihood model as actual field tests are carried out. This allows planners to understand problems and make adjustments to the livelihood model if necessary. Two farms were established with different goals: The Demonstration Farm at Theun Duane (ca. 5 km by foot from Ban Sop On) was established to test the subsistence element through the tr ailing and demonstrating of the basic common components of the livelihood model. The general approach has been (a) establishing a range of crops and livelihood activities that are looked after by extension workers and advisors, (b) selecting successful crops for larger trail plots, and (c) the gradual introduction of successful crops to households with supervision. The Demonstration Farm and Nursery at Ban Nakai Neua was established to demonstrate extra (optional) income generating activities (herbs, mushrooms, handicrafts, NTFPs) of the livelihood model and to act as a nursery facility for rearin g seedlings that will be needed for the actual resettlement. The specific objectives are the following: Prove that selected soils on the Nakai Plateau could produce the commodities described in the SDP given the inputs; this has been proven and demonstrated; Monitor labor inputs as a basis for confirming the proposed plot size envisaged in the SDP, including the forestry element; Pilot sedentary (irrigation) farming with communities that only had previous experience with swidden cultivation; Establish a centre for production of seedlings for resettlement at Ban Nakai Neua. I-2 S ELECTION OF DEMONSTRATION FARMS The rationale of choosing the Theun Duane site for the demonstration farms was: Typical selection that would reflect a realistic site for livelihood trials; Close to Ban Oudomsouk for year round easy access; Near the water sources; Above the highest reservoir level so that it can be sustained after impoundment; Areas containing damaged forest due to fire and shifting cultivation; Poor soils (acid, low nutrient, low infiltration, lo w humidity, etc.) where improvements require the testing of new techniques; Topography of the location is characterized by sloping land, terrace system construction is necessary to keep water and prevent erosion. In addition to the above-mentioned points, the selection of Ban Nakai Neua also considered the fact that the village would only partially be relocated and th at the site could serve as a permanent source of seedlings throughout the resettlement period. In additi on, the nursery would be located beside the school in an attempt to involve school children in the improved livelihood model. Appendix I: Demonstration Farms November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2I-3 C ONSULTATION PROCESS The consultation process has been ongoing from the establishment of the farms. In the case of the Theun Duane Demonstration Farm, the three families were se lected from Ban Sop On after village discussions over several months in 1996-1997 and a collective deci sion. Meetings were held with village leaders, technical advisors and NTEC and later a selection of th ree families representing di fferent levels of income (high, middle and low) were select ed. These families moved voluntarily with the consent of the village leaders of Ban Sop On and with the understanding of their relatives. The move itself was sanctioned by ritual specialists and a proper relocation and moving ritual was held involving relatives and other village members. In the case of the selection of the site at Ban Nakai Neua, an agreement was worked out involving the district authorities, village leaders, school teache rs and the villagers of Ba n Nakai Neua. The community agreed to give land and to promise to supply able-bodied laborers and allow for the incorporation of activities (vegetable gardens and other aspects of the livelihood model) in the school curriculum. I-4 F ARM LAYOUTS Figures 1, 2 and 3 on the following pages indicate the layouts of the two demonstration farms. On the basis of experience with numerous SE Asian projects, the area of land per household labor inputs was established by agricultural advisors at the Theun Du ane Demonstration Farm location. The layout also depended on location of deciduous forests, indicating areas that would be good for vegetable growing and adjacent areas of pine, indicating areas of poor soils and potential forest plots. Each family at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm was supplied with 0.5 ha of land, one house of 75 sq. m. with water tank of 1,250 liters and water su pply system, two cows, two pigs, ample seeds and agricultural implements, kitchen apparatus for cooking, mosquito nets and bedroom furniture.

Table 4 shows the average yields: Table 4: Rice Yields at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm during 1999-2000 Rice Yields Theun Duane Demonstration Farm Lowland Khammouane Province National Average Wet season rice cautious in interpreting these results for a number of reasons since the rice has been grown on atypical land, that is on the valley bottoms instead on in terraces ac cording to the livelihood model. Valley bottom locations were selected due to the ease of irrigation. However, such soils will eventually be below the Full Supply Level and, therefor e, do not provide ideal conditions for fully testing the assumptions of the livelihood model. These results co uld be improved if there is better site selection and more intensive supervision by agricultural advisors. Fruit Trees Many fruit trees appear to be appropriate for cultivation in the area but in general it is too early to draw conclusions. Trees with promising results include mang o, orange, leeche, jackfruit, lemon and grapefruit. Less promising results have been obtained for tamarind, durian and mangosteen. Vegetables and Other Cash Crops Various vegetables have been successfully cultivated by villagers and some of the approximate yields are listed in the Table A-5 below with a comparison to national averages when available. The successful experiences will be further developed fo r introduction to the Pilot Village. Table 5: Crop Yields at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm Crop Type Yields at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm National Average Banana 3,300 kg/ha/year Farms November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 11 Non Timber Forest Products Rattan and cardamom have been planted, and it was found out that only rattan has given a reasonable return. For cardamom it may be too early to make conclusions. Other products are being tested at the Ban Nakai Neua Demonstration Farm and Nursery. Mushroom cultivation has been carried out in Ban Nakai Neua Demonstration Farm and Nursery with mixe d results and work is st ill continuing. It will be necessary to establish links with work going on in the catchment area in this field. Forestry Pine and Acacia have been tested and it appears that only Acacia grows very well. Pines have been planted in the community forest area but are still small after a 3 year period. BPKP has also had experience with a pine plantation near Ban Oudomsouk. The results have not been promising due to a number of reasons, not least a lack of training and awareness for village rs and weak support for follow-up and monitoring. Livestock Livestock results have been good and the adjustment to fodder feeding has been highly successful. As can be seen from the income breakdown in the follow ing section, the sale of cattle has contributed considerable to household income. The present status of the three families is listed in the table below. Table 6: Livestock Status Family Name Period Mature Buffalo Small BuffaloMature Cattle Small Cattle Mature Pig Small Pig Mature Poultry Small Poultry 1997 - - 2 - 2 - - - Vanh Sept 2001 1 - 4 2 - 1 5 - 1997 - - 2 - 2 - - - Khamphou Sept. 2001 4 3 5 3 1 2 3 3 1997 - - 2 - 2 - - - Lae Sept. 2001 - - 3 2 - - 5 4 All experimented grasses have grown very well. Very go od yields have been recorded for the three species (Stylo, King and Ruzi) of about 49,000 kg/ha/year. Lo cal cattle prefer the King and Ruzi species only. I-7 H OUSEHOLD INCOMES An analysis of household incomes reveals a 2000-2001 yearly average income per household of Kip 6.4 million, with little variation between the families. At an average Kip to USD exchange rate of about 8,200 for the period, the income equivalent would be US$ 780. A note of caution on the incomes: the purpose of the demonstration farm is to demonstrate the feas ibility of growing various agricultural products, as one of the components of the livelihood model. Therefore the demonstration farm incomes are not representative of what will be the ultimate resettlement experien ce. Two-thirds of in come is derived from the Project for working on the demonstration farm (rice-for-work), while one-third comes from the sale and consumption of produce grown. This experience indicates that the rice-for-work component can be expected to be considerable during the first few years after relocation.

This is especially noticeable for livestock which made up nearly half of the agricult ural income for two of the three families in the 9 months of data from 2001. Income fr om vegetable and fruits is also cons iderable, in spite of the fact that logging activity on the Plateau has subsided and hence the opportunity to sell vegetables and fruits to workers has declined. With most of the commercial timber in the reservoir area now gone, income from hunting and from the collection of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) has also declined as traditional sources of income. Since the demonstration farms are located further from the river as compared to the original village, the opportunity to fish has decrea sed; coupled with the workload on the demonstration farm, this has caused a reduction in fishing income. However, once the reservoir is established and the fish resource developed, in come from fishing is expected to increa se again. More detailed tables of the breakdown of income are presented at the end of this appendix.

Livestock is almost everyday in the year because the cattle are going out in the morning and return in late afternoon. They are taken care of by the children in each family. Sometimes the families have to go out to search for the cattle because some of them did not return for a couple of days. These days are added. 2. Since the start of growing rice in demonstration farms in irrigated paddy field area (Na nong Phong), the three families work together on this. On upland rice they work individually. I-9 E VALUATION OF DEMONSTRATION FARM EXPERIENCES Despite a short period of development the two farms have firmly concluded some results concerning the experimentation of agricultural production. The outcom e is very clear regarding what is suitable or appropriate and what is not for vegetables, fruit trees, grasses and some other cash crops. These can be summarized as follows: Siting the home lot in the garden has led to very hi gh labor efficiency. Each family has been able to keep its half hectare farm lot completely weed-free. On an additional quarter hectare per family (external to the farm lot), they cultivated paddy rice on available land, and still had more than one laborer available for employment in forests or other off-farm activities. Families at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm ha ve demonstrated that they understand and can adopt the composting of animal wastes to mainta in the productivity of the home-lot soils thus minimizing the need for im porting chemical fertilizers. This is significant since swidden cultivators believe that you cannot utilize plots for more than one year in a seven to ten year cycle. Terracing and bunding have been completely effe ctive in preventing soil erosion under intensive arable cultivation. Growth rate of both fruit trees and fast-growing timber plantations given proper care has been very satisfactory. The availability of hand-feed irriga ted green forage in the dry seas on for cattle has led to greatly improved health and productivity of cattle. The important contribution of fencing has greatly reduced the labour requirement for animal husbandry and eliminated damage to cr ops by free-ranging animal stock. Given adequate attention to varietal selection of rice and irrigation techniques, there is every reason to believe that the estimates for rice production (see Chapter 21) can be attained and maintained. I-10 E XTENSION EDUCATION AND TRAINING Theun Duane and Ban Nakai Neua Demonstration Farms extension education and training program has focus on the following: Forest plantation; Wet land rice farming; Upland irrigation techniques; Vegetable and fruit cultivation; and Livestock management. Appendix I: Demonstration Farms November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 14 One of the difficulties in holding training courses at the Training Centre at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm is that the majority of farm ers attending lectures and demonstr ations are illiterate, with little experience and no or limited schooling. The demonstration plots of new techniques are an effective way of showing people that new techniques work such that all courses should consist of time on the farm and actual instructions with technical advisors in the fields. I-11 O PINIONS OF THEUN DUANE DEMONSTRATION FARM FAMILIES After 4 years of living at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm and working on the new livelihood, the three families' lifestyle has improved in many resp ects. They summarize experiences in the following manner: Food security is no longer a pressing concern sin ce there is no deficiency in rice, the staple crop; Able to purchase better clothes; Reside in a sturdier and cleaner house; More opportunities for cash crops production and making money; Better overall health; Stable lifestyle with few risks (predictability); Ability to save money in order to buy luxury goods such as TV sets and other items. I-12 C ONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS A number of general conclusions can be made along with recommendations based on the work at the demonstration farms since their inception in 1996-97: Consideration for enlarging existing home lot based on the successful results of the trails. Families at Theun Duane Demonstration Farm have demonstrated that they have more than sufficient labor to maintain, productive and weed-free, a three-quarter hectare irrigated home lot (vegetables, fruit and forage). The combination of animal fertilizer, terracing and bunding and irrigation has resulted in a sustainable agricultural regime within the managerial and labor-capacity of the resettled farmers once trained and experienced. Strong indications that increasing the amount of irrigation water delivered throughout the dry season could greatly increase (perhaps double) present levels of agricultural production given adequate trail of labor-saving irrigation options. Given a reliable year-round pumped i rrigation supply, it should not be necessary to bear the cost of installing tube wells, provided that filters are installed. It took at least three years to convince people of the benefits of self-supporting sedentary farmers using irrigation - time frame is realistic in the SDP. Motivation factor: farmers respond positively to adopting new techniques once they have been convincingly demonstrated, with rigorous technical support applied in a culturally sensitive manner. Particular emphasis should be placed on the participation of the younger generation and women. Experimentation work must be maintained withou t a break, because it is fundamental to the success of the livelihood change and adaptation activities.

The IAG believed that such a visible and tangible model will have a greater impact on communities preparing for resettlement and both positive and negative experiences can be utilized by communities and implementing agencies. NTEC accepted the pro posal and included it in the July 1998 RAP. In the POE's opinion in 1999, the decision to proceed with the se lection of a pilot resettlement village was endorsed. J-2 E STABLISHING A PILOT VILLAGE With the agreement of GOL, NTEC has agreed to de velop a pilot demonstration village on the following basis: Selection of an existing village and the rese ttlement relocation site in tandem with GOL, Resettlement Committee, Resettlement Management Unit, Provincial and District officials and affected villagers. Conduct topographical and soil surveys of the new location; develop initial cropping proposals; train agricultural extension advisers on techniques relevant to selected crops; prepare, in an interactive and consultative manner, a Master Plan for village la yout; indicate on plans the extent of clearing and levelling required; mark on plans ground clea ring and levelling guide marks, particularly for cropping areas. Request village resettlers to carry out clearing and levelling program for a significant portion of their normal crop in the new location on cash and rice-fo r-work program (i.e. redirection of their normal activity); agricultural extension advisers begin trai ning programs; initial crop planting in new fields by resettlers using their own labour; seed/seedlings , implements and any irrigation water needed to be supplied by NTEC. Arrange appropriate land use rights certificates for individual farms and house plots. Build houses, community buildings an d other village infrastructure us ing available village labour on cash and rice-for-work basis with support of build ing advisers and any necessary additional labour. Organize health checks program. Build additional infrastructure elements with sub-co ntractors (wells, electricity distribution, irrigation systems and special buildings). Monitor the livelihood models to further th e achievement of the income targets. The objective of moving a complete village before the bulk of the popu lation is to demo nstrate to other villages how a new village might look and function as well as to allow planners to experience problems on the scale of a single village and make adjust ments to the resettlement plan if necessary. J-3 R ATIONALE OF VILLAGE SELECTION The Public Consultation and Partic ipation Process Re port (1998) recommended a pilot village as a result of the ongoing consultation on the Nakai Plateau. Th e village of Ban Sailom appeared to be a good candidate for a pilot village. It actually consiste d of three separate hamlets: Ban Nong Boua (8 households), Ban Pamanton (7 households) and Ban Sailom (14 households). The Pilot Village would thus consist of 29 households. The advantages of making this village the pilot village are many: The villagers are positively inclined towards moving as soon as possible. The village is not located near the river and less reliant on fishing. Of the three sections of the village, two are r ecently established hamlets without fruit trees or established vegetable gardens. Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3 Current houses are of poor quality and the village is one of the poorest villages to be moved. The distance to the selected new site is only 1 to 2 km. Two hamlets and the new site are close to Ban Oudomsouk and therefore easily accessible throughout the year. Health of the population is very vulnerable and weak. The village is mixed Brou and Tai Bo ethnic groups representative of the Plateau. No education facilities. The new area complies with village preferences of wanting to be near the future reservoir, near or on an all weather road, near the forest, near land that can be used for growing rice, and near grazing sites for cattle and buffalo. The possible disadvantages were that village leadership wa s relatively weak and that the village consists of three separate hamlets. Weak leader ship and a lack of skills and huma n resources will have to be dealt with in relation to planning, organization and motiva ting the villagers establish themselves area. It was believed that these disadvantages would represent typica l problems to be encounte red. Interesting lessons could be learnt for the RMU, the villagers , and the new village planning process. J-4 S ELECTION OF PILOT VILLAGE Site Selection Process GOL and NTEC selected the resettlement relocation si te and have provisionally called it Ban Nong Boua Mai ( mai meaning 'new'). Provincial and District official s and affected villagers participated in various stages of consultation (see J-5 below). The resettlement site was chosen based on a combination of desirable physical features, including favourable soils , good access to water supply as well as the villagers own preferences. The site is located between co-ordinates: E 518000 - 520000 N 1958000 - 1959000 The site is located adjacent to the source of the Huou i Malai (a stream) approxim ately 3 km East of Nakai District, next to the existing village of Ban Phonphan pek. Houses were to be built above El 539, and the village has been planned to accommodate the 29 initial families as well as about another 20 families in the futire, in terms of house lots, agricult ural land and infrastructure support.

J-6 L AYOUT AND ALLOCATION OF PLOTS Pilot Village Layout Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the two layouts propos ed to the villagers, and they adopted the layout presented in Figure 3 in which houses are grouped together, complying with Lao traditional style. The first layout consists of houses located along the roadsi de within each individual agricultural plot of land (The Road Model). This model was initially the pr eferred one, judging from the 1998 PCPP results. The second layout plans for houses being grouped together in an area separate from the agricultural cropland (The Cluster Model). After several rounds of consultation, the villagers indicated that they would prefer to be grouped together in order to facilitate all assistance to each other, including sharing of meals and support and care during illness. However, the Cluster Model also has drawbacks, such as limited space for livestock, loss of agricultural productivity due to distance from fields. Although these aspects were explained to the villagers by the Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 6RMU and technical staff, the villagers still preferred th e cluster model, prioritizing social cohesiveness and mutual support over economic performance. A fina l village consultation on the technical and cultural pros and cons of the various opti ons took place in January 2002 at which time the Cluster Model was unanimously approved by the villagers. The selection of the cluster model has certain imp lications regarding the assumptions and conclusions from the demonstration plots as outlined in Appendix I. Certain assumptions, such as proximity to fields, labour inputs, weeding and caring for fields on a daily basis and the housing of livestock near both the house and the source of fodder, are part of the livelihood model develope d at Theun Duane. Thus, livelihood models developed in this latest SD P (Chapter 21 and 25, and Appendix K) do not assume that labour savings will be made by siting each house on ea ch agricultural field. Some villages may still choose to locate their houses on their plots or near to them. There is extra land available at the village site, and one should remember that the livelihood consists of a number of options. It is important to consider the move of the Pilot Village and the establishment of some , but not all, of the livelihood model aspects as a dynamic process. Monitoring adjustments and adaptat ions to the livelihood model will be carried out once the Pilot Village is up and running. Consultati ons will be ongoing throughout the whole process. Allocation of Plots Plots for houses are grouped in 4 clans: \u0083 Nang Xieng Inh clan: 7 plots In principle, most villagers are happy and accept land distribution and allocation according to the consensus. Each household will own 0.5 ha of agricult ural land allocated offi cially by the District Authority, as well as approximately 600m 2 for a house plot measuring about 30m x 20m. Plot Development The new village locati on of 16 ha was cleared using villager la bour (men and women). Vulnerable families (lack of labour) were provided with labour assist ance. NTEC/RMU provided incentive (rice-for-work program) at the rate of 3 kg of rice + 1,000 kip cash per man/day, using these estimated durations: - Clearing/burning: 56 man/day/HH - Shed building: 30 man/day/HH - Fencing: 24 man/day/HH In addition NTEC/RMU provided axes, hoes, saws, hammers, mosquito nets, vegetable seeds, barbed wire and other materials and equipment. Tree Planting On 10 June 2001 a tree planting ceremony was organi zed at the Pilot Village site under the chairmanship of Mr. Le Kakanya, Governor of Khammouane Province, President of the Resettlement Committee (RC), with the participation of authorities from the Dist rict of Nakai, villages of Ban Nong Boua and Ban Phonphanpek, in total 368 pers ons. Two and a half hectare of land was planted with Pinus (2,000 seedlings), rose wood ( Pterocarpus, Afzelia ) (3,800 seedlings) and Acacia (500 seedlings). J-7 S OIL SURVEYS The soil survey and analysis reveal that soils in the pilot Resettlement Area have limited agricultural crop potential unless irrigation is introduced and soils ar e improved with organic fe rtiliser. Nutrient content and organic matter are of low quality. The pH of the soils ranges from 4.66 to 5.42 which is strongly acidic. Supplementing lime is not necessary in irrigated rice fields where an increase of pH occurs with Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7inundation of the field. Adding lime involved the danger of raising the pH to 7 which can lead to nutrient deficiencies can be induced. In practical terms this only requires raising the pH to above about 5.6. Resettlement Area consists of 3 categories of soil: \u0083 S2 - Moderately suitable soils \u0083 S3 - Marginally suitable soils \u0083 S4 - Unsuitable soils The geographic areas with these characteristics ar e shown in Figure 4 (although this map may not accurately reflect soil variations in the area), while the characteristics and values of these 3 kinds of soil are detailed in Table 1 and Table 2. Based on the climate prevailing in the area, current so il condition and topography of the land there are a limited number of crops, which can be recommended and could be produced on an economic basis. Such crops are maize and sugar cane, cassava, taro, fruit trees, forest plantation, tropical grass and vegetables. Increasing the nutrient content and organi c matter of the soil will be a process of 10 years or more, and with associated cost. J-8 H EALTH Due to Malaria program implemented by the EU with NTEC support on the Plateau, the health check carried out in Ban Nong Boua and Ban Nakai Neua reveals that Malaria has decreased significantly from 1998 to 2002, but the parasite load is still a long term sanitary problem. The results of Ban Nong Boua and Ban Nakai Neua are the following: \u0083 Ban Nong Boua 167 persons checked: - Malaria 6 cases or 3.6% - Tuberculosis 2 cases or 1.2% - Parasite 158 cases or 94.6% - Other 1 case \u0083 Ban Nakai Neua 336 persons checked: - Ascaris lumbricoid cases or 78.0% - Strongguloid 33 cases or 9.8% - Hook worm 37 cases or 11.0% - Opistoris viverrini 1 case - Liver fluke 1 case - Tricomonas 1 case - Oxyrosis 1 case At one time malaria was the most po tentially life threatening of the diseases, but now has been generally brought under control, thanks to the success of the EU programme. In order to assure the health of the population, the Pr oject is rechecking the health status of all villagers which will be affected and measures will be established including upgrade of health facilities at the village, district and provincial levels. Collaboration between NTPC and Amiti\u00e9-Coop\u00e9ration Franco-Laotienne (French NGO) is underway for elaboration of future programs, which will include sanitation, nutrition, prevention, etc. The District with the support of NTPC will la unch a hygiene campaign at the village level. Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 8J-9 D EVELOPMENT SCHEDULE \u0083 1998 Registration of household assets and classifica tion of affected families were performed with the participation of RC, RMU, RO and villagers. \u0083 During 2000 the following developmen t activities were implemented: - selection of Pilot Village to be the three hamlets of Ban Sailom; - selection of new village location; - soil survey; - consultations at different levels (RC, RMU, DRWG, VRC and Villagers). \u0083 The year 2001 saw the im plementation of the following activities: - various consultations at differen t levels concerning the villa ge layout, plot allocation, administrative strengthening, etc.; - plan of village location; - plan village layout and plots; - irrigation planning survey; - household plot allocation and temporary land certificates; - villages commencement to clear the site area of the new location; - demarcation of farm/house plots; - upland rice growing; - rice bank development; - health check; \u0083 The year 2002 saw the im plementation of the following activities: - finalisation of the design and BOQ of the irrigation system, and call for tenders; - construction of children's nursery; - first formation of contour bunds; - limited wet season cropping on new plots; - limited dry season vegetable growing (late 2002) based on a gully stop dam water source; - construction of 3 pilot houses; \u0083 The year 2003 saw the im plementation of the following activities: - construction of 26 villager houses; - construction of 22kV electricity network, then co nnections to houses - foll owed by training in electricity use and management at the family level; - construction and initial operation of organic fert iliser factory, production capacity of about 800 kg per day, and employing 4 people full time; - full wet season cropping of agricult ure areas - maize. peanuts, rice; - planting if fruit trees in farm plots; - construction of the Huai Malai reservoir, irrigation pump and the distribution system, and then initiation of a water user group; - first seasons vegetable cropping (late 2003) with new irrigation system (u tilisation about 15 % of cropping; - initiation of the family socio economic monitoring book; - training in tailoring and natural dying; - training in gender issues and birth spacing; Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 9- development of village regulations;. - establishment of an indu strial forestry nursery, with more than 4,000 tress planted , employing 5 people full time; - the full operation of the children's nursery cont inued, and provided a focus for the village; - non formal education for literacy was run every night, and now more than 14 people can write and read;. - a series of study tour to the pilot village was organised for more than 150 people from different villages; and - a health check up found that nobody was carrying malaria, although 13 people have problem with aspiration system and 16 skin system. \u0083 The year 2004 is seeing the implementa tion of the following activities: - finalisation of the field level farmer outlets of the irrigation system; - ongoing improvements to contour embankments and drainage system; - construction of one last villager house; - construction of a domestic water supply sy stem, in parallel to irrigation system; - finalisation of access road and in-f ield road and drainage system; - construction of villager office and meeting hall; - continued application of composted organic fertilis er, and wet season cropping of mainly rice; - establishment of a crop research plot; - construction of a furniture factory, and testing various charcoal production techniques; - expansion of the industrial tree nursery, re forestation of about 20 hectares, and natural regeneration of about 35 ha. J-10 D OMESTIC WATER SUPPLY The requirements for irrigation water in terms of volu me are higher than for domestic use. For the Ban Nong Boua Pilot Village, possible so urces of water are: natural rain , streams (Huoui Khuang and Huoui Malai), nearby ponds (Nong Ma and Nong Boua), deep wells and eventually the reservoir for the NT2 Project (after the impoundment peri od). With a population of nearly 200 persons, the requirement of domestic water (estimated 50 l/person/day pe r WHO recommendations) will be around 10m 3 per day. Three deep ground wells were drilled in 2001 with the following results: One well delivered 0.5 l/sec. Two of the other wells delivered 0.1 l/sec. each Analysis of water quality indicated that the general water from these wells complies with WHO requirements with the exception of turbidity. These three wells were fitted with hand pumps, but where very soon abandoned. Firstly, the wells were drilled at the location spread out over the whole resettlement area - probably on the expectation that houses would be spread out on each agricultural plot, not concentrated into a village. Thus, th e wells were not near any dwelling s. Secondly, the wells were drilled well in advance of the actual relocation, and for both of these reasons, there was (a) nobody to care (b) nobody to use the wells. Thus, some of the fittings were stolen, and the water from remaining wells became unfit for consumption. Due to these various problems with the wells, and th e ready source of water available from the Huai Malai reservoir, it was decided to supply domestic water from the irrigation header tank, after first passing it thru a charcoal and sand filter (for the first 12 mo nths, the villagers actually used unfiltered Huai Malai reservoir waters). A distribution system has been installed and there is one stand pipe + tap for every five houses. Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 10In addition to this filter reservoir water, each house has been fitted with roof rainwater collection gutters and a concrete rain water collection ta nks. It is envisaged that this rain water will be used for drinking and cooking purposes. J-11 I RRIGATION WATER SUPPLY Chapter 22 explains in detail the development of an irrigation system for Ban Nong Boua Pilot Village. This system is composed of the follo wing 4 main components, as follows: (a) An earthen dam on the Huai Malai with crest of 532 EL, creating a reservoir to store about 800,000 m3 of water. The reservoir surrounds the southe rn side of the Ban Nong Boua village and agricultural area. The amount of water stored w ill also be sufficient to provide water to a second resettlement area, no. 17, onto which Ban Boum a will be relocated. When the main Nakai reservoir is impounded, this earthen dam will be fl ooded in the wet season (to 538 EL), and then when this main reservoir recedes during the dry season, the Huai Malai da m will then continue to retain water in the reservoir. (b) A supply channel, pump station, delivery pipe and header tank . Two pumps have been installed to pump water at a maximum of 29 l/s from the Huai Malai reservoir up 40 m head to a header tank (of 56 m3 storage capacity) located on the side of a small hill at about 554 EL. (c) A buried pipe conveyance and distribution system The header tank has two main steel pipe outlets, which then transforms into two main PVC main lines. These then transform into HDPE pipe laterals to provide water to each farmers fields. (d) A the head of each farmers field a specialised farm outlet has been designed and built to allow maximum flexibility in the way that water is used an d distributed through each farmers field. This farm outlet allows for distribution down the farm plot by either (i) a pipe system, (ii) an open channel system, or (iii) from paddy to paddy - if these are develope d. The outlet can also be used for general purpose water access at the top of the farmer's plots - for animals, for example, and for bathing after a hard days work in the field. J-12 P ROGRESS ON AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK The major concern on the Plateau is food security, especially of rice, despite the considerable time and effort put into cultivating upland rice. Rice deficiency has always been a fact of life because of poor soils, climate, water management and flooding. Resettling villagers insist on paddy production despite rice production on the plateau being inefficient with very low yields. Social, cultural and psychological factors may override practicality and technical logic in this case. Soil fertility, labour availability, access to a reliable water supply, draught and an imal supply are all factors contributing to yield. Average yields of the rain-fed rice in the area are generally in the range of 0.8 ton per hectare for upland and 1.5 to 2.0 tons per hectare for wet land paddy rice. The climate (see Chapter 21), the soil, water and other factors all limit current rice yields, and suggests the area may not be suitable for rice cultivation due to soil and water constants. Others crops which require less water are thus also being consid ered, although some rice will be cult ivated in the interim adjustment period until villagers can experience how other elements of the livelihood model work. It should be noted that the topography of the area also imposes limitations, and terraces and contour line planting is being promoted. The eventual ideal system will be a combination of livestock, forage pasture, forest plantation and other crops, all based on soils improvements by (a) application of composted organic fertiliser, (b) judiciou s application of chemical fe rtiliser, and (c) crop rotations. Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 11Wet Season Cropping The 2003 wet season crop plantings in Ban Nong Boua are presented in Ta ble 5, which shows that a total of 1.59 ha of upland rice (13 families), 3.97 ha of maize (all 27 families), 1.83 hectares of peanuts (all 27 families) and 1.82 hectares of black bean (25 families) were planted. Yields were monitored through sampling of four 3m * 3m areas within each farmers plot and are presented in Table 6. The average maize yield was 1.7 t/ha, ranging from 1.0 to 2.3 t/ha. With low input medium yields are expected to be around 1.5 t/ha, while high inputs (improve d seed, chemical fertiliser and more organic fertiliser) would ex pect a medium yield of 3.0 t/ha (see Appendix K-5). Yields for unshelled peanuts were in average 1.1 t/ha and ra nging from 0.8 to 1.7 t/ha. In summary, yields of maize and pean uts were only fair, and will have to be improved if the cropping of these crops would prove to be viable alternative to ri ce growing. One reason for low yields is that farmers planted a mixture of local and improved varieties of corn, and planting in such mixtures crop agronomy is difficult. Peanuts were considerably attacked by so il insects, a problem which should decrease after a couple of years of cropping. In the 2004 wet season most of the farmers have planted predominantly upland rice plus small areas of maize (for animal feed) and peanuts. Dry Season Cropping The dry season on the Nakai plateau starts late September or early October and extends to late March or early April. Vegetables rather than field crops are no rmally grown during this dry, season, and for many vegetables it is possible to plant and harvest two crops over the duration of the dry season. Table 9 provides details of the number of vegetable seedlings planted by each family in the first round of vegetable planting in the 2003-2004 dry season. This wa s the first season that vegetables have been grown on Ban Nong Boua Pilot village by utilising the newly constructed irrigation system. The main vegetables planted were cabbage, chilli, tomato, cucumber and eggplant, with smaller quantities of broccoli, kale, lettuce and herbs also grown. Fruit Trees While some fruit trees were plante d in 2002, most trees were plante d in 2003, and all households planted various quantities of a number of fruit trees, including pomelo (total of 325), lychee (total of 178), lime (total of 302), jack fruit (total of 135 ), mango (total of 194), rose apple (t otal of 18) and l ongan (total of 16), as detailed in Table 7. The average number of trees planted is about 43 trees per family, considerably less that the 72 trees per family that was envisaged in the earlier RAPs. This is because the profitability of fruit trees is not yet fully understood or proven, and thus the plantings to date are more trial plantings. If, over the years, any family considers that fruit trees are suitable in terms of labour requirements and profitability, then they will have the option to plant more trees and manage their farm plot as an orchard. In addition, most households planted pineapple (see Table 8), while only a minority of households planted banana, rose apple and longan. These fruit tress were planted from end of April to mid June. Livestock The villagers in Nong Boua have generally fairly low numbers of domestic animals (see Table 4), with buffalos being the most important. 15 families have buffaloes, while the remain ing 13 families do not have any buffaloes. Of these 15 families with buffal oes, the average ownership is 15 head per family. 6 families have significant numbers, 20 or more head of buffalo. Only 2 families have cattle - cows - and these are all from the Project. Thus, pre relocation, none of the families had cows. Only 12 families ha ve pigs, and 9 of these received their pigs from the project. Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 12J-13 I NCOME Starting in early 2003, each Pilot Village family ha s been encouraged to use a family socio-economic monitoring book in order to keep track of incomes and expenditure. In most cases it is the female head of the household who maintains this book. Incomes an d expenditure are recorded daily, or as occurring, and are summarised, with the assistance of project staff, on a monthly basis. Family income and expenditures for each month for the periods Ja nuary - December 2003 and January - June 1004 are summarized in Table 10 and Table 11, respec tively and illustrated in Figure 5. Although this is the analysis of only half the year , it can be seen that the average in come (5,723,555 Kip) is more than the double of the average expenditure (2,822,056 Kip) . Once data for a full year has been collected a better picture will be formed on the economic perfor mance of the households in the pilot village. Only one household (no. 7) has higher expenditures than income in the period monitored. J-14 I NFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT Houses During meetings with the villagers, it was decided th at seven different sizes of houses would be required, for households of three persons up to nine persons. While NTPC had developed, following consultations some years previously, the general design of houses, each family was given the option to modify the design according to their wishes. Thus, during constr uction minor changes have been made to some of the houses. By December 2003, 29 new houses were bu ilt, and the final one house is due to be completed in June 2004. Wherever labour has been available within the families, thes e have played an active role in construction of their house. The actual BoQ and cost of construction for each of the seven models is presen ted in Table 12 to 18. It can be seen that the major cost factor is the cost of wood. Wood for these 29 houses was from three main sources, as follows: (a) timbers that were felled to clear land for agriculture or housing for Ban Nong Boua; (b) timbers that were felled for shifting cultivation, and collected by the project, in the general resettlement area on the plateau; and (c) timbers that were felled to construct the elect ricity transmission line into the pilot village. In some cases (for some of the ti mbers) villages were paid to hand saw. However, most of the timbers were transported to a sawmill in Thakhe k. In the case of fallen pine trees that were collected (as described above), the timber company exchanged th is pine wood for semi- hardwoods. Each house was also supplied with (a) a pour flush toilet and (b) a rainwater collection tank. Nursery and Primary school The primary school will be built in 2004. However, th e children's nursery was co mpleted in late 2002, and is used by the children of the vill age. Two teachers (local ethnic v illagers) are employed and lunch is provided to all the children. Road The road from the main road to Ban Nong Boua, and roads within the village and agriculture areas were initially (2002) only cleared and ro ughly formed. By mid 2004, newly fo rmed road and drainage system will have been constructed. J-15 S OCIO -CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT Community hall Construction of the community hall is presently ongoing. This will serve as a central point for the villagers of Nong Boua, for meetings, training and cel ebrations. It will also contain offices for groups such as the water users association, the village forestry group, etc. Appendix J: Pilot Village Experience November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 13 Spirit house Two families in Ban Nong Boua have members of the family who are spirit mediums. These two families have thus rebuilt a spirit hous e next to their main house. J-16 I NITIAL LESSONS LEARNED FOR THE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMME It is still to early to seriously evaluate the succ ess and/or failings of the pilot village. However, some valuable lessons can be learned already from the development, construction and livelihood activities to date and these include the following: \u0083 While it depends on each village, it appears that they may prefer that hou seholds are grouped by clan and possibly in a cluster model. If the cluste r model is selected by villagers, then this may require a reassessment of the assumptions and co nclusions of the demonstration farm results; \u0083 Special provisions with regards to land plot allocation for disadvantaged households (such as households with a single mother, widow, labour defi cit, elderly or infirm) should be provided as needed; \u0083 While difficult to achieve in practice, each family should be provided with land of similar slope and soil conditions; \u0083 At least domestic water supply must be available in the relocation sites at, or just before, moving to that site; \u0083 Electricity is a strong attraction for villagers to mo ve, because this will be one of the most important factors to make possible water supply to irrigate crops as well as for other household utilities; \u0083 When performing topographic surveys for new village areas, particular attention must be paid to the 538 m contour as the lowest level for permanent agri culture, and 540 m contour as the lowest level for housing construction; \u0083 Village planning, in terms of reaching agreemen ts on the physical plan and layout of all the infrastructure improvements, is time-consuming. This should be recognized in scheduling the planning for the remaining villages. Both the RM U and the RO will allocate staff accordingly; \u0083 The method for actually distributing water to th e agricultural fields is a difficult and as yet unresolved issue. This is partly because it will de pend on the slope of each field, which is likely to vary considerably over the resettlement area. It w ill also depend on the eventual choice of crops and cropping systems found to be the most economic; and \u0083 It will take at least 2 growing seasons - 2 wet seas ons and 2 dry seasons - for villagers to become familiar with, and test out the new cropping system s. Only after this trial period will they have a better understanding of what the long term cr opping system that is the most effective and economic.

Plan - Volume 2 1K-1 R ESULTS OF SOIL SURVEY CONDUCTED IN PILOT VILLAGE Introduction The soil survey and analysis of the Nam Theun 2 Resettlement Area 16 (XXXXX) was carried out by the Soil Survey and Land Classification Centre from 26th November to 3rd December 2000. The objective of the survey was to gather information on the main characteristics of the soils in the area of the Pilot Village in order to assess the suitability for agricultural develo pment and to identify corrective measures to take to improve fertility. The total area studied was 300 ha ra nging in altitude from 528 to 550 masl. Based upon a stratification of the area 15 profiles and 50 auger borings were made. The soils at each of the sampled sites were classified into Soil Suitability Categories using the standard FAO definitions: S1 - Highly Suitable Soils representing land with no significant limitations to sustained use, or only minor limitations, which will not signif icantly reduce producti vity or benefits and will not raise input requirements above an acceptable level. No soil in the area meets this criteria. S2 - Moderately Suitable Soils with some limitations for sustained use. The limitation reduces productivity or benefits, or increases required inputs to the extent that the general advantage to be gained from use, although still attractive, will be somehow lower than that expected from Class S1. 20% of area sampled falls into this classification. S3 - Marginally Suitable Soils having moderate to severe limitations for sustained use and will reduce productivity or benefits, or increase required inpu ts to the extent that the defined use will be only marginally justified. 20% of area sampled falls into this classification S4 - Unsuitable Soils having limitation difficulties co rrected with existing knowledge at unacceptable cost. 60% of area sampled falls into this classification The profile descriptions and chemical analyses that characterise the soils grouped according to the above classification are shown in Table 1. The chemical analysis reveals that the soils are highly acidic and generally fertile. All three categories are categorised by low levels of organic matter and very low levels of N. Total P an d K are both low but both available P and available K are at a moderate level, and K levels are also low. Cation Exchange Capacity is low and Base Saturation very low. The infiltration tests have returned low values, althou gh this may have been due to the fact that at that time of year the soil moisture content is high and is also compacted. Also at a pproximately 125 cm there is a clay level that reduces infiltration. Based upon the climate prevailing in the area and the current soil conditio ns, there are a limited number of crops that would grow well. These include maize and sugar cane, although the latter should be only planted in the best areas, cassava, taro, fruit trees, forest plantation and tropical grasses. With adequate application of organic matter, vegetables could be grown. Recommendations Based upon the climate prevailing in the area and the current soil conditio ns, there are a limited number of crops that can be recommended and could be produced on an economic basis. Such crops are maize and sugar cane, cassava, taro, fruit trees, forest plantati ons and tropical grasses. ON e smaller scale, and because of the need of relatively high levels of organic matter, vegetable can be grown in the area. Rice is grown in the area, but yields are not high. There are obvious limitations to rice growing in the area. The climate, the soil and the water management, due to the irregularity of the rainfa ll, are limiting factors. These can be overcome by the adoption of improved varieties, fertilisation, improvement of the organic matter content and appropriate water management. Other plantations should be promoted such as forest plantations in combination with livestock production.

They have an effect on improved soil texture, pH and in stimulating the activity of micro-organisms. Organi c fertilisers that could be applied in the area include farmyard manure, crop residues, compost and green manure. However, the rates of application range from 15 to 25 tons per ha according to the crop needs. Several types of green manure could be used. Crotolaria juncea, Sesbania, Phaseolus and Leuceana. The green manure can be incorporated in to the soil during its preparation. Green manure can be grown 2 months Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 3before growing the main crops and should be able to rely on the existing moisture in the soil without the need for irrigation. Another source of organic fertiliser co mes from livestock. In the relative ly poor soils of the plateau an integrated cropping system including livestock will improve soil at a reasonable cost as parts of the crop, and/or crop residue can feed cattle, and create compost. This would require a change from the traditional way of raising cattle so that they are grazed on the farm lot and animal manure is deposited in situ . The application of large quantities of organic fertiliser would be a major difficulty for farmers. Where they have limited access to such materials it will be prefer able to limit the area that is treated in order to maximise the benefit. It is also important that the orga nic matter is incorporated into the soil in order to have maximum benefit. Acidity The pH of the soils ranges from 4.7 to 5.2 which is strongly acidic. Lime needs to be applied at a rate of 2 to 5 tons per ha. The application of ground limest one will raise the pH and improve cation exchange capacity, and therefore stimulate growth. Lime is the most common soil amendment used to correct soil acidity, and it is usual to attempt to raise the pH to near 7. However, there are dangers in raisin g the pH to 7 in that nutrient deficiencies can be induced, particularly for phosphorous and the micron utrients boron, zinc and manganese. A better approach is to aim to neutralise the exchangeable al uminium, which is the main problem in most acid soils. In practical terms this only require d raising the pH to above about 5.6. Lime can be applied every year at a rate of 1.5 to 2 tons per ha or every three years at a rate of 7 t/ha. All classes of soil will benefit from this application and obv iously the more acid soils. Lime should be applied in preference for cash crops, and for fruit trees it shou ld be applied in the immedi ate proximity of the root system instead of a general application. Lime applications are not necessary for the irrigated paddy areas as the anaerobic conditions of the waterlogged soils leads to a stabilisation of the pH. Erosion Control A cropping sequence that provides a substantial vegetation cover is required to control erosion and degradation of soil fertility. Minimizing tillage and le aving crop residues on the soil surface will increase filtration and reduce the hazard of run off and erosion. These practices could be adapted to most soils in the survey area. Contour line planting and building terr aces would also contribute to the maintenance of the soil fertility. Conclusions The results of the soil survey have indicated that the soils in the resettlement area are very poor. Nutrient content is very low and organic matter is also low. The area has limitations for agricultural production, at least until the nutrient content in increased and a higher level of organic matter is reached in the soils. This will be a long process, which could take 10 years or more. The topography of the area also imposes limitations, unless terraces and built and contour planting is promoted. A gradual improvement of the fertility of the soil could include the development of pasture and cattle raising. If properly mana ged, this will give the means to in crease the organic matter, and the structure of the soil, and therefore will improve the so il capacity to retain nutrients. Ideally leguminous forage species could also enrich the soil in nitrogen, and be used by livestock. The development of forest plantations including species improving so il fertility should also be promoted. Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 4K-2 R ESULTS FROM THEUN DOUN DEMONSTRATION FARM In order to investigate the feasibility of cropping within the proposed resettlement areas NTEC funded the establishment of a Demonstration Farm at Theun Du an in 1997. The farm occupies an area of 0.8 ha and has been used for the production of a range of annual field crops since establishment and in addition a range of Fruit Tree crops have been established. A listing of the crops that have been planted and the year of establishment is shown in Table 2 and a summar y of the results of the crops planted is presented. The documentation of the trials and demonstrations has revealed some inconsistencies in the results, and it has been concluded that the yield results from the vegetable crops maybe somewhat unreliable. This may have been caused by the difficulties in recordin g production where several harvest were being made as opposed to the other field crops that have just one harvest date. However, the results have provided useful indicators of the suitability of the vegetable crops for the soil and climatic conditions in the area. The labour inputs that were required have also been recorded although the plots were generally very small and the labour has been recorded in terms of whole days of input, with the result that the overall labour requirements are overstated. In the case of the fruit trees there is also useful information on the suitability of the various species that have been planted although again the production data may be unreliable.

American Joint Vetch Description American Joint Vetch ( Aeschynomene americana ) is a vigorous, erect annual or perennial summer growing legume herb or shrub. Plants can grow to 2 m tall and 2 m wide. Stem bases are hard, hairless and up to 10 cm in diameter, while upper stems often turn reddish-brown and are covered with hairs 1-2 mm long. Leaves are 2-8 cm long and contain 20-70 leaflets 4-15 mm long and 1-2 mm wide. Leaflets fold together at night, and when touched. Flowers are pea-like and 5-10 mm long. Flower colour is yellow, orange or mauve, usually with red or purple stripes. Pods are flat, containing 3-9 segments 2.5-5 mm wide and 3-6 mm long. When mature, the segments of the pod separate readily. Seeds are 2-3 mm long, 1.5-2 mm wide and dark brown to black in colour. There are two cultivars of American Joint Vetch available, Glenn and Lee. - Glenn is an annual, erect cultivar with leaves 4- 8 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide with 12-34 pairs of leaflets. Stems are generally green in appearance. Flowers are 5.6 mm long and are mostly mauve. Pods have 5-7 segments 5 mm long and 4 mm wide . There are 190 000 per kg. Seeds are grey-green to light or dark brown, 368 000 per kg. - Lee is a late maturing annual. It is regarded as a predominantly perennial cultivar in Queensland, where plants live for 1 to 4 years. It generally beha ves as an annual except in those years with a short dry season. Lee plants are more compact and more branched than Glenn, particularly near the base. Stems of Lee are generally reddish in appearance. Flowers are 7.6 mm long and bright orange in colour and 2 slightly larger than those of Glenn. Pods are slightly longer than Glenn with 6-8 segments but seeds are smaller (476 000 pe r kg). Lee flowers later then Glenn. Climate and Soils American Joint Vetch is a native of the Caribbean islands and adjacent areas in North and South America between 30\u00b0N and 30\u00b0S. While Glenn and Lee grow in tropical areas receiving 1100 mm or more average annual rainfall, they are both tolerant of and best suited to wet, waterlogged and flooded soils in this rainfall zone. Glenn has persisted on waterlogged soils receiving 900 mm of average annual rainfall. While both cultivars will grow and persist on a range of so il types including sandy eart hs, and solodics, they grow best on more fertile clay soils of sub-coastal plains. Persistence has been lowest on sandier soils. Glenn has tolerated 3 months of flooding without any adverse effects on plant population or yield, but 5 months of flooding drastically reduced both plant population and pasture yield. Establishment Seed should be sown at a rate of 4-6 kg/ha of pods or 2-3 kg/ha of dehulled seed. For best results, seed should be sown into a well prepared seedbed. Glenn and Lee are not specific in their Rhizobium requirements for nodulation and generally do not require inoculation. Growth during the seedling phase is slow, but they show vigorous growth once established. Both cultivars regenerate well from seed, and seed is spread in cattle dung. Freshly ha rvested seed has a high hard seed content. This falls with dehulling and/or storage. Fertiliser Requirements American Joint Vetch grows best in mo re fertile situations, i.e. fertile cl ay soils or areas with a history of fertilisation. Generally superphosphate or its equiva lent at 100-150 kg/ha should be sown with the seed. Maintenance dressings of 75-100 kg/ha should be ap plied annually. Applications of potassium, zinc or molybdenum may be necessary on some soils. 1Extracts from Agnotes Nos. 207, 285, 549 and 642, Depart ment of Primary Industry, Northern Territory, Australia Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 11Yield Dry matter yields from 9 000 to 14 000 kg/ha have b een recorded. Seed yields of Glenn up to 750 kg/ha have been recorded in the Northern Australia. Grazing Glenn and Lee grow well in wet areas. These areas, if flooded should not generally be grazed during the wet season. In this situation the plants become stemmy and there is only a small proportion of leaf present when grazed in the dry season. Both cultivars perform best in swards which can be grazed during the wet season. This keeps them shorter, more leafy and of better quality, and the leaf remains on the plants longer into the dry season. Where a pasture can not be grazed during the wet season, the later flowering Lee is the preferred cultivar as it will hol d green leaf later into the dry season. Mixtures Grasses which can be sown in mixtures with Glenn and Lee are Brachiaria humidicola ). Hay Good quality hay can be made from Glenn and Lee prov ided it is cut early whil e it is green and leafy. Later cuts will be more st emmy and of lower quality. Pests and Diseases Powdery mildew ( Oidium sp) is commonly seen on Glenn in the late wet season-early dry season period. This does not appear to affect pr oduction, quality or acceptability to animals. Lee is less affected by powdery mildew than Glenn. Flowers and developing seed pods can be attacked by Heliothis larvae. A severe attack can reduce or eliminate seed production in first year stands, and control of this pest may be required in seed crops. B. PARA GRASS (A pasture grass for wet and flooded soils) Description Para grass ( Brachiaria mutica ) is a coarse, vigorous, trailing perennia l which is useful for wet and flooded soils in higher rainfall areas. It has stout runners (stems, stolons) which branch and root readily at all nodes. The runners grow up to 5 m long, with the sward growing only to 1m tall. Leaves and leaf sheaths are generally hairy; leaves are 6-20 cm long and 1- 2 cm wide. The seeds are small, 935,000 per kilogram. Climate and Soils Para grass is a native of tropical Africa and South America Annual rain fall should be more than 1,000 mm. Para grass will grow on a range of soil types including solodic and cracking clays, but water relations are the most important factor. It is adapted to wet cond itions, waterlogging and prolonged flooding. It is suited to shallow flooded areas where the depth of w ater does not exceed 1 m. It is also very drought hardy and can survive long dry spells. It is r ecommended for wet or seasonally flooded areas. Establishment by Seed Para grass can be sown by seed at 1-2 kg/ha, but the seed is expensive, the germination is low and small seedlings can be killed by flooding. For good establishment seed must be sown into a well-prepared weed- free seedbed and lightly rolled. Sowing should be in early to April to May to allow germination and growth before flooding occurs. Freshly harvested seed has a low germination rate because of seed dormancy. Germination improves after six to eight months. Sowing para grass by seed has not generally been successful. Establishment by Cuttings Establishment has been mostly with cuttings containing two to three nodes, with at least one node being buried. Para grass requires protection from excessive weed competition. A well prepared seedbed is therefore an advantage. Cuttings are generally planted in mud or shallow water (up to 15 cm). Planting Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 12occurs in January and February, depending on rainfall. Cuttings should be planted on a square grid at 2-4 m intervals. Fertiliser Requirements Para grass pastures are generally not fertilised on fert ile clay floodplain soils but they do need fertiliser, at least initially, on less fertile soils. Para grass is very responsive to nitrogen fertilisers. An application of nitrogen in the first season is useful to improv e establishment and help young plants overcome weed competition. Nitrogen fertiliser gives increased yiel ds but the greatest returns are at lower levels of fertilisation (100-200 kg N/ha). Crude protein conten t is not increased at these levels of nitrogen fertilisation. The application of phos phate fertilisers by themselves has not been shown to increase dry matter production of Para Grass. Yield Dry matter yields of 4-7 t/ha have been recorded from pastures where no nitrogen was applied. Yields of 10-15 t/ha have been recorded when 100-200 kg/ha nitr ogen fertiliser had been applied early in the wet season. Seed yields of 11-27 kg/ha have been recorded. Grazing Para grass is very palatable and grazing of new plantings should be delayed until the cuttings are well rooted and well developed. It is desirable not to graze the pasture in the first year because early grazing results in th e pulling out and destruction of the cuttings. It generally takes 12 mont hs for a stand to develop properly. It is normally used as saved fodder during the dry season. Allowing animals onto ground which is too wet can damage the stand by pugging and plant destruction. Para should be regarded as a browse grass. Grazing should be controlled to prevent excessive damage to the runners. With light stocking, animals eat only the leaves. With heavy stocking, stems are destroyed to the crown or roots which results in a very slow recovery. It can withstand heavy grazing while the soil moisture is high and the plants are actively growing. Under normal conditions para will not stand co ntinuous grazing. A stocki ng rate of one beast to 1.5-2 ha is recommended as a safe st ocking rate for a para grass stand. Mixtures Legumes which may be included in mixtures are Glen n, Lee, Murray phasey bean, Cavalcade, Bundey and Maldonado. Ponding Banks can be constructed to create artificial ponds to store runoff water to grow para grass in areas where rainfall is too low, or to extend the growth period of the grass in other areas. Para can be planted into ponded areas as they dry out, extending the planti ng until July. The legumes Glenn, Lee and Murray are more suitable in ponds. Other Para grass is tolerant of soil salinity. It will withstand flooding for a number of weeks provided some green material is at the water surface. Stands of para grass can be thinned out if flooded when grazed or if cut very short or burnt. A hot fire can make para grass vulnerable to drought, overgrazing or flooding. Stands can be dramatically thinned and regeneration is very slow after a hot fire. It should not be burnt. Pests and Diseases None have been identified which affect the production of Para Grass. C. HYMENANCHE Description Hymenachne ( Hymenachne acutigluma ) is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic grass that is a native of Australia. It is a trailing grass and roots at the lower nodes. The stems are thick, and can be over 4 m long, containing 10 or more nodes. Leaves are 15-30 cm long and 2-3 cm wide. The plant generally has a dark green appearance. The seed head is a spike 8-10 cm long. Seeds are small (1-2 mm). Olive Hymenachne (Hymenachne amplexicaulis cv Olive) is a grass from South America that has been tested as a species for ponded pastures. Olive hymenachne appears almost identical to Native Hymenachne, except for shorter and broader leaves. Olive Hymenachne has been declared a Weed of National Significance and is on Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 13longer recommended for planting as a pasture in Northern Australia. Natural stands normally form a monoculture, completely covering the soil in the dry season. Establishment - Cuttings Hymenachne can be planted by dropping cuttings containing 2-3 nodes into water over 10 cm deep, during the wet season. Because of its ability to spread by runners, Hymenachne can be sown or planted in wide spaced (i.e. 5 m) rows and allowed time to f ill in the spaces by itself. Seed Hmenachne has been successfully established by dropping seed onto shallow water by helicopter or air-boat. The Native Hymenachne produces little viable seed and regeneration from seed is significant in natural stands where, after big floods, new seedlings can be found from the high water mark down. Seed is difficult to harvest as it produces seed heads and flowers during periods of flooding. Sowing rates recommended for Native Hymenachne are 1 to 2 kg of seed per hectare. Fertiliser Requirements Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers applied at the be ginning of the wet season have not increased dry matter yield or plant content of nitrogen or phosphorus at the end of the wet season. This is because the grasses are only adapted to the more fertile clay floodplain soils. Nitrog en fertiliser (25- 50 kg/ha) can be applied to sparse or newly establishe d stands to promote the number an d growth of tillers to increase population density. Grazing Hymenachne is a valuable fodder resource for the DS in coastal areas of the Northern Australia. It should be used solely as a DS feed due to the harmful effects of grazing at other times of the year. Grazing in the late wet-early dry period particularly causes destruction of stands by trampling, puddling and plants being pulled out of the wet soil. A stocking rate of one beast per 1.5 to 2 ha is recommended as a safe stocking level for Hymenachne stands. Yield Hymenachne is a very lush plant, containing low levels of dry matter, generally 20 to 47%. Yields of 2,000- 3,500 kg/ha of dry matter can be expected at the end of the wet season for Nati ve Hymenachne. There is also re-growth following grazing or cutting in the dr y season, as Hymenachne occupies the deep flooding areas of the floodplains where the water table is close to the soil surface in the dry season. Quality Nitrogen contents of whole plants have averaged 2. 2 to 3.3% (13.8 to 20.6% crude protein) in WS and 1.8% the DS. Up to 4.2% (25% CP) nitrogen has been recorded in leaves of re-growth early in the WS. Phosphorus contents are 0.20% or over during the WS and 0.16% or over during the dry season. Haymaking Good quality hay has been made from Native Hymenachne. Pests and Diseases Tar spot ( Phyllachora spp.) has been recorded on Hymenachne acutigluma in the NT. Symptoms are numerous small (1.5 mm) black, shiny raised spots, round to oval in shape. This disease causes little damage and is not important. The caterpillars of Marasmia spp, a leaf roller of rice and other grasses attack both native and Olive hymenachnes. Symptoms are dead and dying leaf tips. A small caterpillar can generally be found in the rolled up leaf. The damage is much more severe in Olive hymena chne, and may affect production in some years. D. ALEMAN GRASS ( A Grass for Flooded or Ponded Pastures) Description Aleman Grass ( Echinochloa polystachya cv Amity) is a robust vigorous aquatic or semi aquatic grass which produces long stems that tend to grow upright or fl oat on the water surface. The stems are 10-15 mm in Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 14diameter, up to 2.5 metres long containing 7-10 nodes. Leaf blades which are 10-25 mm wide and 200-600 mm in length are smooth and hairless. The seed head is an open panicle 15-25 cm long producing seeds 4- 5 mm in length. Seed is sterile. The grass is a light blue-green colour. Climate and Soils Aleman Grass is a native southern USA to northern Arge ntina. It is suitable for areas receiving more than 1,000 mm average annual rainfall and is recommended fo r wet areas or for seasonally flooded. Aleman Grass grows well in the black cracking clay soils of Northern Australian coastal areas where flooding can occur for 7-12 months of the year. Aleman Grass w ill take deeper flooding than Para Grass but less than Hymenachne and there are reports of it growing in water to 3 m depth. Aleman Ponding with contour banks to keep an area flooded for a longer period of the year is likely to provide a good site for the growth of Aleman Grass. Banks planned and constructed to pond water up to about 1.2 m depth are suitable for Aleman Grass. Establishment Aleman Grass has to be established vegetatively. The procedure is to harvest the long stems during the WS when it is actively growing, trim off the leaves and plant sets/cuttings with 2-3 nodes into mud with only 1 node showing. Care should be taken to plant the stem pieces rightway up 1 to 4 metres apart in rows. Plant sets can be planted vertically, angled or horizontally but not upside down. Row spacing can be varied depending on when it will be grazed, and the level of grass competit ion. If a good first year stand is required, then plant spacings should be close i.e. on a 2 m x 2 m grid. If wide row spacings are used, ploughing between the rows at the beginning of the next wet season encourages spread. This can be done on a yearly basis until adjacent rows have merged. Herbicide may be substituted for ploughing. This method will be more economical in the planting of runners in the long term due to the labour costs in planting. This planting method can be used in w ater. The top of the stems should be above the water level. One end of the stem should be embedded in the mud. Establishment will be less successful if not planted in to the mud because of competition from existing vegetation and slower early growth. Cut stems, if kept covered, dark, cool and moist can be stored for a week or more. They will develop roots from each node prior to planting, which may aid in quicker establishment. If a track type vehicle is available, stems can be dropped into the water or mud in front of the tracks. In all planting situations the success depends on removing competition from other vegetation present so that the stems can root down from nodes that are in contact with the soil. With removal of competition, the plants can spread up to 4 m in the first season. Rows 10 metres apart should converge within 2-4 years. Fertiliser Requirements There is little information on fertilis er regimes. However, on the blac k cracking clays, stands have persisted well without any fertiliser applied. Requireme nts are likely to be similar to Para Grass where good responses to nitrogen applications are recorded in DM yields. Nitrogen fertiliser applied early in the establishment phase (e.g. when grass is 20-30 cm tall) is likely to incr ease tillering and DM production considerably. NPK fertilisers are likel y to boost Aleman Grass establishm ent where phosphorus levels are lower. Dry matter yields from 10-20 t/ha are expected after a wet season. Grazing Because of the wet areas where it grows, most grazing will be restri cted to the early DS once water recedes, through to the early wet season. It is good management to not graze too low just before deep flooding as plants will not survive inundation without leaf above the flooded wate r level. Generally 16-18 months should elapse before grazing i.e. during the second dry season. A light grazing in the first dry season may promote tillering and reduce some grass co mpetition. However, because Aleman Grass is very palatable, establishment may be sign ificantly reduced. Aleman Grass is usually grazed to the crown by cattle, buffalo and horses during the dry season. This does not reduce its ability to re-grow once moisture is again available. Over grazing during this earl y re-growth stage may cause problems with survival. Observations are that it is more palatable than Para Grass and the Hymenachnes. It recovers well when spelled. It is able to recover mois ture from lower soil levels more efficiently than Para Grass, actively Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 15producing green shoots later into the dry season on black cracking clay soils. Recordings of grazing productivity in South America sh ow that beef yields of 200-250 kg /ha/annum have been recorded. Nutrient Concentrations Ranges from 1.4% to 2.8% of nitrogen have been recorded from limited sampling. This equates to a crude protein content of 8.8% to 17.5%. Early WS re-growth has been measured as as 22% CP. Ranges from 0.14% to 0.28% phosphorus have been r ecorded on non fertilised black cracking clays. Hay Making/Silage Hay making is difficult on this species because of th e thick stem. If soil moistu re was still adequate or irrigation available then a reasonable quality hay could be made off the re-growth. Mixtures Suitable species would be Glenn or Lee Joint Vetc h or Murray Phasey Bean, for wetter areas and Bundey for only lightly flooded areas. In the long term mo st legumes will be out comp eted by Aleman Grass. Fire Although Aleman Grass can recover from a fire, it is recommended that these areas are protected by firebreaks as there will be high losses of nutrients from the mulch if it burns, le aving a period when there will be significantly greater evaporation and a complete lack of feed for the stock until the next rains or irrigation. Pests and Diseases As yet no pests or diseases have been recorded. Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 16K-4 F ORAGE INTRODUCTIONS IN XIENG KHOUANG PROVINCE The Province of Xieng Khouang province has become a priority area for cattle and buffalo production. At present most of the cattle and buffalo are found on the pine tree savannah grassland of the Plan of Jars in the centre of the province. The cattle and buffalo are reared traditionally, they feed mainly on native grasses ( Themeda sp. etc.,) which are burnt regularly to provide yo ung green shoots. Supplementation with untreated rice straw (and rice stubble) occurs in the DS. The province is characterised by three agro-ecological zones: - The pine tree grassland savann as. Elevation about 1,100 masl with average annual temp of 20 o C, average rainfall 1,500 mm, silty loam soils with pH 4.8 which are high in aluminium and low in available phosphorous and calcium. - Fertile soils at high altitude. Elevation 1,200 to 1, 500 masl. Loamy moderately acid soils (pH 5.7) of moderate phosphorous and high calcium content. These soils are mainly developed from limestone. - Fertile soils at low altitude. Elevati on 500 to 1,000 masl. Soils are sim ilar to the high altitude fertile soils. About 20 years ago a range of forages were tested at the Lat Saene Cattle Station on the Plain of Jars. As a result two species have been propagated for use, namely Napier or Elephant Grass and Paspalum plicatulum. The latter is being grown without fertiliser and their productivity in most areas is little better than the native grasses. A few years ago, seed of several va rieties were obtained from the Na m Suang Livestock Research Centre and sown at a number of sites. Under light grazing th ree species were found to grow well, namely, Gamba Grass Andropogon gayanus ( Progra m (UNDP/UNDAC/IFAD) grew 64 different introduced forages at 25 sites covering the th ree major agro-ecological zones of Xieng Khouang. The following results and conclusions were drawn: - No introduced forage grew satisfactorily in the infertile pine-tree savannas without phosphate fertiliser addition. However, Paspaulum pliculatum without phosphorous addition). - Oversowing the grassland savannas without both prior cultivation and phosphorous addition were not successful. - With both cultivation and phosphorous, several grasses grew well in the infertile savannas. Outstanding was Gamba Grass. However, the following were also excellent: Setaria sphacelata, Hamil and Makueni decumbens) . B. humidicola cv Tully showed promise for more heavily grazed and wetter areas. - Lotonis bainesii cv Miles was the outstanding legume for the infertile savannas but there was doubt as to its persistenmce (very severe end of season fungal foliage defoliation). - Other legumes with potential fo legumem in th e infertile savannas. However, Caliandra calothyrsus grew well in the more fertile backyards. - On the fertile soils, growth of the best forages was excellent without fertiliser addition. 2 All of the Stylosanthes varieties tested were apparently attacked by anthracnose leaf and stem nose fungus). Appendix K: Agriculture and Livestock Development November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - So cial Development Plan - Volume 2 17- On the high altitude, fertile soils, Desmodium intortum cv Greenleaf was the outstanding vigorous legume. Trifolium repens cv Haifa (White Clover) may be suitable for heavily grazed situations. At medium altitude Aeschynomene Americana cv. Glenn (American Joint Vetch) was also outstanding. - At all altitudes, Avena stiva cv. Saia (Saia Oats) was a satisfactory DS forage grass crop in unused, irrigated rice paddies, but fertiliser was necessary on infertile soils. Lolium multiflorum cv Tetila and Surrey (Italian forage crop in rice paddies. Fertiliser was essential and rice stubble burning highly beneficial paddies. Lotus pedinculatus cv Maku has also potential. - Neither fertiliser nor irrigation are necessary in some high altitude fertilse oils for successful growth of DS forages.

Table 81: WFS 1.1 Cereal/Legume WS Cro pping with Vegetable DS Production The main WS crops are Upland Rice and Maize grown as separate crops (rather being intercropped) with additional areas of legumes, namely Peanuts and Bl ack Beans. Fruit Trees (Mango, Lychee, Jackfruit, Guava, Pineapples and Banana) are planted on 500 sq m. DS cropping includes Maize together with Peanuts and Bl ack Beans, each occupying equal areas, and small areas of Cabbage, Chillies and Cucumber for one DS cropping only. Irrigated Paddy (1,600 sq m) is grown either on the lower terraces or a dedicated paddy area in both WS and DS. WS DS Upper Terraces - Crop Areas (sq. m) Crop 1 a/ Crop 2 b/ Upland Rice Maize Peanuts Black Beans Fruit Trees 1,500 1,500 750 750 500 Maize Peanuts Black Beans Cabbage Chillies Cucumber Fruit Trees 500 250 250 200 150 150 500 Total 5,000 Total 2,000 CI 100% CI 40% Lower Terraces - Crop Areas (sq. m) Crop Production (Whole Farm Scenario at Full Development by Year 3) Irrigated Paddy 1,600 Irrigated Paddy 1,600 Livestock Production Traditional buffalo rearing is continued by the household that are grazed in forest areas and seasonally within the drawdown area. Backyard production of pigs and poultry with improved animal heal th care through Project support. Observations The Model represents th e first stage of crop intensif ication moving away from the traditional intercropping of upland rice and maize to sole cropping together with areas of legumes grown in both WS and DS. Vegetable cropping in the DS is also introduced. Labour requirements for this model peak in November with a maximum of 38 days required at full development. This will enable most households to take advantage of employment opportuniti es during the construction period as well as allowing the fami ly to pursue other livelihood options including fishing and fo restry related activities. This WFS can be further inte nsified through the expansion of DS cropping of vegetables and enlargement of the areas planted to legu mes either as sole crops or as intercrops with Maize. The Model A (High Inputs) predicts a Gross Margin (excludi ng labour costs) of US$ 510 per annum by Year 6 of which US$ 220 will represent cash income.

Observations The Model depicts intensive buffalo or cattle raising with the cultivation of forage, both grasses and selected legumes, including some annual crops for forage, and the utilisation of this through a cut and carry system. The 0.5 ha plot will generate sufficient forage to feed 2 animals although there will be a periodic need for them to also graze in forested or in the drawdown areas. There is no cultivation of annual legumes or vegetables in this Model and the labour requirements are somewhat reduced in consequence. The production of irrigated rice on the lower terraces will also provide sm all areas of additional grazing after harvest for the livestock. Labour requirements for this Model peak in March with a maximum of 27 days required at full development which will be a constraint only for Households in Cate gory 4. For most households there would remain good opportunities for wage employment throughout most of the year. The Model predicts a Gross Margin (excluding labour co sts) of US$ 409 per annum by Year 6 of which US$ 330 represents cash income.

Observations The Model provides an example of a specialisation in duck production that might be adopted by some households where they have access to water. These households might al so have a farm lot that had a larger area of land suitable for planting irrigated paddy. Th e inclusion of maize will generate some of the feed requirements of the ducks supplemented by the grazing that they be able to do on their paddy land. It is an ticipated that the household would be able to also graze their du cks on other paddy land belonging to other households, the ducks providing very effective control of the Golden Snail. Labour requirements for this Model peak in December with a maximum of 59 days required at full development which will be a constraint for Households in Categories 4 and 5. The Model could be further intensified by the introduction of a second crop of vegeta bles in the DS depending on the availability of labour. The Model predicts a Gross Margin (excluding labour cost s) of US$ 1,329 per annum by Year 6 of which US$ 931 represents cash income. The Gross Margin will decline by 61% where the household reverts to lower input levels in Years 4 to 6.

Executive Summary The government of Lao PDR has allocated by Pr ime Ministerial Decree, 20,800 hectares of State Forest land for the resettlement of some 900 families, pa rt of whose traditiona l territories will be flooded by the reservoir for the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydropower Project. This Resettlement Area is located on the south-western edge of Nakai Plateau in Khammouane Province and has been allocated for the purpose of resettlers' livelihood support, which traditionally is based on agriculture, fishing and in recent years some wage income. The NT2 Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has identified community forestry as a sustainable source of augmentary income for the villagers to be resettled. The Nakai Plateau V illage Forest Association (NPVFA) incorporating community representation, will be establis hed to manage the forest resources. Owing to the restricted area of soils considered suitable for agriculture on the Nakai Plateau, the RAP envisages that, village forestry will need to augment resettlers' agricu ltural incomes by USD $300/family/annum. This income is to consist of USD $100 dividend from the logging of the forest in the Resettlement Area plus USD $200 from forest labor. It is anticipated that these two income components will be derive d from a share of proceeds fr om the sale of around 10,000 m 3 of saw log per annum The Forest Inventory and Planning Center (FIPC) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has been contracted by the NT2 Hydropower Project (NT2) to perform a forest management inventory of the Resettlement Area. This inventory follows a preliminary resettlement location planning and forest inventory exerci se performed by Margules Poyry in 1997. The objective is to use the inventory data as a basis for developing a Forest Management and Forest Harvesting Plan that will meet th e requirements of the RAP. A fi eld inventory was undertaken in January and February 2001, following the standa rd methodology utilized by the Department of Forestry (DoF) for initial planning of the layout of Forest Management Compartments for long term capital intensive logging operations. A 1% systematic sampling inventory plot layout was employed. Based on the survey results and assuming a 30 year felling cycle, the Resettlement Area has been divided into logging Manageme nt Compartments ranging in size from 150 to 450 hectares depending on the density of the forest. The logging schedule of the Resettlement Area was then prioritized over the thirty year cutting cycle, by ranking Compartments in order of Possible Logging Volume (PLV). The PLV is an indicative measur e of the remaining commercial volumes of trees of Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), exceeding 50 cm. It also incorporates a sustainability requirement, that not more than 25% of standing volume, may be cut at any one time during the 30 year logging cycle and that a minimum volume of follow on trees must remain after the cut. According to the MAF forest management inventory methodology, which prioritizes the sequence of Compartments to be logged during the ensuing fi ve years, the next step is to undertake a more intensive inventory, based on a 5% systematic sample immediately before logging each Compartment. This sampling intensity will reduce the error in the estimation of the annual cut from the current +/- 30% to close to +/- 10%. Th e information so gained will be used as a basis for setting rules for tree marking just prior to logging. The inventory indicated the follo wing. Twenty-six percent of the Resettlement Area has already been cleared or partially cleared for agricultur e. Another twenty-three percent is too steep for production forestry and has been classified as Protection Forest. A significant portion of the remaining area has been heavily logged. A further portion would need to be cleared for access Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 17roads and the possible expansion of Ban Oudomsou k (industrial and peri-urban zones). The total area of stocked natural forest (crown density >20%) covers 10, 144 hectares. Mixed Broadleaf and Coniferous ecotype (MS), composed of 68 percent of Pinus merkusii , is the dominant forest type, covering more than 70% of th e stocked forest. Hardwood spec ies cover the remainder of the stocked area. Except for Compartments located in the northwestern and southeastern extremities of the Resettlement Area, most of the easily accessible commercial tress above 50cm DBH have already been removed. Much of the remainder are located on steep slopes and along the drainage lines and are not easily logged by conventional heavy logging equipment. However, they could be exploited without significant environmental impact, by labor intensive methods. A significant portion of the forest (10%) located in flat areas in the low volume Compartments is severely degraded, with little or no regrowth of native timber species, because logging over the past 20 years has not followed sustained yield regimes, and because no control have been exerted over fires in the undergrowth. Much of the forest canopy has been opened excessively, leaving the remaining commercial trees expose d to wind-throw and/or excessive lateral growth and thereby, reduced log quality. Accordingly it will be necessarily to incorporate some forest rehabilitation into the Forest Management Plan. The recommended management regimes for such tract is salvage logging and/or replanting of a mixed forest stand, combining slower growing native commercial species with 'nurse crops' of faster growing leguminous species for so il improvement and the provision of short term income for the resettlers. Such areas could also be replanted to fast growing plantations. The total standing volume of sawlog trees with DBH exceeding 50 cm and which are potentially eligible for logging over the whole area of stocked forest is 500,000 m 3 +/- 5% (95 percent confidence limits). Of this, 383,000 m3 +/- 5% is located within the high stocked Mixed Broadleaf/Coniferous Species (MS) ecotype (covering 7,500 hectares ). The total volume of MS type forest which could be logged immediately, under current logging regulations, amount to 175,000 m3 +/- 5%. For the Mixed Deciduous (MD) and Dry Evergreen (DE) forest types, the volumes that can be logged un der current logging regulation s are 53,000 +/- 20% and 10,000 +/- 20% m3 respectively. Thus the total potential vo lume available for logging under the current regulations, is 238,000 m3. Currently, these harvesting rules would apply: a ch osen interval of 30 years between cuts, with a sustainability requirement that no t more than 25 percent of the standing volume should be removed in any one cut. These regulations on cutting intensity are imposed so as to encourage a closed canopy. A closed canopy minimizes latera l branching, preserves tree form and future log values, maintains growth rates and avoids wind-thr ow. Significant wind-throw is already evident on flat areas with shallow water-logged soils during the wet season. This has arisen because of the patch work even aged nature of much of the MS forest type which is reflected in the tendency for loggable trees to occur in patches, rather than be dispersed evenly throughout a uniform mixed age stand. At this juncture, the survey data indicate that the forest income requirements would not be met 20-30 years hence, if the family income fr om forestry is maintained at USD $ 30/m 3 of timber harvested and the logging regulations are adhered to. There are several possibilities for increasing the volume logged and the co mmunity's resultant income. A more dispersed logging operation , that skims the high volume logs from the whole forest every year, or a reduction of the logging cycle to 20 years are means by which the harvested volumes could be increased. However, a dispersed skimmi ng operation risks making the logging operation uneconomic and can open the canopy excessively where the remaining high log volumes occur in restricted areas of difficult access. Reducing the length of the logging cycle could be justified if forest growth rates were increased by about 30%, through intensive silviculture. Alternatives to increasing the volume of logs extracted, is to provide a greater proportion of log revenues, Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 18especially from the more valuable hardwood lo gs, to the community and/or involve the community more in the logging operation itself, thereby reducing monetary outgoing from the logging operation itself to comm ercial contractors. While the above modifications to the logging plan could result in increased volumes of timber extracted during the first cutting cycle, unless care fully implemented, they co uld pose some risk to sustaining log volumes in second and subsequent cuts. Moreover there is little margin for safety to deal with a contingency, such as a major fire through the forest. The means by which these problems can be avoided is to rehabilitate the areas of unstocked and degraded forest, by establishing fast growing plantations for the production and sale of pulpwood, thereby generating future income. A large Japanese market exists for wood-fibre ne arby. This market coul d be accessed from the Nakai Plateau area, once Highway 12 to Vietnam is sealed and easy truck access is obtained to the Vietnamese port of Vinh. Sealin g of the highway is expected by Year 2005. Economic Analysis of forest plantation trials conducted in the Lao PDR to date, indicate that the introduction of fast growing pulpwood plantations of Acacia species on over 2,000 ha of unstocked forest and degraded forest land, could potentially provide USD $200/family of annu al income from planting and harvesting the plantations. An advantage of the community undertaking such a venture, is that the annual cut from the natural forest could be reduced from its initial level of 10,000 m 3/year, to perhaps half that level after year 10. This would facilitate greater flexibility in the management, silvicultural improvement and rehabilitation of the natural forest. The dividend payment, when combined with earnings of USD $200/family/year from labor in the forest and it s plantations, plus any distributed earnings, would yield a total family income from forestry in th e Resettlement Area, in excess of the USD $300/year income required by the RAP.

Conclusions and Recommendations The forest needs to be salvage logged. The forest has been logged intermittently ov er the last decades and the distribution of commercial timber and potentially commercial timber is very uneven. Some areas have degraded and need enrichment plantings or, given the slow growth rate of native species, to be augmented by plantations of fast growing ti mbers. Others that have been overlogged will need to be salvaged to avoid the wastage of lo gs arising from wind-throw. Such areas should be identified using aerial photography at the sa me time as a baseline evaluation is undertaken of the Resettlement Area The suggested criteria for deciding whether to undertake salvage logging operations, is when the average tree spacing of trees (DBH>20 cm) exceeds the mean tree height over areas of more than 5 ha. This corresponds to a stand density of approximately 30 stems/ha (DBH>20 cm). The alternative to salvage logging in areas where the low stand density is not extensive is to replant fast growing species in the inter tree spaces. Use labor intensive logging methods in poorly accessible areas Forest located on steep areas or within more incised drainage channels have significant stands of commercial logs, due to the difficulti es experienced in accessing such locations with conventional mechanized logging equipment. Th e in-situ sawing of logs into billets and the use of animal or human draft is the favored method of extraction from such areas. Ease the pressure on the forest, maintain flexibility and grow plantations Providing the felling cycle for pines can be re duced to 20 years, or the restriction that no m o r e t h a n 2 5 % o f t h e s t a n d i n g v o l u m e i s r e m o ved, there is sufficient timber available to meet the requirements of the RAP. NTEC may be able to negotiate such a change to the logging plan. However, there may still be insu fficient flexibility in the resulting plan to overcome events such as a major fire. Accordingl y, it is suggested that rather than trying to increase the proposed rate of extraction of pine, consideration be given to generating income in years 20-30 through the establishment of plantations as early as possible, in all areas designated for forestry, but with sub-optimal tree cover. Plantations have the potential to yield income a decade after planting, so there is time for trailing potential species suitable to the po or soils of the region, determining optimum fertilizer inputs and establishing the market fo r plantation products. In clusion of plantations would not preclude extracting more timber from the mature forest than currently envisaged, if more detailed inventory indic ates that such extraction were c onsistent with sustained yield. Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 21Fire control and management must be included in the forest management plan. Many Compartments have been exploited and fire damaged and lack follow-on trees in the 1-20 years age class. These areas will need to be identified and monitored. P. merkusii is a fire climax species and regenerates after fire. A hot fire induces cones in the overstorey to open and provides an ash bed for seed to germin ate and then compete effectively with the understorey species. Too frequent fires, dest roys the regrowth before it has a chance to attain sufficient bulk and height to withstand su bsequent fires. If regrowth does not occur after a period of fire control, depending on the amount of understorey, either hand planting of follow on species, or a hot burn followed by fire control will be required, even though stand volumes might be significant. Social fire control and general fire protection should have a very high priority in the silvicultural plan. After physically protecting and rehabilitating eroded roadside drains and gullies, fire protection after an initial hot rege neration burn, will serve to restore a cover of leaf litter on the soil surface, thus preventing further top soil erosion. The control of too frequent fires, that destroy recent regenera ted stock, can be achieved through village organizations and awareness raising. The forest should be rehabilitated. The long-term natural forest management recommendation and harvesting plan detailed above, in practice applies mainly to the Compartments of the Resettlement Area which have not been logged or only partially logged. Though this report recommends sustainable land and forest management regimes, this has not b een practiced in the past in the Resettlement Area by either the logging concessionaires or the local community. Soil erosion and stand degradation have been the result and some potentially usable timber has been wasted by rotting or burning. The status of the forest and the degree of land degradation should be recorded at the same time as the areas requiring salvage logging are determined from aerial photography, and remedial action undertaken as soon as practicable. The rehabilitation of the forest will require the establishment of a seedling nursery to produce a mix of slow and fast growing native species, leguminous nurse trees and the applicable NTFPs. The seedlings will need to be grown in December through to May and then planted out in June. Enrichment planted Compartments must then be protected from grazing for at least the next two years. The estimated pl anting cost is USD $300-500/ha. The forest management model will also eventua lly need to consider the parallel production and introduction into the forest of those NTFPs upon which the RAP Livelihood Model relies, but which are not suitable fo r domestication in village gardens. Land that does not require a hot burn for regeneration, can be cheaply prepared for enrichment plantation by herding cattle and buffaloes in heavy concentrations to eat and trample the grass and weeds, Compartment by Compartment. The herds can be restricted to one Compartment at a time by the strategic pl acement of salt licks, supplementary feeding (green forage and salt) and by organizing a roster of supervisory herdsmen from the animal owning communities. Where degraded areas are not salvage logged, ther e will remain an urgent need to fill canopy gaps as quickly as possible. This should be done using fast growing trees in order to provide sufficient lateral competition to the remaining commercial trees, thus minimizing lateral branching and a loss in log value as quickly as po ssible. It is recommen ded to plant a mixture of a native species and exotic fast growing leguminous species such as Acacia mangium . At harvest after 5-6 years, these trees will provide po les, timber, fence post, pulp wood or chip wood while rejuvenating the top soil through nitrogen fixation and leaf litter deposition. They are also reasonably fire resistant and could be planted in rows along the roadsides, and firebreak alignments to reduce the cost of firebreak control. Acacia species could Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 22also serve as a nurse crop for slower growing na tive species when establishing the wind break following the reservoir shoreline. Native speci es should be reintroduced into each forest ecotype, some of which are slow growing but highly valuable. 3. Meeting the RAP Forestry Target Income To maintain the proposed cutting cycle of 30 ye ars in the forest management plan requires that the harvesting rate of the natural forest be reduced by 25% over the final 20 years of the logging cycle. Income to the community from fast growing plantations has the potential to reduce the cut over the last 20 years of the cycle by 66%, while maintaining family income from labor of at least USD $200/annum with a signif icant margin of safety (close to 100%). The area available for fast growing plantations consists of about 2,000 ha of unstocked forest and up to about 1,000 ha of forest to be salvage logged. The latter is no t always on the better soils, but unstocked forest is mainly bush fa llow and was originally the evergreen forest ecotype located on the better soils. Plantation forests located on evergreen ecotype in the region yield in excess of 25 tonne/ha/year of pulpwood. Assuming a plantation growth rate of 20 m 3/ha/yr on 2,000 ha of unstocked forest and a return on plantation wood of USD $15/m3, the income/family available to labor, mainly from the logging operation, is in the range of USD $100 to USD $200/annum. As most of the research and development has already been done in Lao PDR, a joint venture or similar arrangement, could result in this income being generated 10 years from the date planting commences, if the rate of forest establishment is set at 200 ha/yr starting from Year 3. By Year 10, the annual cut from only the natural forest could be reduced from 10,000 m 3 to 5,000 m3, and still provide a dividend payment of USD $100 (Table H-2). This would result in a sustainable remaining annual PLV for the natural forest. This is a significant reduction in the cut and provides an opportunity for th e logging operation to be much more selective so as to rehabilitate the forest and increase its growth rate. A potential limitation on the logging and rehabilitation of the natural forest is labor availability from Year 10 onwards (100 person da ys/family/year for all forestry activities). Thus it would be advisable to ensure that areas of difficult access are logged by labor intensive methods during the first ten years. Alternatively, the plantation areas could be reduced so as to ensure suffici ent labor is available for logging such areas at a later date In Years 1 and 2 of the rotation, there is a significant vacant and cultivated inter-row space (60-80% of land area) between the tree rows. Fe rtilizer applied during th ese years, is placed directly into the small volume of the root zone of the newly planted trees. Thus there is about 70% (1.4 ha/family) of the established plantation area that is already cultivated and which can be planted by villagers, to a rain -fed rice crop, without adverse effects on tree growth and robbing of the fertilizer input.

Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 31L-5 M INISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY (MAF) POSITION Following the National Public C onsultation on the RAP in January 1999, the Department of Forestry reviewed the forestry proposals in the RAP and subm itted their views to the Resettlement Committee on March 16, 1999, via a letter from the Director of the Forestry Depa rtment as follows: \"Views of the Department of Forestry Concerning the Community Forest Development for the Nakai Plateau Villages, Nam Theun 2 Project - With reference of Nam Theun 2 Hydro-electric Project. - With reference to the Resettlement Action Plan Submitted to GOL by the Resettlement Committee. The Forestry Department has the following views and position on the project: 1. First the Department of Forestry approves and agrees with the policies of the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project and the Resettlement Action Plan in the Project Area. 2. Regarding the developmen t of 13,750 ha of Nakai Plateau fore st, and in order to implement the project successfully as well as the policies with full participation and responsib ility from the resettled population, based on lessons learned, the views of the Department of Forestry are as follows: 2.1 The first action required is public information and consultation concerning government policy in terms of the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project. The concerned population should be properly informed and they must understand well prior to the implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan. 2.2 Selection of sites and Resettlement Areas should be distributed according to a suitable land allocation plan after discussion with members of the resettled population. 2.3 A Community Forest Management Committee shou ld be established at the village level to take responsibility for the forest, deal with state organizations and attend to the various forestry training requirements. 2.4 The responsible committee at the village level shou ld be trained in basic knowledge of forestry management, such as map interpretation, definition of villa ge border lines defining and map drawing etc. 2.5 The District and Province authorities should offi cially certify the border limit of each village. 2.6 Maps should be drawn showing the land alloc ation and projection of land utilization for a long term period of 10 to 20 years of each village. 2.7 Plans should be prepared by land and forest classification (cleared forest, dense forest, damaged forest). Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 322.8 Inventory planning of land suitable for production purpose (zone and plot defined according to the forest condition) should be carried out. 2.9 A forest action plan should be prepared an d logging should be acco rding to the management plan. For example, extraction could be 1.00 CUM, 1.5 CUM or 2 CUM per ha depending on the yearly yield of each species in the region). The forest action plan should conform with the integrated approach. The various species under the management plan will be divided for sa le to the market and for processing locally into finished or semi-finished products for th e village consumption in accordance with the demand. In addition, non timber forest products are encouraged in all aspects such as the trading, processing etc. (based on conditions and the resources in the region). Other employment opportunity promotion will depend on the long term land use planning which will identify appropriate area for different activities such as agriculture, livestock or tree planting. This production will contribute posit ively to increase the population's income. 2.10 Village forest development fund The village forest development fu nd is to be mainly funded from the sale of timber which is a benefit shared by the state and the population: th e income from the sale of logs at the second log yard, after forest royalty pa yment to the state, will be used as village socio-economic development fund by the population. (This should be discussed in more detail with particularly the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Finances.......with regards to the obligations and benefits distribution.\" Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 33L-6 F OREST MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION PROGRAMME (FOMACOP) Introductory Note : As part of a Case Study prepared by consultants for the ADB*, the following discussion on Village Forestry prov ides a background overview. It is understood by NTEC that the subsequent MAF Regulation 535 of June 18, 2001 on the Management of Village Fo restry, does not apply to the special case of the Naka i Plateau, as this is covered by Decree 37/PM of April 12, 2002. * Seatec International. Strengthening Social and Environ mental Management Project (SSEMP) - Asian Development Bank (TA3133). July 2000. Background The Forest Management and Conservation Programme (FOMACOP) Phase 1, is a five-year program scheduled for conclusion in Septem ber 2000, executed by the Department of Forestry (DOF), of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF). The project budget, of around USD $ 20.3 million, was provided by the World Bank (USD $ 8.7 Million), the Global Environmental Facility of the United Nations (USD $ 5 million), the Government of Fi nland (USD $ 5.6 million) and the GOL (USD $ 1 million). FOMACOP consists of two sub-programmes: the Forest Management Sub-programme, which focuses on the development and implementation of Village Forestry, and the National Biodiversity and Conservation Area (NBCA) Management Sub-programme, which focuses on the conservation of biodiversity, using an Integrated Conservation & Development (ICAD) approach. Jaakko P\u00f6yry Consulting of Finland provided techni cal assistance along with the Vientiane based Burapha Development Consultants and the NGO CARE International under the forestry component. MIDAS Agronomics of Thailand provided technical assistance within the conservation component, while the NGOs World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and th e World Conservation Society (WCS) cooperated with the FOMACOP National Biodiversity & Conservation Area (NBCA) Management Sub-programme. In Phase 1 of the program (1995- 2000) the goals of FOMACOP were: To develop and trial pilot schemes that improve the implementation of sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation systems; and To strengthen villagers' and fore stry staff's capacity to Implem ent these systems, and to seek acceptance for the developed systems as a basis for expanding their implementation. During a second phase, expected to commence in 2002, the goal will be: To expand these systems beyond the pilot sites and to continually develop, test and improve other systems elsewhere. At the national level, FOMACOP aims to promote the sustainable management of forest through the development of forest and conservation policy. Within the impact area of the project FOMACOP aims to (i) promote Village Forestry in two Provinces (Savannakhet and Kh ammouane), (ii) improve the well being of villagers in the project area and (iii) to establish four NBCAs and bring them under efficient management (in the Provinces of Savannakhet, Khammouane, Saravan/X\u00e9 Kong and Champasak/Attapeu). It is the Forest Management sub-Programme that has primarily drawn the attention of the SSEMP Team, with its potential to maintain rura l community incomes above the poverty level, and thence its potential use in community based watershed management and as a component in the planning and implementation Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 34of resettlements associated with large infrastr ucture projects. By the end of 1999 FOMACOP was working in 60 villages, with approximately 18,000 peop le, over an area of 145,000 ha. They claim to have brought about 115,000 ha of forest under sy stematic, sustainable forest management. The Village Forestry Concept Village forestry is a partnership between the GOL and the local villagers, which aims to bring all forested land within their traditional village territories under the sustained-yield management of the local villagers. The forest remains legally under the ownership of the GOL, with the village rs compensated for its management and protection by allowing them to keep net revenue after the payment of royalties and other taxes, of which part is channeled back into fore st management. The villager's customary use of the forest is recognized. Income, whic h is not channeled back into forest management, goes to the village community for the financing of community projects, such as schools, potable water supply, small irrigation schemes, etc. A basic premise of the FOMACOP development concept is that in the face of poverty and increasing population pressure, forest resource s can be protected only if forestry contributes to meeting villager's basic needs and to their overall economic and social development. Sustainable forest management in itself will not improve villager's well being unless so me revenue from forest management is invested directly into the farm family cash flow, or indirectly by the promotion of development, livelihood projects and small businesses. FOMACOP claims that many other Community Forest projects have failed primarily because villagers have been allocated poor quality forests, or totally deforested village land, that cannot support the population and even less generate the surpluses essential for financing development. In FOMACOP's adopted village forestry approach, villagers will be ma naging natural Production Forests, which fall within their traditional (customary use) territories. The areas range in size from about 800 hectares to up to 6000 hectares, containing dry dipterocarpus forest and dry evergreen/mixed deciduous hardwood forests, which have good commercial potential, and can provide more or less immediate benefits. The final decision as to how the forests within a village territory are used lies with the villagers, in so far as they stay within the regulatory framework. The villagers also collect most of the social, technical and economic information needed to formulate and implement their plans. Forestry staff, primarily from the District Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO), provides management control, extension services, training and technical assistance to assist villagers in the planning and management. The DAFO staff are in turn trained through a strengthened Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office (PAFO). It is essential to have the necessary checks and controls both in planning and implementation to ensure that forest management will be sustainable, and that the system is not abused by villagers or people coming from outside. This function is th e responsibility of both DAFO and PAFO. Benefits of Village Forestry FOMACOP's Village Forestry model has the potential to provide benefits to all stakeholders. It brings Production Forests and Protection/Conservation Fore sts within the village fo rest management area under sustainable management and ef ficient protection, which has the po tential to ensure its availability for future generations. Lao PDR Society as a whole benefits from the collection of timber-related royalties and taxes. In 1999 about 70 percent of the value of logs (at a depot) was returned to the state. Another benefit is transparency, with checks and controls, which mean that there should be no \"leakages\" and the government should obtain the full, true commercial value of the timber. In relative terms however, FOMACOP claims it should be the villagers who are the greatest beneficiaries, since in the past they were not entitled to financially benefit from Production Forest management at all. In 1999, when the regional timber markets were still depressed, villages were earning on average USD $ Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 353,000, which equates to approximately USD $ 60 per family1. In the future, average revenues are expected to increase as a result of forest certification and improved international market situation. Village forestry has also generated local employment, which is very important in areas where employment opportunities are limited, especially during the dry season. Almo st all the villages want to use the revenue, which remains after allocating part of the funds into forest management, for improving water supply and developing agriculture, which will in turn lead to an improved and hopefully sustainable livelihood in the future. Several villages have planned to improve basi c infrastructures, such as access roads and bridges, and to build schools. FOMACOP is also actively trying to attract other organizations to start development activities in the districts where village forestry is being promoted. This will help ensure that development of various sectors will be balanced and cons istent with villagers needs. Lessons Learnt & Recommendations The FOMACOP management model is designed to meet the specific requirements of the various forest types encountered in the project area. The forest management system is both comprehensive and technically excellent. It not likely to adversely chan ge the biodiversity or species composition of the forest, nor does it deplete the standing volume. The pre-harvest inventory, assessment of natural regeneration before and after harvesting, the markin g of seed trees and control of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) extraction, aim at ensuring sustai nability and even improving the productivity of the forest. Harvesting is implemented at a lower rate than the growth of the forest. On average only 1-2 trees per hectare are removed at each entry in acco rdance with comprehensive selection criteria. The February 2000 World Bank/Government of Finlan d's (GOF) Supervision Mission review of the combination of silvicultural measures, harvesting and lo gging practices, control of illegal cutting, grazing, NTFP extraction and fire prevention indicates that the FOMACOP model provides the vital elements needed for sustainable forest management. The Mission was convinced that independent third-party certification assessment would confirm this finding an d open the way to VFA (Village Forest Association) access to high value international markets for sustainably harvested timber. The Mission was also convinced that, while a range of institutional and technical approaches need to be developed in the Lao forestry sect or, the village forestry model de monstrated by FOMACOP could be the basis for the development of a significant portion of the resource base and that it has enormous potential to contribute to sus tainable poverty alleviation and Go vernment revenue mobilization. Whilst the Village Forestry model has been demonstrated most comprehensively and successfully, the project has had less success with the implementation of ICAD in the buffer zones of the project areas NBCAs, nor has it yet been able to convince the GO L of the nationwide need and applicability of the Village Forestry model. Some reasons for these problems are as follows: The GOL depends heavily on the proceeds of logging for financing its activities in both the civilian and military spheres. Instead of defining Villa ge Production Forests ac cording to the income needs of villagers, vis-\u00e0-vis maintaining themselves reasonably above the national poverty level, the project has raised expectations that the villagers will have a continuing right to share in the proceeds of logging from the entirety of their indi genous village territories. Previously, without roads and sawmills, the forests were of no commerci al value to the villagers , except as sources of NTFPs. The GOL's view, justifiably, is that the advent of roads and processing infrastructure represents and unearned windfall for the local in habitants and would prefer to see each village territory demarcated between Village Production Forest (sized according to family income needs) and State Production Forest. 1 By comparison, in planning for meeting the income targets for the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project, a forestry wage labor income of USD $ 200 per family was projected, plus a USD $ 150 share a revenue from timber sales, of which USD $ 50 is assigned to community development and USD $ 100 to family cash flow. Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 36 Due, in large part, to FOMACOP having counterparts in the DOF rather than in the MAF as a whole, individual farm incomes have not yet been significantly augmented by the proceeds of Village Production Forests manageme nt nor have unsustainable agricultural land use practices been rectified (income from timber sales has been devo ted mainly to improvements at community level, such as village road access, clinics, schools etc.). Low agricultural productivity forces the farmers to attempt to expand their cattle and buffalo herd s and to extend their grazing areas by frequent firing of the grasslands and savannahs. This exacerbates soil erosion and leads to the degradation of adjacent forests. To be more holistic, theref ore, the project future Ph ase 2 should incorporate a technical support component to be devoted to ag ricultural intensification stabilization measures such as water harvesting, pasture improvement, irrigation system expansion and upgrading, aquaculture, fruit orchard establishment and the home garden production of vegetables, herbs and spices. The World Bank/GOF Supervision Mission Draf t Aide-Memoire (February 2000) seeks to attribute lack of progress in the Biodiversity Conservation component of FOMACOP to delays in the implementation of land allocation. The aide-Memoire fails to mention that land allocation and other conservation measures such as disarming the population or forbidding access to NBCA core areas cannot succeed unless viable livelihood substi tutes are first provided for the buffer zone and enclave communities. These aspects are di scussed in depth in the 1999 IUCN report on Community Development in the Nakai-Nam Theun NB CA (Ban Mak Feuang Pilot Village). This report also highlights the contention that wit hout parallel integrated ru ral development support measures on both sides of the Lao-Vietnam border it is unrealistic to hope for effective forest or biodiversity conservation in eastern Lao PDR. Neither is land allocation as currently practiced in the Lao PDR a solution to the problems of human impact on conservation areas. The current policy of providing only three plots of bush fallow to swidden cultivators will only lead to yi eld decline and weed infestation. Moving the swidden villagers to focal zones ex acerbates forest destruction in those focal zones without leading to forest regeneration in the lands vacated, nor provides any means of resisting incursions by highland dwelling ethnic minorities from neighboring countries. Rectification of the drawbacks of the land allocation processes currently in vogue are being addressed by NAWACOP, whereby land development and soil conservation are introduc ed as components of the process. Current institutional reorganization will place land allo cation under the responsib ility of a new resources management agency in the Prime Minister's Office (Report of the meeting of the National Land Allocation Committee, Paks\u00e9, 20-22 nd December 1999). The focus of FOMACOP's village forestry model has be en, up till now, on natura l Production Forests. In the future it will be important to strengthen th e management of all land resources within village boundaries in a more integrated manner. Agro-forestry and other interventions, such as industrial tree plantations, must be developed to provide adequate bene fits to villages, which do not have forest resources. Unless this equity issue is re solved conflicts over resources may arise. FOMACOP notes that the sustainabilit y of efforts is a key issue everywhere, including FOMACOP. Provincial trainers and DAFO/PAFO field staff have now enough skills and experience to sustain village forestry work in the project area and even expand to new areas provided th ey will continue to enjoy adequate levels of compensation post-project. VFA ar e also becoming stronger and stronger. However, this is not enough. FOMACOP states that the following issues must be addressed before Village Forestry will become a feasible proposition in the long term: A supporting policy, legal and organizational environment for village forestry, and sustainable forest management in gene ral, must be created; A system of financing village forestry must be developed; Appendix L: Nakai Plateau Forestry: Policy and Background Documents November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 37 Provincial and District forestry offices must be re-oriented to become more service-oriented organizations with adequate capacity to both support and control village forestry operations; VFAs and groups of VFAs must be further strength ened both organizationa lly and technically. This again will require strengthening forest extens ion services. Village forestry extension must become a routine function of DAFO and PAFO; and External \"pull-factors\", which help in sustaining or even driving village fore stry development in the future, must be established. Forest certification and linkages between the forest managers (state and villagers) and industry/marke t could become such forces. A possible alternative to placing such reliance on DAFO and PAFO is to organize joint venture contracts incorporating an ethical, international forest management corporation to provide the necessary technical support and international linkages. As FOMACOP notes, it is however important to put things into perspective. Although FOMACOP's village forestry project is large, even by international standards, the reality is that in relation to the total forest area in Laos or the annual total removals , village forestry is still practiced on a very small scale. To really make a difference, it is necessary to expand village forestry to new areas. In the case, particularly in the rain shadow area s of Savannakhet Province, where soils are generally poor and erodible and irrigation possibilities few, income from forestry activities will need to remain the most important component of the rural family cash flow. There is a current tendency on the part of the GOL administrators to view \"conservation\" and \"development\" as mutually exclusive activities, and therefore to place heav y emphasis on \"development\". For sustainability however, hand-in-hand .

The Khamkerd District officials have proposed two possible areas for village and irrigation development. The areas are adjace nt to the small rivers of Houay Sot and Nam Pan and both can be reached from the Lak Sao to Nakai Road No. 8B. Bolisat Phattana Khet Phoudoy (BPKP) has prepared drawings and a design report for the Ho uay Sot irrigation scheme. The Khamkerd District Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO) have prepared a preliminary assessment report on the Nam Pan irrigation scheme and have commenced topographical survey. It is planned to move the two villa ges no later than 2005. Consequently , for planning pur poses, the number of households was increased slightly to fifty. An irrigate d plot area of 1.5-ha per family has been assumed, as these resettlers will have reduced opportunities when compared to the resettl ers on the Nakai Plateau. Consequently a net irrigation area of 75-ha is required. Taking into account land lost by right of way for canals, access tracks, plot boundary berms, high and lo w spots, etc, the area should be increased by 10 per cent and a gross area of 82.5-ha established. The Houay Sot drawings and design re port were reviewed and not considered feasible. The scheme area is 63-ha and located near to a river, the Nam Phao, that caused considerable flash-flood damage along its banks at the end of the last wet season. The scheme requi res two fairly large embankment dams, 160 and 150-m long and height from streambed to crest of around 16-m, a spillway, two main canals and two secondary canals. The estimated cost is US$ 454,116 or US$ 7,208 per hectare. The final cost is likely to be considerably more as the spillway design is not good and no dam geotechnical investigations have been undertaken. The Houay Sot catchment area above the dams is relatively small at 9 km 2 and it is unlikely that most years there will be discharges during the last few months of the dry season. The relatively high dam heights are necessary to raise water levels so that river flow is di verted into the two main canals. Without pumping, none of the water stored behind the dams is \"live\" storage and can be used for irrigation. For the above reasons, it is recommended that the Houay So t Scheme is not pursued further. The Khamkerd DAFO has recently commenced investig ating the Nam Pan scheme. The proposed area is located in an undulating area of low hills between moun tains to the east and the relatively flat Lak Sao town area to the west. The undulations are between 509 masl and hills over 540 masl. The area is mostly mixed forest with dense undergrowth with a few areas cleare d, assumed by farmers from the nearby existing Ban Nam Pan. The Nam Pan is a larger stream than the Houay Sot with a catchment area of 13.8-km 2 above the proposed dam site. The area has a good forest cover and the river is perennial but with low end of dry season flows. There are a series of narrow winding tracks in the area and the present distance from Road 8B to the proposed dam site is about 12-km. Unfortunately the DAFO preliminary proposal appears to be heading in an expensive direction. The report gives brief details of an earth dam 780-m long and 28. 7-m high from streambed to crest. The cost is estimated between US$ 0.9 to 1.5 million depending on the depth from streambed to an impervious foundation and the unit rate us ed for compacted earth fill (the DAFO unit rate is US$ 2.5/m 3 and the Pilot Village rate is US$ 1.4/m3). The spillway and main canal intake stru cture are likely to be expensive as a general rule is that the higher the embankment dam, th en the higher the cost of these structures. The spillway has a greater drop from the crest back to the riverbed and the intake structure has a greater depth from the crest to the lower reservoir storage depths. It is assu med that DAFO wish to store as much water as possible for maximum area dry season irrigation. A less expensive option is to: Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 2 Do not attempt to create a large reservoir storage volume for dry season irrigation of rice. Assume wet season rice and dry season non-rice crops. Do not attempt reservoir storage for all the dry seas on. The structure is designed to store dry season night flows only or perhaps no storage, diversion only. Do not attempted to irrigate land above the 530-masl contour. Then a dam around 190-m long and 15-m height is requi red with an indicative cost of around US$ 122,800 based on a foundation depth of 5-m and unit rate of US$ 2.5/m 3 for the compacted fill. An irregular rectangular shape irrigation area and grav ity open channel canal system has been identified. The area is about 265-ha but includes fift een hills of various sizes that cannot be commanded by a canal system at a water elevation of about 530-masl. After deducting these areas, plus some more for a swamp area and other undulations and steeper slopes , it is considered safer to assume an ar ea of around 150-ha. This is sufficient for the Sop Hia and Nam Nian resettled households plus about 67-ha extra. Farmers from Ban Nam Pan could use this extra area. A preliminary canal system has a main canal supplying four secondary canals. These in turn supply a series of tertiary canals. The canals are excavate d and wind along the side of the hills in the area and irrigate the lower land. Imported canal compacted earth fill volumes are minimized. Because of the undulating nature of the area, the canal lengths are relatively long when compared to a \"flat\" area irrigation scheme. The main canal is about 0.7-km long, the four secondaries about 3.9-km lo ng and the tertiaries over 5.3-km long. If vehicle access tracks are incorporated along the canal bank s, the earthwork volumes increase considerably. Provisionally, vehicle access is limited to the main canal only. The canal system will require regulation, conveyance, protection and measuring structures including turnouts, checks, emergency spillways and culverts. The area is naturally draining in th ree directions and the inclusion of a drainage system is not required. The resettlers will decide the location of the new village housing. A good possible site is along the banks of the Nam Pan on the northern boundary of the scheme. It is proposed that the existing access road from Road 8B to the existing Ban Nam Pan is upgraded by some realignment, widening and a gravel surface. A new road can then follow the Nam Pan in an easterly direction to the villa ge housing area and then on to the new dam site. Other possible housing sites are above the new reservoir and on the high ground above the main canal. The latter location has th e advantage of less walking distance to the scheme southern areas. The housing area will include buildings for a school, cl inic, community center, workshop and rice mill. A new village domestic water supply will be installed. Hand dug wells with handpu mps are proposed as there are no streams that can provide a gravity fed supply av ailable. Pour flush latrines will be installed at every house. An electricity supply will be provided. Lak Sao has a good supply from the Theun Hinboun Power Station. It is proposed to install a new 22 KV line along Road 8B to the village, about 9-km long. The forested Nam Pan catchment area is in good condition and has good potential for the collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and hunting. The Nam Pan area appears suitable and it is recommended that it be pursued further. Technically, the next step is a Nam Pan irrigation scheme pre-feasibility study. The existing Ban Nam Pan must be consulted, as they will have traditional rights to at least part of the area under consideration an d the discharge in the Nam Pan will be affected by the new sc heme. The Khamkerd DAFO has commen ced topographical survey. If the completed maps show that a canal system can comman d a suitable area without undue large earthworks volumes, then this, plus the consultations with Ban Nam Pan and some exercises on dam size and reservoir storage volume, will suffice as this study. If the pre-feasibility investigations prove positive then further feasibility studies are required. Important are geotechnical investigations for the dam and spillway as is a more in-depth examination of the cropping patterns, cost of various reservoir storage options with regard to dry season river discharges and downstream riparian flows. This includes considering full dry season storage, nigh-flow storage and no storage, i.e., use a Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 3diversion weir and no crops grown for several months of the year. Also important is discussion and agreement on the scheme beneficiaries. Will the beneficiaries be: Sop Hia and Nam Nian resettlers only? The resettlers plus Ban Nam Pan households? Not in cluding them in the scheme may cause friction and problems later. They could use the area irrigated by Secondary Canal S1. Also households from other villages if there is area available? The Khamkerd DAFO identified the Nam Pan scheme as part of their own irrigation development programme with regard to reducing shifting cultivation areas and poverty alleviation. If the scheme is proved feasible, then it is unlikely that the District will simply allow NTEC to develop the area without any conditions. They will likely wish to maximize the scheme and incl ude other farmers. NTEC are unlikely to finance a large scheme for non- Project farmers and cost sharing with the Khamkerd District authorities should be considered and is a pr eferred option. However it should be noted that cost sharing might lead to later complications regarding the choice of Consultants for further studies and detail design, and the choice of Contractors for construction. Then later, the District may have problems with making payments of its share of the cost to the Contractor. Indicative cost estimates have been prepared with two summaries. Summa ry No. 1 is for a 150-ha irrigation scheme assuming that the scheme should include farmers from the existing Ban Nam Pan and NTEC finances the full scheme. Summary No. 2 considers an option for cost sharing with NTEC financing the dam, spillway, main canal and the cost of th e remaining irrigation development is shared with Khamkerd District. Table 1 shows that the Summary No. 1 grand total is US$ 805,200 at US$ 16,104 per household for the fifty Sop Hia and Nam Nian households. The irrigation sc heme claims 56 per cent of the total at US$ 447,100. For a 150-ha scheme, the cost is reasonable at US$ 2, 981 per hectare. Indicative estimates for access road construction, village housing and co mmunity buildings, water supply and sa nitation, and electricity supply have also been prepar ed totaling US$ 358,100. Summary No. 2 shows the NTEC cont ribution is US$ 731,400 at US$ 14,628 per household for the fifty Sop Hia and Nam Nian households. Kham kerd District contributes US$ 73, 800 for the remaining 67.5-ha area development. The irrigation sc heme cost is US$ 373,300 or US$ 4,525 per hectare for 82.5-ha.

Two of the other three villages, Ban Sop Hia and Ban Nam Nian, had previously indicated du ring public consultations that sect ions of the villages wish to be resettled north of the reservoir, near to Lak Sao (L ak 20), the Khamkerd District Centre, Bolikhamxay Province. A significant number of the households in the two villages were originally from this area. Figure 1 shows the location of Ban Sop Hia, Ban Nam Nian and Lak 20. The Project package for resettled villages includes ne w housing, water supply and sanitation, road access, irrigation facilities and other means of livelihood, el ectricity supply, and comm unity facilities including community and health centers, rice mill, workshop and school. The Manager of the Resettlement Management Unit (RMU) had previously held discussions with Khamkerd District officials and had been shown drawings for a Houay Sot Irrigation Scheme located near to Lak Sao. Consequently the Irrigation Consultant visited Lak Sao on 5 and 6 June 2003 accompanied by the RMU Manager, Mr. Hoy Phomvisouk. They met with the Dist rict Governor, DAFO officials, principally Mr. Khampanh Xayavong, Deputy Head of Agriculture and Forestry, and made a site visit. The District officials proposed two areas: 1. Houay Sot Irrigation Phoudoy (BPKP). BPKP had prepared one volume of drawings and a design report dated January 2001. 2. Nam Pan scheme under prelimin ary assessment by DAFO. Inve stigations had commenced in March 2003 and a topographical survey had commenced. The two areas are covered by 1:25,000 map sheet E-48-67-A-c. Lak Sao is shown on adjacent map sheet No. E-48-66-B-d. Figure 2 below is taken from these map sheets and shows the location of Lak Sao and the proposed Houay Sot and Nam Pan areas. Aerial photographs L-10B, 25 and 26, also cover the areas. 2.2 Number of Households to be Resettled near Lak Sao On 8 June 2003, the RMU Manager had further public consultations with the two villages. The household numbers that wished to be resettled near Lak Sao are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Ban Sop Hia and Ban Nam Nian Preferred Resettlement Locations No. of Households Village Lak Sao Nakai Reservoir Elsewhere Totals Sop Hia 21 32 4 57 Nam Nian 26 0 0 26 Total 47 32 4 83 The projected number of affected households to be resettled is based on a natural household expansion of 2.2 per cent per annum. At this time it is planned th at the two villages will either move in 2004, or at the latest in 2005, in two years time. A rate of 2.2 per cent per annum equates to a total increase of 4.5 per cent over two years. This equates to 49 households. To include a minimum factor of safety, the number of resettled households considered in this report has been rounded up to 50.

Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 7 2.3 Livelihood/Income Scenario 2.3.1 Farm Plot Area For the villages that will be resettled adjacent to the Nakai Reservoir, th e following irrigation facilities per household will be provided: 0.5-ha irrigated farm plot for growing field crops, perhaps wet season rice, vegetables, fruit trees, and fodder for livestock consumption; 0.15-ha irrigated paddy for wet season supplementary irrigation and perhaps vegetables and fodder in the dry season. However, when resettled near the reservoir, the resettlers will have access and opportunity for: Fisheries resources from the reservoir; The Nakai Plateau Village Forest ry Association which will pay ea ch household US$ 100 per year and employ somebody from each household for at least 50 days a year; Other employment opportunities created both during and after construction of the hydroelectric project. Near Lak Sao they will not have the sa me opportunities, therefore the irri gated plot size must be increased accordingly. Table 3 shows a comparison of projected household incomes from livelihood elements at full development. The table shows that a 1.5-ha size plot at Lak Sao will provide a similar income to the Nakai Plateau.

Cost of seed, fertilizer and chemicals deducted. *2 An increased area is shown, as the resettlers will have no opportunity fo r forestry, fisheries and increased employment opportunity. *3 Field crops include maize, beans and peanuts. Forage crops for fodder production also included. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 8*4 There is more potential for gathering non-timber forest products and hunting near the two possible irrigation areas than on the Nakai Plateau. Consequently a 1.5-ha irrigated farm plot has been chosen. 2.3.2 Irrigation Scheme Area Required For fifty households and a plot area of 1.5-ha, a net irrigation area of 75-ha is required. Allowing a 10 per cent increase for land lost by right of way for farm access roads and walkways, irrigation canals, drains, terrace berms, and other non -farm areas such as natural gullies, term ite mounds, other lo cal high spots and depressions, a 82.5-ha gross scheme area is required. 3 HOUAY SOT IRRIGATION SCHEME : CONSIDERED NOT FEASIBLE 3.1 Introduction The proposed Houay Sot scheme is located about 6-km nor theast of Lak Sao. The Houay Sot is a tributary of the Nam Phao, which is the river that flash-flooded an d caused a considerable amount of damage along its banks at the end of the last, 2002, wet season. As Stated previously, BPKP have prepared a volume of drawings and a design report. The design report concentrates on topographical survey results and canal design only, with no details of the dam and spillway design. It also contains an Engin eers Estimate of total US$ 454,115.80. The scheme irrigation area is 63-ha. This is smalle r than the 82.5-ha area re quired for the resettlement irrigation scheme and is sufficient for about 38 households. However the report and drawings were reviewed because it is not imperative that the tw o villages use the same irrigation area. 3.2 Scheme Components The drawings volume shows th e following sche me components: 3.2.1 Embankment Dam No. 1 Embankment Dam No. 1, with spillway , is located fairly close to th e confluence with the Nam Phao. Important dam details area as follows: Crest length about 160-m Crest elevation 520.50 masl Full Supply Level (FSL) & Spillway elevation 519.00 masl C r e s t w i d t h 4 - m Max. height from natural surface to dam crest 15.87-m Upstream & downstream side slopes 1:4 and 1:2 The drawings indicate a zoned dam. There is no geotechnical information shown and consequently it is doubted that any investigations have been made. 3.2.2 Dam No. 1 Spillway A spillway consisting of a reinforc ed concrete box-culvert located on dam fill about 50-m from the left abutment. There are 7 boxes of dimension 2 x 1-m. Areas of hand-placed rock are shown on the dam upstream and downstream side-slopes adjacent to the culvert. This arrangement is inappropriate and discharge through the spillway will ca use dam downstream erosion. The sp illway should also be located on natural ground left of the dam fill. 3.2.3 Embankment Dam No. 2 and Main Canal Intake Structures Embankment Dam No. 2 is a saddle dam required to prevent impounded water from overflowing into another, southern, watershed area. The dam has similar characteristics to Dam No. 1 as follows: Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 9 Crest length about 150-m Crest elevation 520.50 masl C r e s t w i d t h 4 - m Max. height from natural surface to dam crest 15.6-m Upstream & downstream side slopes 1:4 and 1:2 This dam has two Main Canal irrigation outlets (MC 1 and MC 2) shown to provide water to relatively flat southern area. Similar to th e spillway, the outlets should be located in the adjacent natura l ground away from the compacted fill. The MC outlet pipe diameters are 1-m and the invert elevations are shown at 518.00 masl. As the dam FSL level is 519.00 masl, all the water stored behind the dams is dead storage and there is no live reservoir storage for irrigation purposes . The addition of pontoon mounted pu mp sets and delivery pipelines to stilling basins would be required to utiliz e this water stored behind the dams. 3.2.4 Irrigation Canal System The canal system for the 63-ha irrig ation area consists of tr apezoidal compacted earth- fill open channels. The following canals are required: MC 1 835-m long SC 1, MC 1 186-m MC 2 216-m There are no tertiary or quaternary canals shown to distribute the water further and to irrigate individual paddy plots. MC 1 crosses an area of low ground where there is a natural drain. The height of fill from top of canal bank to the culvert pipe invert elevation is 8.36-m. 3.3 Design Problems As stated above, there are no geotechnical details regarding embankment design for the two compacted earth-fill dams. This includes, but not limited to, no de tails on borrow pit materials for the different zones and depth to a suitable impervious dam foundation. The spillway arrangement is unsuitable as regard the downstream protection required to prevent erosion. It should be located away from the embankment comp acted fill. There is no hydrological information or calculations regarding the spillway de sign flood. No hydraulic calculations and information on the estimation of spillway dimensions. The catchment area is about 9-km 2 and the 50-year design flood should be about 52 m3/s. The arrangement and design of the components is su ch that even with two sizeable dams, there is no reservoir storage for times of low or no-flows in the Houay Sot. The scheme is basically a \"run-of-the-river\" type. As the catchment area is sma ll, there will be some dr y dry-season months and any economic analysis cannot include a full dry-season crop. A height of fill of 8.36-m on MC 1 is excessive. Consideration should be given to a canal inverted siphon structure under the drain at this location. The scheme is located adjacent to the Houay Phao. If the scheme had been constructed during the 2001/02 dry season, then not much of it woul d have survived the 2002 September flood. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 103.4 Scheme Costs The Engineers Estimate is US$ 391,479 plus 2% for construction supervisio n, 4% for transport and 10% for tax, total US$ 454,116. DAFO stated that if they were gi ven the construction contract, they would not charge for supervision and tax. The main components of the estimate are as follows: Canal compacted earth fill, 34,795 m 3 at US$ 2.50/m3 $ 86,989 (MC is Dam 2, 35,134 m3) For 63-ha, the cost is US$ 7,208 per he ctare. This is too high for a sc heme with dry season water supply problems and the risk of wet season flood damages. The final estimate may well be considerab ly more when considering the following: A more suitable design for the spillway is included; The results of the required geotechnical invest igations are incorporated into the dam design; If, similar to the Pilot Village Dam, a suitable fo undation depth is 8-m below the stream bed level, then the dam embankment volume s will be considerably higher; The inclusion of filters between the two zones and a downstream horizontal drainage blanket; Rock protection on the upstream dam fa ces and sodding on th e downstream faces. 3.5 Other Resettlement Village Components 3.5.1 Village Housing and Water Supply There are areas of higher ground located between the reservoir and the Houay Phao that could be cleared for a housing area. Then, with the addition of a pump wa ter supply system, the impounded reservoir would be a source of the village water supply. 3.5.2 Access Road Access to the area would be from Road 8B. About 5-km from the centre of Lak Sao there is a good laterite surface road to Ban Nagnom. About 400-m along this ro ad there is a narrow track, about 3-km long in a nearly due north direction, to Ban Nam Pan. A permanent bridge crossing, or a lower cost Irish Crossing, is required over the Nam Pan. Then it is about another 2-km to the possible housing area. The narrow 5-km long track is in undulating mixed forest with dense undergro wth and would require the following improvements: Widening from the present 2.5 to 3-m width to at least 5-m plus tree and bush clearing/cutting for a further 2-m on neither side; Some earth fill in lower areas and a gr avel surface along most of its length; Side drains and culverts were natural streams cross the road; Some realignment in steeper sectio ns and also along lower sections where farmers have cleared land for paddy development. 3.5.3 Electricity Supply Lak Sao has a good electricity supply from the Theun Hinboun Power Station. There is a power line to near the confluence of the Nam Phao and Houay Sot as there is a GoL Poultry/Fish farm located there. A further 1-km long extension, crossing the Nam Phao, of this line would be required to the housing area. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 113.5.4 Agriculture and Forest Lands The area under consideration is gently undulating with mixed forest and dense undergrowth. It is not heavily populated and there is no pressure on the land. Areas of shifting cultivation are noted, as are some areas of permanent paddy. The soils varied, but on the lower ground were suitable for paddy development. There is potential for the resettled farmers to gain income from NTFPs and growing vegetables on the reservoir banks. 3.6 Recommendation: Not Considered Feasible I t i s r e c o m m e n d e d n o t t o p u r s u e t h is area further because of the following problems with the proposed irrigation scheme: The BPKP irrigation sche me estimate is expensive at US$ 454,116 or US$ 7,208 per hectare for 63- ha. The final cost is liable to be considerably more: o The spillway design is poor. It will require re positioning and more do wnstream protection than that shown on the drawings; o More geotechnical investigations are required on the dam foundations and borrow pit areas. The investigations are likely to show that the depth from the Houay Sot streambed to an impervious foundation will be more than the 2-m shown on the drawings thus increasing the compacted earth fill volumes; o The two dams require additional features including slope protection. o The river has a small catchment area with low dry season discharge and no-flow some years. The two dams are required to raise river water levels only for diversion into the two main canals and will have no storage for irrigation purposes unless pumping arrangements are added. The proposed scheme is located ne ar to the Nam Phao. If the scheme had been constructed in the 2001/02 dry season, the Nam Phao flash floo d that occurred at the end of th e 2002 wet season would have damaged much of the infrastructure. 4 NAM PAN SCHEME , DAFO PRELIMINARY PROPOSAL 4.1 Introduction The proposed irrigation area is located south of the Nam Pan in an undulating area of low hills between mountains to the east and the relati vely flat Lak Sao town to the west. The undulations are between 509 masl and hills over 540 masl. The area is of mixed forest with dense undergrowth with few cleared areas. The Lak Sao DAFO has recently commenced invest igations in March 2003 on this scheme. They have prepared a brief preliminary report, which appears to have been prepared to obtain funding for a topographical survey. A topographical survey has commenced and benchmarks were observed at the dam site. The location of a fairly large dam on the Nam Pan has been shown on a 1: 25,000 map. The Nam Pan also is a tributary of the Houay Phao and is the next southernmost watershed to the Houay Sot. However the location of the proposed dam is ab out 4-km from the Nam Phao and will not be affected by any Nam Phao flash flooding. The Nam Pan has a catchment area measured at 13.8-km 2 above the proposed dam site. The area has a good forest cover with the highest point being Phou Chomvoy with an elevation of 1,219 masl. The river is perennial but with low dry season flows in March and April. There are existing narrow tracks from Road 8B to the dam site. The distance is about 12-km. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 124.2 Embankment Dam The principle preliminary embankment dam data as shown in the preliminary report are as follows: Crest length between 750 to 800-m Crest elevation 553.70 masl Full Supply Level (FSL) & elevation 551.00 masl Approx. river bed elevation 525.00 masl Therefore, max. height from natural surface to dam crest 28.7-m C r e s t w i d t h 5 - m Upstream and downstream side slopes 1:3 and 1:2.5 The DAFO sketch shows a reservoir behind the dam with a FSL surface area of about 1 km2 . No estimate of storage volume can be observed. From observing th e 1:25,000 maps, it appears that a shorter dam at crest elevation 553.7 masl but repositione d for less storage could be about 380-m long. The DAFO sketch shows the dam being extended to also block two minor tributaries of the Nam Pan. A dam height of 28.7-m from natural surface to crest is high. If a suitable impervious dam foundation is around 5 to 8-m below the riverbed level, the total da m height will be around 35-m. Preliminary estimates of the dam cost are as follows: 5-m deep cutoff and Houay Sot repo rt compacted earth fill unit rate of US$ 2.5/m3 US$ 1.5 million 8-m deep cutoff and Houay Sot rate of US$ 2.5/m3 US$ 1.6 million 5-m deep cutoff and Pilot Village co ntract compacted earth fill unit r ate of US$ 1.4/m3 US$ 0.8 million 8-m deep cutoff and Pilot Village rate of US$ 1.4/m3 US$ 0.9 million 4.3 Spillway On the sketch of the dam site, a sp illway has been shown on the left bank of the dam discharging into another small stream watershed and not returning to the Nam Pan. This is not acceptable because: The Nam Pan will have a significantly reduced catc hment area downstream of the dam, only 2-3 km2. Therefore there will be near to no discharge downstream of the dam thereby cutting off the households at Ban Nam Pan, lo cated some 3-km downstream; The spillway will probably discharge considerable am ounts of water in the late wet season and a new river will be formed. The spillway must return discharged water back to the Nam Pan channel. The vertical drop from the spillway crest back to the streambed is about 26-m (551.0 - 525.0). 4.4 Irrigation Area The DAFO report shows the start of the canal system and no other details. The area is generally undulating with few flat areas. Only small areas have been cleared for shifting cultivation and paddy purposes. The start of the main canal (MC) is not clearly shown on the photocopy of the DAFO report obtained. It appears to be located around 540.0 masl. This will have the following problems: Similarly to Houay Sot, the reservoir storage belo w elevation 540 (some 15-m height of storage) will be of no use for irrigation purposes unless additional pump sets are installed; The control of the flow through the outlet structure pipe is usually by manually operated screw- gates. The gate handle must be above the flood discharge elevation in the reservoir. If the flood discharge level is, say 553 masl, then the outlet st ructure must be about 13-m high (553 - 540). This is excessive with regard to reinforced concrete volumes and gate stem length. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 135 NAM PAN SCHEME , CONSULTANTS PROPOSALS 5.1 General The preliminary DAFO proposal is appears to be head ing in an oversized expensive direction. A dam 750-m long and 35-m high is a considerable structure. A spillwa y drop from FSL to riverbed of 26-m is likewise. In order to make the scheme more afford able, the following is recommended: Do not attempt to create a large reservoir storage vo lume for dry season irrigation of rice. Consider dry season non-rice crops only, which require far less irrigation water. The stream is perennial but with low-flows in late dry-season months. Therefor e just design the spillway elevation to store night- flows but allowing some water to pass downstream for Ban Nam Pan. Do not attempt to command the whole area. Lower the elevation of the main canal water level to around 530 masl and attempt to keep it in hillside cut. It is still possible to command a significant area at this elevation; The above will greatly reduce the dimensions of th e dam, spillway and main canal outlet structure. Figure 3 shows the proposed irrigation area and preliminary canal layout. 5.2 Embankment Dam For the design of the dam and spillway assume the following: MC water level of 530 masl; A spillway elevation of 530.50 is require d to ensure this MC water level; Allow around 2-m head for storing dry season nigh t discharges only. Therefore the spillway level is now 532.5 masl masl; Allow 1.8-m head over the spillway for fl ood discharge of 65 m3/s and safe freeboard. Allow a further 20-cm for any crest settlement. The dam crest elevation is now 534.5 masl. For a dam of lower crest elevation than the DAFO proposal, the dam location can be moved downstream of the DAFO proposal. For a dam of elevation 534.5 masl, there is a suitable locati on just before where the river valley opens out. The preliminary dam details are now as follows: Crest length about 180 to 200-m Crest FSL and bed elevation 525.00 masl Therefore, max. height from natural surface to dam crest 9.5-m Approx. drop from spillway crest to riverbed 7.5-m The crest width should remain at 5- m width. However the embankment side slopes may be reduced to 1:2.5 but depends on the characteristics of the borrow pit materials. Similarly to the DAFO proposal, the depth from natural surface to an impervious dam foundation may be between 5 to 8-m. This equates to a 14.5 to 17.5-m total dam height. For the preliminary estimate of the dam cost, a 5-m deep foundation and a unit rate of US$ 2.5/m3 has been assumed. The indicative cost esti mate shown in Table 4 is US$ 122,500, considerably less than the DAFO proposal.

The spillway flood discharge must be kept clear of the dam embankment. The preferable location, as regard natural river configuration, is the southern abutment (or left abutment looking downstream). However the MC intake structure must be located on the left abutment. Similarly, the access road to the dam is on the left abutment and must be kept open for easy access for regular dam inspection and any maintenance works required. Consequently the spillway must be located on the right, northern, dam abutment. Unfortun ately this will necessitate a large excavated outlet channel so that spillway discharge can return to the Nam Pan downstream. A \"straight\" inlet with flared entrance wing walls (at 45 0) is applicable. A spillway inlet width of 20-m and 1.8-m high sidewalls will accommodate a 50-year flood of 65 m3/s with freeboard and 100-year flood of 80 m3/s without freeboard. The flood discharges have been obtained from the \"Pak Mong curves\" which are commonly used in Lao PDR for a preliminary assessment. The spillway will discharge into an excavated trapez oidal channel about 100-m long. The channel bed width is 20-m, side slopes 1:2 and bed slope 0.0013 m/m or 13-cm per 100-m. The new channel will then discharge into a tributary of the Nam Pan before returning to the Nam Pan main channel. It would be ideal if the excavated channel material can be used for the dam eart hworks. It is preferable if the Nam Pan tributary is excavated to the same dimensions as the outlet channel so that tailwater levels are controlled for a significant distance downstream of the spillway. 5.4 Irrigation Area The proposed irrigation area is i rregularly undulating. The only information available is maps at scale 1: 25,000 with 10-m contour intervals and some 5-m interval s shown. Consequently a ca nal layout based on this information is provisional, to say the least, in an undulating area such as at Nam Pan. There are likely to be more undulations that are not shown on th e map that will affect the canal layout. The irrigation area is south of the Nam Pan and is of roughly rectangular dimensions of 2.2 x 1.2-km. The area is defined by the following boundaries: North The Nam Pan. East The dam is located to the east of the irrigation area. Behind and adjacent to the dam are high ground and hills. To the southeast, a natural drain is the boundary. South A natural drainage gully flow ing in a southwesterly direction. West Low ground between the scheme and a line of hills. Within these boundaries there is an area of approximately 265- ha. However within the area there are fifteen hills of various sizes shown that cannot be comman ded. Consequently it is estimated that the area commanded by a canal system located at, or just be low, the 530-masl contour will be about 200-ha. When taking into account: There will be more minor undulations that are not shown on the map and some of the hillside slopes will be too steep for terrace development; An area of swamp is shown on map; it is safer to consider an actual irrigation area of about 150-ha. This is sufficient for the 82.5-ha scheme required for the Sop Hia and Nam Nian resettled households plus 67.5-ha extra. It is appropriate, at this preliminary stage of the investigations to consider a 150-ha scheme area because of the following reasons: Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 18 The Khamkerd District officials will most probably wish to maximize the area as they wish to reduce shifting cultivation practices in the District as per Government of Lao policy; The northwestern area of the scheme is close to the existing Ban Nam Pan. Part of the scheme area will most probably be within th e Ban Nam Pan traditional village land use boundaries. Ban Nam Pan has no existing irrigation facilities and if some irrigate d land is not allocated to this village, then it is likely to cause friction and problems later. 5.5 Irrigation Water Requirement The irrigation water requirement (IWR) for the design of the canals is based on: Wet season supplementary irrigation of rice; Dry season vegetables and field crops including maize, peanuts and beans. For the wet season supplementary irrigation of rice a peak IWR of 13 mm/day is assumed to take into account crop water requirements, canal conveyance and field application losses. For peak 12-hour irrigation this equates to a canal water duty of 3 liters per second per hectare (l/s/ha). 5.6 Main Canal and Main Canal Inlet Structure The wet season rice IWR is 3 l/s/ha and the irrigation scheme area is about 150-ha , therefore the MC should provide 450 l/s or 0.45 m3/s. A trapezoidal earth cana l with a 1-m wide bed width, 1:2 (V/H) side slopes, water depth of 0.6-m, freeboard of 0.4-m and be d slope of 5-cm per 100-m, will provide this. The reinforced concrete MC inlet structure will be loca ted on the left abutment of the dam. Assuming an arbitrary canal water level of 530.00 masl, the canal inta ke structure will have an invert elevation of 529.00 masl. Therefore the height of the structur e is 5.5-m (dam crest of 534.5 - 529.0). 5.7 Canal System 5.7.1 General The canal conveyance and distribution system will be by open trapezoidal channels. A MC will feed four Secondary Canals (S1, S2, S3 and S4 ), which will feed tertiary canals. There will be some instances were quaternary canals will be required to distribute wate r from the tertiary canals. The MC should be a conveyance canal only and there should be no irrigation outlets direct from the MC to the farm plots. A canal compacted earth fill un it rate is far higher than the unit ra te for excavation. To avoid high canal compacted fill volumes, the canals are excavated in side slopes of hills . This will not alwa ys possible and there will be some canal reaches in fill. 5.7.2 Preliminary Layout A preliminary canal layout is shown on Figure 3. No t all the tertiary canals have been shown. After topographical survey mapping, it will probably be found that mo re tertiary canals are required because of the undulating nature of the area. The provision of vehicle access along a canal bank considerably increases the earthworks volumes and cost. As there are few tracks in the area, it is proposed that the MC has vehicle access along it. Further consideration for vehicle access along the secondary canals should be given after topographical survey is complete and a more accurate assessment of the earthw ork volumes is possible. Particularly the S3 canal should be considered as it is a continuation of the MC access track and a short extension can connect to the existing tracks shown on the bottom of Figure 3. A MC of about 2.1-km length is required to supply four secondary canals varying in length. These in turn supply about eight tertiary canals of varying length. At this stage in the investigations, it is not worth considering the layouts in any more detail. The MC only conveys the scheme full supply for about 700-m. Then it reduces in discharge after each Secondary Canal. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 19 Because the proposed area is undulating and the irrig ation canals have to wind around hills, there will be relatively long lengths of canal required to irrigate the area. Four Secondary Canals, total length about 4-km, have been identified: S1 is about 1.3-km long is about 0.20-km and irrigates about about 1.2-km long and irrigates about 35-ha S4 is about 1.2-km long and irrigates about 25-ha. The following minimum Tertiary Canals are required: S1 will require four tertiaries of total length about 3.7-km; S2, two tertiaries of total length about 0.6-km; S3, one tertiary of length about 0.2-km; S4, one tertiary of length about 0.8-km. A total tertiary canal length of over 5.3-km is required. 5.7.3 Canal Structures Examples of the canal structures that will be required in the canal system are as follows: Turnouts to deliver water from a canal to a smaller order canal; Pipe outlets, that can be easily blocked off, from a canal to individual farm plots; Check and end structures to maintain water elevation in the canal when canal discharges are less than design; Culverts to convey natural drains under the cana l or inverted siphons to convey irrigation water under a natural drain; Emergency spillways to prevent a ca nal from overtopping due to mi s-operation or blocked canal; Measuring structures are frequently not included because of the extra cost and head loss involved. However their inclusion will assist scheme manage ment with the equitable distribution of water throughout the scheme. For long-life and easier operation, the structures should be reinforced concrete with steel gates rather than stone masonry and timber drop boards. 5.8 Irrigation Farm Plot Development As stated previously, there are only a few farm areas in the proposed irrigation area that have been already cleared. This is considered because the area has a low- density population rather th an poor soils. The cleared areas are located in the lower \"valley\" areas between hills. To fully develop the undulating area, the area will have to cleared, tree stumps removed and terraces deve loped on hillside slopes. The extent of the terracing and plot sizes will be determined afte r topographical survey is completed. Because of the undulating nature of the area, several natural drainage systems exist: The Nam Pan to the north; The Nam Phao to the east; The Houay Phaleng to the southeast Some deepening and widening of natural drainage gullies may be re quired, but not enough for any consideration in the cost estimates. Individual farmer s can undertake any excavation where required. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 206 OTHER NAM PAN RESETTLEMENT VILLAGE COMPONENTS 6.1 Access Road An access road is required from Road 8B to the ne w resettlement village and dam site for construction purposes. The existing access from Road 8B to the dam site is a narrow winding 12-km long track. If the existing track were to be used, it wo uld require the following improvements: Widening from the present 2.5 to 3-m width to at least 5-m plus tree and bush clearing/cutting for a further 2-m on neither side; Some earth fill in lower areas and a gr avel surface along most of its length; Side drains and culverts were natural streams cross the road; Some realignment in steeper sectio ns and also along lower sections where farmers have cleared land for paddy development. The road is winding because it conn ects isolated areas that have been cleared for cultivation. A new road from Road 8B direct to the dam site would be far less than 12-km long. There are several options available for the location of the new village housing and the final choice should be left to the resettlers. Below it will be explained that a location of the bank of the Nam Pan has been provisionally chosen. Apart from construction access to th e dam, it will also be nece ssary to cut a road from the borrow pit site to the dam location. The final rout e of the road will be chosen after the geotechnical investigations and topographical surveys are complete. It is generally of lower cost to improve the existing track rather than construct a new road along a different route. Therefore the road to the new village could be a mix of improving the existing track and new construction. A provisional route is as follows: Upgrade the existing track from Road 8B to Ban Nam Pan, approximately 3-km; Construct a new reach along the hills on the sout hern bank of the Nam Pan to the housing area, approximately 2-km; Upgrade the existing track to the dam site, approximately 1-km. 6.2 Village Housing As stated previously, the location of the village housing area should be le ft to the resettlers. However it is assumed that they will choose to live adjacent to the Nam Pan. Although the resettle rs will be provided with a water supply and latrines, there are still other reasons for living near to a small river including recreational and some fishing possibility. There is a suitable 2-km long reach available between the existing Ban Nam Pan and proposed dam. The new village will be locate d above Nam Pan flood elevations. Other possible locations for the new housing are: Above the new reservoir. This is nearer the forest area to the east of the dam and there will be the possibility of fisheries in the reservoir. On the hills above the MC. This is a more central location with less walking distance to the southern irrigation plots. The village housing area has been estimated, based on the Pilot Village layout, at 0.07-ha per household for housing and village roads plus an extra 2-ha for th e school, market, workshop, community centre and rice mill. 0.7-ha equates to a 28 x 25-m rectangle or a 25 x 25 -m plot with a 3-m wide village road along one side. Consequently for the 50 households that wish to be rese ttled in Khamkerd District, a housing area of 5.5-ha is required. Generally, villagers wish to have immediat e or close access to the main access road. Therefore a long, rectangular village bo undary shape of about 500 x 120-m has been assumed, so that no house is far from the road. The general area where the new village can be located is shown on Figure 3. 6.3 Water Supply and Sanitation The three possibilities for a rural village water supply are: Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 21 Rainwater collection from roofs via gutters into storage tanks; Gravity fed supply from a perennial spring or stream located above the village; Groundwater abstracted by handpumps or by ro pe and bucket from hand dug or bored wells. Rainwater collection is usually the most expensive and th ere can be problems with sufficient storage to last through the dry season. There are no perennial springs or streams located above the possible village locations that can be developed for a gravity supply. Groundwater is usually the cleanest source and if the village is located adjacent to the Nam Pan, then it will be only a short vertical dis tance from the natural surface to the water table. Therefore hand dug wells with handpumps is the chosen option. For shallow wells, the \"TARA\" hand pump, designed and manufactured in India, is the most reliable and are commonly used by UNICEF. However there are cheaper Thai and Lao manufactured pumps available. So that it is not too far from every house to a well, four wells have been proposed. Every household should have its own latrine. There are several types of latrines available in Lao PDR. The usual village choice is \"pour flush latr ines\" with vent pipes. Pour flush latr ines require between 1.5 to 2 liters of water for flushing but are odor free and are the safest type of latrine regarding the transmission of excreta related diseases. They have a long life and there is no need to move them for many years. They should be located at least 20-m from any wells. 6.4 Electricity Supply As stated previously, Lak Sao town has a good electricity supply from the Theun Hinboun Power Station. It is not proposed to extend the line from the GoL fish/poultry farm on the bank on the Nam Phao that was proposed for the Nam Sot scheme. This would be fairly short at about 4-km, but would necessitate crossing the Nam Phao and building a new road especially for this line extension. Consequently it is proposed that the supply to the new resettled village fr om Lak Sao along Road 8B, about 4- km, and then along the access road to the new village, about 5-km. Thus the total line length is about 9-km. A 22-KV line will be installed as will a 160-KVA transf ormer. The Bolikhamxay Branch of Elecricite du Laos (EDL) will probably undertake the installation. 6.5 Agriculture and Forest Lands Similar to the Houay Sot area, the area under considerati on is gently undulating wi th mixed forest and dense undergrowth. It is not heavily populated and there is no pressure on the land. Isolated areas of slash and burn are noted, as were some areas of permanent paddy. The soils vary, but on the lower ground are suitable for paddy development. There is signific ant potential for the resettled farmers to gain income from non-timber forest products and hunting in the area. Behind and to the east of the proposed dam site there are mountains that stretch back to the Nakai Nam Theun NBCA. From aerial photograph observation, this area appears to be in fairly pristine condition. As there is no pressure on the land there is land ava ilable for cattle grazing. There is some potential for fisheries in the new reservoir, but more for recreation than income generation. 6.6 Indicative Cost Estimates An indicative cost estimate for the development of th e irrigation scheme and th e above village development components is found in Table 4. The estimate does not include the cost of the further studies required and cost of the preparation of detail designs, drawings and contract documents. The estimate has two summaries regarding the irrigation development: Summary No. 1 is for no cost sharing. That is, the cost of developing a fu ll 150-ha irrigation scheme even though only 82.5-ha is require d for the Project resettled farmers. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 22 Summary No. 2 concerns a possible cost sharing opt ion. This is that NTEC finances the dam, spillway, main canal and 82.5-ha of the remaining ca nal system and land clea ring and leveling. The estimated cost of this is US$ 731,400. The Khamkerd District authorities fi nance the remaining 67.5- ha at an estimated cost of US$ 73,800. The total estimated cost for the 150-ha scheme is US$ 805,200. The most expe nsive component is the construction of the irrigation scheme at about 56 per cent of the total cost. The estimates are indicative. For example, the irrigation sc heme costs are based on information from a 1:25,000 map. The earthworks volumes for the earth dam and canal system may va ry significantly after detail design. 7 NEXT STEPS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NAM PAN SCHEME 7.1 Technical Procedures Technically, the normal procedure to develop an irrigation scheme after a potential scheme has been identified and an outline proposal prepared, similar to the previous chapter, is: Pre-feasibility study. Feasibility study. Prepare detail design and drawin gs and contract documents. Undertake tendering procedures, co ntract award and construction. 7.1.1 Pre-feasibility Study The pre-feasibility study does not need to be a formal study. For example it is known that the Nam Pan is perennial. Local farmers have cleared some plots in the scheme for paddy, so these soils should be good. The Khamkerd District has commenced topographical survey of the area. If the survey maps shows that a canal system, similar to the one proposed, will command a sui tably sized area, then this is sufficient for the technical side of a pre-feasibility study. As regard the social side of the study there are existing tracks in the area, probably cleared by the villages of the existing Ban Nam Pan while looking for new paddy ar eas. This village should be consulted as they may have, or consider they have, traditional rights to a considerable part of the area under consideration. The village traditional boundary should be identified, as should any other villa ge boundaries that may extend into the study area. 7.1.2 Feasibility Study Further studies are required to produce a concise feasibility report. The studies include: Embankment dam geotechnical investigations on foundation and borrow pits. Spillway foundation investigations. Location and cost of other local construction materials - sand, gravel and rock; Nam Pan hydrological studies. Estimates on mean monthly discharges and further design flood calculations; A full soil survey and mapping of th e command area is probably not required. Perhaps just a more in depth examination by a soil scientist an d agriculturist for a couple of days; Compare options for different dry season dam stor ages and considering downstream riparian Nam Pan flows, cropping patterns, command area and canal arrangement. As stated previously, a general rule is the larger the reservoir storage, the hi gher the cost of the da m, spillway and MC intake structure. Dry season rice is an expensive option an d should be eliminated at this stage. Consider full dry season storage for non-rice crops, overnight storage only and no storage. If no storage is required, consider a diversion weir rather than a dam and spillway; Preparation of cost estimates for the different options. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 237.2 Involvement of Khamkerd District The involvement of the Khamkerd District will compli cate the above procedures . The Khamkerd DAFO has their own irrigation development programme with regard to reducing shifting cultivation areas and poverty alleviation. It would be ideal if the District were to simply allow NTEC to develop the area without any conditions. However this is unlikely to happen. Theref ore this section considers some of the non-technical problems involved in the development of the Nam Pan area for NTEC to consider and decide how best to proceed. There will have to be discussions, negotiati ons and agreements between NTEC and the Khamkerd District Officials. The subject matter could include: Initially, the preliminary concept and size of the scheme. For example, the preliminary DAFO report indicates a large dam and this Consultant proposes a small dam. Also, should households from outside of Ban Sop Hia and Nam Nian be included in the scheme, particularly farmers from the existing Ban Nam Pan? Cost sharing for the studies, design and construction, if any. Who undertakes the design and construction? The Khamkerd officials may wish for District or Provincial Enterprises to undertake the design and construction without any tendering processes, e.g. BPKP or the Bolikhamxay Provincial Irrigation Se rvice. NTEC will require competitive bidding, especially for the construction. More discussion on the abov e subject matter follows. 7.3 Scheme Concept and Size The potential for further irrigation development in Khamkerd District is not known. It is possible that the \"best\" schemes have already been developed. Therefore the District Authorities may wish to maximize the scheme area and include other resettle d villages from within the District. In the case of the existing Ban Nam Pan, to not include the village would be unfair and may cause local friction and problems later. It is fairly typical in Lao PDR, and appears to be the case at Nam Pan, that the Khamkerd DAFO wishes to have a \"large\" scheme. This is apparent from the large 750-m long, 28-m hi gh dam shown on their preliminary assessment with an estimate cost va rying between US$ 0.8 to 1.6 million. The NTEC management is certain to consider this size of stru cture prohibitively expensive for fifty resettlers. The Consultants proposal for a much smaller dam, albeit with less storage volume, with an estimated cost of US$ 122,800 is much more likely to be consid ered positively by NTEC management. Similarly for the irrigation area. To increase the area as identified by the Consultant will require a significant increase in canal compacted earthworks and canal structures to convey water further than the identified scheme boundaries. Consequently the first NTEC discussion subject and agreement with the Khamkerd District officials is whether to include households from other village s in the Sop Hia/Nam Nian resettlement scheme? 7.4 Cost Sharing - Feasibil ity and Design Stages Further studies are required for the pr eparation of a feasibility report. Provincial and Di strict administrations frequently do not undertake feasibili ty studies and do not consider alternatives - the original large-scale concept can be carried through to construction. Cost sharing for the studies and detail design is not recommended, NTEC should cover all the costs. The District administration may wish that BPKP or a District/Provincial Enterprise undertakes the study and detail design. It is recommended that an agreement with the Khamkerd District office should include that a local Consultant Company, after competitive bidding, undertakes a feasibility study with Terms of Reference prepared by NTEC. The contract award shou ld be based on the Consultants previous experience, proposal methodology and work schedule, CVs of the team and price. If the Consultant prepares a good report, then it is preferable that the same company un dertakes the detail design stage. If their bid is too expensive, then the work is re-advertised. Appendix M: Khamkerd Resett lement Village Site Planning November 2004 Nam Theun 2 Project - Social Development Plan - Volume 2 247.5 Cost Sharing - Construction If it is decided that the scheme will be larger than the 82.5-ha required for the So p Hia/Nam Nian resettlers and assuming that NTEC do not wish to finance the whole scheme, then some sort of cost sharing agreement will be required. Any construction cost sh aring between NTEC and Khamkerd District will have to be carefully considered. There are possible cost sh aring options available, two options are considered below. 7.5.1 Possible Option 1 Assuming a 150-ha irrigation scheme rounded up estim ated cost of US$ 450,000, the cost per hectare is US$ 3,000. The possible cost sharing could be: US$ 247,500 to NTEC for a 82.5-ha scheme for NT2 resettled households only, and US$ 202,500 to Khamkerd District for the remain ing 67.5-ha for farmers from Ban Nam Pan. It would be difficult for the Khamkerd District to raise US$ 202,500 in a ti mely manner as typically District offices in Lao PDR have trouble funding infrastructure projects. To finance infrastructure projects some Provinces resort to paying Contractors through logg ing concessions. Others can make a few payments and then cease. Then the contractor has to accept whatever is offered. This can include non-inflation adjusted payments stretching over many years. 7.5.2 Preferred Option 2 Another alternative is that NTEC pays for the dam, spillway and main cana l. The cost sharing is limited to secondary and tertiary canal construction and land clearing and leveling. This alternative is shown in the indicative cost estimate in Table 4 as Summary No. 2: Cost Sharing. The cost to Khamkerd District would be US$ 73,800, less than half the above amount. It may still be difficult for the District to raise US$ 73,800. However it is possible to prepare a construction contract for the development of 82.5-ha only. Secondary Canal S1 irrigates an area of around 70-ha. This canal could be allocated to the Ban Nam Pan farmers and the Sop Hia and Nam Nian resettlers use the rest of the scheme. 7.6 Competitive Bidding It is probable that the Khamkerd District has little or no experience with the competitive bidding process and usually uses either BPKP or a District/Provincial Enterprise using GoL unit rates for construction projects. If there is construction cost sharing with Khamkerd District, then the Khamkerd District may request that a local Contractor undertakes the work without competitive bidding. This is not recommended.
