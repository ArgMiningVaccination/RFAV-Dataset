Harnack, USAR the United States The Judge Advocate General established the Center for Law and Military Operations in 1988 at the direction of the Secretary of the Army. The purpose of the Center is to examine legal issues that arise during all phases of military operations and to devise training strategies for addressing those issues. It seeks to fulfill this purpose in four ways. First, it is the central repository within The Judge Advocate General's Corps for memoranda, lessons learned, and after\u00ad action materials pertaining to legal support for deployed forces. Second, it supports judge advocates in the field by disseminating key lessons learned, by building a database of legal issues encountered by previously deployed judge advocates, by creating guides to successful operational law training and evaluation, and by recommending refinements to doctrine for legal operations. Third, it integrates lessons learned from deployments into the curriculum of all relevant courses, workshops, orientations, and seminars held at The Judge Advocate General's School. Fourth, with The Judge Advocate General's School, it sponsors conferences and symposia on topics of interest to operational lawyers. The Director of the Center also serves as Chief, International and Operational Law Division, Office of The Judge Advocate General. The Deputy Director heads the main office in Charlottesville, where the Center forms an important part of The Judge Advocate General's School and represents the Corps' growing commitment to excellence in operational law.

LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995-98 LESSONS LEARNED FOR JUDGE ADVOCATES CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS 13 NOVEMBER 1998 Summary With this report, the Center for Law and Military Operations identifies lessons learned for judge advocates from United States military operations in Bosnia from 1995 to 1998. The report focuses on providing gu.idance and practical considerations for judge advocates that will be or are responsible for those who will deploy. The Center prepared the report based on after action reports submitted by judge advocate sections involved in the operation, materials gathered during a three-day conference attended by participants, materials gathered by judge advocates participating with the Center for Army Lessons Learned Combined Arms Assessment Teams, interviews ofindividual judge advocates who deployed, and other sources. The Center finds that the Corps delivered legal services well in every functional area, and that doctrine for legal operations, while changing in many ways, is mostly sound. The JAGC must continually train, educate, and resource its youngjudge advocates to support battalion and brigade-sized task forces while physically apart from the main SJA office. These \"all purpose\" judge advocates must deliver the entire range ofoperational law advice to commanders while continuing to execute the critical military justice and client services functions. Among other suggestions, the Center recommends that judge advocates prepare for difficulties inherent in multinational operations, help develop situational training and conduct continuous refresher training on the rules ofengagement, develop a baseline of expertise in fiscal law-JAGC-wide, work seamlessly with the Reserve Component, keep detailed logs ofall significant actions, and be ready to deploy. Lessons learned materials, to include this report, would not be possible without the detailed logs, notebooks, computer files, and reams ofdata forwarded to the Center by dedicated judge advocates, legal administrators, non-commissioned officers, legal specialists, and civilians. To maintain the JA GC 's posture as a learning organization, the Center asks you to record, gather, and submit to the Center all materials that concern legal support to military operations.

He was a schoolteacher who never did anything to anyone. I went next door. Here lived my neighbor of5 0 years, who was eating supper with his family. He is a Serb. I shot and killed all ofthem. \"1 I. Introduction To the Western observer, such ruthless, violent, and seemingly irrational ethnic hatred is beyond comprehension. Yet, from 1991 to 1995, the seething cauldron ofwhat the world once knew as Yugoslavia erupted into a conflict of annihilation2 pitting former friends, neighbors, and even family members against each other along ethnic lines--Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Muslims (Bosniacs), and Bosnian Croats. Today, we call these three groups the Entity Armed Forces (EAFs), formerly known as the Former Warring Factions (FWFs) and hereinafter known as EAFs.3 Nearly four years ofunchecked violence shocked the international communities' conscience and the results were staggering: I Ivo J. LEDERER, NATIONALISM AND THE YUGOSLAVS, NATIONALISM IN EASTERN EUROPE 396-397 (Lederer et. al., eds.) (University of Washington Press 1969). 2 Perhaps not in the classical sense of annihilating an enemy's army, but an entire ethnic class from a geographical area. At the very least, each EAF perceives that the other seeks to annihilate it. Allegations of ethnic cleansing on all sides of the conflict have likely strengthened this perception. See App. B, The Fonner Warring Factions and Their Competing Strategic Goals. 3 For a great historical account, see ANDRAS RIEDLMAYER, A BRIEF HISTORY OF BOSNlA\u00ad HERZEGOVINA (Harvard University Summer 1993).

On December 16, 1995, the IFOR's main body of60,000 troops began its deployment into Bosnia-Herzegovina, hereinafter known as BiH.15 The IFOR accepted the Transfer ofAuthority16 from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on December 20, 1995-D-Day. Finally, the wanton destruction ofhuman life and property stopped.17 United States military operations in the Balkans from 1995 through the present represented military and legal challenges of unprecedented scope and complexity.

They formally signed in Paris, France, on 14 Dec. 1995 (signed by Bosnia-Herzegovina President lzetbegovic, Croatian President Tudjman, and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia President Milosevic). The base document is known as the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina [hereinafter GFAP]. For text ofthe base document and Annex 1-A (Agreement on Military Aspects ofthe Peace Settlement) see Appendix E(5). The GF AP contains Articles I-XI and 11 Annexes. The Entity Armed Forces (EAFs) include the forces ofthe Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Muslims, and Croatian National factions. 14 S.C. Res. 1031, U.N. SCOR, 50th Sess., 3607 mtg. at para. 14, U.N. Doc. S/Res/1031 (15 Dec. 1995). Acting under Chapter VII ofthe U.N. Charter, the U.N. Security Council adopted U.N.S.C. Res. 1031 authorizing member states to establish a multinational implementation force (IFOR), under unified command and control and composed ofground, air, and maritime units from NATO and non-NATO nations, and to ensure compliance with the relevant portions ofthe GFAP. U.N.S.C. Res. 1031 authorized member states, amongst other things, to take all necessary measures to effect the implementation ofand to ensure compliance with the military aspects of the GF AP, ensure compliance with the !FOR-established rules and procedures governing command and control over Bosnian airspace, and to defend itself from attack or threat of attack.

The role of U.S. forces as part of NATO's19 first ever land component, out-of-area, and joint Partnership for Peace (PFP) operation20 was unprecedented. This groundbreaking operation demonstrated a successful application of the rule of law in a decidedly uncertain, devastated, and potentially hostile environment. For various political and military reasons, commanders, staffs, and soldiers simultaneously planned, trained, deployed, and began to implement the terms of the GF AP. The sheer number of Troop Contributing Nations (TCN) to IFOR21 thrust additional burdens upon U.S. commanders in this difficult and unique mission. The multiple, complex international treaties22 and the hundreds ofnon-governmental organizations (NGO) and private organizations (PYO) assisting in Bosnia intensified this potentially crushing burden. Judge advocates played a pivotal role in helping commanders overcome these challenges and accomplish the 18 On 12-13 Sep. 1998, Bosnian voters stayed true to their ethnic divisions.

At all echelons of command,23 judge advocates interpreted and advised commanders on multinational Rules of Engagement (ROE), the 500-page GFAP, at least four applicable Status ofForces Agreements, multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, and TCN support issues. Similar to events leading up to Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti from 1994-1995, many Americans watched a region spiral into lawlessness, followed by the international community demanding measures for stabilization. Similar to Haiti, a large combat force then entered the region peacefully on terms negotiated just prior to deploying. In this case, the region was the Bosnia Theater of Operations (BT0).24 It is here where the similarities in these two operations diverge. The history, geography, topography, command and control, size ofdeployed forces, presence ofthe GF AP, and lengths of these two operations varies drastically. This is not to say, however, that many ofthe lessons learned from Haiti are irrelevant to the Bosnia deployment. In fact, many are the same. Judge advocates that deployed to Bosnia cited the Center's Law (lnd Military Operations in Haiti, 1994-1995 and The Judge Advocate General's School's Operational Law Handbook as the two best predeployment operational law resources. This publication seeks to amplify those lessons learned and clarify issues that are offirst impression or of a relatively unique nature. Perhaps the greatest tribute to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines ofOJE is the exemplary and even-handed manner25 in which these Americans performed their duty in applying the rule oflaw in this complex environment.

In Bosnia, the timetable had a higher degree ofstability as the GF AP was initialed weeks before the deployment began. 25 The IFOR Mission was to \"In an evenhanded manner, monitor and enforce compliance with the military aspects ofthe Dayton Peace Agreement.\" See Appendix F. 20 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS war-hardened armies, eighteen-year old Americans were well trained to protect themselves, their fellow soldiers, and their units. At the same time, they balanced initiative and restraint under the rules of engagement while facing the constant possibility that the wrong decision could undermine the GFAP and even re-ignite hostilities. Making proper decisions under the ROE occupied only a small portion of our service members' time in relation to their daily tasks-all in accordance with U.S. law and policy, operational directives, and a\u00b7 host of international agreements. Infantrymen helped establish a Zone of Separation (ZOS) between the EAFs as established by the GFAP and other negotiated agreements. Artillerymen quickly and precisely demonstrated their resolve and their combat capabilities yet identified any maneuver damage caused by the demonstrations. Supply, maintenance, and POL (petroleum, oils, and lubricants) personnel provided support to other troop contributing nations strictly in \u00b7 accordance with specific Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements and other appropriations laws. Soldiers on patrols and at checkpoints strictly .enforced the military aspects of the GFAP, yet treated the flood of displaced persons with dignity and respect. Commanders and their legal advisors applied the lessons learned from Haiti in detaining members of the EAFs in accordance with law and policy. Civil affairs personnel assisted in administering the Foreign Claims Act by acting as investigating officers and providing logistics support for the theater maneuver damage program. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines remained undistracted by personal concerns as judge advocates provided legal assistance throughout the Bosnian Theater of Operations. As seen in operation after operation,26America's men and women in uniform are disciplined and follow orders given by their chain of command, Operation Just Cause, Operation Uphold Democracy, Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Somalia, and now Operations Joint Endeavor and Guard all reflect lower discipline rates. 26 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 21 ')ustifying a disciplinary system aclrnowledged by Congress and the courts to be essential to mission accomplishment.\"27 This report reflects experiences ofjudge advocates that participated in military operations in Bosnia-whether they were at the NATO level, supporting rear detachments, or advising brigade and battalion commanders in the ZOS.

As with any lessons learned publication designed for broad audiences, much of what follows will seem over simplified. For many inexperienced judge advocates and legal specialists, however, these lessons are cases of first impression. Other sections address issues of significant breadth, complexity, and of first impression for even seasoned judge advocates.32 This report cannot, however, answer or address fully every aspect of the hundreds of legal issues that arose, and, continue to develop during this ongoing operation.33 The Center has developed an information system (discussed in the next paragraph) that seeks to make available to judge advocates around the world the vast majority of legal issues and concerns that arise in operations.

The Center for Law and Military Operations,37 together with the automation wizards at the Pentagon and The Judge Advocate General's School, has pushed forward in its goal of developing automated databases ofoperational law materials and making them available to judge advocates, world-wide. To date, CLAMO has made available to active and reserve component judge advocates, via Lotus Notes38 or the Internet (JAGC.NET), ten distinct operationally oriented databases. Some ofthese databases include SOFA agreements, Reserve Component-oriented After Action Reports, United Nation Security Council Resolutions, Government Accounting Office reports, opinions, memoranda, standard operating procedures, declassified operations plan annexes, and other useful forms, cards, and training aids. These databases allow judge advocates to design and tailor deployment packages and give them direct access to valuable resources. Perhaps most important is the near real-time access judge advocates have to the lessons learned ofother judge advocates. As this report was in progress, the judge advocates ofthe 1st Cavalry Division, who were preparing for deployment to Bosnia, had access to over 1000 documents, including numerous judge advocate interviews and AARs, either used by or prepared by those that had gone before them as part ofthe Implementation Force (hereinafter IFOR)39 or the Stabilization Force 36 See u.s.

IFOR concerned the 1st Armored Division and the 1st Infantry Division's Covering Force for one month. 24 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS (hereinafter SFOR).40 Access to such information does not replace the need for judge advocates to analyze every issue on its own merit and to ensure that their opinions are based on thorough research and current data. However, these databases provide raw data and legal information regarding virtually every functional area of the law in a deployed environment. Because ofthe size, complexity, and ongoing nature of operations in the Balkans, CLAMO's goal with this publication is to summarize useful lessons learned from legal support to operations in the Balkans from 1995 to 1998. Emerging doctrine and evolving organizational structure reflect that the Judge Advocate General's Corps' support to the battlefield commander falls into three distinct areas: command and control,41 sustainment,42 and personnel service support.43 The extended nature of the Bosnia deployment has allowed CLAMO to analyze these discrete areas in the context ofproviding professional legal services as far forward as possible at all echelons of command throughout the operational continuum.44 For operations in the Balkans, the Center finds-through its survey ofvirtually hundreds oflessons learned-that judge advocates delivered quality legal support in a ground breaking fashion in all 40 The Stabilization Force (SFOR) is ongoing. 1st Infantry Division, 1st Armored Division, and now the 1st Cavalry Division participated in SFOR. 41 Ge~er~lly, issue~ d.irectly affecting the commander's decision making process on the battlefield fall within C2.

Emerging doctrine should reflect the lessons learned from nearly three years in Bosnia. 45 While CLAMO's lessons learned methodology is straightforward,46 operations in the Balkans have generated such voluminous reference materials that CLAMO gathered and analyzed resources in an exhaustive yet somewhat limited fashion.

This is a report ofkey lessons and not a history ofjudge advocate participation in the Bosnia deployment. Because of the nature of this peace operation-coalition forces putting themselves between three EAFs in a highly charged environment-a full appreciation of any legal or practical issue requires judge advocates to understand the historical setting which gave rise to the operation. In fact, understanding the historical backdrop of the Balkans, and trying to understand what occurred prior to the deployment, is lesson learned number one. Events leading to the explosive conflict in Bosnia combined with the experiences of the EAFs throughout the conflict shed light on the EAFs' intent, desired endstate, and ability to compromise over a given issue.

HISTORY6 The Balkan57 region has been home to some ofmankind's most brilliant civilizations. Nevertheless, identity, determined by cultural and religious affiliation, has left a historical schism separating distinct ethnic groups. The Balkans has become a melting pot of shifting populations. Though these separate cultures have often melded cooperatively, much of their history has been marked by strife. Violence is ingrained and distrust runs deep in this 2000-year-old battleground. By the 7th century, after the fall ofthe Roman Empire, the Slavs first settled the area ofBosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). By the 9th century, Serbia (southeast ofBiH) and Croatia (west ofBiH) established themselves as competing kingdoms. By the 12th century, the \"Kings of Hungary\"58 took over the Kingdom of Croatia and the area of present.,.day BiH. By the 13th century, the Kingdom ofBosnia gained and retained its independence for about 250 years by fighting off the Hungarians and Serbs. During this time, the Bosnian population was mostly Roman Catholic (Christian). The Kingdom of Serbia was largely Eastern Orthodox (Christian). See Historical Maps at Appendix A(l). The 14th century marked the Ottoman Empire's conquest of the Balkan region-introducing Islam into the region. In 1389, the Ottoman Turks defeated the seat of Serbia's Kingdom and their cultural center at that time-Kosovo. The recent bloodbath in Kosovo 56 See LEDERER, supra note 1. See also WILLIAM T. JOHNSON, DECIPHERING THE BALKAN ENIGMA, Strategic Studies Institute (Carlisle Barracks Pa. 1995). 57 The Balkan countries include Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia (Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo), Slovenia, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Turkey. 58 See LEDERER, supra note lat 2. LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 29 is rooted in this event that took place over 600 years ago. By 1463, the Kingdom ofBosnia joined Serbia's fate by losing its independence to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire consolidated these former Kingdoms into one province called the Eyalet of Bosna. For the next 415 years (1463-1878), the Ottoman Empire remained in control of the region fostering the spread ofthe Islamic faith. During this period, the Ottoman Empire provided a somewhat59 flexible religious environment that allowed converted Bosnians to adapt existing traditions to the new Islamic faith. Further, the Ottoman Empire was tolerant ofnon-Muslim minorities allowing them to practice religion, to live, and to trade as they chose. From this environment grew a Bosnian Muslim culture that co-existed with Catholicism (primarily Croats) and Orthodoxy (primarily Serbs). After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, the Great Powers of Europe met in Berlin and decided the fate of the faltering Ottoman Empire. The Great Powers appointed Austria-Hungary as ':ldministrator of Bosnia-Herzegovina and, at the Russian's insistence, granted independence to Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria. As the Ottoman Empire was pushed out of Europe, the Muslim Slav population in BiH increased. Muslims from the northern reaches of the shrinking Ottoman Empire found safe haven in BiH. Meanwhile, the Austrian administrators developed the BiH infrastructure, including parks and schools, which stimulated a building boom. In this relatively prosperous setting, the various ethnic groups again turned their attention toward nationalism and independence. Serb nationalists advocated the consolidation ofall non-Muslim Slavs from Serbia, BiH, Croatia, and Slovenia. This consolidated Serb-state would be independent from Austria. On the other hand, many Bosnian Muslims advocated a pluralistic society, content to remain under the control of 59 Non-muslims were subject to higher taxes and most civil and military offices were reserved for muslims. 30 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS Austria. By 1908, Austria formally annexed BiH, further hardening the Slav nationalists' position. This Balkan history plays largely into the strife that forms the basis of this report. It is the Balkan Wars of the early twentieth century,60 however, which have had the most dramatic consequences within the region. In these wars, Serbia played a large role in expelling the Turks from the region and regaining lands lost throughout history. In 1914, ethnic frictions flared and Gavrilo Princip, a Serb nationalist, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro\u00ad Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo, BiH. This led to the Third Balkan War (World War I), pitting the Bulgarians, Turks, Germans, Croats, and others against the Serbs, Greeks, the U.S. and other Allies. During the war, the Croats collected Serbs and Muslims into several concentration camps where thousands died.61 By the end of the war, millions were dead across Europe including half of Serbia's military age male population.62 World War I left approximately two and one-half million displaced persons in the Balkans, a result repeated in the disintegration ofBosnia in the 1990s. The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 created the Kingdoms of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, and only filled the void left by the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It did not address the Muslim Slavs. The region was plunged into dictatorship and renamed the Kingdom ofYugoslavia.63 As we still see, today, the mere establishment ofa single state did little to smooth fundamental differences among its twelve million inhabitants. Ethnic hatreds and tensions continued to plague the country. The Serb-dominated Yugoslav government soon alienated the Croat population. In 1928, a Serb politician killed a popular Croat on the floor of parliament in 60 1912 First Balkan War, 1913 Second Balkan War, 1914 Third Balkan War {World War I). 61 See LEDERER, supra note 1. 62 See LEDERER, supra note l at 1. 63 \"Jug\" in Cyrillic means South. Thus, Yugoslavia means kingdom of the South Slavs. LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 31 Belgrade.64 The following year, a coup lead to the dissolution of parliament and the re-drawing ofinternal borders to account for Bosnia and Croatia. Discontent continued, however, as hard-line Serbs ruled the provinces with an iron fist, spawning anti-Serb extremist individuals and organizations that would surface, in earnest, during World War II. The Yugoslav regime further tightened their rule ofthe provinces after an anti-Serb assassinated the King of Yugoslavia. With Hitler's march across Europe in World War II, Nazi forces overran Yugoslavia and Greece in 1941. The Axis Powers occupied and partitioned Yugoslavia. The war years saw Yugoslavia become a killing ground where, in addition to German occupation forces, four distinct groups engaged in ruthless campaigns ofethnic cleansing. The Ustasi led the German puppet Croat-state and engaged in the cleansing ofSerbs, political opponents, and Jews. Some Bosnian Muslims joined in with the Ustasi.65 The German controlled regime in Serbia, led by a Serb, engaged in the cleansing ofnon-Serbs, political opponents, and Jews. The Chetniks, a guerrilla army led by a Serb army officer, 66 broke away from the German-controlled regime in Serbia. They fought the Germans and retaliated against the Ustasi by cleansing Croats and Muslims in Bosnia. The Partisans, a multi\u00ad ethnic guerrilla army led by Josip Tito, fought ruthlessly against the Germans, the German-controlled regime in Serbia, the Chetniks, and the Ustasi. With their ability to tie down the Axis Powers, and the subsequent backing of the Allies, Tito's communist Partisans emerged from World War II as the undisputed leaders ofYugoslavia. After eliminating his opposition,67 the now self-declared Prime Minister Tito declared the country the Federal People's Republic ofYugoslavia.

Strictly administrative delineations, these lines did not reflect natural boundaries of the different groups and they did little to soothe tensions. Prime Minister Tito held together this confederation of provinces by repressing any ethnic divisiveness. Most ethnic infighting took a forty-year hiatus. Prime Minister Tito's death in 1980 began, again, the disintegration of this region. By the late 1980' s, deteriorating economic conditions, the fall of the Soviet Union, and demands for political reforms exacerbated tensions. Serb nationalism, fueled by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's68 calls for a Greater Serbia, once again reared its head. In 1989, Slobodan Milosevic sent a tremor through non-Serb Yugoslavia by cracking down on the ethnic Albanians that make up ninety percent of the population of Serbia's autonomous province ofKosovo. He stripped the autonomous status ofall non-Serbian minority regions-to include Kosovo. This severely restricted the educational, political, and economic rights of the ethnic Albanians. B. THE BALKAN CONFLICT, 1991-1995 1. 1991-The Fighting Resumes Against this ominous backdrop, Slovenia, a country without a Serb minority, declared its independence in June 1991. Though the mostly Serbian Yugoslav National Army (JNA) resisted temporarily, the well-armed and well-prepared Slovenians fended off the skirmishes. The JNA elected not to become heavily involved and withdrew to neighboring Croatia. See Historical Maps at Appendix A(l). 68 President of the Serbian Republic. LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 33 Croatia likewise declared independence, but did not fare as well. Croatia was not prepared militarily and had a large Serb population within its borders. A protracted conflict resulted. Croatian Serb nationalists, with apparent backing from the JNA out of BiH and Serbia, seized about thirty percent of Croatia and proclaimed the independent Republic of Serb Krajina. Savage fighting, to include the near destruction of historical Dubrovnik, Vukovar,69 and other civilian population centers, allegations of targeting civilians, and ethnic cleansing70 set the tone for the next three and one-half years of conflict in the Balkans.71 On September 25, 1991, the U.N. stepped formally into the Balkan conflict by imposing a weapons and military equipment embargo on all of the former Yugoslavia.72 Then, pursuant to a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire between Croatia and the rebel Serbs, the JNA withdrew at the end of 1991 with control of roughly one-third of Croatia. See Summary of United Nations Security Council Resolutions at Appendix E(4). 2. 1992 -U.N.

Despite threats ofviolence from Bosnian Serb nationalists, Bosnian Croats and Muslims voted for independence. Most Bosnian Serbs boycotted the referendum. On April 5, 1992, people from all three Bosnian ethnic groups-Croats, Muslims, and Serbs-demonstrated in Sarajevo calling for peace. JNA-backed Serb nationalist snipers opened fire into the crowd. The next day, April 6, 1992, the war in Bosnia began in earnest between Bosnian government forces and Bosnian Serbs. The JNA, with artillery positioned on the high ground around Sarajevo, laid siege to the city. On April 7, 1992, the U.N. authorized the full deployment ofUNPROFOR, sending approximately 15,000 peacekeeping troops into Croatia, and later into BiH and the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia, hereinafter FYROM. On May 22, 1992, the U.N. admitted the country ofBosnia\u00ad Herzegovina75 as a full member. With the backing ofthe JNA, however, the militarily superior Bosnian Serbs controlled roughly sixty percent ofBiH by the end ofMay. Because ofthe continued Serb aggression, the U.N., at the end ofMay, imposed economic sanctions against Serbia. 76 As the conflict in BiH continued unabated, and the rest ofthe world was flooded with images ofemaciated captives in prison camps around the region, the U.N. took steps to contain the conflict. At the request ofthe President ofthe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), the U.N., on December 11, 1992, expanded UNPROFOR's mandate to include monitoring the border between FYROM and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia-Serbia and Montenegro (FRY).77 Other U.N. actions included expanding the 75 S.C.

The year 1992 ended with unabated fighting and continued ethnic cleansing. Allegations of systematic rape, torture, and murder of civilians permeated the news. Estimates reflect a total of 2.5 million displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia-1.8 million refugees within the former Yugoslav republics (i.e., uprooted ethnic groups).80 3. 1993-The War Continues With Increased U.N. Involvement While heavy fighting and the siege of Sarajevo continued, Croatian forces pushed into the Serb-held region ofKrajina, just before the expiration o~UNPROFOR's initial mandate, to regain lost territory and set a new cease-fire line. At the same time, Serb forces seized U.N. weapons from various U.N. depots. In BiH, the heretofore two\u00ad ~ided conflict-BiH government forces against Bosnian Serbs forces\u00ad expanded dramatically as warfare broke out between the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims. The U.N. strengthened the no-fly zone by authorizing participating NATO forces to shoot down violators.81 In June 1993, NATO ~uthorized, at the,request of the U.N., close air support for UNPROFOR troops. On April 12, 1993, NATO began combat patrols to enforce the U.N. no-fly zone-Operation Deny Flight.82 On February 28, 1994, NATO aircraft shot down four warplanes that violated the no-fly z9ne.

After Bosnian-Serb forces declared control of seventy percent of BiH, the U.N., in June 1993, authorized83 increased troop strength and the use of force to protect six Muslim enclaves (safe areas) under siege by Bosnian Serb forces: Bihac, Gorazde, Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Zepa. NATO's decision in August 1993 to use air power to protect these safe areas provided Sarajevo some temporary relief from the year-long siege. This relief was short-lived. The war, now involving all three ethnic groups in BiH, intensified. Atrocities committed by all parties to the conflict continued, including the destruction of Serb-majority villages in Croatia.84 As these developments plunged further the region into darkness, the United States committed several hundred troops to the UNPROFOR mission in FYROM85 to help contain the conflict. \u00b7 Several diplomatic initiatives in 1993, while short-term failures, provided the first real hope for peace and laid the groundwork for the agreement that would ultimately end the war-the General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP).86 Lord Owen of Britain and envoy Cyrus Vance of the United States proposed the Vance-Owen plan that included a Bosnia with ten ethnically divided provinces/divisions, all having significant autonomy. 87 These ten provinces would share one 83 S.C.

Lord Owen and the Hon Cyrus Vance put forth a plan that divided Bosnia-Herzegovina into IO provinces, established corridors for safe passage of aid and civilians, established constitutional principals giving the provinces autonomy with decentralized state, and set forth cease-fire and demilitarization arrangements. LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 37 central government, with limited authority, and a rotating presidency. In May 1993, the Bosnian Serb Parliament rejected this plan. In June 1993, Croatian and Serbian leaders reached agreement on partitioning BiH into a confederation of three provinces-Serb, Croat, and Muslim. Initially, the Bosnian Muslim leaders refused to participate until the Serbs lifted the siege of Sarajevo. This plan evolved into the next failed proposal-the Owen-Stoltenberg plan. This plan called for an ethnically based, three-way split of territory.88 Various rigid conditions,89 not accepted by all warring factions, led the Bosnian Parliament to reject the Owen-Stoltenberg Plan in September 1993. Despite these political efforts to end the war, 1993 ended in much the same fashion as 1992-except now, all three factions were at war with one another. \u00b74. 1994 -NATO Employs Air Strikes; Muslim-Croats Make Peace On February 6, 1994, an artillery shell detonated in the middle of a Sarajevo marketplace killing sixty-eight civilians and maiming scores of others. This attack in Sarajevo and the continued siege ofthe previously declared safe-areas led NATO, at the request of the U.N., to step up involvement in Bosnia. See United Nations Security Council Resolutions at Appendix E(4) and Appendix C. At the request of the U.N., the North Atlantic Coundl (NAC) reacted to the Sarejevo incident by authorizing NATO air strikes against artillery and mortar positions around Sarajevo on February 9, 1994. Also, any heavy weapons not under UNPROFOR control and found within a twenty-kilometer exclusion zone around Sarajevo would be subject to NATO air strikes. In April, the safe haven of 88 30% Bosnian Muslim; 18% Bosnian Croat; 52% Bosnian Serb. See CNBC History of the Balkans. 89 The Bosnian leaders demanded restitution from the Bosnian Serbs for the territory they gained over the last eighteen months ofconflict. 38 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS Gorazde was under Bosnian Serb attack. On April 10 and 11, 1994, NATO aircraft provided close air support to protect UNPROFOR troops in Gorazde by employing its first air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. As the attack on Gorazde continued, the North Atlantic Council, at the U.N. 's request, authorized air strikes against any Bosnian Serb heavy weapons within a twenty-kilometer exclusion zone around the previously declared safe haven ofGorazde. Up to this point, these largely Muslim cities were \"safe havens\" in name only and were under constant attack. Further, the NAC authorized air strikes against any heavy weapons that attacked, from any range, any of the six safe havens. With the above authority, and at the request ofthe U.N., NATO aircraft struck again, this time within the exclusion zone around Sarajevo. One attack was in response to the Bosnian Serbs seizing weapons from an UNPROFOR collection site and the other was in response to a Bosnian Serb attack on an UNPROFOR vehicle. In November 1994, in response to new fighting between the Bosnian Government and Bosnian Serbs near Bihac, BiH, NATO extended90 air strikes into Serb-held territory ofCroatia.91 A second development in 1994 (the first being stepped-up NATO involvement) that eventually led to a shift in the balance of power in BiH away from the Bosnian Serbs was the United States\u00ad brokered Muslim-Croat federation,92 ending hostilities between these two warring factions. This federation did two things. First, it set the condition~ for a direct role for the Croatian army in support ofthe Bosnian Muslims against the Bosnian Serbs that later, in 1995, tipped the military balance against the Bosnian Serbs. Second, the GF AP 90 S.C. Res. 958, U.N. SCOR, 49th Sess., 3461 mtg., U.N. Doc. S/Res/958 (19 Nov. 1994). 91 On 21 Nov. 1994, NATO attacked the Udbina airfield in response to recent attacks launched from that airfield into BiH. On 23 Nov. 1994, NATO attacked air defense radars in Otoka after Serbs fired surface-to-air missiles at NA TO aircraft. 92 Agreed to by t:-.e Bo-&nian Government, Bosnian Croats, and Croatian Government. 39 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 would ultimately reflect this Muslim-Croat federation. This development did not, however, lead to a quick political or military solution. The countries that made up the Contact Group93 offered another peace plan, this one giving fifty-one percent ofBiH to the Muslim-Croat federation leaving forty-nine percent to the Bosnian Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs rejected this plan. The year 1994 ended with intensified NATO involvement through the use of airpower, two sides at conflict instead of three (the Muslim-Croat federation against the Bosnian Serbs), and a new cease\u00ad fire. Former United States President Jimmy Carter negotiated this cease-fire and all parties to conflict agreed with its terms. This cease\u00ad fire held-for four months. 5. 1995 -The Conflict Ends At the end of the four-month cease-fire, the fighting resumed. It included violations of the exclusion zones and the shelling ofthe declared safe areas-two of which were the tortured cities of Sarajevo and Srebrenica. NATO reacted with air strikes against Bosnian Serb ammunition depots in Pale, BiH, in May 1995. The Bosnian Serbs responded by taking captive 370 UNPROFOR troops and using them as human shields at potential NATO air strike targets. Television cameras beamed images ofU.N. troops tied to bridge supports around the globe. The government of Serbia helped negotiate the release of these hostages. The U.N. strongly condemned the mistreatment ofU.N. troops, the increased level ofhostilities, and the June 2 shooting down of a United State Air Force plane. As a consequence, the\u00b7U.N. withdrew all UNPROFOR forces that were isolated at weapons collection sites around Sarajevo. In June 1995, the NAC approved .93 United States, Russia, France, Gennany, and Great Britain. The Contact Group's goal was to broker an agreement between the new Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs. 40 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS plans for a NA TO-led operation to support the withdrawal of UNPROFOR from BiH and Croatia.94 The war appeared far from over. Against this ominous backdrop, the \"tides of war turned dramatically.\"95 First, the newly fortified, combined armies of the Muslim-Croat federation, attacked and gobbled up chunks ofterritory in the northwest. Second, the fall of the safe areas Srebrenica and Zepa to the Bosnian Serbs and the renewed Bosnian Serb artillery shelling of Sarajevo finally galvanized NATO into acting decisively with a month\u00ad long bombing campaign. Operation Deliberate Force, a joint U.N.\u00ad NATO air campaign, successfully damaged the military capabilities of the Bosnian Serbs. This operation succeeded in reducing the threat to the Sarajevo safe area, deterring further attacks on all safe areas, enforcing the twenty-kilometer weapons-free exclusion zone around Sarajevo, providing unrestricted use of the Sarajevo airport, and in securing freedom of movement for UNPROFOR and non\u00ad governmental organizations. With the threat ofresumed air strikes, Operation Deliberate Force concluded in September 1995.96 Third, the newly weakened Bosnian Serb military gave more ground to the fast moving Muslim-Croat offensive of September 1995. By November 1995, the Bosnian-Serbs controlled just fifty percent ofBiH. With NATO's newfound resolve and the new territorial parity, diplomatic efforts increased dramatically. For the first time, the military focus shifted from extracting UNPROFOR under hostile 94 AFSOUTH OPLAN 40104 provided for the extraction ofUNPROFOR under hostile conditions. At the direction of USAREUR, SETAF developed OP LAN Daring Lion. In Jun. 1993, SET AF participated in Mountain Shield at the Grafenwoeher Training Area to develop and validate OPLAN Daring Lion. In anticipation ofconducting the UNPROFOR extraction, EU COM issued a warning order to SETAF for OPLAN Daring Lion and CINCSOUTH released OPLAN 40104. As the Bosnia Peace Plan and the 5 Oct. 1995 cease-fire held, NATO decided not to use OPLAN Daring Lion. See USAREUR AAR, supra note 12, at 19-30. 95 See CNBC History ofthe Balkans. 96 This did not, however, end NATO air strikes. OPERATION DENY FLIGHT was a continuing operation, and, on 4 Oct. 1995, when Bosnian Serb anti-aircraft radar locked onto NATO aircraft, NATO attacked two different radar sites. LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 41 conditions to conducting a peace operation. A United States-led mediation produced an October 5, 1995, cease-fire and brought the parties to the conflict to Dayton, Ohio, to work on a peace settlement.97 Representatives from Serbia (Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was already indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and did not attend), Croatia, and the Bosnian Government all attended the conference. On November 21, 1995, the presidents of Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia initialed the Dayton Peace Accord (DPA).98 The DPA, which is still in effect, is a wide-ranging \u00b7 peace agreement that gave birth to a single Bosnian state with the Bosnian Serbs, later named the Republika of Serpska (RS), controlling forty-nine percent and the Muslim-Croat Federation controlling fifty\u00ad one percent of the territory. Federal elections would occur within nine months of the formal signing of the agreement. With the initialing of the Dayton Peace Accord, NATO expedited planning for a multi\u00ad national Implementation Force (IFOR) to implement the military aspects of the DPA.99 On December 5, 1995, NATO endorsed OPLAN 10405-0peration Joint Endeavor-the military plan for IFOR. This act set the stage for the largest military operation in NATO history. 100 Then, on December 14, 1995, the parties101 signed the official Balkan peace plan, the General Framework Agreement for Peace, in Paris, France (hereinafter GFAP). The following day, the U.N. passed Security Council Resolution 1031, giving NA TO the peace enforcement mandate, under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter,102 to 97 On 1 Nov. 1995, the peace talks opened at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio. 98 The basic agreement and the military annex are at Appendix E(5). The text of the entire agreement is available on CLAMO's Lotus Notes database, or through JAGC.NET on the Internet. ~ 99 Three days after the 5 Oct. 1995 cease-fire, SACEUR invited the Partner for Peace nations to participate in the Implementation Force. 100 Department of State Fact Sheet, subject: NATO Involvement in the Balkan Crisis (Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs 8 May 1997). 101 President Franjo Trudjman, Croatia; President Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia; President Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia. 102 U.N. CHARTER, chapter VII (See Appendix E(2)). 42 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS implement the military aspects of the Peace Agreement. On December 16, 1995, the NATO-led IFOR began Operation Joint Endeavor-the deployment ofwhat would be, by February 1996, a 60,000 member multinational force with troop contributing nations from all 16 NA TO allies and 18 non-NATO countries, including Russia. C. OPERATION JOINT ENDEAVOR (OJE) 1. IFOR Tasks & Milestones Recalling that the Entity Armed Forces (EAFs) voluntarily agreed to the terms of the GFAP, the IFOR's role was to assist, in an even-handed manner, the EAFs to implement the peace agreement. See Sample Mission Statements at Appendix F. Under the terms of Annex 1-A to the GFAP,103 the military annex, the Implementation Force successfully enforced the cease-fire, ensured the withdrawal of forces and the movement ofheavy weapons to designated storage sites, supervised the marking ofboundaries and the zone of separation between the EAFs, provided for the safe withdrawal ofUNPROFOR forces not participating in IFOR, and controlled the airspace over BiH. Finally, IFOR provided a secure environment for the multitude of other organizations responsible for implementing the civilian aspects of the GFAP. IFOR's success in carrying out the military aspects of the GFAP was pivotal in Bosnia's transition to peace in the first year after the signing of the GFAP. December 2, 1995, began the deployment to Croatia, Hungary, and Bosnia of the IFOR Enabling Force of2600 troops, who prepared for the 60,000 strong IFOR main body deployment. On December 20, 1995, D-Day, the UNPROFOR Commander transferred authority to Commander, IFOR, ofall NATO and non-NATO forces participating in IFOR. The next day, the first ever Joint Military Commission met in Sarajevo. On January 19, 1996, D+30, the EAFs withdrew their forces 103 See GFAP supra note 13. LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS JN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 43 from the Zone of Separation on both sides of the agreed cease-fire line (ACFL). On February 3, 1996, D+45, the EAFs withdrew their forces from those areas to be transferred to another EAF. By March 19, 1996, D+90, the transfer of agreed-upon territory between the EAFs was completed, the cease-fire line was replaced with the inter-entity boundary line (IEBL ), and the new ZOS was established around the IEBL. See Map at Appendix A(2). The last major milestone in implementing the military aspects of the GFAP concerned demobilizing designated forces by moving them and all heavy weapons into designated cantonment areas. As the EAFs were unable to meet the initial April 18, 1996, (D+ 120) deadline, SACEUR pushed the deadline to June 27, 1996, (D+ 180). The EAFs met this deadline. 2. Command and Control104 The NATO-led OJE was under the political direction and control of the North Atlantic Council (NAC). Military control of IFOR, the military force of OJE, included a unified command structure that began yvith NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR), General George Joulwan. Also, General Joulwan was SACEUR designated NATO's Commander-in-Chief, Southern Command (CINCSOUTH), Admiral Leighton Smith, as the first Commander of the Implementation Force (COMIFOR). COMIFOR, in turn, commanded the three multi-national divisions105 through NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC). See Organization Charts at Appendix D(1)&(2). 3. /FOR Support to Civilian Implementation ofthe GFAP IFOR's success in implementing the military aspects ofthe GF AP created a relatively secure environment for the 400-plus . 104 See NATO Task Force Organization, Appendix 105 U.S.-led MND-SW. 44 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS international and non-governmental organizations responsible for implementing the civilian aspects of the peace agreement. 106 The December 8-9, 1995 Peace Implementation Conference named Carl Bildt as the High Representative (Office ofthe High Representative or OHR) in charge ofmonitoring and coordinating all aspects of the civilian implementation ofthe GF AP. IFOR provided support to the civilian implementation ofthe peace process at the request ofthe OHR and consistent with IFOR's mandate and available resources. IFOR worked closely with and provided significant logistical support107 to the OHR, the International Police Task Force (IPTF), the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Significantly, IFOR assisted the OHR and the OSCE as they successfully prepared, supervised, and monitored the September 14, 1995 elections. IFOR stood up a Civil-Military Cooperation team (CIMIC) which rendered technical advice and expertise to the various international and non-governmental organizations, IFOR units, various commissions, the EAFs, and local authorities. The 350-person CIMIC included IFOR personnel, attorneys, educators, public transportation specialists, engineers, agriculture experts, economists, public health officials, veterinarians, communication experts, and other experts. 4. U.S. Military Role While organizations all over the Department ofDefense played a role in the success ofIFOR, U.S. forces directly supported the operation in four primary locations. First, the U.S.-led Multi-National 106 NATO Fact Sheet, subject: NATO's Role in Bringing Peace to the Former Yugoslavia (Mar. 97). 107 Some of the support included transportation, medical treatment and evacuation, vehicle recovery and repair, and security information. 45 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 Division, North (MND-N), Task Force Eagle (TFE), was and continues to be responsible for the northeast one-third of BiH. This area of operations includes Tuzla, the Posavina Corridor, Doboj, Zvomik, and the highly charged city of Brcko. See Organization Chart at Appendix D(3). During IFOR, TFE represented the largest concentration of U.S. forces, numbering about 22,000. Second, U.S. commanders and personnel supported the multi-national headquarters in Sarajevo. Third, USAREUR and V Corps personnel supported TFE from the Intermediate Staging Base (ISB)in Hungary and from locations in Croatia. Fourth, U.S. forces continued to support the UNPREDEP (formerly UNPROFOR) mission in FYROM.108 \u00b7 On December 20, 1995, UNPROFOR transferred authority to the Commarider of TFE, the Commanding General ofthe First Armored Division (now the Commander of IFOR's Multinational Division\u00ad North). Despite the extremely harsh conditions that accompanied the worst winter in 40 years, V Corps and 1st AD engineers, many from Hanau, Germany, successfully bridged the Sava River on December 31, 1995. 1st AD soldiers, augmented with V Corps personnel, immediately crossed the bridge into Bosnia becoming part of the most powerful organization in !FOR-Task Force Eagle. Forces from Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Poland, Denmark, Lithuania, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Russia, and Turkey joined TFE adding 3 additional brigades to TFE-the Nordic-Polish, Russian, and Turkish Brigades. TFE now had 6 brigades (plus), fully armed and prepared for any contingency, hoping not to fire one round in anger. Amidst the highly charged and extremely volatile situation amongst the EAFs after 4 years ofbrutal conflict, TFE, with firm resolve, successfully implemented every military objective in the GF AP in an even-handed manner. After nine months on the ground, TFE supported the OSCE in the country's first democratic national elections. 108 The U.S. contribution to UNPREDEP in FYROM is called Task force Able Sentry. 46 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS 5. Judge Advocate Support Like operations in Haiti, Operation Joint Endeavor and the continuing operations in the Balkans profit from heavy judge advocate support.109 Judge advocates, legal administrators, noncommissioned officers, and legal specialists, from the active and reserve components, deployed in support of OJE and the continuing operations. Reserve Component judge advocates and legal personnel distinguished themselves by their seamless integration into existing organizations in Bosnia, the ISB in Hungary, and backfilling legal centers in Germany. Initially, fifteen judge advocates, one warrant officer, and twenty-three 71Ds deployed in support ofTFE. Five judge advocates and six 71Ds deployed with 21st TAACOM(F) to the ISB in Hungary. Also with the ISB in Hungary, four judge advocates and four 71Ds deployed as part of USAREUR(F). Finally, one U.S. judge advocate augmented the U.K. and Dutch attorneys at the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. See Judge Advocate Disposition at Appendix D(4). TFE judge advocates provided full legal support to two brigade combat teams, an aviation brigade, a corps support group, a military police brigade, the division artillery staff, the Division Main in Tuzla, and the Division Rear. Judge advocates at every level-from NA TO to the soldier on the ground-impacted on these operations. They: Helped craft the GF AP Assisted commanders at every level-from the coalition level to the base camp in the Zone of Separation-with every aspect ofthe Rules ofEngagement Helped negotiate, write, and interpret the crucial Status of Forces Agreements, Transit Agreements, Implementing and 109 See HAITI AAR at 25. ~ 47 LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 Technical Arrangements, and Acquisition and Cross\u00ad Servicing Agreements Provided contract and fiscal law support Established responsive foreign claims procedures Assisted in the proper and effective administration of justice-of equal importance forward and in the rear detachments Supported soldiers and families both forward and in the rear detachments Developed expertise and procedures while participating in critical Joint Military Commission and bi-lateral meetings The day-to-day advice judge advocates provided to commanders in Bosnia proved crucial. Judge advocates serving in isolated base camps performed every aspect of legal support to operations. D. OPERATION JOINT GUARD (OJG) I. SFOR Tasks & Milestones As IFOR's mandate-to implement peace--drew to a close, the North Atlantic Council (NAC) concluded that a reduced110 military presence-a Stabilization Force (SFOR}-was required to stabilize the peace and to allow continued work on the implementation of the civilian aspects of the GFAP. See Sample Mission Statements at Appendix F. On December 12, 1996, the U.N. authorized111 SFOR to succeed IFOR with the same authority to implement the military aspects of the GF AP. SFOR accomplished its primary mission of contributing to a secure environment necessary for the consolidation of peace. \u00b71\u00b0From 60,000 to about 31,000 in U.N. Doc. S/Res/1088 (12 Dec. 1996). 1 48 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS SFOR successfully deterred and prevented the resumption of hostilities, monitored and enforced compliance with the military aspects of the GF AP, ensured force protection at all times, operated Joint Military Commissions, enforced and controlled the military and civilian airspace, and within its capabilities, provided selective support to civilian organizations. 2. Command and Contro/111 Like IFOR, SFOR remained under the political direction and control of the North Atlantic Council (NAC). Military control of SFOR, a unified command structure, remained with NATO's SACEUR, General Joulwan. With SFOR, the SACEUR made two significant changes in the command and control structure. First, SACEUR appointed the Commander of Land Forces Central Europe (CINCLANDCENT) as the Commander, SFOR (CINCSOUTH was the Commander ofIFOR). Second, the SACEUR removed the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps from the chain of command. Now, the COMSFOR directly commanded the three multi-national divisions. The three divisions now included troops from all 16 NATO allies plus 20 non-NATO troop-contributing nations. 113 3. SFOR Support to Civilian Implementation ofthe GFAP With the continued stabilization of the military situation by SFOR, all eyes turned to the need for success in implementing the civilian aspects of the GFAP. SFOR worked with the OSCE on elections, playing a critical role in ensuring a free and fair environment for elections to take place in the Republik of Serpska.114 SFOR 112 See NATO Task Force Organization. Appendix D(l). 113 The 14 Partner for Peace troop-contributing nations are: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Sweden, and Ukraine. The remaining six non-PFP troop-contributing nations are: Egypt, Jordan, Ireland, Malaysia, Morocco, and Slovenia. 114 This is discussed later in the ROE section. 49 LAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONSINTHE BALKANS, 1995-1998 supported the UNHCR as it continued to struggle with the return of refugees and displaced persons, assisting, for example, to prevent the return of unauthorized weapons to the ZOS. SFOR continued to assist the IPTF in its mandate to promote local law and order and restore confidence in the rule oflaw, played an expanded role in assisting the ICTY, provided security and logistics support to ICTY investigative teams, and participated in the apprehension of alleged war criminals. Finally, SFOR continued to use the expertise ofthe Civil-Military Information Center. 4. U.S. Military Role United States forces supported SFOR through the Intermediate Staging Base (ISB) in Hungary and Croatia, SFOR Headquarters in Sarajevo, and Task Force Eagle in the Multi-National Division-North. Also, U.S. forces continued to support the UNPREDEP mission in Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia (FYROM). Initially, 1st Infantry Division (IID) deployed a covering force to Bosnia to secure 1st Armored Division's return to Germany. Two days after the transfer ofauthority, the 1 ID immediately intervened and defused two separate, potentially explosive demonstrations between the EAFs in the villages ofCelie and Gajevi. On November 10, 1996, the 1st Armored Division transferred authority--command and control-to the 1st Infantry Division from Wuerzburg, Germany (U.S. military calls this SFOR1). The Commander, 1st Infantry Division, deployed 1st Infantry Division (Fwd) to TFE while maintaining the Division \"flag\" at Wuerzburg, Germany. On December 20, 1996, COMIFOR transferred authority to COMSFOR, ending Operation Joint Endeavor and beginning Operation Joint Guard. The 1st Infantry Division stayed in place as part of the new Stabilization Force (SFOR1) in command ofTask Force Eagle. Together with the other nations making up the MND-N sector, the soldiers of the 1st Infantry .Division kept the peace in Bosnia and provided a stable climate in sector. 50 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS On October 22, 1997-less than one year after spear-heading Operation Joint Endeavor, the 1st Armored Division(Fwd) returned to Bosnia, relieved in place the I st Infantry Division, and assumed command, again, ofTask Force Eagle (SFOR2). The 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) from Fort Polk, Louisiana, deployed two battalion task forces to support I st Armored Division (Fwd). Unlike their deployment with TFE as part of IFOR, the Commander, 1st Armored Division, now maintained the division \"flag\" at Bad Kreuznach, Germany. The soldiers of the 1st Armored Division and the 2d ACR continued to keep the peace and provided that secure environment for the hard work that continued on the civilian aspects of the GFAP. 5. Judge Advocate Support As OJE ended and OJG began, the 60,000 troops ofthe IFOR gave way to the 35,000 SFOR troops in theater. Likewise, force levels of TFE dropped from a Division (plus) to a Brigade (plus). For judge advocat~s, this new manning level carried great significance. See Judge Advocate Disposition at Appendix D(4). Instead ofjudge advocate support to brigade combat teams, judge advocates now provided full-time support to three, later four, battalion task forces in U.S. sector base camps. 1st Armored Division, 1st Infantry Division, and 2d ACR judge advocates provided full legal support to these battalion task forces, the brigade headquarters, an aviation brigade, and the Division Forward in Tuzla. These \"all purpose\"115 judge advocates continued to show the value that judge advocates bring to the commander in the decision making process and to supporting soldiers, both forward and in the rear detachments. 115 Base camp judge advocates provided legal support to connnanders, staffs, and soldiers in virtually every area of the law.

U.S. Military Role United States forces will continue to support the SFOR at the ISB in Hungary and Croatia, SFOR Headquarters in Sarajevo, and Task Force Eagle in MND-N. U.S. forces will continue to support the UNPREDEP mission in FYROM. As SFOR transitioned to a smaller follow-on force, the U.S. has agreed to contribute roughly 6900 personnel.117 Beginning August 26, 1998, the I st Cavalry Division became the first continental U.S. division to deploy to the Balkans. The I st Armored Division transferred authority--command and control-ofTFE to the lst Cavalry Division on October 7, 1998 (SFOR3). Two ofthe lst Cavalry Division's brigades, deploying in sequence for six months each, will provide support to the maneuver elements. SFOR 4 begins when the second ofthe two 1st Cavalry Division brigades deploy. 5. Judge Advocate Support Like their predecessors, I st Cavalry Division judge advocates will continue the trend ofproviding full-time legal support to battalion task forces located in four base camps in the U.S. sector. Also, judge advocates will provide full legal support to the Brigade Headquarters, an Aviation Brigade; and the Division Headquarters (Eagle Base) in Tuzla. See Judge Advocate Disposition at Appendix D(4). 117 Id LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 53 III. Lessons Learned A. INTRODUCTION TO LESSONS LEARNED 1. Command and control issues initially dominated legal support to operations in the Balkans. As stated in the Introduction, legal support to operations (the Judge Advocate General's Corps' support to the battlefield commander) \u00b7 can be viewed in three discrete areas: command and control, 118 sustainment,119 and personnel support.12\u00b0Command and control issues dominated the beginning ofOperation Joint Endeavor starting in December 1995-meting out the Rules ofEngagement (ROE), drafting and reviewing plans and orders, and interpreting and applying the GF AP and other international agreements to facilitate movement ofpeople and equipment into country. Once IFOR established its presence, command and control issues centered on interpreting and applying the GF AP's provisi_ons pertaining to the Former Warring Factions-gaining control ofthe Zone ofSeparation, monitoring and controlling weapons, facilitating freedom ofmovement, facilitating elections, etc. 2. As the theater matured, sustainment issues quickly dominated legal support to operations, particularly regarding contract and fiscal law. Sustainment issues grew and eventually dominated legal support to the operation. Fiscal and contract law issues predominated. Issues included occupation and lease ofreal estate; construction and 118 Including but not limited to interpreting, drafting, disseminating, and training commanders, staffs, and soldiers on the Rules of Engagement, participating in targeting cells, participating in the military decision making process, and dealing with the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). Generally, issues directly affecting the commander's decision making process on the battlefield fall within C2. 119 Including but not limited to negotiating ACSAs and other agreements, contracting, and administering the Foreign Claims Act. . 120 Including but not limited to the administration ofmilitary justice, legal assistance services, and basic soldier-related claims issues. 54 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS maintenance ofbase camps, roads, and bridges; the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP-all the support required to move, house, feed our divisions); and support to our civilians, the host nation, the local populace, other contributing nations' forces, and non\u00ad governmental organizations (NGOs). Foreign claims were also a large part of the legal support provided within the sustainment arena. 3. Legal support within the personnel service and support function remained critical and relatively constant. Issues of military justice, legal assistance, and personnel claims were ever present and critically important to supporting the command and the troops. Their volume remained somewhat constant throughout the various operations. Ifone were able to diagram these three functions or areas of legal support to military operations and their relative volumes (in terms ofnumber of issues raised and man-hours spent) through the Balkan operations, it might look something like this: Levels of Legal Support to Operations by Functional Area 60 50 40Rough %of 30issues 20 10 o~_c:a--...-:;~a_a,~~E:a..1---~ ; \u00a7. .2\u00ad a. ~ 0 0 E Ee: CIO NO ~ ... + + 0 Q Time ~Sustainment OPersonnel Support 55 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 This pattern would likely be similar for other operations at the stability (e.g., peacekeeping, peacemaking, peace enforcement, etc.) end ofthe spectrum ofmilitary operations. For high intensity operations, command and control issues likely become the main effort during battlefield operations. Sustainment issues tend to predominate before and after battlefield operations, while personnel service support legal issues remain ever-present and relatively constant. 56 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS B.

The legal framework ofoperations in the Balkans-to include Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, 129 UNSCR 1031, 130 the GF AP, and the ROE131-clearly provides for the use ofnecessary force, to include the use ofdeadly force. The robust nature of these peace enforcement ROE provided for decisive action, when appropriate, by Task Force Eagle {TFE) personnel.132 On the other hand, military operations in the Balkans were undertaken with a cease-fire in place and with the consent of the Entity Armed Forces (EAF). To maintain the very fragile peace in Bosnia, TFE personnel had to maintain their impartiality-both actual and perceived. The ill-advised use offorce could eliminate this perception of impartiality and re-ignite the conflict. Against this backdrop ofpotentially conflicting messages, judge advocates successfully advised commanders and trained soldiers on \"who can shoot at what, with which weapons, when, and where.\"133 127THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUB. 1-02, DEP'T OF DEFENSE DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS ( 1989) [hereinafter JOINT PUB. 1-02]. ROE are directives issued by competent authority to delineate the circumstances and limitations under which its own naval, ground, and air forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered. They are the means by which the National Command Authority (NCA) and operational commanders regulate the use of armed force in the context ofapplicable political and military policy and domestic and international law. 12s Id. 129 See Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, Appendix E(2). 130 S.C.

The North Atlantic Council (NAC) reached a multinational consensus on the ROE (hereinafter NATO ROE). Based on the U.N. and GFAP mandates for the IFOR to use necessary force to accomplish the mission, the U.S. National Command Authorities-the President and Secretary ofDefense\u00ad approved the NAC's ROE concept. From this, SACEUR, CINCAFSOUTH, COMIFOR, COMARRC, and issued their respective See SFOR Headquarters Structure at Appendix D(2). ln\u00b7turn, each of the troop contributing nations could issue more restrictive ROE for their own forces (based on host nation law). For U.S. forces under the operational control (OPCON) of COMIFOR/COMSFOR, the CJCS Standing Rules of Engagement135 were NOT in effect.136 This meant that most137 U.S. forces had to train on and apply the use of force under the NA TO ROE.

The 1994 SROE are currently undergoing a five-year review and may change significantly in the near future. 136 The SROE apply to U.S. forces in operations with limited exceptions for multinational force (MNF), civil disturbance and disaster relief operations. Enclosure A of the SROE, id., directs that U.S. forces assigned to the operational control (OPCON) of a multinational force will follow the ROE ofthe multinational force, unless the National Conunand Authority (NCA) directs otherwise. Because Bosnia was a multi-national operation and the NCA did not direct otherwise, the SROE did not apply to those soldiers under the OPCON ofIFOR/SFOR. 137 U.S. Forces under the OPCON of the U.S. and located outside ofBiH, followed the SROE. This is discussed later in the text. 59 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 Judge advocate participation in interpreting, drafting, disseminating, and training ROE peaks in multinational peace operations. ROE are a commander's tool to control the use offorce and operators (i.e., S3/G3/J3) are and must remain responsible for the development ofthe ROE.138 Nevertheless, commanders involved in preparing for and executing operations in the Balkans turned to their judge advocates to take the lead in interpreting, drafting, and training the ROE.139 Within TFE, judge advocates-captains, majors, and lieutenant colonels-understood the legal, policy, and military140 underpinnings ofthe ROE when advising commanders on the use force to accomplish the mission. Operations in the Balkans validated this critical function where soldier-lawyers, at all levels, provided advice that expanded or limited a commander's options to accomplish the m1ss10n. 1. Expect difficulties with ROE in coalition operations. Operations in Bosnia involved 32 to 36 Troop Contributing Nations (TCN). All multinational forces in Bosnia were under the direction and political control ofthe North Atlantic Council (NAC). The sixteen nations that make up NATO reached a consensus on the ROE. Further, the non-NATO TCNs agreed to abide by the NATO ROE but could restrict further the application of the ROE based on TCN requirements. Judge advocates, at every level ofcommand, had to work closely with each other in order to make the ROE a multinational success. 138 JTF COMMANDERS HANDBOOK at 1-13 -1-19. 139 See OJE-AAR, supra note 30, vol. I. ~ When asked whether ROE were perceived as judge advocate functions or operator functions, judge advocates from TFE, IFOR, the ARRC, AFSOUTH, and NATO all agreed that action officers and commanders alike viewed the ROE as a judge advocate function. 140 See U.S. Navy Captain Ashley Roach, Rules ofEngagement, NAVAL WAR COL REV. 46, 48 (1983) (for a discussion of the underpinnings ofROE). 60 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS a. Expect to train and deploy without the ROE; expect challenges in the first set ofROE. The complexity inherent in large-scale multinational operations will likely result in last minute approval of the ROE. Fast paced events on the ground, the extraordinarily difficult negotiation process in getting multiple nations to agree on the ROE, 141 and varying political requirements virtually assure a similar result in future large scale multinational operations. That is \"simply the way it is.\"142 Further, once the ROE are approved, the various OPLANs in multinational operations may result in inconsistent terms, imprecise terminology (for \u00b7 example, ill-defined acronyms), vague decision making authority (for example, senior commander verses senior soldier on the ground), and complicated weapons release matrices.143 For the Implementation Force (IFOR), the Commander, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), used a detailed ROE matrix. The ARRC used the matrix to achieve unity of effort across the three multinational divisions. Generally, judge advocates and staffs liked the matrices. The Task Force Eagle Staff Judge Advocate also employed a ROE matrix. Despite the complexity of translating ROE annexes into matrices, operators and judge advocates alike thought that they worked well. 144 b. Identify troop contributing nation counterparts and liaisons early. In Bosnia, the MND-N included troops from 12 nations: The U.S., Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Poland, Denmark, Lithuania, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Russia, and Turkey.

TCNs may deploy with outdated or inaccurate translations ofthe ROE or may deploy without ROE cards for their soldiers.145 Other TCNs may have little or no training in the use of force in peace operations. Judge advocates must make early contact with TCN liaisons to identify and fix these potentially dangerous shortfalls. In one instance, a U.S. judge advocate provided classroom and situational training exercises (STX) for Russian soldiers in the TFE area of operations. 146 c. Accountfor troop contributing nations' (TCN) domestic law and sensitivities in mission planning. Commanders must assign missions in multinational operations with an understanding ofthe TCNs operational capabilities, national/political interests, and domestic legal constraints. TCN's may lack the necessary ROE training to adequately deal with a difficult enforcement situation. Multinational partners may have domestic limitations more restrictive than the ROE or may have a culture of ~pplying force in peacekeeping operations. A multinational partner may have historical stigmas that may cause hesitation in the use of force. 147 For example, a TCN may have policy or legal restrictions on the use ofRiot Control Agents (RCA).148 Still other TCNs may not agree with the U.S. 's view on particular definitions such as what constitutes hostile intent.

Work with the operators and other staffsections to ensure all troop contributing nations (TCNs) have accurate, translated ROE and soldier cards. First, TFE judge advocates helped the G3 determine which TCNs, particularly their subordinate units, had the current ROE and whether they had ROE soldier cards available for their soldiers in the relevant language.149 Many TCNs did not have the current ROE and did not have ROE soldier cards. The various ROE soldier cards are at Appendix G. In addition to interpreting, drafting, and training ROE, judge advocates ended up producing, laminating, and distributing ROE cards. Judge advocates should take steps to ensure that operators take the lead in developing the ROE, information managers produce and laminate ROE cards, and public affairs officers (PAO) coordinate all media release of the ROE. The second issue concerned the initial ROE classification as NATO Confidential. This classification kept the ROE out of the hands of non-NATO TCNs until they were in Bosnia for some time. Later, a FRAGO fixed this by classifying the ROE as NA TO Confidential\u00ad Releasable IFOR. 150 This must be done at the earliest opportunity. The initial classification also hindered public affairs operations. Public affairs has a significant role in today's complex, operational environment and requires clear guidance on what can be released and when. While the ROE had a public dissemination annex, it failed to state a release authority. Judge advocates should work closely with the PAO to ensure relevant information is available for release in a timely fashion. 149 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 16. ~ 150/d. 63 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS JN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 2. Situational Training Exercises (STX) and mission-oriented refresher training best prepare soldiers to deal with peace operations. Units must conduct training from the commander level down, and include class and practical training, with the main effort on STX. STX, or Situational Training Exercises, focus on one or a few tasks within a particular mission scenario and require soldiers to practice until the tasks are executed to standard.151 As noted previously, TFE soldiers deployed without the ROE. This is not to say that USAREUR units waited until they had the ROE to train. In fact, V Corps, Southern Europe Task Force (SETAF), and I st Armored Division commanders and judge advocates focused on Bosnia up to two years before the deployment. Senior commanders 152 planned and soldiers trained continuously for the uncertain future. a. Judge advocates must have situational awareness (Bosnia) and understand pre-deployment contingency planning. Judge Advocates helped develop pre-deployment training for 1st AD and other V Corps units that might be tasked to deploy to Bosnia. To develop this training, judge advocates had to understand the situation in Bosnia and the mission. Judge advocates read country studies, Civil Affairs Area Assessments, historical documents, and press reports to gain insight into what soldiers would face in Bosnia. Judge advocates also had to be integrated members ofthe staff to gain access to and understand the various contingency plans that the National Command Authority (NCA) might have asked U.S. forces to implement. From this understanding, judge advocates helped design home station STXs centered around the basic principals of self\u00ad defense, the invaluable STXs used by V Corps in Mountain Eagles I & 151 These scenario-based exercises are also called \"lane training\" because they confront the soldier with a controlled event and observe the response. 152 Interview with COL Gerard A. St. Amand, fonner V Corps Staff Judge Advocate, at the Judge Advocate General's School, Charlottesville, Virginia (26 Sep.1998) (where he related that the V Corps Commander focused on preparing the Corps for Bosnia well before anyone knew what the mission would be). 64 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS II153 (Bosnia preparatory field exercises), and Individual Readiness Training at Hohenfels, Germany.154 b. Use Situational Training Exercises (STX). This lesson learned is found in the Haiti AAR. It is a lesson, however, that bears repeating. Many155 judge advocates, commanders, and soldiers who deployed to Bosnia agree that soldiers were better prepared for the Bosnia missions because of the STX training. To conduct STX's on ROE, a commander, judge advocate, or other trainer places a soldier in a particular simulated METT-T156 and then confronts him with an event, such as the crashing of a traffic checkpoint barrier by a speeding vehicle. The trainer evaluates the soldier's response, and afterward discusses alternative responses available within the ROE. The STX brings to life abstract rules on the ROE card, giving the soldier concrete terms of reference within which to determine his response. In this way, the soldier achieves the balance between 153 MAJ Ron Miller, V Corps, helped design 30-50 scenarios for STX training focused on individual and collective tasks-dealing with potential scenarios in Bosnia-for Mountain Eagle I and II.

From our sampling of interviews, 100% agreed that situational training exercise (STX) training, particularly in peace operations, better prepared them for what they saw in Bosnia. 156 See, e.g., U.S. DEP'T OF ARMY, SOLDIER TRAINING PUBLICATION No. 21-II-MQS, MILITARY QUALIFICATION STANDA RDS II: MANUAL OF COMMON TASKS FOR LIEUTENANTS AND CAPTAINS 3-86 (31Jan.1991) (Task 04-3303.02-0014, Prepare Platoon or Company Combat Orders) (describing the factors of \"mission, enemy, terrain, troops, and time available\"). 65 LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 initiative and restraint so important to success in operations other than war.157 For Bosnia, various trainers used the widely known mnemonic, RAMP,158 as an effective training tool in preparing soldiers for deployment to Bosnia. In its generic form, RAMP training seeks to provide soldiers a baseline understanding of the application of the use of force-those rules articulated in the SROE-that follow soldiers in all operations. Then, when faced with a specific mission, those same soldiers are better equipped to deal with the mission-specific ROE. Deployment training at Fort Benning, Georgia, 159 Hohenfels, Germany,160 the I 0th Mountain Division, 161 at home station in Germany, and in Bosnia successfully used RAMP as a training tool for deploying soldiers. Training soldiers on the principles that underlie ROE, and on the specific ROE that apply, prepare them to handle most situations appropriately. 162 157 See generally Major Mark S. Martins, Rules ofEngagement for Land Forces: A Matter of Training, Not Lawyering, 143 MILL REV. 1, n.274 at 90-92 (1994) (extolling the virtues of s\u00b7cenario training). (!) 158 See id. at n. 274. (!) RAMP is an acronym summarizing the basic principles a soldier must know to legally and rightfully use force. It is part of a Rules of Engagement training and development mechanism developed by MAJ Mark S. Martins. It stands for: Return fire with aimed fire. Anticipate attack. Measure the force you use (graduated response if able). Protect only yourself, your unit and those persons and property designated by your commander with deadly force. 159 Fort Benning is the CONUS Replacement Center for troops deploying to Bosnia from the Continental United States. 160 Hohenfels is the Individual Readiness Training center where all Europe-based soldiers prepare to deploy to Bosnia. 161 The 10th Mountain Division was responsible for deploying a rifle company to protect designated special property in Bosnia-a bridge. The Staff Judge Advocate noted that they supplemented the \"P\" in RAMP by instructing soldiers and training them on the use of minimum force, to include deadly force ifnecessary, to protect the bridge. The feedback from the soldiers and leaders to the . Staff Judge Advocate was extremely positive. 162 See Interview ofLTC Vowell, supra note 146. (!) 66 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS Examples of how well the soldier on the ground and in the air 163 1 . d dknew and applied the ROE abound. But severa JU ge a vocates cautioned that peace operations can cause greater, sometimes dangerous, reluctance on the part of soldiers to employ force when authorized and even perhaps, advisable.164 c. Conduct continuous ROE mission and refresher training. Before executing specific missions, judge advocates briefed soldiers and units on the ROE. For example, judge advocates briefed artillery units on the use of position defense, 165 aviators prior to specific show of force missions,166 and various convoy operations including claims convoys.167 Judge advocates agreed that continual ROE refresher training, based on a review and \"analysis of events occurring throughout the area of operations,\"168 is a vital link in maintaining our soldiers' edge in the use of force. Judge advocates continually drafted training scenarios based on recurring events in 163 See lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 14-15. ~ 164 See, e.g., Interview with LTC Steven T. Salata and MAJ Kevan J.

Finally, judge advocates must conduct or closely monitor all ROE training.169 3. Staffintegration is essential for judge advocates to be a combat multiplier in ROE issues. One of the first things I did with big OP LAW payoffs was to make friends with the planner in the S-3 shop .... I'd monitor the actions of the patrols and keep tabs with the battle captains ....

Routine participation in targeting cells, 171 ROE planning cells, and other planning groups ~eepjudge advocates in the information loop172 and position judge advocates to be problem solvers before things break. See Assault Command Post Layout (FOR) at Appendix D(5). Initially, judge advocates were not \"active members\"173 of targeting cells.

Early participation in the targeting planning process helps commanders and staffs develop courses of action supportable by the ROE. Ifthe ROE are unclear for a particular mission, early planning allows time to obtain command guidance, necessary FRAGOs on the ROE, or even requests for changes in the ROE. Staff integration174 is particularly critical in the Bosnia base camp environment. Since the end of 1996, judge advocates have served as base camp judge advocates to battalion task force commanders. For the most part, battalion commanders and staffs are unaccustomed to having judge advocates on their team. It is imperative for these base camp judge advocates-usually captains-to begin the team building process at the first opportunity. The base camp judge advocates handled many complex, sensitive, and potentially explosive use of force issues 175 and they attribute their success, in part, to being part of the command team. One of the most importapt things that a judge advocate can do is train the battle staff to identify issues early and resolve them with the judge advocate. 174 Staff integration really begins at home station. This lesson is not new. Attending Combat Training ~enter Seminars/Leader Training Programs, deploying to the Combat Training Centers, participating m FTXs and CPXs, attending staff calls and functions, conducting aggressive leader development programs at home station, and developing tactical expertise at every opportunity, all make judge advocates better staff officers. 175 Interview with CPT Wells, supra note 170. ~ See also 1 AD-AAR, supra note 145, and Interview with LTC Vowell. <J) Base camp judge advocates dealt with the entire spectrum ofROE issues: RCA, targeting, checkpoints, detention, weapons confiscation, etc. 69 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 4. Establish straightforward standards [~rdeployment and employment ofRiot Control Means (RCM), 17 to include Riot Control Agents (RCA). 177 To minimize the need to adjust tactics, training, and ROE in midstream to meet a crisis, commanders and judge advocates should plan for the use ofRCM at the earliest opportunity (may include batons, tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and even water cannons). The riots that occurred in Brcko in 1997 magnified the need for such planning and preparation.178 Widely varying Troop Contributing Nation {TCN) laws and policies will affect this planning for the employment and deployment of RCM. Because the NATO ROE were not available until TFE deployed into Bosnia, little advanced planning could take place. In peace operations, commanders will want something other than deadly force available. 179 The tenuous situation ofBosnia called for U.S. forces to get between three Entity Armed Forces (EAFs), enforce the peace, and assist in the civilian implementation of the GF AP .180 Consequently, U.S. commanders sought the use ofRCM-to include Riot Control Agents (primarily cayenne pepper spray and CS/tear gas). 176 RCM equates to what some call Less Than Lethal Means (LTLM). RCA is a subset ofRCM. RCA includes pepper spray and tear gas. RCM includes RCA and police clubs, rubber bullets, water cannons, riot control formations, etc. See PowerPoint Brief, subject: SFOR Legal Update (Feb. 1998) (provides a detailed look at RCM). ~Also, a lAD briefing provides an excellent timeline on these RCA issues. ~ 177 Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3110.07 (3 Jul. 1995) (document classified SECRET) (outlines U.S. policy for using RCA during peacetime, in armed conflict, or peace operations). 178 The Brcko riots presented our soldiers with old women wielding two-by-fours, teenagers throwing rocks, etc. Nonlethal weapons to include riot shields, batons, sponge grenades, plastic beehive M203 grenade rounds, and dye grenades were later brought in and required additional, reactionary training ofsoldiers.

Consistent with the SACEUR OPLAN, COMIFOR delegated RCA release authority to the Commander, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (COMARRC). See NATO Task Force Organization at Appendix D(l). This meant the Commander of Task Force Eagle needed COMARRC approval to employ RCA. Although this seemed simple, it was not. Executive Order 11850 required U.S. Presidential approval for U.S. servicemembers to use RCA. A further complication was the ongoing process concerning the ratification ofthe Chemical Weapons Convention.181 Yet the NCA approved the NATO ROE for IFOR which provided for the use ofRCA. The question became whether NCA approval ofthe NATO ROE equated to Presidential approval of the use ofRCA under Executive Order 11850. This question was left unresolved through most of Operation Joint Endeavor. Ultimately, TFE commanders, with specific approval from the Commander of SFOR, could utilize RCA. A second issue concerned the difference between employing (actual use) RCA and deploying (obtain, train, and issue) RCA. While the question ofemployment was debated, TFE sought to deploy RCA. The U.S. chain ofcommand told TFE to first get authority to use (not authority to get, train, or issue) RCA from Commander, Implementation Force (COMIFOR). The COMIFOR legal advisor responded by telling TFE that release authority was unnecessary. After going back through U.S. channels, TFE received approval to obtain and issue RCA.

All levels of command and judge advocate technical channels must provide prompt, explicit, written guidance in this difficult area. Even though IFOR and later SFOR did not restrict the types ofRCM procured, trained, or carried by TCN troops, judge advocates and commanders must plan for TCN host nation law and policy to affect the use ofRCA. 5. Maintain a constantly updated ROE battlebook. Judge advocates should expect broad, sweeping mandates in peace operations. In Bosnia, the U.N. and the GF AP provided such language in its \"silver bullet\"182 clause where IFOR could take appropriate action to enforce the peace agreement. The constantly changing situation on the ground caused constant analysis ofthe ROE and demanded further guidance. Accordingly, judge advocates maintained up-to-date UNSCRs, applicable international agreements (Vienna Convention), official versions ofthe GFAP, OPLANs, FRAGOs, command policy guidance letters, command standard operating procedures, technical channel legal opinions, and any other command messages or memorandums clarifying the command's position on the use offorce in various battle books. The one publication that puts together much ofthis guidance is the mission essential183 Joint Military Commission, Policy and Planning Guidance Handbook, now in its 6th edition (January 1998). From the beginning, judge advocates played a critical role in putting this handbook 182 The oft-cited silver bullet language comes from U.N.S.C. Res. I 031 and the GF AP and gave IFOR the authority to do what is necessary to enforce the peace. See Appendices E(3) and E(5). 183 This Handbook is recognized, Anny-wide, as a tactic, technique, and procedure for operations in Bosnia. III Corps used it to help develop training scenarios for the Mission readiness Exercise (MRE) for the I st Cavalry Division. The Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) and the Joint readiness Training Center (JRTC) use the Handbook to help their O/Cs coach, teach, and mentor the training units preparing for Bosnia. 72 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS together. One judge advocate noted that it could be called the \"SFOR ROE Handbook.\"184 See Extract ofthe JMC Handbook at Appendix K. 6. At the outset, seek ROE that allow soldiers to use deadly force against persons committing serious criminal acts. ROE should allow members of the multinational force to use deadly force, ifnecessary, to stop civilian-on-civilian violence that endangers life or is about to cause serious bodily harm (for example, murder, rape, serious assault). Today, this provision is part of the SFOR ROE.185 For IFOR, however, this provision was missing and to some judge advocates left ambiguity in the ROE.186 As the fall elections neared in 1996, COMARRC issued a message187 that seemed 184 E-mail message, 05/27 /98 11:34am, from CPT Patrick Sullivan, l '1 Cavalry Division judge advocate, to Major John W. Miller, Center for Law and Military operations, subject: Pegasus Forge 98-04 (SFOR3). 185 \"You may use minimum force, including opening fire, against an individual who unlawfully commits, or is about to commit, an act which endangers Life, or is likely to cause serious bodily harm, in circumstances where there is no other way to prevent the act.\" See SFOR ROE Card at Appendix G. 186 One judge advocate explained that his unit conducted ROE training to stop such serious acts of civilian on civilian violence. 187 The following is a TFE point paper on COMARRC's 2820472 Aug. 1996 message, concerning rules ofengagement (ROE): ~ BACKGROUND: On 2820472 Aug. 1996, COMARRC issued the following message: \"You may use appropriate force (including opening fire) in order to prevent a person you witness committing or threatening to commit a serious crime or any other act that could kill or cause serious bodily harm.\" KEY POINTS: a. The ROE have not changed as a result of the message from COMARRC. b. The purpose ofCOMARRC's message is to relay his interpretation ofour authority to use deadly force in the protection of persons without designated special status. This interpretation is that TFE soldiers may use force, including deadly force, to prevent the commission ofa serious crimes on persons with or without designated special status. 73 LAWANDMILITARYOPERATJONSJNTHE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 to allow the use of deadly force to stop serious civilian-on-civilian violence. Yet, the ROE had not changed. This same issue arose in Operation Uphold Democracy, and ended with a similar change in those ROE. 188 A related issue that judge advocates can expect to see is the ability of soldiers to use deadly force to stop the destruction of civilian property. For example, the current SFOR ROE does not permit SFOR soldiers to use deadly force in this manner.189 In Bosnia, rogue factions hindered the return of displaced persons and refugees (DPREs) through arson and physical violence, thereby frustrating civilian implementation ofthe GF AP. Judge advocates should expect issues regarding protection of civilians and property in similar operations. 7. Expect U.S. servicemembers to fall under multiple ROE when operations use an Intermediate Stage Base (/SB). In peace operations, the U.S. will likely use an ISB as a deployment, redeployment, and logistical support platform. As long as c. Any change to the ROE must be authorized by NATO. COMARRC's message stated that this message does not amount to a change in the ROE. This message is an interpretation within COMARRC's authority to apply \"conditions to the application of certain rules.\" ROE, para. 1. There are no time limits associated with this message. STATUS: a. COMARRC has instructed the MND's that the new ROE cards are not to be distributed below brigade level \"until clarification is received from the NAC that nations are content with the revised wording.\" ARRC Message, Revised ROE Card, DTG 032000Z Aug. 1996. b. This issue is currently being reviewed by NATO. 188 See discussion in HAITI AAR at 37-39. ~ 189 LTC Vowell discusses this in some detail in her interview.~ 74 \u00b7 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS the country hosting the ISB is a neutral party or participating member ofthe multinational force, the threat level should be minimal, calling for something other than robust ROE. This was the case for the ISB in Hungary. EUCOM190 and USAREUR agreed that the CJSC Standing Rules of Engagement191 (SROE) were appropriate for soldiers under the operational control of the U.S. and working in Hungary. Depending on whose operational control U.S. servicemembers fell under (U.S. or NATO), U.S. soldiers were subject to different ROE. This caused two issues to immediately surface. The first issue concerned the ROE for a U.S. soldier under the operational control (OPCON) of the U.S. (SROE apply) but traveling to and from Bosnia. For example, a fuel carrier (U.S. soldier) delivers fuel to TFE by driving from the ISB in Hungary, through Croatia, to Bosnia, and then returns to the ISB in Hungary. By requiring this soldier to comply with the SROE only, two U.S. soldiers, standing side-by-side (one is the fuel carrier; the other is a TFE soldier) in Bosnia, would use different ROE. Recognizing this dilemma, the European Command (EUCOM) issued a message on December 21, 1996, setting up a geographic ROE concept where all U.S. soldiers, upon crossing the border in Croatia and regardless of any OPCON relationship, were subject to the NATO ROE. 192 The second issue stemmed from the first. Once the geographic rule went into effect, legal advisors at USAREUR (Fwd) and 21st TAACOM(Fwd) in Hungary had soldiers that needed ROE cards and training on two very different sets of ROE-the SROE and the NATO ROE. This is a continuing training challenge for commanders, soldiers, and judge advocates but one that has caused few problems. 190 See comments by Commander MacGregor, Legal Advisor, EUCOM in OJE-AAR, supra note 30. ~ . 191 See supra note 135. 192 Id. 75 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 C. INTERNATIONAL LAW Operations in Africa, Haiti, Northern Iraq, and Bosnia-military operations other than war193 -continually defy the traditional application of international law. Most judge advocates understand that peace operations rarely fit neatly under the legal framework of the Law of War194 or any other legal architecture. In the Balkans, the three Entity Armed Forces (EAFs) laid down their arms in October 1995 and the parties195 signed the General Framework Agreement for Peace, agreeing to cooperate \"with all entities involved in the implementation of the peace settlement\"196 as detailed in 11 separate annexes. See Appendix E(5) for the text of the GF AP and its Military Annex. Thirty-six nations contributed military forces or logistical support to this peace enforcement action, authorized by a Security Council resolution that expressly invoked Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.197 See Appendix E(2) for text of U.N. Charter, Chapter VII. Acting under this U.N. mandate, NATO, in its first-ever out of area deployment, led 60,000 multinational forces into Bosnia to enforce the peace. Never before had so many nations participated in a 193 Operations that encompass the use of military capabilities across the range of military operations short of war.

Know the international legal basis for the mission andfor the use offorce. Various international agreements and operational documents broadly defined the scope ofthe mission and how soldiers could use force. Commanders at all levels looked to judge advocates for innovative solutions to very complex problems. Judge advocates must have a firm understanding ofall legal documents and how they fit together. For Bosnia, judge advocates must understand Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, all applicable U.N. Security Council Resolutions, the GF AP and all relevant annexes, all OPLANs and ROE annexes, and applicable U.S. policy on the application ofthe Law of War in peace operations.198 2. Consent-based peace agreements will affect every facet of the operation. The GF AP, and its military annex, defined the roles and responsibilities of the EAFs and the multinational force and included the following among its comprehensive provisions: Broad justification for the use of force Specific timelines for action New terms of art such as Zone ofSeparation (ZOS) and Inter\u00ad Entity Boundary Line (IEBL) Status of various police forces and other organizations Rules on the withdrawal, demobilization, and control of forces and weapons Instructions on freedom ofmovement for IFOR U.S. DEP'TOF DEFENSE, DIR. 5100.77, DOD LAW OF WAR PROGRAM paras.

While the agreement contains many details, the language is sufficiently broad to allow commanders flexibility in enforcing the peace. The often\u00ad . cited \"silver bullet clauses\"199 in UNSCR 1031 and the GFAP were a stroke of genius and should be included in future peace enforcement mandates.\u00b7 ...[T]o authorize the IFOR to take such actions as required, including the use of necessary force, to ensure compliance with this Annex, and to ensure its own protection .. .. 200 [B]oth [the Federation and the RS] shall be equally subject to such enforcement action by the IFOR as may be necessary to ensure implementation of this Annex and the protection of lFOR.201 The Parties understand and agree that the IFOR Commander shall have the authority, without interference or permission of any Party, to do all that the Commander judges necessary and proper, including the use of military force, to protect the IFOR and to carry out the responsibilities listed above ..., and they shall comply in all respects with the IFOR requirements.202 199 See OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II Cl) 200 note 13, Annex 1-A, para.2 (b) (see Appendix E(5) for text). 201 Id. at paragraph 3. 202 J,d. at para. 5. 78 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS 3. International agreements directly impact a commander's options in operations. Status of Forces Agreements (See Appendices E(S) and E(S) for examples), Transit Agreements (TA) (See Appendix E(9) for an example), Technical Arrangements, and Acquisition and Cross\u00ad Servicing Agreements (ACSA) define a commander's ability to sustain the force, to include: Deploy across international boundaries (TA} Secure privileges and immunities for the force (e.g., criminal jurisdiction; taxes on incomes, goods, and services; civil liability; hiring practices, customs paperwork, etc.) (SOFA) Provide goods and services, on a reimbursable basis, to multinational partners (ACSA) Purchase and move logistics supplies without import/export fees (SOFA and TA) Operate independent mail and telephone systems (SOFA) Use government-owned facilities for free (SOFA) Improve infrastructure (SOFA) Hire local national personnel (SOFA) a. Account for LOGCAP personnel in all agreements. Whether LOGCAP personnel were covered by the various SOF As remained in doubt for much of the operation. While LOGCAP issues are covered later in this report, it is worth mentioning here that the status ofLOGCAP personnel, as a subset of civilians on the battlefield, is an issue ofmuch debate at the Department of the Army levels. Judge advocates should watch for doctrinal guidance in the future. 79 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 b. Expect difficulties with information flow on international agreements. Well-crafted agreements mean little if the lower level government employees do not get the word. For example, a TA allowing U.S. forces to move through Austria does not mean much to the uninformed customs official or border guard.203 Judge advocates should have copies of all necessary agreements for all key advance party personnel. This is particularly true since planning, deployment, and mission execution will likely occur simultaneously. c. Understand a host nation's legal and military cultures. Language barriers, definition of terms, and differing government and legal systems cause difficulty in implementing already concluded agreements. Judge advocates must educate themselves on these host nation practices. This is particularly true for the emerging Partnership F.or Peace (PFP) countries that have little experience in implementing SOFA or TAs.204 One example concerns claims. The PFP SOFA requires the host nation to investigate, adjudicate, and settle claims under their own laws. Judge advocates in Hungary, with little familiarity of the Hungarian legal system, had to quickly learn the system. d. Conduct SOFA training with PFP countries.205 Many PFP countries, just now emerging from the stifling bureaucracy of Soviet control, are unfamiliar with how a SOFA works (e.g., terms, conditions, responsibilities). These countries have very little experience in dealing with these complex issues. For example, taxes are a very politically sensitive issue in Hungary as they have only 203 See the European Conunand Legal Advisor's comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, 204 See LTC Pribble, remarks in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, vol. I.~ 20S Id. 80 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS dealt with taxes within the last seven years-since the end of the Soviet regime. For Operation Joint Endeavor, Hungary was the first PFP country to deal with thousands of deployed troops and civilians within its borders and the application of a SOFA to that situation. Lack of detailed U.S. knowledge about the way the Hungarian system operated made the situation more challenging. To reduce future problems, U.S. commands should train PPP countries on the terms and conditions of the PFP (NATO) SOFA and their respective responsibilities. This training would benefit the U.S. as well-judge advocates can learn about the various PPP government and legal architectures.206 D. JOINT MILITARY COMMISSIONS (JMCS) The most important lesson learned on JMC [Joint Military Commissions] . . .is the fact that we now know what a JMC is, and we have a fairly good idea on how to make a JMC work . .. 207 1. JMCs are critical to mission success in peace operations. A Joint Military Commission (JMC) is an assembly ofa commander, his or her chosen staff, and the military leaders with whom they are organized to interact. It is the commander's liaison mechanism to dea} with military and political factions, i.e. the Entity Armed Forces in Bosnia. The JMC is a body of commanders and staffs who work through meetings, liaison officers, and correspondence to coordinate military planning and operations, and to ensure compliance with relevant international agreements. In Bosnia, the JMC was a forum for military authorities to coordinate implementation of the military aspects of the GFAP. JMCs can be likened to the \"team 206 LTC Pribble and LTC Thompson, remarks in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, vols. I and II. ~ 207 COL David E. Graham, remarks in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 173. 'l) Prior to operation joint Endeavor, there was no doctrine or guidance on how to organize and utilize Joint Military Conunissions. OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 159. 'l) LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 81 village\" concept at the Joint Readiness Training Center.208 However, the JMC role and scope of operations is narrower, focusing on military and government leaders, organizations, and activities. The JMC was the key liaison and control mechanism for compelling compliance with treaty tasks209-the Task Force Eagle commander's \"key non-lethal peace enforcement tool\"210 and Task Force Eagle's focal point for compliance.211 It was a forum for military factions to coordinate their operations, a mechanism for IFOR to issue instructions and guidance to its own forces and to factions, and an arbitrator of entity disputes.212 See The Former Warring Factions and Their Competing Strategic Goals at Appendix B. a. JMC organization and structure. Operation Joint Endeavor saw JMCs organized at each command level from division through battalion. In 1996, the Center For Army Lessons Learned published a detailed guide on the initial setup ofJMCs.213 At each level the local IFOR commander served as the chairman. The commander chose his JMC staff separately or from existing staff. Local commanders from the three different Entity Armed Forces (EAFs) served as JMC members to represent the Army of the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina or Bosnian Croat Defense Council (HYO), and the Republika Srpska (RS). 208 See CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS, THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S SCHOOL, U.S. ARMY, TACKLING THE CONTINGENCY DEPLOYMENT: A JUDGE ADVOCA TE'S GUIDE TO THE JOINT READINESS TRAINING CENTER, 243-248 (24 Dec. 1996).

The Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) was the land component command for IFOR. The ARRC did not establish a completely separate JMC staff. It used existing staff sections and members, to include the ARRC commander, G3 Plans, a political advisor (a British civil servant), the legal branch, the media operations branch, a faction liaison (a Brigadier General, one field grade officer, and two interpreters), and a specially appointed JMC Secretariat. Unlike Multinational Division North (MND-N, discussed below) SFOR did not have an attorney assigned full time to the JMC.214 (2) Division. Task Force Eagle's JMC section was comprised of a former Brigade commander, majors and captains from the G-2, G-3 and SJA sections, and foreign area officers {FAOs). It was organized into a Chief ofthe JMC, a noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC), an operations and administrative section, and a faction LNO. There were also desks and liaison officers (LNOs) for each subordinate IFOR brigade and a desk and group of Joint Commission Observers (JCOs).215 The JMC mission in Joint Endeavor subsumed a full time judge advocate.216 The JMC personnel did not 214 Interview with MAJ Kurt Mieth, SFOR Legal Advisor's Office, at Sarajevo (2-23 Feb. 1998) [hereinafter Interview ofMAJ Mieth].~ 215 Joint Commission Observers (JCOs) were UK Special Air Service (SAS) troops and Royal Dutch Marines conducting direct liaison with the EAFs. They were a carryover organization from the united Nations Protective Forces (UNPROFOR). JMCs used them as LNOs to the EAFs. See CALL-JMC, supra note 209 at 23. 216 1st Armored Division's JMC JA member was Major Kevin Govern. He spent his entire 11\u00ad month tour working in the Task Force Eagle JMC. While some of his duties in the JMC were non\u00ad legal and perhaps attributable to \"mission creep,\" his pennanent presence in the JMC appears to have been both desirable and necessary. See OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 30-172. ~ Future missions may or may not require such heavy judge advocate involvement in the JMC. Also, as time has passed and mission functions have grown routine, the judge advocate's role in the JMC has diminished. By Jan. 1998, CPT Carrier, the MND-N JMC Legal Advisor, was able to summarize his duties in 6 bullets: Advise the JMC staff on Dayton, Vienna and Florence agreements Keep current on events by reading intelligence summaries and reports Monitor weapons seizures, destruction and returns Help draft and review JMC correspondence 83 LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 operate in a vacuum. Primary staffs (G-1 through G-6) and Personal/Special Staffs provided political and operational analysis and other support during JMC operations.217 (3) Brigade and battalion. The brigade and battalion commanders served as chairmen oftheir respective JMCs, selecting those members of their staff appropriate for JMC work. Entity Armed Forces (EAFs) sent commanders from the next higher level ofcommand. In other words, IFOR battalion level JM Cs had \u00b7 EAF brigade commanders as their counterparts, and IFOR brigade level JMCs had EAF division commanders as their counterparts.218 b. JMC tasks, functions, and duties. The role of the JMC is mission dependent. In Bosnia, where the peace enforcement mission called for dealing with numerous armed and political factions, JMCs were critical to mission success. Their functions and duties included: Treaty expertise Develop and disseminate policy Compliance (with military aspects ofpeace agreement) Track compliance Process EAF movement and training requests and monitor movement and training Document and record breaches ofPeace Agreement Address enforcement and compliance issue Help update JMC Policy and Planning Guidance Handbook 217 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 45. ~ 218 See Memorandum, LTC Jimmy M.

Note that force is not listed as a mode. This is because the JMCs were so effective at using the other tools of enforcement that demonstrations of force were not often needed. The judge advocate was intimately involved at all levels. Judge advocates organized meetings with EAF leaders.219 Judge advocates drafted or reviewed virtually every piece of correspondence that went to EAFs with commanders' signatures. They also personally conducted briefings to the EAFs in English and in their dialects, to explain compliance requirements and other issues. 220 2. Empower the JMC.

The creation of JMCs can be a specified or an implied task. The JMCs in Bosnia were a result ofthe General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP). 2191 ~ AD-AAR, supra note 145 at 46. \\Y 220 Id. at 47. 85 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 Annex IA of the GFAP defined the Parties' agreed-upon military responsibilities, set forth NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR) mandate rights and roles, formally created the JMC process as a forum for factions to coordinate operations, and defined the mechanism for issuing instructions and arbitrating entity disputes.221 On December 15, 1995, Admiral Smith, the Commander, Implementation Forces (COMIFOR), issued a Statement of Procedures (SOP) that further defined the implied military tasks and the JMC process. The SOP established the JMC as the central body for EAF commander coordination and problem resolution. The COMIFOR delegated routine JMC chairmanship to COMARRC. The COMARRC issued instructions to ensure the Parties' compliance with the GFAP's military aspects. Below the COMARRC level, the multi-national divisions (MNDs) and their subordinate brigades and battalions conducted \"subordinate military commissions.\"222 b. Empowerment ofthe JMCs. The creation of the JM Cs did not guarantee success. They were effective because they had direct aGcess to the commanders, had commanders chairing them and the meetings they hosted, and had an authority comparative to a chief of staff for performing factional liaison functions.223 They became institutions ofknowledge, expertise, and authority to which subordinate units, multi-national brigade liaisons, and EAFs looked to for guidance and assistance.224 At meetings commanders were the final arbitrators, not simply mediators.225 Task Force Eagle empowered brigade and battalion JMCs with broad authority. This worked so well that the ARRC and Task Force Eagle JMCs had to meet less frequently.226 221 GFAP, supra note 13, Annex IA, Art. VIII Appendix E(5) for text). 222 CALL-JMC, supra note 209 at 4. 223 IAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 46. ~ 224 CALL-JMC, supra note 209 at 21. 225 MAJ Kevin Govern, Remarks in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 158. ~ 226 See Id. at 164. ~ 86 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS 3. Train to do the JMC mission. JMC members, including the judge advocate, must train and rehearse. This training must be mission-focused and give examples of . what personnel will actually be doing. Inevitably judge advocates will be drawn into doing more than textbook legal analysis, and should be . 227so prepared. a. Area Familiarization. Key to effective JMC functioning at all levels was having persons with detailed knowledge of the people, the area, and their history-someone who knows the culture and the personalities well enough to personally liaison and to manage other LNOs. At Theater/Corps level, this person was called the Factions Liaison.228 Task Force Eagle (Division level) used foreign area officers and already-in-place Joint Commission Observers as area experts and liaisons. The judge advocate and other JMC members must be familiar with the operational setting as well-the geography, peoples, key leader personalities, cultures, language, and 29history.2. Without such knowledge, it is impossible to make effective use ofmeetings, correspondence, and LNOs. b. JMC Tool #1: Meetings. During its tenure alone, Task Force Eagle, I st Armored Division, held 11 large JMC Meetings (meetings between the commander and all three factions), 103 Bilateral meetings (72 meetings between the commander and a faction leader and 31 between the JMC staff or head and one faction leader), and numerous staffcoordination meetings.230 Effective meetings ofhigh level leaders required consideration ofmeeting location, transportation 227 See Id. at 157-174 for discussion ofthe many functions the lst Armored Division Joint Military Commission judge advocate performed. cri 228 OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 163-164. cri 229 OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 162. cri 230 MAJ Kevin Govern, Joint Military Commissions: The Task Force Eagle Experience, Remarks at U.S. Army Europe Operational Law Continuing Legal Education seminar (Feb. 1997). cri LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 87 to and from the meeting, site security, the physical facility, seating arrangements, translators, the agenda, media relations and releases, and more. Joint Military Commissions: Lessons Learned from Operation Joint Endeavor, by the Center for Army Lessons Learned, May 1996, is an excellent source of tactics, techniques and procedures for the conduct ofJMC meetings. Here are just a few ofthe lessons learned: (1) US/NATO/ Coalition commanders, from division to company level chaired the JMC meetings.231 An authoritative presence-the Commander-made JMCs work. (2) The meeting location must be hospitable to all parties. A \"neutral\" location in proximity to all parties, i.e. in the Zone of Separation, was viewed as best.232 For example, the first JMC meeting was held at a bombed out building which had a mural where the eyes ofthe portrayed people had been scratched out. The problem was the mural portrayed Bosniac-Muslim peasants doing normal things like farming. 233 (3) The U.S. Commander can bolster his power and authority by physical signs .during a meeting. Some techniques used included good security (armored vehicles, foot patrols, escorts), overflights ofthe meeting site by aircraft, and even a live demonstration of our aerial reconnaissance capabilities.234 (4) Reducing the agreed upon points to writing and having the members sign them prior to departing prevented future disputes over the outcome of the meeting.

JMC Tool #2: Liaisons. Joint Military Commissions relied heavily upon liaisons to the EAFs to track and monitor compliance, handle complaints, communicate with the EAFs, and develop a good rapport. Joint Commission Observers reported through command channels and received liaison and collection taskings from ARRC and Task Force Eagle levels. JMC chiefs \"overwatched,\" coordinating JCO efforts and ensuring their information was shared among staffs.236 Joint Commission Observers were a wealth of information for JMCs, knowing with whom, where and how to establish contacts with the EAFs. They also provided valuable political and in-country-information on government, local laws, personalities, and more. JCOs and other liaisons monitored and reported activity, especially at critical locations/hot spots. They verified troop activity and reported violations ofagreement. Liaison officers and observers were key to peace enforcement. They should be well trained in local language, culture, religions, etc., and must also have detailed political and operational awareness. 237 d. JMC Tool #3: Correspondence. (1) To Entity Armed Forces (EAFs). Correspondence to faction leaders clarified compliance issues (e.g. to tell them about weapons storage and handling requirements, prior notification of troop movements, etc.), address complaints, and raise compliance violations. Judge advocates were key in writing and reviewing these letters before they were sent to ensure they were in accordance with the GF AP and subsequent agreements.

School children should devote their time to activities which contribute to a peaceful future. Combat training is not one ofthose activities. Major General, USA Commanding (2) Within IFOR/SFOR Channels. Along more traditional judge advocate lines, judge advocates developed more than 50 information papers to clarify the GF AP and United Nations Security Resolution 1031. They also helped develop, review, and publish six editions (to date) ofthe Task Force Eagle JMC Standing Operating Procedures and the Task Force Eagle Policies, Procedures and 238 Likened to traffic tickets, though much more serious in nature. OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 169. ~ 90 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS Command Guidance Handbook (an approximately 40-70 page document giving the TF Eagle commander's intent and specific guidance on execution ofthe mission). (See extract of the JMC Handbook at Appendix K) The TFE Handbook was an outstanding way of compiling directives, policies and procedures issued to date in a user-friendly format. Any troop could pick up the Handbook, read the half-page section on the applicable topic, and know what to do. It is a model product for future operations, and can be credited for making many aspects of the mission as \"routine\" as possible in such an environment.239 \u00b7 E. THE ZONE OF SEPARATION (ZOS) Perhaps the intertwined lessons to be learned from the ZOS are the intricacies ofreducing a peace plan to physical geography and the need to develop and widely disseminate clear policies and procedures.240 The General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP) and its signatory Parties expressly created all of the demarcations depicted and discussed below. Refer to the Map at Appendix A(2) for a general illustration and Appendix E(5) for an extract ofthe GF AP. 1. Every operation will create new law derived from its unique circumstances: ZOS v. CFL v. IEBL v. AOT-The commander expects the judge advocate to know it. a. A CFL (Agreed Cease Fire Line). This is the line where the fighting stopped-\"a clear and distinct demarcation between any and all opposing factions\" according to the GFAP.241 The opposing factions (also known as the Former Warring Factions or 239 See Interview wit.11 CPT Christopher Carrier, JMC Legal Advisor, MND-N, at Tuzla (4 Feb. 1998). ~ 24 4> Tactical le--~ns learned on planning. establishing and controlling the ZOS are well addressed in Center for Army Le-.,sor.s Learned, Drawing a Line in the Mud, Newsletter No. 96-5 (May 1996). 241 GFAP, supra r.ore Appendix E(5) for text). 91 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 Entity Armed Forces, and as the Parties (to the GFAP)) included the Republic ofBosnia-Herzegovina (BiH), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (or Croat Defense Counsel, HYO), and Republika Srpska (YRS). b. IEBL (Inter-Entity Boundary Line). This is the line the Parties to the GF AP agreed to in Dayton. It approximates the ACFL, but has variances. The Parties literally pulled out a map and drew a line. Variances to this map-drawn line obviously had to be made once on the ground. A specified task ofIFOR was to mark the IEBL and the ZOS boundaries. Task Force Eagle Commander had the authority to approve adjustments of 50 meters or less, to preclude splitting homes, utilities and the like. Other requests were forwarded through the Joint Civil Commission for COMIFOR approval. When marking the IEBL, members from both entities (the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska) had to be present. The attempts to place a physical boundary between entities and peoples who occupied portions ofboth sides was often difficult. For example, a binding arbitration proceeding was held to delineate the IEBL vicinity the town ofBrcko in the northeast. Republika Srpska viewed Brcko as necessary to them because of its strategic location bisecting their two main regions and its proximity to a major river. At the same time, the Federation ofBosnia and Herzegovina viewed its overwhelming Bosniac population as grounds to draw the line to include Brcko on its side. Multinational divisions and sub-commands made sure their boundaries did not coincide with the Inter-entity boundary line to keep it from becoming a wall in the minds ofthe EAFs. c. AOT(Areas oftransfer). These are the areas where the ACFL and the IEBL differed. The areas enclosed by the two lines were to be turned over to the respective parties on a set schedule. By D+45 (February 3, 1996, where D-day was the day ofTransfer of Authority from UNPROFOR to IFOR), the Entities were to have 92 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS vacated the AOTs. At D+90 (March 20, 1996), the Entities were allowed to move into the AOTs they were assuming. d. ZOS (Zone ofSeparation). The ZOS was a zone extending two kilometers to either side of the ACFL at first, and then to either side of the IEBL once the AOT transfers were complete. When IFOR troops marked the ZOS boundaries, only a member from the entity on whose side the marking occurred had to be present. See Map at Appendix A(2). e. 10 km Reporting Requirement. The GF AP imposed a requirement on the EAFs to report the location and status of forces and equipment within 10 kilometers on either side of the Agreed Cease Fire Line to IFOR by D+30 (January 19, 1996).242 This was not, however, a designated \"zone\" or demarcation for any other purpose. 2. New law must consider all the parties involved: people and weapons in the ZOS-Former Warring Factions, Police, Civilians, and/FOR. a. Weapons. GF AP guidance on weapons within the ZOS was as follows: No weapons other than those of the IFOR are permitted in this Agreed Cease-Fire Zone of Separation except as provided herein. No individual may retain or possess any military weapons or explosives within this four-kilometer Zone without specific approval of IFOR.243 Within the Agreed Cease-Fire Zone of Separation, no individual may retain or possess any weapons 242 GF AP, supra note 13, Annex lA, Art. V, para. 2 (see Appendix E(5) for text). 243ld. at para. 2(b ). 93 LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 or explosives, other than a member of the IFOR or the local police exercising official duties as authorized by the IFOR in accordance with Article IV, paragraph 2(b). [above]244 The phrasing \"military weapons\" caused IFOR to question whether the GF AP impliedly created a separate category ofZOS-allowable weapons-civilian weapons. Eventually IFOR allowed the following: Civilians could have civilian weapons (bolt, pump and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns and single-shot pistols or revolvers) provided they registered them with the nearest police station and carried a permit. However, soldiers were not allowed to carry weapons in the ZOS, even with permits. Civil police could carry sidearms, but had to meet the requirements for civil police operating in the ZOS (addressed below). Army officers in the rank ofone-star General and above plus up to three bodyguards could carry sidearms while in the ZOS on IFOR business.245 IFOR/SFOR troops had authority to confiscate and subsequently destroy all military weapons and civilian weapons found in the ZOS without a valid permit.246 b. Entity Armed Forces (EAFs). At D+7 EAFs were to vacate and transfer selected positions along the ACFL. EAFs were to complete withdrawal of all forces from the ZOS by D+30. Task Force Eagle issued very specific guidance on how troops were to deal with 244 Id. at para. 2(c)(3). 245 SOP, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, subject: Amendment #2, Policy Guidance #2, para. 15 (23 Sep. 1996). cri 246 Id. 94 248 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS unauthorized faction weapons, units or soldiers in the ZOS (specific Rules ofEngagement). Detention ofEAF military members by task Force Eagle was almost always to verify movement approval at 247 An \u00b71\u00b7checkpoints and did not exceed a few hours. Ynn 1tary Personnel active or reserve who actually had their residence in the ' ' ZOS were required to register with the nearest IFOR command post. The GFAP permitted movement ofEAFs and their weapons through the ZOS with prior permission from and oversight by IFOR, for example, to allow movement to cantonment areas. c. Police. The GF AP specifically authorized civilian police to operate in the ZOS (see 2.a. above). However, IFOR forces were concerned about soldiers operating in the ZOS under the guise of police. The ARRC therefore issued guidance requiring civilian police operating in the ZOS to wear a distinctive uniform, carry an identification card, carry only a sidearm, and drive clearly marked vehicles. This guidance required !FOR to disarm individuals not meeting this criteria. Also, it required the entit~es to submit lists of authorized police to local commanders, specifically naming those designated for ZOS duty. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) was supposed to coordinate and monitor joint-entity police patrols for the AOT interim period. Because these were generally lacking and because the IPTF was largely ineffective, Task Force Eagle commanders were directed to gradually allow the AOT-gaining entities to assume police duties in the AOTs. d. Civilians. As previously stated, the ARRC created a ci~i.lian weapon exception to allow civilians with permits to carry non\u00ad mihtary weapons. However, the infamous \"silver bullet\" clause249 allowed !FOR ~orces to confiscate any weapon if they perceived a threat or potential threat. Additionally, the GF AP mandated that IFOR 247 IAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 23. ~ 24s GF AP, supra note 13, Annex IA, Art. IV, para. 3(b) (see Appendix E(5) for text). 249 ld. 95 LAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONSINTHE BALKANS, 1995-1998 disband all \"armed civilian groups\" 250 (broadly defined as two or more armed civilians) throughout BiH, not just within the ZOS. Otherwise, the GF AP imposed no real restriction on civilian movement through and in the ZOS. In fact, a GF AP stated goal was the resettlement of the ZOS and other areas. e. IFOR/SFOR. IFOR forces enjoyed complete freedom ofmovement throughout the ZOS. IFOR's mission was clearly stated in the GF AP-enforce GF AP provisions with regard to the EAFs and entities. This meant patrolling the ZOS to ensure EAF soldiers and unauthorized weapons did not permeate the ZOS, either overtly or under the guise ofpolice or civilians. Annex 6 (Agreement on Human Rights), Article I (Fundamental Rights and Freedoms) ofthe GF AP expressly stated \"The right to liberty ofmovement and residence.\" However, by the GFAP terms, assuring these rights was left up to the Parties, not IFOR. On October 15, 1996, the Office of the High Representative, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Police Task Force, IFOR, and the European Command signed the Procedure for Return and Reconstruction in the Zone of Separation, which set out procedures for resettling the ZOS. It tasked IFOR to \"ensure a secure environment\" within the ZOS. 3. Control ofan area means control ofthe terrain and the people on it. a. Marking and clearing the ZOS Years of war and scourge left areas in and around the ZOS dangerous and uninhabitable. The GF AP assigned responsibility for removal, dismantling and destruction of mines, equipment, obstacles, unexploded ordnance, demolitions and weapons to the responsible parties, not to IFOR. 251 IFOR monitored these removal, dismantling 250 ld. at para. 3. 251 Id. at para. 3(a). 96 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS and destruction operations. TFE directed the factions to wear orange vests and helmets while clearing mines. b. Checkpoints The issue of checkpoints arose within and outside the ZOS. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitution, Annex 4, specifically provides for freedom of movement and prohibits the entities from establishing controls at the boundary between the entities. However, IFOR did not have a mandate to enforce the national constitution. Absent any GF AP prohibition on roadblocks, they were allowed outside the ZOS. IFOR called upon the police to follow internationally recognized standards,252 such as no arbitrary arrests, no levying of tolls or taxes, and no discriminatory right of passage. They also required checkpoints with three or more police to have a permit stating location and duration. Initially no checkpoints were allowed within the ZOS. By October 1996, however, requests by all sides for checkpoints within the ZOS led the International Police Task Force (IPTF) to establish IPTF/Federation (international) police checkpoints. c. Resettlement ofthe ZOS The GFAP provided that \"All refugees and displaced persons have the right freely to return to their homes oforigin,\"253 and \"The parties shall take all necessary steps to prevent activities within their territories which could hinder or impede the safe and voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons. \"254 The Procedure mentioned in paragraph 2.e. above provided that returnees who trespassed or could not establish the right to property under the Procedure (an interesting issue in itself given the prior lack of a clear private property scheme) 252 s _ee, e.g., G.A. Res. 217a(III), U.N. GAOR, 2d or 3d U.N. (Umversal Declaration ofHuman Rights). 2s3 GFAP, supra note 13, Annex 7, Art. para.

It did not go so far as to say they would be violating the GF AP. F. WEAPONS CONFISCATION AND CONTROL ISSUES Confiscation and control ofweapons was one ofthe most important and imposing challenges that faced IFOR troops on first arriving in Bosnia. The first concern was controlling the military factions and their weapons. The focus then shifted to the police forces, often a guise for active and former military, and later to the civilians. By February 1998, there was still some confiscation and destruction of weapons, but far fewer than before and mostly from civilians without 1255.

Missions were derived from the General Framework Agreement for Peace. Given the peace enforcement nature ofthe mission, weapons control was critical. a. Task Force Eagle (TFE) derived specified and implied tasks from the military aspects ofthe GFAP, which included: Enforce a permanent cease fire Establish and mark the Zone of Separation (ZOS), Military Boundary Lines, and other specified locations in which the Parties256 must withdraw their forces 255 See Interview ofLTC Vowel~ supra note 146 <l); and Jacobson supra note 164. <l) 256 ''The Parties\" refers to the three Entity Armed Forces (formerly known as the Former Warring Factions}-the Republic ofBosnia-Herzegovina (Bill or B-H), the Federation ofBosnia and Herzegovina or the Croat Defense Council (HYO), and the Republika Srpska (RS). 98 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS On order, compel removal, withdrawal or relocation of any forces and weapons posing a threat or potential threat to IFOR Observe, monitor, and inspect Parties' military forces and facilities. Supervise heavy weapons withdrawal, demobilization and the Parties' removal of obstacles and explosive hazards b. TFE also derived specified and implied tasks for the Parties, which, among others, included: Conducting cease fire operations, to include: (I) No positioning forces forward of established Cease Fire Lines (CFLs), the Zone of Separation (ZOS), and other TFE designated areas (2) No firing ofweapons or explosives, except per the agreement (3) No additional mine, barrier or protective obstacle emplacement Allow TFE to observe, monitor and inspect military forces and facilities Conduct TFE and GF AP-directed heavy weapons withdrawal, demobilization and obstacles and explosive hazards removal c. The GF AP had very specific guidance on weapons, especially heavy (to include air defense) weapons. (1) After D+ 120 all the Parties were to withdraw all heavy weapons and forces to cantonment/barracks areas or other approved sites, which were subject to IFOR inspection. EAFs had to declare and report weapons and personnel to !FOR. EAFs bad to demobilize forces which could not be accommodated in the cantonment/barracks areas. The GF AP did not allow forces with long\u00ad barreled or automatic weapons outside the cantonment/barracks areas 99 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 except for training approved in advance by IFOR/SFOR or for IFOR/SFOR-approved \"special duties.\"257 (2) \"No weapons other than those of IFOR are permitted in this Agreed Cease-Fire Zone of Separation except as provided herein. No individual may retain or possess any military weapons or explosives within this four kilometer Zone without the specific approval of the IFOR.\"258 (3) The following GFAP language was the key to IFOR's execution of the mission: \"IFOR has the right and is authorized to compel the removal, withdrawal, or relocation of specific forces and weapons from, and to order the cessation of activities in, any location in Bosnia and Herzegovina whenever the IFOR determines Forces, weapons or activities to constitute a threat or potential threat to either IFOR or its mission, or to another party.\"259 Often called the \"silver bullet\" clause, it gave IFOR forces broad powers to act and implement rules and requirements felt necessary by individual units and commanders. The GF AP did not mandate IFOR to confiscate or destroy unauthorized weapons-those not properly stored, reported or open to inspection. This \"silver bullet\" clause, however, made confiscation and destruction a viable implementation tool for commanders to use. Placing a silver bullet clause in future agreements could be the key to mission success.260 257 GFAP, supra note 13, Annex 1-A (Military Annex), IV, para. 5 (see Appendix E(5) for text). J,d at para. 2. 259 ,,'d. at para ..6 260 See OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 21-22. ~ 258 100 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS 2. Consider all possible parties, locations, weapons, and situations when developing guidance on weapons confiscation and control The first two operations, Joint Endeavor and Joint Guard, saw written and verbal guidance given almost daily on weapons control (use, storage, inspection, reporting), confiscation, and disposition (hold, return, destroy).261 The changing and developing situation, or mission creep/flux, necessitated much of this. While this can never be totally avoided, the judge advocate on future missions can help the commander give more detailed guidance up front. This would help avoid responding to situations as they arise by considering the variety of situations and issues that arose in Joint Endeavor and exercising forethought. In developing guidance on weapons control and confiscation, judge advocates and commanders must consider the types ofpeople, weapons systems, and locations involved. The specifics, below, show how detailed the thought process must be. a. Parties involved. Joint Endeavor saw four types of personnel to consider: military, special police, police, and civilians. Because the GFAP addressed heavy-to include air defense-weapons in detail, most questions arising concerned small arms. (I) Military (the Parties). The GF AP and IFOR recognized the need for EAF military to train to maintain proficiency, and so had to accommodate that need while still fulfilling the peace enforcement mission. COMARRC (Commander, Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps) Policy Guidance Number 11 addressed individual weapons and EAF training. It prohibited armed individual soldiers or armed military groups outside barracks, except: (a) Participation in a notified and approved training, exercise or live fire; 261 By~~~\u00b7 1998~ disannam~nt ofEAJ'.s and police was infrequent and most weapons seized were from ClVlhans without penmts. Interview ofMAJ Kurt Mieth, SFOR at Feb. 1998). ~Interview ofLTC Salata and MAJ Jacobson, supra note 164. ~ ' \u00ad101 LAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONSINTHE BALKANS, 1995-1998 (b) Participation (without live ammunition) in a local ceremony; (c) Division commanders and above could carry sidearms and have three bodyguards with sidearms, as long as all were in uniform and on official duty; and, (d) Military police could carry sidearms, as long as all were in uniform and on official duty. To conduct training or an exercise, EAFs had to notify TFE five days in advance, get their approval on a case by case basis, and separate weapons and ammunition while traveling between sites. (2) \"Special Police\" (Military ofInterior Police). The GF AP considered the Military ofInterior Police, or \"special police,\" to be \"Forces\" under the GFAP. They therefore were subject to the same terms as the EAF forces-withdrawal to cantonment/barracks areas subject to inspection, weapons and personnel declaration and reporting to IFOR, and no carrying of long\u00ad .barreled or automatic weapons except for authorized training or IFOR\u00ad approved \"special duties.\" Thus, while performing regular duties, they could only carry sidearms. For the recognized \"special duty\" of guarding !FOR-approved sensitive government and military installations, special police had to submit to the joint Military Commission (JMC) a list of all locations at which they wanted armed guards and indicate which they wanted to guard with long barreled or automatic weapons. They could patrol only up to 50 meters outside the perimeter. The long barreled and automatic weapons, when approved, had to remain within the perimeter and could not include tripod\u00ad mounted heavy machine guns. 262 (3) Police. Control ofpolice weapons was key because police were often a subterfuge for military forces. In addition to the IFOR conventional forces, civilian police had another body to 262 Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, SOP 826 addressed \"special police\" or \"MUPs.\" 102 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS work with-the International Police Task Force (IPTF). The IPTF helped formulate policy for police use ofweapons.263 The COMARRC and IPTF policy authorized police in MND (N) (Task Force Eagle's sector) to only carry sidearms. Unless approved by IPTF, police on foot, in patrol cars, or at checkpoints could not carry shotguns or automatic rifles. When permitted, IPTF would issue a written permit to the police officer commanding the operation stating the quantity and type of weapons authorized. Otherwise, they were to be kept at police station armories. The police could not use, handle, or store military\u00ad type weapons (AK-47s, Skorpion and UZI-type automatic weapons, were examples cited by TFE) in any way. \u00b7 (4) Civilians a. \"Armed civilian groups.\" When the Parties signed the GFAP, they committed to disarming and disbanding all armed civilian groups. The GF AP did not define \"armed civilian groups,\" but the IFOR Commander's Statement of Procedures defined them as, \"A group of two or more nonmilitary personnel in possession ofweapons.\" In this sense weapons meant any sort of weapon in a civilian's hands. This policy applied throughout Bosnia, not just within the ZOS. Policy letters and memorandums during the operation told commanders to exercise discretion in applying this definition. For example, hunting was a permissible activity and two (legitimate) hunters together were not really an \"armed civilian group\" requiring disarmament. b. Individual civilians. IFOR looked to local BiH law for guidance on possession of arms by individuals. Civilians could keep bolt action, pump, or semi-automatic rifles and shotguns and revolvers or single-shot pistols. All of these privately owned weapons had to be registered at the nearest police station and civilians had to 263 . See th~ section on Police issues, which addresses the IPTF and other police concerns, such as the remfiltratmg of armed EAFs under the guise ofpolice officers. 103 LAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONSINTHE BALKANS. 1995-1998 have a permit with them when in possession of a firearm. Military\u00ad type weapons were not authorized, even for \"hunting.\" As in most other aspects ofa peace enforcement mission, actions must be tempered by the overall intent and desired end-state. Thus TFE expressly stated that they were not there to disarm Bosnia,264 and therefore house-to-house searches were not to be done unless operationally necessary.265 IFOR did, however, view searches ofhomes within the Zone of Separation as sometimes necessary. During the resettlement effort, EAFs literally blew up and burned many homes to prevent members of opposing ethnic backgrounds from moving in. Based on informants, IFOR searched homes for explosives and weapons. The NORDPOL Brigade lawyer made good use ofpreventive law. He used waiver/consent-to-search forms whenever an occupant would sign them. After completing the search, he had the occupant sign a form stating there was no damage nor missing items on the departure of the SFOR troops.266 SFOR initiated a major effort to get civilians to voluntarily disarm in 1998. It ran from February 19 through March 26, 1998. It was an amnesty program that SFOR developed and the Entity governments and police implemented.267 c. /FOR andNGO Civilians.

The EUCOM plan and USAREUR Regulation 690-9 provided that the USAREl!~ ~ommander. could authorize the issuance ofweapons to DOD c1v1hans deploymg to Bosnia.268 Emergency essential DOD civilian employees were issued government sidearms if they received training in accordance with military regulations and standards (e.g. Field Manual 23-35). NGO personnel normally were not to be armed and, under the GF AP's terms and the Rules ofEngagement, were subject to search. IFOR personnel were to inventory and report any confiscated NGO weapons to higher headquarters through military police channels. b. Locations. Just as laws and rules varied depending on who was being addressed, they also varied by location. (1) Nonmilitary Installations. The IFOR issued specific guidance for armed security ofnonmilitary installations. The EAFs, police, and other host nation authorities had to notify IFOR of all nonmilitary installations with armed security, to include grid coordinates, description of the site, rationale for needing armed security, phone numbers for emergencies, and requests for long barreled or automatic weapons. They could not use mines, explosive device, booby traps, heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, or anti\u00ad tank weapons, or arm civilians. (2) The Zone ofSeparation. See separate section on the ZOS. (3) Manufacture, Importation, and Movement of Weapons. In addition to accounting for existing weapons, IFOR had to address the issue ofnew weapons, either manufactured in country or imported. Article III (Regional Confidence- and Security-Building Measures) to Annex IB (Agreement on Regional Stabilization) to the U.S. DEP'T OF DEFENSE AND ARMY MOBILIZATION AND OPERATIONS PLANNING AND EXECUTION SYSTEM (AMOPES), DIR. 1404.10, EMERGENCY ESSENTIAL DOD CITIZEN CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES, APP. 3 (CIVILIAN PERSONNEL) TO ANNEXE (PERSONNEL) (10 Apr. 1992). 268 105 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 GF AP prohibited importing arms, but only for a 90-day period from the entry into force ofthe annex (until May 30, 1996). It also prohibited importing the following for 180 days from entry into force: heavy weapons or ammunition, mines, military aircraft, and helicopters. One judge advocate opined that movement ofarms from one HYO pocket through Croatia into the other pocket was not a violation of the agreement. He noted that this movement did not violate the intent of the agreement, which was to prevent introduction of additional weapons. The GF AP did not prohibit the Parties from manufacturing weapons, ammunition, and explosives. However, a declaration ofproduction facilities had to be turned in to IFOR by July 5, 1996, detailing location, items produced, production capacity, storage capacity, and whether armed guards would be used. c. Weapons Types (1) Air Defense and Heavy Weapons. Paragraph 5(a) (Phase III) ofArticle IV (Redeployment of Forces) of the GFAP, required the EAF s to concentrate, secure, and store all \"heavy weapons\" in approved storage sites by 120 days after the transfer of authority to IFOR. The GF AP defined \"heavy weapons\" as all tanks and armored vehicles, all artillery 75 mm and above, all mortars 81 mm and above, and all anti-aircraft weapons 20 mm and above. Separate approved sites were set up for Air Defense Artillery (AAA) systems. At one point Task Force Eagle had to clarify this definition because 14.5 mm anti-aircraft guns did not fall within the definition of \"heavy weapons,\" and could be stored at either approved AAA sites or approved Weapons Storage Sites. As of 18 April 1996, COMARRC guidance was to confiscate all AAA systems not in approved AAA sites, hold them for 30 days while notifying higher, then destroy them. A hard line was not taken on other weapons systems until October 1, 1996. 106 CENTER FOR LAW AND MIUTARY OPERATIONS (2) Mines. The GF AP Military Annex required the . ,,269 . Parties-not IFOR-to \"remove, dismantle or destroy a 11 IDines m the ZOS and areas to be transferred. Judge advocates helped commanders decline local national (other than the EAFs) requests for IFOR assistance in removing mines. However, judge advocates helped commanders develop incentives for the EAFs to do what the GF AP required-clear the minefields. For example, TFE approves or disapproves EAF training and movement requests contingent upon . . . 270EAF progress m counter mme operations. (3) Civilian Explosives. While it was clear what to do with military weapons and explosives, the unique issue arose of how to handle civilian explosives (e.g. for quarries, construction, etc.). TFE forces stopped five vehicles in April 1996, alone, each carrying about 9.5 tons of explosives. The TFE commander was legitimately concerned about possible wrongful use of these explosives. The judge advocates did their legwork, met with local officials, and discovered a system was already in place for issuing permits and bills oflading and obtaining police escorts for shipments of civilian explosives. They and the commander then worked with local officials to have the system enforced, and notified them that they would seize any explosives shipped in violation of local requirements. This was a good example of trying to work from within the country's existing system to further restore order in the spirit of the overall mission, while simultaneously ensuring force security. 3. Publish and disseminate clear and concise guidance on weapons confiscation and control . While military police channels were responsible for physically handlmg co!1fiscated weapons, the judge advocates were almost always 269 , 70 GFAP, supra note 2(d) (see Appendix E(5) for text). -TASK FORCE EAGLE, JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION HANDBOOK, CHAPTER 17 (COUNTERMINE OPERATIONS) (6th ed.12 Jan. 1998). 107 LAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONSINTHE BALKANS. 1995-1998 the ones to answer questions on searches, inspections, and confiscation of weapons. a. Determine what law or rules will govern search and seizure. The possible sources oflaw and rules governing searches and seizures for missions in other nations are too numerous to name. In the Joint Endeavor/Guard/Forge operations, IFOR/SFOR forces were fortunate. The Former Warring Factions all signed the GFAP, wherein they committed themselves to cooperate fully with and facilitate free and unimpeded access and movement for any international personnel.271 They also conceded to the IFOR the ''unimpeded right to observe, monitor and inspect any Forces, facility or activity in Bosnia or Herzegovina that the IFOR believes may have military capability.\"272 Note that the words \"believe\" and \"may\" set very low threshold standards for conducting searches and inspections. The fabled \"silver bullet\" clause273 lowered the threshold even more. These two provisions allowed the multinational force to justify the search of just about any persons or activities, as necessary. b. Give timely, clear, and specific guidance to ALL parties. (1) Giving Guidance. The policies on confiscation and control ofweapons changed frequently, due to unforeseen or unplanned situations and mission adjustments, or \"creep\". It was very important for judge advocates to continually seek clarification and inform the commanders ofpolicy changes. Rapid dissemination up and down the chain was essential. Sometimes the EAFs knew about changes before subordinate elements, creating embarrassing, and potentially volatile, situations.274 Another problem was keeping track 271 GFAP, supra note 13, Art. II, para.4 (see Appendix E(5) for text). 272 ld. at para. 6. 273 Id. 274 See OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 95-96. cri 108 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS ofall the policies in an easy to use fonnat. Task Force Eagle's Joint Military Commission published an extremely well organized, user friendly Policies, Procedures and Command Guidance Handbook. It summarized the commander's intent and gave very specific instructions on topics such as disbanding anned civilians and detaining personnel, destruction ofmines and munitions, destruction ofheavy weapons systems in the Zone of Separation, movement ofweapons and forces, and many other issues. See Appendix J for an extract of the JMC Handbook. (2) Disposition ofUnauthorized Weapons. Once it was clear what weapons were authorized, there were questions about what to do with unauthorized weapons. Initially, the Commander, TFE, pushed down the power to make decisions and set policies to brigade and battalion commanders. Gradually, higher headquarters declared set policies in an effort to demonstrate resolve and to make IFOR actions uniform, predictable, and not subject to complaints of unequal treatment by the EAFs. The Commander, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps' (COMARRC) policy was: any weapons found in the ZOS were to be confiscated and destroyed after 30 days; intentionally concealed weapons were to be confiscated, destruction at lower commander's discretion (except destruction ofheavy weapons required COMARRC approval); and unauthorized weapons due merely to poor administration or inefficiency by the factions could be moved to an appropriate site (did not have to be confiscated). In August 1996, the TFE Commander reserved to his level the discretion to return weapons and ammunition to EAFs and the discretion not to confiscate unauthorized weapons and ammunition. Henceforth, TFE commanders had no choice-they had to confiscate unauthorized weapons. Effective October 1, 1996, COMARRC also cracked down requiring IFOR troops to immediately confiscate and destroy weapons and ammunition found at unauthorized sites, with no appeal period. 109 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 Tracking confiscated weapons was a problem. Commanders must establish a clear system ofinventory, to include weapons destruction certificates, early on. While not exactly in the judge advocate's zone, this duty fell upon the Joint Military Commission (JMC) judge advocate's shoulders.275 G. LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES 1. Develop clear, mission-oriented standards for detention of civilian personnel. Although the GF AP did not specifically give IFOR the authority to detain civilians, IFOR derived such a power from the \"silver bullet\" clause of the Accords.276 The very breadth of that clause, however, made specific guidance more vital. Therefore the NATO OPLAN had a legal annex that, among other things, spelled out the rules regarding detention. The plan correctly noted that NATO was not a party to an international armed conflict, and hence detained personnel were not ~nemyprisoners ofwar. 277 The plan required IFOR to tum over any detained person to local officials as quickly as practicable, and 275 See Memorandum. CPT Christopher Carrier, MND-N JMC Legal Advisor, to Executive Officer, 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment, subject: Resolving Confiscated Weapons Inventories (24 Nov. 1997) and Memorandum. CPT Christopher Carrier, MND-N JMC Legal Advisor, to Executive Officer, 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment, subject: Resolving Confiscated Weapons Inventories, (8 Dec. 1997) (address the problems he faced in getting units to report).~ 276 Called the \"silver bullet\" because it creates an expansive justification. GF AP, Annex 1 A, Art. VI, para. 5, reads, \"The Parties understand and agree that the !FOR Commander shall have the authority, without interference or permission of any Party, to do all that the Commander judges necessary and proper, including the use of military force, to protect the IFOR and to carry out the responsibilities listed above in paras. 2, 3 and 4, and they shall comply in all respects with the IFOR requirements.\" (The paragraphs referred to herein set forth the IFOR responsibilities in very broad terms, and even include an open end by acknowledging that the NAC may add more terms.) 277 See HAITI AAR at 53-56 for discussion ofmaintaining law and order and handling hostile persons when the law ofarmed conflict does not strictly apply. ~ 110 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS mandated a legal review for anyone who was held for more than 72 hours.278 Specific IFOR guidance reminded soldiers that they could detain civilians where those civilians obstructed friendly forces, interfered with the mission, or committed a serious crime in the presence of IFOR. The JMC Handbook defined this last category to include any act or omission \"which does or could reasonably be expected to cause serious bodily harm to civilians, non-belligerents or IFOR personnel.\"279 Soldiers were reminded to exhaust other available means before detention, to treat detainees humanely, to tum them over to military police at the earliest opportunity, and that the senior soldier present had the authority to release any detainee.280 Counter-surveillance efforts were a common cause of detention of civilians. Soldiers often detained and questioned civilians who were seen sketching, photographing, or videotaping IFOR base camps. Although such activity was generally an innocent act of tourism, commanders appreciated the broad authority to prevent such potentially dangerous activity.281 278 NATO OPLAN, Operation Balkan Endeavor, Legal Annex, 2.m (2) and (3).

Develop clear, mission-oriented standards for detention of military (Entity Armed Forces) personnel. Another difficulty in the detention arena was distinguishing civilians from Entity Armed Forces (EAFs) military personnel.282 For EAF personnel, the most important issue requiring a detention decision was the subject's presence in the Zone of Separation (ZOS) after the redeployment period.283 The standards for handling military personnel were essentially the same as for civilians: humane treatment, brief detention, and rapid turnover to the military police. The military police would, in turn, hand the detainees over to local authorities. 284 In addition to the general desirability ofmilitary personnel avoiding police duties, the lack of facilities also encouraged only brief detentions. The only detention site available in the Multinational Division North (MND-N) sector was one built by the military police, which could accommodate three persons. In one instance, a group of Bosnian Federation soldiers purporting to be from Croat forces were found well beyond the Zone of Separation (ZOS) and detained at a \u00b0Tactical Operations Center (TOC).285 In one case, the rapid return-to-local- authorities policy proved to be discordant with overall strategic policy. As many have noted, one of the difficulties of a multi-entity federation is that the local authorities may be a hostile force to the detainees. 286 In the most notorious occurrence, seven Bosnian men (the \"Zvornik Seven\") turned themselves in to IFOR troops in Republika Serpska territory. They were 282 MAJ Zolper, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 87. ~ 283 GFAP, supra note 13, Annex IA, Art. IV (see Appendix E(S) for text). 284 IAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 22. ~ 285 Id. at 23. ~ Unlike the case from Zvornik that follows, they were escorted back across the ZOS and returned to their own forces once their true identity was detennined. 286 See, e.g., LTC Fucci and MAJ Zolper, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 87-88. ~ 112 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS quickly turned over to the local authorities.287 Those authorities . proceeded to torture confessions from several ofthem. After. a year m Prison they were tried and convicted. Three of the seven ultimately . ' . 288received twenty-year pnson sentences. 3. Beware a nation's police forces-often they are as potent and influential as the military. The constitution ofBosnia-Herzegovina, agreed to as part ofthe GFAP, includes the \"right to liberty ofmovement and residence\" as one ofthe fundamental rights of the people.289 The GFAP envisioned a multi-ethnic Federation where refugees who had been \"ethnically cleansed\" from their homes because they were in the minority could return to their historic residences. A critical part ofthe IFOR mission, then, was to ensure that the dispossessed could return home once the armed groups left or IFOR removed them from the Zone ofSeparation. 287 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 22. ~ 288 The men had been residents ofSrebrenica, site ofa large \"etlmic cleansing\" ofBosnian Muslims by Bosnian Serb forces in the summer of 1995. See Indictment ofDrazen Erdemovic, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (22 May 1996). On 10 May 1996, they approached a U.S. artillery platoon, claimed they had been recently fired at, and surrendered. The men were in violation ofthe Dayton Accords because they were a group that was armed: they carried five knives, two pistols, and a couple of hand grenades among them. Within two hours they had been handed over to Serbska police in Zvornik. Later-they claimed after they were coerced by beatings-three confessed to murdering four missing Serbian woodcutters, and the other four confessed to helping dispose ofthe bodies. In the intervening time an American patrol had been sent to the police station to retrieve the men, but had been turned back by hostile Serbian crowds. See Tracy Wilkinson, LOS ANGELES TIMES, 24 May 1996. See also Alex Ivanko, Transcript ofIFOR Press Briefing, Sarajevo Coalition Press Information Center, 18 May 1996 (confirming IFOR 's view that the men had been beaten, and that they were on the list ofthose missing from Srebrenica, but finding also some \"peculiarities\" in their overall level ofhealth and grooming when taken with their story that they had survived for the last ten months in the woods). At the eventual trial the defendants were not permitted to have attorneys from the Federation; during the two-day trial their Serbska attorneys \"spoke only briefly.\" See Amnesty International News Release, Bosnia-Herzegovina: Amnesty International Condemns Unfair Trial of\"Zvornik Seven\" (24 Apr. 1997). For an observation that the presence ofa judge advocate at the relevant headquarters might have prevented the entire incident, see LTC Christopher Maher, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 59. ~ 289 GF AP, supra note 13, Annex 4, Art. II, para. 3(m). 113 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 The immediate difficulty for the refugees in exercising this right was the EAF's use of a system of checkpoints that began during the war as a method to control civilian movement. Local police and the Interior Police, often subterfuge organizations for military members,290 were the \"bullies\" behind most of these restrictive checkpoints. However, from the earliest days of the operation, IFOR recognized that there were some legitimate reasons why the entity governing bodies might need to use checkpoints, at least for short periods.291 For example, local truckers often tried to move through Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina under the guise of transporting SFOR freight, thereby illicitly gaining Status of Forces Agreement protection and avoiding legitimate taxes, fees, and inspections. (Efforts would range from simply painting \"SFOR\" on the side of their vehicles to forging documents.) Thus our forces had to develop a coherent approach to handling the checkpoints. Judge advocates played a key role in resolving this complex situation. As U.S. forces came across checkpoints, they turned to their attorneys' advice to evaluate their options based on an application of the rules to the particular situation. Sometimes IFOR allowed the checkpoints to remain; sometimes IFOR removed them. The reliance on the judge advocate's advice was the consistent theme among these types of issues.292 Eventually IFOR issued guidance requiring any checkpoint of two or persons in operation for more than 30 minutes to have documented IFOR approval. IFOR could detain violators and 290 See Interview ofL TC Vowell, supra note 146. ~ 291 TASK FORCE EAGLE, JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION, POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND COMMAND GUIDANCE HANDBOOK 6 (2d ed. 12 May 1996). ~ (\"Police forces are only authorized to establish checkpoints to control/stop criminal activity or for legitimate purposes\". The handbook goes on to list a few of those legitimate purposes, including traffic direction, temporary road closure, and reaction to life threatening emergencies). 292 See, e.g., Information Paper, CPT Matthew D. Ramsey, Operational Law, First Armored Division, subject: Proposed Language For Frago Allowing Police Checkpoints In The ZOS (20 Oct. 1996) ~and Information Paper, CPT Mark Tellitocci, Assault Command Post judge advocate, 1st Armored Division, subject: Check Points By Local Military And Police Personnel (24 Jan. 1996). ~ 114 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS seize their weapons and roadblock equipment. Whether IFOR could detain police at illegal roadblocks was a divisive issue. The Joint Military Commission viewed it as dangerous and inflammatory. The command decided to allow detentions necessary for force security or fulfillment of the mission, but no \"punitive detentions.\"293 One high profile situation was the Republika ofSrpska (RS) imposed \"road tax\" over the Brcko Bridge. RS police manned the \"toll\" station. All parties recognized and agreed that, by terms of the new constitution among other authorities, only the country as a whole-the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH), not the individual entities--could charge transit fees or visas. In response, the RS devised a \"road tax.\" This so-called \"road tax,\" however, was remarkably disparate along ethnic lines. It charged nothing for vehicles with RS or Yugoslavian plates, 200 DM for foreign registered cars, 500 DM for foreign trucks, and 50 DM for Slovenian vehicles. Judge advocates and attorneys at all levels-TFE, SFOR, the United Nations Office of the High Representative, and the International Police Task Force--concluded the tax was illegal because it was excessive and discriminatory, violated BiH Constitutional provisions on freedom ofmovement and equal treatment within BiH, and provisions allowing only the Federation, not individual entities, to establish visa and immigration policy.294 The High Commissioner's office told the RS to dismantle the toll station or face action by the IPTF and IFOR to close it down. 293 Memorandum, CPT Christopher Carrier, JMC Legal Advisor, subject: Carrier's Greatest Hits Poland, A Review of Key Documents (20 Jan. 1998). cr> 294 This issue developed back in Aug. 1996 and was still unresolved as of 21 Aug. 1997, when Ambassador Gerd Wagner of the Office ofthe High Representative wrote an ultimatum to Madame Biljana Plavsic, President ofthe Republika Srpska, and Mr. Gojko Klickovic, the Prime Minister. Because there was some question whether the RS tax may have been legal under Chapter VI of the Law on the Roads ofRepublika Srpska (1995) entitled \"Road Toll and Roads Financing,\" attorneys ~t all levels examined the issue and reached agreement before acting. There are numerous materials m the CLAMO OJG-AAR database addressing this issue. Cl) 115 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 4. Reforming a nation's police force is essential to reestablishing a sound peace. Part ofthe peace process for Bosnia-Herzegovina was the creation of an International Police Task Force (IPTF) under U.N. auspices. The IPTF did not have a mission to be the nation's police force: rather, they were to serve as observers and advisors to the governments of the entities as they established their own effective police forces. 295 As with all other international organizations, the resolution of the IPTF requests for support required resolution by judge advocates. IFORjudge advocates and other soldier-lawyers in the theater helped the IPTF with its organization oflocal police units and with determinations oflawful possession ofweapons. Judge advocates also helped determine what logistics and personal support, such as access to pontoon bridges and base camp Army & Air Force Exchange Services, that IFOR would provide to the IPTF.296 One additional and critical piece of support for the IPTF was part of the basic IFOR mission: the ability to regulate the size ofthe local police forces.297 Two disquieting facts motivated the IFOR 295 Information Paper, CPT Tellitocci, subject: International Police Task Force ( 19 Jan. 1996).

The first was the concern that many of the demobilized military personnel of the entities would simply be reclassified as police and used to carry on the war at a lower level.298 The second was the way in which the police forces had themselves become an instrument oflawbreaking, especially by mistreating members of minority ethnic groups in their region.299 In order to make the local police an agency ofprogress toward peace rather than a hindrance, IFOR delegated authority to the brigades to limit local police size and to register them by name.300 H. WAR CRIMES 1. Anticipate war crimes to pervade many oftoday's conflicts. The conflict in the Former Yugoslavia has been and remains a political, military, and legal quagmire. No issue has combined all three factors in a manner that interested the general public more than war crimes. Violations of the law ofwar occurred on all sides of the conflic~. The nature of the barbaric acts alleged subjected military and political leaders to extensive media scrutiny and, therefore, intense public interest. Ethnic hatred-based conflicts are ripe for war crimes. In June 1991 conflict broke out between forces loyal to the Muslim-led government and forces loyal to the concept of a Bosnia Serb Republic. These Serb forces were comprised offormer Yugoslav 298 Memorandum, CPT Tellitocci, for ADC(M}, subject: Controls of Civilian Police in the ZOS (23 Jan. 1996). ~ 299 See U.N. Sec.

The large\u00ad scale attack, conducted with armored forces and small arms, followed an uprising by a group ofabout 150 non-Serbs that had wrested control from the Serbs. In re-taking control ofPrejidor, Serb forces advanced street-by-street, ejecting non-Serbs from their homes, mistreating them and, in most cases, killing them. Serb forces herded most that were not killed, especially surviving men who were able to escape the onslaught, into deplorable conditions in concentration camps at Keratem and Omarska, where most eventually were tortured and killed. On July 13, 1992, the Security Council adopted Resolution 764, which reaffirmed that all parties to the Yugoslav conflict must comply with international humanitarian law, particularly the 1949 Geneva Conventions. It also stated that all persons who commit or order the commission ofgrave breaches of those conventions are individually responsible for war crimes. 302 This had no practical effect and continued allegations ofwidespread torture and killing prompted the United Nations Security Council on October 6, 1992 to ask the Secretary General to establish a Commission of Experts to investigate the alleged war crimes.303 The Secretary General established a five member Commission that began investigating allegations in November 1992. 301 UNITED NATIONS FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSION OF EXPERTS ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 780, to the President ofthe Security Council 29-33, U.N.

In response, the Security Council on February 22, 1993, decided to establish an international tribunal to prosecute the offenders,304 called the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). On May 25, 1993, the Security Council, acting pursuant to Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, formally established the tribunal and enacted the tribunal's constitutive statute.305 On February 11, 1994, pursuant to Article 15 of the statute, the eleven appointed judges of the newly established Tribunal adopted rules of procedure and evidence.306 For the world, the GF AP held the promise of progress toward resolution of four years of intense fighting and senseless killing. For international lawyers, the establishment of the ad hoc tribunal signaled the potential for the first international war crimes trials since those that followed World War IL Two fundamental questions remained, however. The first question was purely a legal one-whether this court actually had jurisdiction over the alleged offenses. The larger question revolved around how this tribunal, without an international police force or its own enforcement powers, might bring war criminals to justice. 304 S.C. Res. 808, U.N.

Seek the specific legal authorities that address war crimes andjurisdiction over the war criminals. The rules of international law that apply in conflict vary depending on whether the conflict is international or internal in nature. While this distinction is important in several respects, it is most important in terms of this discussion because the concept ofindividual responsibility for grave breaches ofhumanitarian law does not extend to internal armed conflict. While a general duty exists among the parties to suppress violations of humanitarian law, no specific duty exists to punish individuals responsible for the commission of such violations.307 Stated simply, in order for the tribunal to acquire jurisdiction to try individuals for \"grave breaches\" such as willful killing, torture, or willfully causing great suffering, it would first have to make a determination that the conflict was international and not internal in nature. While space precludes this report from examining each aspect of this question, the Commission of Experts concluded that \"the character and complexity of the armed conflicts concerned, combined with the web of agreements on humanitarian issues the parties have concluded among themselves, justify an approach whereby [the Commission] applied the law applicable to international armed conflicts to the entirety of the armed conflicts in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.308 In reaching this conclusion, the Commission placed great emphasis on a series of agreements entered into by the principle parties to the conflicts. The United Nations admitted these parties to membership in the United Nations by resolutions adopted in May 307 See generally preliminary remarks of the International Committee of the Red Cross to U.N.S.C.

ICTY Paper, supra note 307, at 54. 120 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS 1992.309 The Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Republic of Croatia, entered into a series of agreements brokered by the ICRC. In the Croatian conflict for example, the parties agreed to apply the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I in their entirety.310 Included in this agreement were provisions concerning individual criminal responsibility for grave breaches. Agreements concerning conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, however, were less extensive and, while they provided for punishment of violations, they excluded the concept of individual criminal responsibility.311 Despite the determination of the Commission, the applicability and enforceability of these agreements remains in doubt. The few decisions rendered by the Tribunal have failed to shed much light on the issue ofthe enforceability of the agreements. Neither, unfortunately, has the Tribunal resolved the question ofjurisdiction as it relates to the nature of the conflict. In its August 1995 decision on defense motions contesting the jurisdiction of the court in the case versus Dusan Tadic, the Tribunal made no finding regarding the nature ofthe armed conflict in question. Rather, the Tribunal took a much narrower approach, holding that the requirement ofinternational armed conflict does not appear on the face of Article 2, which confers subject matter jurisdiction to prosecute grave breaches ofthe Geneva Conventions.312 The foregoing does not assert that judge advocates need to know the nuances of the international justice system or the intricacies of 309 G A R es. 236, 237 and 238, U.N.

It does illustrate that topics such as the Law ofWar and the Geneva Conventions, which many believe are inapplicable or outdated, remain as important as ever--even in peace operations. 3. Guidance on handling persons indicted for war crimes (PIFWCs) must be specific and tied in with the Rules ofEngagement. By using the Security Council to establish the Tribunal, the U.S. and other participating U .N. members agreed that \"war crimes\" were a direct violation of international law, and the Tribunal could try these cases. The parties to the Dayton Peace Accords agreed to \"cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law.\"313 What qualifies as \"cooperation\" is subject to debate. The Tribunal issued its first indictments in November 1995. Initial guidance with respect to TFE's policy on detention ofwar criminals came in the form of an information paper issued by the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, TFE, on February 6, 1996.314 This information paper summarized IFOR guidance dated January 10, 1996. It also contained information distributed by the tribunal itself, as well as that given by the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. The Task Force Eagle Staff Judge Advocate and legal staff received copies of the original indictment and made arrangements with the Tribunal to receive all forthcoming indictments. Of immediate concern to TFE legal personnel were requests from local civilian officials to receive copies ofthe indictments. \u00b7Though the indictrrients were technically matters ofpublic record and had been distributed, media outlets were damaged greatly by the conflict and news simply 313 GFAP, supra note 13, Art. IX (see Appendix E(5) for text). 314 Information Paper, Staff Judge Advocate, Task Force Eagle, subject: Policy Guidance on Detention ofWar Criminals (6 Feb. 1996). cri 122 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS was not getting out. Citing policy reasons, TFE legal personnel, in a memorandum to the Commander, TFE, recommended against distributing copies ofTribunal materials to local officials. Their rationale was simple: the Tribunal is a civilian organization, and enforcement and liaison should be a civilian police concem.315 This memorandum further explained who had been indicted for what and clarified Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) Rules of Engagement (ROE) relating to indicted war criminals. The ARRC ROE provided the following guidance with respect to indicted war criminals: Detention of persons indicted by the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia with whom IFOR comes into contact in the execution of their assigned tasks is permitted. It is emphasized that the UNSCR does not task either the detention of or search of such persons indicted for war crimes [by the Tribunal]. IFOR should detain indicted persons, but only if they come into contact with such individuals in the execution of assigned tasks and the situation permits detention.316 Initial TFE guidance echoed this position. Essentially, TFE personnel were authorized to detain indicted war criminals (but only those indicted by the Tribunal) and would do so only in accord with an ROE matrix which provided authority levels for such detention. While authority for detention was unrestricted, the policy dictated that mM . emora~dum, Staff Judge Advocate, Task Force Eagle, to Commander, Task Force Eagle, subject: Indicted War Criminals (no date). \\l) 316 Allied Rapid Reaction Corps Rules of Engagement, Fragmentary Orders 5 and 6. cri In reality, S~?Rforces were proactive in securing some PIFWCS, such as the former Chief ofPolice in PnJedor. 123 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 \"reasonable efforts should be made to coordinate with TFE Main prior to detention.\"317 Other guidance included the use of \"common sense and prudent judgment when assessing the appropriateness of detaining an IWC [indicted war criminal],\" and the proviso that PIFWCs would be detained only when encountered by TFE personnel in the \"regular course of duty.\" Only minimal force could be applied to affect a detention or prevent escape. Deadly force was authorized only ifthe PIFWC committed a \"life threatening hostile act or demonstrate[ d] life threatening hostile intent.\"318 Further provisions were made for interrogation, rights warnings, reporting to TFE and higher headquarters after detention, and coordination with the Joint Military Commission. Judge advocates should direct legal determinations of appropriate support to the International Tribunal, the policy advised, to SHAPE HQ via HQ IFOR Legal.319 ARRC SOP 285 provided further guidance when it was revised on May 13, 1996. These revisions to the ARRC SOP provided additional details on reporting, restraint, detention, and transfer of PIFWCs. While TFE soldiers were still authorized to detain PIFWCs and directed to do so when they encountered them in the execution of assigned duties, the level of force allowed in doing so was restricted: \"use of deadly force is not authorized to prevent the escape of a detained war criminal. Use minimal force to recapture, and deadly force is only authorized in self-defense.\"320 317 Infonnation Paper, Staff Judge Advocate, Task Force Eagle, subject: Policy Guidance on Detention ofWar Criminals (6 Feb. 1996). cri 31s Id. 319 Id. 320 Headquarters, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, Standing Operating Procedures 285(13 May 1996), as reflected in Infonnation Paper, Staff Judge Advocate, Task Force Eagle, subject: Policy Guidance on Detention of War Criminals ( 19 May 1996). cri 124 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS This seemingly incremental shift in the use of force, the greatly exacerbated procedures after detention, and the requirement that \"the t d\"321 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 b 11 coord' detention of indicted war cnmma s must e we ma e created a policy and procedure that turned into a public relations nightmare. While much of the world community b~lieved all al?n? that all coalition forces should make the apprehension ofwar cnmmals a priority, U.S. military leaders asserted, for justified and very principled reasons, that we could not do so. While this policy was questioned, it did not create a furor. The seeming shift in policy, evidenced by the new ARRC SOP and its beefed-up reporting requirements before detention, however, did cause a furor. Whether justified or not, the world community now perceived our policy to detain only \"in the course of assigned duties,\" combined with greater restrictions on the use of force, and the increased reporting requirements, to constitute a \"look the other way\" approach. This view may have been justified. Several judge advocates related conversations with personnel conducting missions at guard posts who, after recognizing PIFWCs, advised those PIFWCs to stand fast while the soldiers advised headquarters of a possible detention. The effect, intended or otherwise, was to provide the PIFWC the opportunity to leave the area with the soldier unable to use any other than minimal force to apprehend if he or she even bothered to attempt to do so. Despite these criticisms, the basic policy (Rules of Engagement) with respect to apprehension ofPIFWCs did not change during IFOR. IFOR issued subsequent guidance regarding the Tribunal but changes related mostly to logistical support which TFE personnel could provide to the Tribunal and its personnel. A July 15 1996 information paper 322 ' ' ' for example, provided guidance relating to TFE support to International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) 321 I fi . p n ~rmation aper, Staff Judge Advocate, Task Force Eagle, subject: Policy Guidance on Detention of War Criminals, para. c ( 19 May 1996). ~ 322 Inti . p o~tion . a~r, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Task Force Eagle, subject: Supporting International Crurunal Tribunal for the Fonner Yugoslavia (I 5 Jul. 1996). ~ 125 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 investigative teams such as life support, emergency assistance, helicopter reconnaissance, and security considerations. The paper also delineated types ofsupport not allowed, including guards, direct escorts, investigation of graves, and witness protection. The Joint Military Commission provided the last piece of formal command guidance to IFOR TFE personnel in October 1996.323 Again, while !FOR remained authorized to detain PIFWCs by the Tribunal, they could not conduct manhunts, and no changes were made to the ROE applicable to detention. 4. Judge Advocates will be actively involved in the capture and handling ofpersons indicted for war crimes (PJFWCs). Opinions varied by nation as to what should be SFOR's role in handling Persons Indicted for War Crimes (PIFWCs). The NORDPOL Brigade viewed hunting down PIFWCs as an obligation. The United States viewed PIFWC apprehension as outside the scope ofour mission. NATO's position, the controlling view, has been to detain war criminals in the execution ofassigned tasks if the tactical situation permits. It is as ambiguous or flexible a statement as the U.S. makes it. Prior to the summer of 1997, neither IFOR nor SFOR made any effort to go hunting for them. In fact they went out of our way to avoid them. On one occasion, when IFOR forces knew that a war criminal was in a building that they were going in, they waited a half an hour to go in the building-until they knew he had left. Since then SFOR troops have been involved in several detention operations, resulting in many PIFWCs captured and one killed. Judge advocates have written the contingency plan for what happens when SFOR detains a PIFWIC. After detention, a judge advocate accompanies the detainee to the tribunal and ensures proper transfer of TASK FORCE EAGLE, JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION, POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND COMMAND GUIDANCE HANDBOOK (3d ed. 20 Oct. 1996). ~ 323 126 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS custody to the tribunal. Each PIFWC going to the Ha~ue was accompanied by a judge advocate. They serve SFOR interests by protecting against possible allegations of wrongdoing. On July 1 O, British SAS commandos seized two indicted Serb war criminals at the northern Bosnian town ofPrijedor (one of who pulled a pistol, fired on the British, and was killed). The legal advisor was closely involved in the planning and implementation of this operation. Pursuant to that plan, two U.S. judge advocates helicoptered north to the U.S. base at Tuzla to meet with the surviving PIFWC to supervise the reading ofhis rights and the indictment, take witness statements from the SFOR troops, and tum him over to the ICTY representatives for immediate flight to the Court at The Hague, Netherlands. This incident precipitated a series of Serb small arms and grenade attacks on several isolated SFOR outposts (mostly Civil Affairs and Intelligence detachments). While SFOR personnel suffered some casualties, no one died. Two weeks later a Croat appeared at a Dutch outpost in the central Bosnian town of Vitez at about midnight, saying he had committed war crimes and thought he might be on the non-public list ofPIFWC. The Dutch checked with their higher headquarters, the British Sector HQ (Multinational Division Northwest at Banja Luka), but were told the man was not on any list. The next morning the judge advocates went to the Sarajevo ICTY office to brief them on the incident. After checking with The Hague, they discovered that the man had indeed been indicted and by an oversight did not appear on the lists provided to SFOR or the ICTY office in Sarajevo. As the man indicated he would return, and the Dutch had retained some documents he had brought, an ICTY investigator and the judge advocates went to the Dutch outpost and stayed for four days, until the Dutch dismantled and closed it. Unfortunately the PIFWC never showed up. The Dutch and SFOR were criticized in the press for \"letting a war criminal get away,\" but all had acted in accordance with law and agreements. Liaison with ICTY was improved after this and succeeded in getting a 127 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 complete list of indictees at HQ SFOR in Sarajevo for immediate reference should such a situation reoccur. U.S. judge advocates were later involved in planning for a mass surrender of ten to twelve PFWICS from the Vitez area in early October, but at the last minute they decided to transport themselves to Croatia (outside the SFOR area of operations for detention ofPIFWCs) and surrender to the authorities there before being flown to The Hague by ICTY personnel. I. JOINT, INTER-AGENCY AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION 1. Use judge advocate technical chains to augment information flow. Command information normally flowed through the command group or G3 operations, to a unit's commander or S3, then to the various staff sections. Time delays and poor dissemination, however, caused a lag to judge advocates, who then lacked sufficient knowledge to advise the command. Judge advocates developed and fully exercised their technical chain of communication-talked to each other-up, down, and laterally. Judge advocates addressed operational law issues in information papers (with copies going to all judge advocates, multinational brigades and key staff officers), emails, and in a compiled format-the Joint Military Commission (JMC) Policies, Procedures and Command Guidance Handbook.324 Commanders did not mind judge advocates using their technical chain to share information. They often appreciated receiving critical information through it more quickly than through command channels. In addition, some commanders felt more comfortable with their judge advocate's advice knowing their judge advocate had sought guidance from the next higher commander's judge advocate, beforehand.325 3'4 ~ -See See OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 108-110. (!) 128 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS 2. Judge advocates must include all unified components in their technical chain communications. Operations in Bosnia involved judge advocates from many nations and levels ofcommand. Judge advocates in the U.S. division, MND-N, essentially had two technical chains of command. See Organizational Charts at Appendix D. SFOR was the theater force headquarters in Sarajevo, while United States Army Europe (USAREUR) was the administrative headquarters in Germany. MND\u00ad N judge advocates would report to SFOR first, and then coordinate with USAREUR where appropriate. 326 The IFOR/SFOR Headquarters in Sarajevo, multinational divisions, and the supporting units had judge advocates from American, British, Russian, Norwegian and Swedish troop units, and from NATO joint and combined headquarters. Language and different approaches to legal issues were obstacles to bridging the technical gap among these judge advocates. Resolving coalition legal issues required translators and common approaches and solutions to legal issues. Task Force Eagle's StaffJudge Advocate bridged the gap by using translators, weekly meetings with Troop Contributing Nation judge advocates, and legal specialist \"work exchanges.\"327 Task Force Eagle also chose a judge advocate as the liaison officer to the 3rd UK Armored Division for a period.328 . 326 S I . ee nterv1ew ofLTC Salata and MAJ Jacobson, supra note 164. ~ 321 l AD-~ supra note 145, at 24-25. ~ These work exchanges included reciprocal visits between enlisted legal personnel from various troop contributing nations. 328 lAD-AAR. supra note 145, at 59. ~ 129 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 3. Prepare to provide or coordinate legal support to sister services.319 . Army judge advocates provided legal assistance, foreign and personnel claims, administrative law, and criminal law support to the United States Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy as follows: Legal assistance to hundreds ofMarines that were part of an aerial observation unit Legal assistance to over 500 airmen at Tuzla Air Base Base operations (administrative law) to the Air Force in Tuzla, BiH and Taszar, Hungary (the Intermediate Staging Base) Legal support to two Marine Corps' (JAGMAN section 0208) investigations of aircraft crashes. Processed foreign claims (e.g., for the Marines, damage to roads and fields) and personnel claims (e.g., for the Air Force, lost laundry) Criminal law jurisdiction issues. While UCMJ authority remained within service lines, Army judge advocates played a critical role in coordinating military justice for sister services. For example, a Navy servicemember was attached to a Naval unit in Italy, reattached to an Army unit in Bosnia, and loaned to a NATO unit in Sarajevo. In \u00b7this example, Army judge advocates had to determine who could impose UCMJ punishment, track his orders, and find the appropriate Navy Personnel Service Support for answers. These efforts were in support of the sister service judge advocates that were in place. For example, an Air Force judge advocate from Aviano, Italy flew to Taszar, Hungary, monthly. 329 E-mail message, 10/23/98 7:43am, from Mr. (Formerly Captain) Anthony F. Febbo, to MAJ John W. Miller, subject: Re: Hi (on file with CLAMO). 130 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS 4. The Internet created new judge advocate technical channels. Judge advocates repeatedly touted internet access to be an invaluable resource. Aside from the numerous website resources, judge advocates used the Internet to ask questions of subject matter experts in the JAG Corps located at The Judge Advocate General's 330 School, Charlottesville, Virginia, the Pentagon, and elsewhere. 5. Judge advocates at all levels had to communicate with both government and non-government agencies and organizations. For example, the Joint Military Commissions existed down to the battalion level and required judge advocates to communicate with Entity Armed Forces (Former Warring Faction) leaders, local officials, the International Police Task Force, local police, and more. Situation awareness, political savvy, communications skills, and patience were key to ~eaningful communications that furthered the mission. Consider one judge advocate major from the Office ofthe Legal Advisor at IFOR/SFOR headquarters in Sarajevo, for example. He liaisoned with the U.N. Mission, the U.N. Office of the High Representative, the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OCSE), the International Police Task Force headquarters, the Pope's staff for the papal visit, and local officials such as the President ofthe Constitutional Court ofBosnia and Herzegovina and the Minister ofJustice ofBiH. He represented SFOR in two cases before 330 See Interviews with CPT Paul N.

Judge advocates drafted many letters to EAFs to explain compliance requirements, raise noncompliance issues, and address complaints. Joint Commission Observers (JCOs) helped overcome the lack ofcommercial mail and phone systems by making face-to-face contact, using tactical satellite (TACSAT) communications and acting as couri~rs. Judge advocates personally conducted briefings to EAF members and attended Joint Military Commission, bilateral, and work coordination meetings with EAF members. Quick, accurate dissemination ofguidance and response to questions made it easier and more desirable for EAFs to comply.333 The Joint Military Commission (JMC) was the key method oftying the EAFs to IFOR and SFOR. J. INFORMATION 0PERATIONS334 The multinational force recognized the need for the coordinated and synchronized use ofinformation activities to successfully implement the peace plan. Accordingly, IFOR/SFOR launched an information campaign. This campaign had three components: A Public Information campaign to bolster NATO's credibility with the media and to garner support from the troop contributing nations 332 Memorandum by MAJ David C. Rodearmel, 153d LSO, SFOR Legal Advisor, subject: After Action Report (21Mar.1998). ~ 333 See lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 46-47. ~ 334 See PASCALE COM BELLES SIEGEL, INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES, NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY, TARGET BOSNIA: INTEGRATING INFORMATION ACTIVITIES IN PEACE OPERATIONS (Jan. 1998).

Coordination mechanisms for the information campaign existed at IFOR/SFOR headquarters, the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) during !FOR, and at Task Force Eagle. Two key IFOR/SFOR information coordination mechanisms were the CJ3 (operations) information operations cell and the Combined Joint Information Campaign Task Force (CJICTF). The ARRC had several information coordination mechanisms which included a daily Information Coordination Group meeting. Task Force Eagle used an Information Coordination Group to plan its information operations. Judge advocates participated at each of these meetings. I. Be prepared to participate in information operations working groups. 337 While the term information operations is a relatively new term with an evolving definition, judge advocates were key players in information operations meetings.

Information operations (IO) require planning and broad expertise-use IO planning cells where appropriate. One example of what may be considered an information operation was SFOR's response to the Entity Armed Forces' use of media broadcasts that the international community perceived as an obstruction to the peace process. Before the 1997 elections, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) viewed EAF use ofstate-owned media (television and radio stations) as an attempt to undermine free and fair elections. The OHR asked the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) to intervene. SACEUR then tasked SFOR to develop courses ofaction. The SFOR CJ3 information operations cell developed various courses of action. SFOR legal advisors participated in every one ofthese planning or decision meetings. At the same time, these legal advisors worked with SHAPE to develop the rules of engagement for the various courses of action. Complex issues regarding electronic jamming capabilities, possible collateral damage, and mission requirements demanded detailed coordination. 134 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS K. CIVIL AFFAIRS 1. Become involved early with civil affairs units. Like other recent deployments, civil affairs units, primarily hailing from the reserves, extensively supported operations. Because these units do not have a habitual relationship with the active component unit they find themselves supporting, the civil affairs units easily slip out of the main effort, and their effect as a combat multiplier \u00b7 for the supported unit is lost.339 An additional difficulty is that their technical channels will generally include lawyers.340 As their actions are under the authority of the supported commander, however, the commander needs to be accustomed to checking out the missions with his own judge advocate. Judge advocates at all levels need to cultivate a relationship with their commander that will lead him to tum immediately to them when legal issues present themselves.341 Soldiers in civil affairs units, by virtue of their mission, often believe. that they have both the duty and the authority to resolve claims based on the activities of U.S. forces. This caused frequent concerns because they sometimes made representations to local claimants that 339 LTC George B. Thomson (Ret.), comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 40 (\"they tend to become free agents, uncontrollable, out there in heart ofdarkness land operating on their own\"). cr> 340 In addition to the judge advocate positions within the civil affairs structure, many of the soldiers are attorneys-indeed, some are Department of the Army Civilian attorneys-in their full-time occupations. See COL Joseph A. Russelburg, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 42. cr> 341 BG (now MG The Assistant Judge Advocate General) John D. Altenburg Jr., comments in OJE\u00ad AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 41. cr> The broader judge advocate community needs to work on establishing structural relationships with the civil affairs units. See COL David E. Graham, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I, at 43. cr> These relationships are already established doctrinally. See U.S. DEP'T OF ARMY FJELD MANUAL 27-100, LEGAL OPERATIONS, paras. 7-4, 8-14, and esp. ch. 11 (1991). Unfortunately, U.S. DEP'TOF ARMY FIELD MANUAL41-10, CIVIL AFFAIRS OPERATIONS (11 Jan. 1993) contains no overt requirement for civil affairs units to coordinate with the Staff Judge Advocate of units they serve with, even ifthe relationship is that of direct support. 135 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 were inconsistent with actual resolution of the matters by the claims service.342 Early coordination with these units can make lemonade of this problem, however. As one claims officer noted, civil affairs personnel have vehicles, translators, and contacts in the local commtinity. With .training and coordination with the office of the staff judge advocate, they could function as unit claims officers, investigating and reporting on the relative merit ofclaims. In this way, they become a vital part of the process while simultaneously being educated in the importance of withholding comment to the claimant until after the claims commission has made its decision.343 \u00b7 2. Build effective relations with governmental and non\u00ad governmental organizations (NGOs). Many international governmental and non-governmental organizations were critical components in the overall success of operations in Bosnia. In addition to elections support for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) (see paragraph 4., below), IFOR/SFOR assisted the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia with the excavation ofmass graves, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with refugee repatriation,344 and the International Police Task Force (IPTF) with the accomplishment ofits law enforcement mission. The International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) had sole responsibility for investigation of war crimes. IFOR 342 \"The civil affairs people see it as part of their mission to go out and do the hearts and minds thing. and that includes taking care of meritorious claims ....

Soldiers were to report such sites ifdiscovered. The ICTY could ask IFOR/SFOR to monitor them initially through observation points (OPs) or checkpoints ifthe ICTY suspected or discovered tampering of these sites. Although IFOR could not clear mines, provide transportation, or guard sites for the ICTY, they could provide a liaison team and life support at the nearest IFOR base camp. IFOR could also provide area military security to prevent military disruption of the I CTY by any party. 345 In the area ofrefugee resettlement, the General Framework . Agreement for Peace called for freedom of refugees who had formerly lived in the Zone of Separation (ZOS) to return to their homes.346 The local police forces had the duty of ensuring that the only settlers in the ZOS were legitimate former residents. The GFAP, however, gave IFOR the authority to evict those who illegitimately attempted to settle there. Therefore, although U.S. forces were not required to conduct this law enforcement function, the GF AP empowered them to do so. This enabled judge advocates to advise, and commanders to decide, on particular actions based on unit and mission concems.347 3. Establish ground rules for nation rebuilding. In the course ofpeace operations, numerous bits of technical assistance and advice will be given to civic officials of the host nation. Because much of the advice will center on legislative and judicial matters, units will rely upon their judge advocates for coordinating and providing such advice. In order to do so appropriately, judge advocates must stay in communication with the Political Advisor 345 TASK FORCE EAGLE, JOINT MILITARY COMMISSION, POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND COMMAND GUIDANCE HANDBOOK 25 (2d ed. 12 May 1996). <l) 346GFAP, supra note 13, Annex 4, Art.

Treat election support as an operation. Article IV of the GF AP announced that the \"Parties welcome and endorse the elections program for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\"349 Annex 3 to that agreement spelled out the program implementing those elections. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was the lead international organization for elections. The Provisional Election Commission (PEC) was directly responsible for the election rules and regulations. The Local Elections Conunission (LEC) was responsible for running the elections. IFOR/SFOR forces had the task of creating conditions for free elections. The OSCE, its Election Appeals Sub-Commission, the PEC and the LEC had the primary duties in running free elections. The IFOR/SFOR mission to create conditions allowing for free elections translated into U.S. forces providing security at elections sites and along routes to the polling stations and sites, and transportation to the polling stations. 350 This support required significant military police, civil affairs, and transportation support.351 There were many 348 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 29. ~ Occasionally, U.S. forces, especially judge advocates, will assist the nation's civil institutions merely by accomplishing their usual missions.

Ramsey, to ACofS G3, 351 138 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS elections-municipal elections in September 1997, the Serb national assembly in November 1997, and national elections. Task Force Eagle treated each election as a military operation. For example, Operation Plan Libra addressed the municipal elections. Before the support was rendered, the task force analyzed the mission and created an information paper and a slide briefing that outlined the duties and limitations that the soldiers had regarding the elections.352 A constant theme of those briefings was that soldiers had the right to prevent acts ofviolence around polling places, but that \"local election commissions (LECs) [were] responsible for protecting the integnty ofthe election process.\"353 Judge advocates were involved at every stage-reading, proofing, and preparing plans, orders, and annexes.354 Two reserve judge advocates in particular became critical to the success of the mission. One was the liaison from IFOR to the OSCE; the other orchestrated the civil affairs support for the elections.355 All judge advocates by virtue oftheir training and expertise, should expect to play key roles in advising connnanders about elections during similar operatiems. 356 subject: Office ofthe Staff Judge Advocate Election After Action Review Comments ( 4 Oct. 1996) (\"On 6 Jul. 1996, HQ ARRC Phase IV Directive identified support to the OSCE as the Corps' main effort.

Civilians and faction police falsified identifications and residency records, bused elderly and disoriented persons to the wrong polling stations, destroyed homes earmarked for occupancy by political minorities, and loitered in registration centers with weapons to intimidate voters. 357 One party official even made a public death threat to a specific OSCE representative.358 The Election Appeals Sub-Commission (EASC) of the OSCE took courageous steps in the face ofsuch danger to enforce free elections. Election Appeals Sub-Commission judges exercised their powers to strike members of offending parties offthe ballot, to totally prohibit a party from participating in an election, and to publish their stinging decisions in the local press and media.359 L. RELATIONS WITH THE MEDIA 1. Prepare for media interest in command decisions. As was true in other recent deployments, commanders and staff ~fficers had to include media considerations in their planning processes. This was true at all levels of the operation. SFOR took press releases so seriously that the staff would drop all other activities to react.360 Media operations became part of the core business of the Joint Military Commissions (JMCs). A preparation team consistently assessed the public relations effects of proposed JMC decisions.361 IFOR/SFOR planned and made press releases available immediately after key JMC meetings. This prevented attending parties from misstating or distorting the agenda and outcome of these meetings and won favor with the local populace. Judge advocates also integrated 357 See numerous rulings by the Election Appeals Sub-Conunission (EASC) cri 359 The GF AP: supra note 13, Annex 3, laid the framework for the Election Appeals Sub\u00ad Commission (EASC). 360 Interview with MAJ Mieth, supra note 214. cri 361 CALL-JMC, supra note 209. 140 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS press concerns into their consideration of issues, ranging from local police and EAF checkpoints362 to LOGPAC labor agreements.363 2. Train soldiers in dealing with the media. The U.S. extensively trained all soldiers to deal with and react to members of the press. This preparation was fundamental to the success ofoperations. The public affairs-created Soldier's Guide contained a list of eight clear, concise bullets to aid in \"meeting the media.\"364 The Joint Military Commission Handbook, one ofthe most useful documents produced in the series of Balkan operations to date and a 362 lnfonnation Paper, CPT Mark Tellitocci, subject: Check Points by Local Military and Police Personnel (24 Jan.1996). ~ 363 Memorandum, LTC Christopher M.

Accredited media will be escorted by public affairs staff or have authorization to operate in the area. Think OPSEC. When in doubt, call the PAO. 0 Listen to the question. Ifyou are unsure of a question, ask the reporter to repeat it or clarify it. Take time to think about your answer. 0 Be honest. There is nothing wrong with saying \"I don't know\" or I can't tell you.\" However, never lie to a reporter. 0 Stay within your responsibility or expertise. Just remember: ifyou command it, own it or did it, then talk about it. A void hypothetical questions. 0 Do not discuss classified or sensitive information. Ifyou're not sure if a topic is sensitive or classified, don't talk about it. 0 Anything you say is on the record. Assume everything you say will appear in print or on the air. \u00b0Keep your answers briefand to the point. Broadcasters will edit your 30 seconds ofcomments into a single 3-to 5-second sound bite. 0 Relax and be yourself. Reporters are interviewing you because of who you are you are; do not try to be anyone else. 141 LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 model for future operations, contained a similar section on dealing with the media. Finally, pre-deployment training included media training. Media training was the only category of training that USAREUR specifically required twice-it was taught at both the CO NUS Replacement Center (CRC) and at the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC), Hohenfels, Germany.365 Soldiers underwent three to five days of individual readiness training, which included STX (Situational Training Exercise) lanes on media. The resulting proficiency among the soldiers was a consistent source of praise for the deployment.366 M. FISCAL LAW Again and again, especially in operations other than war, everyone wants to drink from the . Fiscal and procurement law issues rear their ugly head any time support is proposed for our civilians, local civilians in the area of operations, other nations' forces, non-governmental organizations, and even ourselves. \u00b7 1. Develop, take, and have access to persons with fiscal and contract law expertise. Fiscal restraints travel with the money. 368 365 Memorandum, CPT Keith J.

Hancq, Deputy Chief, Contract Law Division, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, U.S. Army Europe, at Heidelberg, Germany (9 Mar. 1998) [hereinafter Interview ofMAJ Hancq]. ~ 142 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS One of the biggest lessons learned of the Balkan Operations is the heightened need for procurement and fiscal law expertise in a peace operation.369 Fiscal and procurement issues were the most pervasive and time consuming of sustainment issues, and perhaps of all three categories oflegal support to military operations (command and control, sustainment, and personnel service support). Some judge advocates estimated that they spent 75% to 90% of their time on . procurement and fiscal issues. 370 Many sources of funds exist in today's operations-Operations & Maintenance (O&M), Mobility Enhancement Fund, OMA, Humanitarian Assistance, and CINC initiative funds, for example. Finding the right funding source, determining that funding should come from other than U.S. dollars only, or justsaying no is a constant and challenging task. Contracting issues were as varied as the parties with whom our forces had to deal\u00ad local civilians, contractor-hired locals, other troop contributing nations, the United Nations, and more. The issues started from day one in theater with !FOR forces using CONEX shelters, vehicles, and other equipment that belonged to the United Nations Protection Forces.371 It is axiomatic that the obligation and expenditure of appropriated funds are subject to stringent purpose, time, and amount controls.372 In the freewheeling world of a peace operation, the 369 See, e.g., Interview ofLTC Vowell, supra note 146 ~.and Interview ofCPT Paul N. Brandau, Chief ofMilitary Justice and Administrative Law, 1st Armored Division (Fwd), at Tuzla (5 Feb. 1998) ~ 370 See, e.g., Interview ofMAJ Kurt A. Mieth, supra note 214, and Interview ofLTC Salata, supra note 164. (l) 371 A problem arose when a Brigade S4 signed a Temporary Possession Document for U.N. CONEXES. The CONEXES were \"relocatable buildings\" governed by U.S. DEP'T OF ARMY, REG. 420-18, which provides their purchase, regardless ofprice, must be approved by the Assistant Secretary ofthe Army, Installations, Logistics and Environment (ASA(l,L&E)). AR 420-18, para. 5-3c(4). Then there was the color-of-money issue-which funds could be used to acquire the CONEXES. See, e.g., Memorandum, L TC Harry L. Dorsey, to Judge Advocate, USAREUR (Fwd), subject: Purchase ofCONEX Containers from the U.N. (21Mar.1996) ~.and Memorandum, MAJ Paul D. Hancq, to Office ofthe Staff Judge Advocate, V Corps, subject: Temporary Possession Document (19 Dec. 1995). ~ 372 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301, 1341, and 1502(a), addressing purpose, amount, and time, respectively. 143 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 purpose requirement becomes a dangerous trap for well-intentioned commanders and staffs. During Joint Endeavor, three limitations in particular proved troubling for U.S. forces: morale programs, civil\u00ad humanitarian affairs, and the special rules regarding construction. In addition, the experiences ofthe LOGCAP contract and its contracted employees, as well as the tensions that arose from the cross-servicing agreements and other aspects ofmulti-national operations provided great opportunities for judge advocate excellence. 2. Centrally manage logistics support. Logistics support in the Balkan operations was multiple source: it came from Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contracts, the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP), acquisition and cross-servicing agreements, leases, host nation support, and more. Demands on these various sources were as diverse as the people making theni-units and commands at all levels, other troop contributing nations, and civilians. From the beginning ofany similar .operation, U.S. commanders must consider standing up a joint acquisition board to minimize confusion and duplication ofeffort and allow economies of scale.373 The committee should include the varied organizations and activities involved in the process of acquiring logistics. This committee should receive, manage, and coordinate all requests for logistics support. The use ofmultidisciplinary boards to deal with acquisition issues is a success story from Bosnia. Below is a useful example for planning future operations (the particular operation will dictate the appropriate number and level of committees).\u00b7 This is how one command used acquisition boards in Bosnia:374 373 See Interview ofMAJ Hancq, supra note 368. ~ See also, Operation Joint Endeavor Observation Forni, Task Title: Provide Supplies and Services for Theater Forces, Observation Number 4, Task/Air Number: ST 4.3.2 (15 Apr. 1996). ~ 374 See Interview ofCPT Brandau: supra note 369; Telephone Interview with CPT Paul Brandau, Trial Defense Service, Fort Gordon, Georgia (26 Oct. 1998); and Telephone Interview with LTC 144 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS Base camp commanders forwarded requests for logistics support through S4/G4 channels to the Base Camp Commissioning Authority (BCCA). The BCCA was located at Eagle Base in Tuzla. The BCCA could act on requests for support up to $2,500, inclusive. The Commander, Task Force Eagle, delegated to the Chief of Staff (CofS) the authority to act on requests for new construction or modifications (LOGCAP) between $2,501 and $25,000. The Commander, TFE could act on all non\u00ad LOGCAP requirements that did not exceed the Base Operations budget. The Chief of Staff could act or send the request to the Joint Acquisition Review Board (JARB). In most cases, the CofS sent the request to the JARB. The JARB would make recommendations through the BCCA to the CofS for action. The JARB included: Five voting members. The chief of the JARB (LTC), a logistics representative (L TC), a comptroller (CPT), a contracting representative (MAJ), and an engineer (MAJ). Two permanent non-voting members. The legal advisor (usually a CPT or MAJ) and a recorder. Various interested parties all without vote. For example, the requesting base camp or organization (e.g., G2, CA, etc.), safety team, and a Brown & Root representative USAREUR handled LOGCAP requests in excess of $25,000 (now up to $50,000) and those non-LOGCAP requests that exceeded the Base Operations budget.

Carefully watch spending, Scenario One: The R & R program. To maintain the morale ofJoint Endeavor soldiers high despite demanding work under difficult conditions, the command wished to establish a program based upon the DoD Directive authorizing Rest and Recuperation programs (R & R). Commanders initially intended to fly soldiers to recreation centers in Germany, paying for their food and lodging from appropriated funds. The same funds would pay for buses to take them back to their home stations, and pay for hotel rooms there if they had previously given up assigned quarters.375 The difficulty with this particular good intention is that the DoD Directive requires soldiers in the R & R program to be in a leave status once they arrive at the R & R site.376 Judge advocates had to inform the command that soldiers in a leave status accumulate only personal expenses, which cannot be paid for from appropriated funds. 377 The cost in congeniality among the staff for such advice was high.378 4. Carefully watch spending, Scenario Two: Winning hearts and minds. A second fiscal difficulty arises in peace operations because of the unusual intertwining ofmission-directed spending (including protection ofthe force issues) and humanitarian assistance (HCA) that 375 MAJ Paul D.

The judge advocates proactively advised commanders that most such projects were not permissible subjects for O & M funds.380 Some representative issues that arose are discussed below. Judge advocates must always consider the mission when analyzing what funds are available for an issue. IFOR/SFOR was not on a Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) mission. Thus movement of and support to displaced persons and refugees (DPREs) was a mission for UNCHR and non-governmental organizations. IFOR/SFOR was \"merely\" to provide a secure and safe environment C'. h . . . 3811or sue organ1zat10ns to operate m. Roads and bridges provided fertile ground for judge advocates to tighten the fiscal reigns. One commander wanted to pursue what seemed like a great idea-cost-sharing the expense ofrepairing 380 kilometers ofMSR road with Hungary. Proble~id the U.S. have an operational need for the work? Ifnot, we could not contribute. If so, we had to pay for it all, or risk violating the miscellaneous receipts 379 See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 40l(a) and U.S. DEP'T OF DEFENSE, DIR. 2205.2, HUMANITARIAN AND CTVIC ASSISTANCE (HCA) PROVIDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MILITARY OPERATIONS (6 Oct. 1994). Other than De Minimis activities, HCA activities require approval ofthe Secretary of State. HCA activities must promote the security interests ofboth the United States and the assisted country, the operational readiness skills ofthe participating armed forces, and the foreign policy interests of the United States. There are other limits, also, such as the HCA may not be given directly or indirectly to any individual, group or organization engaged in military or paramilitary activities.

Under terms of the GF AP, IFORJSFOR forces were to promote conditions for free elections. U.S. forces were tasked to provide security at polling stations and along routes to and from the polling station, and even to provide transportation. Unique issues arose, such as the purchase of donuts and coffee for the locals as a successful improvised force protection measure: Operation \"Dobro Donut.\"385 Other taskings were even further from the general mission, for example transporting polio vaccine for host national civilians. As in all settings, judge advocates had to analyze the situation and advise the command of courses of action that would accomplish the mission effectively without violating law or regulation.386 382 A detailed analysis of this issue was done by MAJ Paul D. Hancq, Deputy Chief, Contract Law Division, OJA, USAREUR. ~ 383 In MND-N alone, there were at least 20 A VLB bridges, 4 Bailey bridges, 9 ARRC bridges, and 2 float bridges. Besides the funding restrictions, there was also a directive by CINCUSAREUR requiring recovery ofall U.S. bridging assets at the operation's conclusion, whenever that may be. 384 This was the subject of some email traffic between MAJ Paul D. Hancq, Deputy Chief, Contract Law Division, OJA, USAREUR, and others. ~ 385 See Memorandum for Resource Management, subject: Operation Iron Donut (6 Oct. 1996) ~: During national elections, elements of2BCT conducted operation 'Dobro Donut' at the bus transload points in their area ofresponsibility. At these points, civilians were offioaded from their buses and searched. Besides being time consuming, the process was invasive. Donuts and coffee were provided to give the civilians something to do while being searched, and to quell their hostilities toward both the searching and TF Eagle soldiers involved in the process. The lack ofviolence at these 'feed and search' points speaks for the overwhelming success ofthis tactic. 386 That fiscal law lends itself to fact-specific determinations and individual exercises ofjudgment is demonstrated by the fact that a collection ofjudge advocates at the after-action review could not agree as to whether the NATO order directing the movement ofpolio vaccines could be 148 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS 5. Carefully watch spending, Scenario Three: Construction. As might be expected, the largest deluge of questions regarding fiscal law came from the construction area. Confusion often arose as to the distinctions between repair, maintenance, and construction especially when it came to work on existing roads and bridges. Engineers are useful in helping to make that determination.387 The obvious impact ofsuch a determination is what funds are available to support the project. Many of the problems arose when commanders and staff officers sought to use Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding for construction projects in the million-dollar range. When judge advocates reminded commanders and staff of the legal limits on their authority to spend funds for construction, they sometimes responded by stressing the need for the construction to accomplish their \"title 10 responsibility.\"388 It probably added to the confusion that during the course of the deployment the statutory ceiling for O&M use for construction was raised from $300,000 to $500,000.389 In an oversimplified view, this changed the three-tier \"structure\" of construction spending to O&M appropriations for $500,000 and less, Minor Military Construction, Army, for $500,001-$1.5 million, and specific approval through the Specified Military Construction Program (MILCON appropriations) for amounts over $1.5 million. accomplished without violating U.S. fiscal law. See the discussion at OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 231-235. ~(10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2551 was cited as authority to fund transport ofHumanitarian Assistance Program-Excess Property (HAP-EP) medical equipment purchased by the State Department with Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funding). 387 See the ternlS section ofU.S. DEP'T OF ARMY, REG. 420-10, MANAGEMENT OF INSTALLATION DIRECTORATES OF ENGINEERING AND HOUSING (2 Jul. 1987), and Memorandum, the Comptroller, Office of the Secretary ofDefense, subject ofDefinition for Repair and Maintenance (2 Jul. 1997). See also U.S. DEP'T OF ARMY, REG. 420-72, SURFACED AREAS, BRIDGES, RAILROAD TRACK AND AsSOCIA TED APPURTENANCES (21 Mar. 1991) (also helpful in discerning maintenance and repair from construction in these specialized areas). 388 MAJ Paul D. Hancq, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I, at 215. ~ 389 See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(c). The change was accomplished by Public Law 104-201 (1996). 149 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 One possible source ofconfusion was the citation in the 1995 Operational Law Handbook to a practice note regarding possible expansion ofpermissible uses of 0 & M funds during \"operational settings. \"390 More recent versions of the handbook remark-in successive footnotes-that this possible expansion is limited to \"combat operations,\" and that it is, after all, \"based on policy, not law or regulation.\"39 1. Judge advocates must stay aware of current law and use technical channels in complex fiscal issues. There is no operational exception to fiscal law in the construction area.392 6. Judge advocates should gain familiarity with the LOGCAP Contract. The Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) contract is designed to be a force multiplier by providing logistical support for the deployed force.393 Although it is generally perceived to work well, there remain some difficulties with performance under it to which judge advocates should be attentive. The primary (initial) problem was disunity of command. Without a centralized process for requesting logistics support, U.S. 390 OP. LAW HANDBOOK. supra note 194, at 12-4. 391 OP.

Because this authorization had only funded two projects between 1992 and 1996, Congress reduced the budget from the requested nine and one-half million dollars to five million dollars. To use these funds requires an authorization by the Secretary of Defense and a twenty-one day waiting period following notification to Congress, but it is an option in contingency situations. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804. 393 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at DEP'TOF ARMY, REG. 700-137, LOGISTICS, CIVIL AUGMENTATION PROGRAM (LOGCAP) (16 Dec. 1985). The Corps ofEngineers administers the contract. However, as one experienced judge advocate noted, units using the services provided by LOGCAP will want legal advice concerning the contract from their own contract attorney. Therefore, the deploying contract attorney should immediately get a copy of the LOGCAP contract, as well as the telephone number for the point of contact for administration. MAJ Susan Tigner, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 236. ~ 150 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS units yanked contractors from job to job. Besides being inefficient for work already contracted for, this added costs for those jobs that were not originally estimated for. The accessibility of the contractor meant that costs increased and productivity diminished because the contractor was frequently pulled from Project A and sent to Project B, which sometimes was unauthorized (a sort of \"mission creep\"). With no central authority to prioritize requests for logistics support, various commanders and senior officers in theater imposed their individual and sometimes conflicting priorities on Brown and Root.394 To administer the contract efficiently (to avoid unauthorized commitments), communication links were establish~d between the headquarters and the contractor, and units were told to seek LOGCAP support through the headquarters rather than going directly to the contractor. To enforce this from the contractor side, the unit made clear that it would not reimburse unauthorized work-that done at the request ofsomeone other than the designated point ofcontact.395 See Lesson Learned M.2. above for details. Other problems with the LOGCAP contract included inadequate management-Brown and Root did not have enough managers on the ground-and employees not willing to work holiday seasons despite offerings of more pay (this was much less of a problem after the onslaught of requirements the first year).396 394 Memorandum, Contract Law Division, Office ofthe Judge Advocate, U.S. Anny Europe, subject: Lessons Learned ( 17 Jan. 1996). ~See also Memorandum, MAJ Paul D.

Resolve the status ofcivilian contractors. Increased reliance on the support of contractor personnel, largely through the LOGCAP, necessitated an emphasis on the status of such personnel when negotiating the international agreements supporting the deployment. During Operations Joint Endeavor and Joint Guard, issues regarding contractor employees arose both in the former Yugoslav Republics and in Hungary, and they involved questions of entry and customs, registration as foreign corporations, and taxation.397 The resolution of these problems differed in the various parts of the theater. In Bosnia, U.S. forces argued that the LOGCAP contractor personnel were a \"constituent element\" of NATO forces, and had full exemption under the SOFA from any host national law.398 In Hungary, on the other hand, the demand for contractor compliance with host nation law was strong enough to cause the creation of a legal advisor position to the USAREUR liaison team.399 In response to Hungarian income tax claims, the contractor held five million dollars in escrow a,gainst asserted income tax liability. Ultimately, the Hungarian government refunded the money as a part of the Omnibus Agreement.400 397 Memorandwn, Contract Law Division, Office of the Judge Advocate, U.S. Army Europe, subject: Lessons Learned (17 Jan. 1996).

Issues that must be addressed include criminal jurisdiction, weapons carry and use, taxation, customs, access to/use of military dining facilities, the . PX, shelter/housing, medical care, legal assistance, and flights. For example, contractors were not supposed to eat in dining facilities unless their contract specifically provided for such support. Dining facilities cracked down, requiring contractor personnel to show proof ofeligibility to the chow line head counter.401 8. Designate a single point ofcontact for acquisition and cross-servicing agreements (A CSA). In a multinational setting, much ofthe logistical support is achieved through ACSAs. These agreements provide for reimbursable or reciprocal logistics support with other NATO nations, and other countries on coordination ofthe Secretaries ofDefense and State.402 ACSA \"orders\" are distinct from Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) ~\u00b7contracts.\"403 (See Appendix L for a list ofACSAs) Unfortunately, neither contracting personnel nor most judge advocates had significant training in ACSAs when Operation Joint Endeavor began.404 Task Force Eagle addressed this problem by designating a single point ofcontact for cross-servicing agreements during the operation.405 401 See Interview ofMAJ Hancq, 2341 -2350. 403 10 U.S.C. Chapter 138, Subchapter I provides the statutory basis for ACSAs. See ALSO DEP'T OF DEFENSE, DIR. 2010.9, REG. 12-16, ED 60-8, and UR 12-16. Note, however, that references in these sources to compliance with commercial contracting procedures are superseded by legislative changes dating back to FY 1995. FAR, DFARS, and AFARS principles are guiding as \"general principles ofprudent procurement practice\" but not mandatory in ACSA orders. 404 MAJ Susan Tigner, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 238. ~These agreements have subsequently become part ofthe curriculwn at Acquisition Law CLE's.

An ACSA is one such legal authority. The lack ofan ACSA can cause problems. For example, most all ofthe troop contributing nations working with the U.S. forces in MND-N had ACSAs with the United States. Russia, Romania and others did not. Thus, they were not supposed to use our dining facilities or receive any other support in kind. However, European Command-Supreme Allied Headquarters Europe (EUCOM\u00ad SHAPE) used a \"work around.\" They considered the EUCOM-SHAPE ACSA a basis for exchanging support with these nations as long as they would abide by the reimbursement terms ofthat ACSA and the EUCOM J4 and Legal Advisor approved. 9. Expect tension between U.S. law and multinational operations. The ever-present tension between mission requirements and fiscal limitations is heightened in multinational operations. In Bosnia, U.S. forces were under the operational control ofa multinational force headquarters (IFOR/SFOR). NATO sometimes assigned missions to U.S. forces that conflicted with U.S. fiscal constraints. Judge advocates must maintain a heightened awareness ofpossible conflicts between law and mission, and prepare to raise questions through technical channels regarding these limits.406 Other troop contributing nations face similar host nation legal constraints. An example ofthe intricacies faced was the coordination required to fix CINCUSAREUR's Suburban vehicles. Because CINCUSAREUR used the vehicles in his capacity as the NATO Commander ofLand Forces, Central Europe, U.S. Army repair ofhis vehicles would constitute support to NATO. Thus the 21st TAACOM could not simply \"just do it.\" They had to provide NATO Headquarters (SHAPE) information on availability ofservices, price, 406 COL Graham, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 234. cri 154 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS and method ofrepayment. After that they had to wait for SHAPE to agree to the services and place an order requesting the logistical . . f h d . 407support, t hereby comm1ttmg to payment o t e quote pnce. Additionally, in a multinational setting, NATO will do much contracting and blanket ordering. Operations orders from EUCOM and.NATO stressed the use ofthe NATO Contract Coordination Center (KCC) Basic Purchase Agreements (BP As) and Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to purchase common items. Nations providing forces would probably be better served by increasing NA TO funding and conducting more joint purchasing ofsupplies where their needs coincide.408 Unfortunately, no authority currently exists for a simplified transfer offunds to NATO for such purchasing. Therefore, U.S. forces could not use blanket purchase agreements negotiated by NATO's contracting office which prevent troop contributing nations from bidding against one another.409 The U.S. should consider amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation to allow the U.S. to order directly on NATO contracts when U.S. forces operate under NATO command.410 N.

The Ministry was to conduct the initial investigation and adjudication. This arrangement was short lived. In the Spring 1996, the !FOR Legal Advisor and the Ministry of Justice for the Federation ofBosnia-Herzegovina and the Ministry of Justice, Republika Srpska negotiated separate agreements. These claims protocols gave the troop contributing nations (TCNs) and the claimants primary responsibility for settling claims against them. The Claims Annex to the Technical Agreement between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry ofJustice and the Implementation Force, December 23, 1995, established a Claims Commission. The Claims Commission would settle issues only if disagreements arose and mediation failed between a TCN and the claimant. Thus, it became business as normal for the claims community.412 See Appendix N for a diagram ofthe Claims Structures. In a peace operation, where the combat exclusion does not usually apply, the Foreign Claims Act reigns predominant.413 A strong claims operation can foster goodwill and cooperation.414 It demonstrates a respect for the law and a desire to make redress for damages. It also fosters fruitful contacts with the local populace.415 The. deployed environment in a unified operation creates unique claims challenges and issues. 412 See Memorandum, the IFOR Claims Office, subject: The Legal Bases for the IFOR Claims Operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina (20 Jul. 1996) {for a detailed explanation of the authorities pertinent to claims). <J) See, e.g., Article 15 of the Dayton SOFA (23 Nov. 1995) and GFAP, supra note 13, Annex 1-A, Art. VI, Appendix E(5) for text) . . 413 Claims against the United States in a deployed environment are usually addressed pursuant to two authorities: Title IO U.S.C. \u00a7 2734 (The Foreign Claims Act) and Title IO \u00a7 2734a (The International Agreement Claims Act). 414 An explicit purpose of the Foreign Claims Act. See Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2734(a). 41 5 Interview with LTC William F. Ridlon, Chief, SFOR Claims Operations (Feb. 1998). <J) 156 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS 1. Address the lack ofuniform liability standards. Troop contributing nations (TCNs) handled claims in a diverse manner because of the unified nature of the operation and the unique local laws. IFOR/SFOR headquarters stated they would only pay for damages arising from negligence on the part ofIFOR/SFOR personnel. The headquarters would not pay for non-negligent damage (e.g., maneuver damage). The United States, however, much to the chagrin ofother TCNs, chose to pay maneuver damage and other claims allowable under the Foreign Claims Act. The United States also differs from some countries in who handles claims. Some nations use private insurance companies and civilian employees to handle claims against their armed forces. The U.S. method ofhandling claims within military channels was more responsive. This caused the U.S. to gain the reputation ofbeing the fastest with the \"mostest.\" The result was a flood ofclaims submissions to the U.S. for damages done by other TCNs, for fraudulent and inflated claims, and disdain from the other nations who did not want to put their pocket book on the table.416 Another problem was the lack ofsound host nation liability standards. The U.S. Anny generally looks to \"the law and custom of the country where the accident occurred\"417 for liability standards. The U.S. claims personnel could not turn to local law for liability standards in Bosnia. For example, Bosnia assigns strict liability on the owner of a vehicle for any accident, regardless ofwho was driving. This was an issue in accidents involving contractors driving military vehicles where the contract assigned liability to the contractor.418 Therefore, U.S. claims personnel referred to the general principles oftort liability 416 See Id. 417 U.S. DEP'TOFARMY. REG. 27-20, Cl.AIMS para. 10-8.a (31 Dec. 1997). 418 See Interview ofLTC William F. Ridlon, Chief, SFOR Claims Operations (Feb. 1998). ~ 157 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALK.ANS, 1995 -1998 outlined in paragraph 3-8 ofDepartment ofthe Army Regulation 27\u00ad 20, Claims. U.S. forces and IFOR/SFOR worked hard to ensure that the standards were uniform within their claims arenas. IFOR quickly issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) from their main office in Sarajevo. The SOP described how IFOR would handle claims that claimants submitted directly to IFOR Headquarters in Sarajevo. Task Force Eagle and the United States Army Claims Service, Europe, published general claims guides or SOPs and specific guides on handling real estate and timber claims. These were all \"on the street\" early in the operation and amended as needed. 2. Use innovative methods to promote access to claimants. a. Combine claims convoys, site visits, and fu:ed office operations for Foreign Claims processing in a large area of responsibility. A part ofrunning a successful claims operation is to promote the claimants' access to the system. Normally, the Army takes in and pays out claims at a fixed location/office. However, in Bosnia the area of responsibility was large and the populace was scattered. Further, local nationals lacked transportation or refused to travel to U.S. locations because offear ofEntity Armed Force violence.419 Thus the \"claims convoy\" became a regular mode ofclaims service. The \"claims convoy\" involved a judge advocate, a Class A agent, a translator, and support personnel traveling together to intake, investigate, and pay claims. Often convoys would travel to remote sites and set up shop out ofthe back ofa HMMWV vehicle. Task Force Eagle expanded this concept to establish regularly scheduled 419 Primarily these were Bosnian Serbs who were unwilling to enter Federation territory, lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 58. ~ 158 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS stops, or site visits. Word would spread among the locals, and they would appear at the stops on the scheduled days to take care of business. The disadvantage of the claims convoys was the security requirements. Travel within the theater required at least four vehicles, two personnel per vehicle, one M60 machine gun with gunner and assistant gunner, and a combat lifesaver.420 These requirements had the added undesirable effect of intimidating some residents, making them view us as an occupational force. 421 Judge advocates were often convoy commanders. This required judge advocates, 71 Ds, and legal specialists to be well-versed in all aspects of convoy operations (e.g., ROE, safety, vehicle maintenance, driver licensing, land navigation, weapons proficiency, radio \u00b7 procedures). See Appendix 0 for a claims convoy checklist and a sample convoy brief. b. Use Cfril Affairs to assist claims intake and investigation. \\Yith proper coordination and training by judge advocate personnel, civil affairs provided invaluable claims support.422 They assisted in taking in and investigating claims. Civil affairs personnel regularly interacted with locals and thus provided claims personnel greater access to local nationals. For example, civil affairs personnel manned an office in d0\\\\1ltown Brcko once a week to intake claims. Their knowledge of where to go and who to see also helped investigations.423 ._.~ S.:e Interview ofCPT Chad Operations (10 Feb. 1998). (!) 4 2.? Th~ key was making sure that they made no promises or representations, as discussed in the Civil Affairs s~tion surra.. Cl Sw lnterview note 178. ~ LAWAND MILITARY OPERA TIO NS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 159 3. Prepare for difficulty with the combat exclusion in peace operations. The Foreign Claims Act provides for the settlement and payment of claims caused by or incident to noncombat activities ofU.S. armed forces.424 Unfortunately, this leaves a gap, as noted by one judge advocate: There is a gray area between combat and combat related activity, which of course is excluded, and then torts and noncombatant activity that we would ordinarily pay for, in a peacetime situation. We are down there with enough men, women, materiel, and of course in the positions to conduct a war if we had to. The only thing that's missing is the fighting. But that means that we have had to take measures for force protection and otherwise, that were we anyplace else it would be a combat 425 zone. Long-term occupancy ofreal property, including the fortification of such property, caused significant claims activity. Ultimately the NA TO countries that were among the troop contributing nations agreed that such claims should not be paid, based upon the language of the GFAP.426 For future operations, judge advocates must be aware of the fact that peace operati<:>ns will often call for commanders and soldiers to make decisions regarding the host nation comparable to what would be done in combat, but without the claims protection offered for combat activity. 424 10 u.s.c. \u00a7 2734. 425 MAJ Jody M.

Beprepared to pay claims that you might not ordinarily accept. Peace operations call for an increased attentiveness to the relationship between U.S. forces and citizens of the receiving state. Although the GF AP arguably precluded claims against IFOR for necessary activities, commanders often found it appropriate to settle such claims in order to generate or preserve goodwill. Whether this involved small payments to farmers for the deprivation of grazing land or spot repairs to roads damaged by U.S. military equipment, it was often in the U.S. interest to make things right.427 5. Train many members ofthe staffto be foreign claims commissioners, unit claims officers, and maneuver damage control officers. The wide geographic dispersion ofunits andjudge advocates during Operation Joint Endeavor made it imperative to establish numerous foreign claims commissioners. Base camp, brigade, or battalion task force judge advocates will normally operate apart from the headquarters. These judge advocates are often inexperienced in claims. Therefore supervisors should make foreign claims training a priority before deployment. By training more than 30 judge advocates as commissioners, and an additional 25 enlisted soldiers to assist, Task Force Eagle was able to resolve foreign claims swiftly by decentralizing their investigation and settlement.428 Judge advocates should use Unit Claims Officers (UCOs) and Maneuver Damage Control Officers (MDCOs) at the battalion level to assist claims operations. Legal personnel should assist them to prevent, document, and investigate all incidents that may result in a claim against or on behalf of the United States. 427 MAJ Jody M. Prescott, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 126. ~ 428 Id. at 130-131. 161 LAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONSINTHEBALKANS, 1995-1998 6. Preventive measures reduce claims-use the digital camera. Part ofwhat made the investigations successful was the fielding of digital cameras (a standard component of the Rucksack Deployable Law Office, or RDL 429). They provided almost instant access to photographic evidence, alleviating the traditional difficulty of getting film developed while deployed. They played a key role in claims investigations and investigations conducted under Department of the Army Regulation 15-6.430 Perhaps one of their most useful roles was to take pictures of sites before friendly units occupied or moved through them. They could document the condition ofroads, structures, and vegetation in order to later accurately pay legitimate claims or dismiss fraudulent claims. The Nordic-Polish Brigade's legal advisor initiated another preventive measure that met with great success. Whenever their forces conducted a search ofa home or building, they had the occupant sign a form before leaving verifying that they caused no damage and that no items were missing.431 7. Educate soldiers about the limits of\"reasonable\" personal property before deployment. As the theater matured during Operation Joint Endeavor, soldiers worked to make their living areas more comfort':lble. The mail system and an increasing AAFES presence began to fill the camps with 429 The RDL is a proven set of off-the-shelf capabilities that inclU:des a laptop computer, CD-Rom, modem and network capabilities, scanner, printer, digital camera, TACSAT phone, appropriate set ofhardware and software, and hard-shell case. 430 SFC Trejo, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 101. ~For an example of their use in the base closing process, see Memorandum, CPT Richard J.

The Personnel Claims Act, however, only allows payment for items that are possessed reasonably.433 Task Force Eagle had to determine what was reasonable for such entertainment items. Ultimately, even though soldiers were able to purchase such items from the camp AAFES, the SJA opined that it was not reasonable to have more than twenty-five compact discs, or to have $400 combination TVNCR units in theater.434 Noteworthy was that the standard evolved: all agreed that what would clearly be unreasonable during the initial phases of a deployment might not be so during later stages of an extended peace operation.435 Although there were soldiers who complained about the arbitrariness ofsuch determinations, the process of line drawing is fundamental to the claims business.436 The critical task from a morale perspective is to let the soldiers know early-.ideally as part of the SRP process before deployment-what is reasonable under the claims system.437 8.

A memorandum containing the observations of the chain ofcommand was generally sufficient to substantiate a soldier's loss.438 Task Force Eagle created an efficient records base and consistency throughout the unit by centralizing the processing of claims at the Division Rear (D-Rear). This arrat).gement placed a burden on the D-Rear judge advocates requiring them to conduct claims interviews and follow-ups. Civil affairs teams helped investigate claims and provided transportation to outlying camps.439 0. REALESTATE 1. Ensure real estate teams deploy with lease forms appropriate to the operation. Real estate teams deployed into Bosnia with form leases similar to those used to acquire temporary possession ofland for training within the United States. Because Operation Joint Endeavor required the commissioning ofoperational, semi-permanent camps for IFOR soldiers, these leases were inadequate. Numerous legal issues arose and judge advocates had to resolve them on the scene to enable continued productive use of the land.440 438 CPT Scott E. Stauffer, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. iII at 81. ~ 439 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 39. ~ 440 Id. 48. ~The role for judge advocates in real estate is a cradle-to-grave one. The deployed judge advocate must be prepared to play a key role in decommissioning when camps are being closed due to consolidation or redeployment. The critical issues at that time will include environmental remediation, contract termination, fiscal questions regarding property handovers, and claims. See Appendix 5 (Basecamp Decommissioning Tirneline) To Annex L (Basecamp Operations) To Frago_ (Withdrawal) (calling for a final turnover of the land to the owner in a meeting with \"Real estate, CA, [and] JAG\"). 164 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS 2. Include utilities in agreements for property use. The war devastated the utility infrastructure. As a result, power, water, and telephone companies sometimes sought to maximize profits from facilities used by IFOR. Frequently, local governments and military forces had not paid for their utilities. This increased the cost for other users, and made it difficult for IFOR forces to determine a fair price for using utilities.441 Some IFOR forces using government land mistakenly assumed they too would be exempt from utility payments and were later presented with astronomical bills to be negotiated after the fact. One effective technique for dealing with this problem was to define or at least cap the utility cost as a part of the negotiations for the lease ofthe property.442 3. Be prepared to establish ownership standards for property claimed to be privately owned. The GF AP gave rise to two new\u00b7 governments in Bosnia-both with CC?mmunist traditions. Both new governments emerged from the ruins ofa devastating war. This combination was the worst possible situation\u00b7 for determining property ownership. Much property had been state-owned before the war and those individuals that owned property were displaced by the war. After the war, \"squatters,\" those displaced by the war and living on whatever spot on the ground they could find, claimed land ownership by adverse possession. Others asserted title merely because no one else in the area claimed a particular piece of property.443 Task Force Eagle had to sort out what property was available for use, ownership, and ifnon-government property, how much to pay. To do this, TFE devised a four-part classification system for real property. 441 LTC Karl M. Goetzke, comments in OJE-A.AR., supra note 30, Vol. III at 14. ~ 442 !AD-A.AR, supra note 145 at 48. ~ 443 Id. at 50. See also LTC Karl M.

Cash has a way ofbringing owners out of the woodwork .... \"). cri LAWANDMILITARYOPERATJONSINTHE BALKANS, 1995-1998 165 The first category was property that was clearly public. The nature ofthe property often demonstrated its public nature\u00ad schoolhouses, military barracks, and the like. This category also included those factories that were clearly government property. For public buildings, the GF AP required no lease. TFE, however, used accommodation agreements to address utilities, improvements, easements, etc.444 The second category was recently privatized land. Often this property was transferred by the government to a private landowner as late as one day before the arrival ofIFOR troops. The typical response by U.S. forces in such circumstances was to demand the property but to lease it as if it were legitimately privately held. This decision was primarily based on long-term considerations for dealing with the parties.445 The third category was clearly private property. The U.S. forces did not want to remove people from their homes or use recently tilled fields, but TFE required some private property for mission accomplishment. In those cases, the U.S. leased the property.446 The final category was presumed public property. Such cases often involved mines or other formerly state-owned enterprises. TFE treated this property as public when no objective record ofprivate ownership could be found. Accommodation agreements were created with responsible parties. In some instances the units could not find accountable individuals so they essentially seized the property and waited for any claiming owners to come forward.447 444 lAD-AAR. supra note 145 at 22. ~ 445 lAD-AAR. supra note 145 at 23. ~ 446 lAD-AAR. supra note 145 at 23. ~ 447 . rt!\\lAD-AAR. supra note 145 at 23. \\.!I 166 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS In the second and third categories, the real estate teams often had difficulty detennining ownership. There was no true system of title recording in Yugoslavia. Essentially, the land offices could print from their computerized-and easily amended-land record system at any time.448 As a result, teams used varying and extensive approaches to ensure that they were paying the right people. One team even used church baptismal records to determine whether claiming farmers had actually lived on particular property since their youth.449 4. Be aware ofreal estate issues when assuming use of property from the United Nations. The U.N. forces that preceded IFOR brought a great deal of property into the theater. IFOR took over much ofthis equipment from the U.N. pursuant to Section 607 of the Foreign Assistance Act (this Act allows the U.S. and U.N. to enter into reciprocal support agreements). Judge advocates had to remind commanders that this property was not free. Before agreeing to accept a piece ofequipment, resource managers had to determine that: There was a true need for the property in question The cost of reimbursement to the U.N. would be less than the cost for the U.S. logistical system to acquire or bring the equipment into the theater450 448 LTC Christopher Maher, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. III at 7. ~Seealso LTC Denise Vowell, comments in OJE-AAR. supra note 30, Vol. III at 8 ~(noting that many of the records offices are in the Republic ofSerpska and \"they mysteriously aren't available\" if the owner was a Bosnian Muslim or Croat). 449 LTC Karl M.

Use SOFAs and other international agreements to establish property rules and land use rights. The GF AP and its attendant SOF As gave great latitude to the troop contributing nations (TCNs) in enjoying unhindered access to the property of the signatory nations.451 On the other hand, the very broad language created some tension between IFOR rights and host nation responsibilities. The same dichotomy of approaches between TCN s that occurred in the claims arena also occurred with real estate. Some TCNs read the terms of the GFAP quite broadly. They concluded that furnishing land for IFOR use was entirely a responsibility of the Bosnian government and would pay nothing at all for their use ofland. Future multinational operations should strive to resolve this discrepancy among the participating nations prior to the deployment of forces.452 P. ENVIRONMENT AL LAW 1. Peace operations require a dedicated environmental law specialist. Complicated issues ofenvironmental law arose during the course ofOperation Joint Endeavor. Task Force Eagle noted that environmental considerations in peace operations are enormous because preserving the mission's legitimacy is as critical as combat readiness to overall success. 453 451 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 51. ~ 452 COL Redding, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. III at 26. ~Anapocryphal (but illustrative) story from the theatre tells ofthe French officer who responded to a claim for damage to property from a local owner by saying, 'No, this has already been paid for with the lives of four French soldiers who died here.\" LTC Goetzke, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. III at 47.~ 453 lAD~AAR, supra note 145 at 27. ~ See also Tab B (Environmental Standards) To Appendix 4 (Environmental) To Annex L (Basecamp Operations) To Frago (Withdrawal) (\"Focus will be on 168 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS Bosnia h~s little meaningful environmental law.454 Determining the appropriate clean-up standards for POL spills was often the first challenge. After that determination, ensuring compliance with the standard required environmental expertise. Fortunately, one of the reserve soldiers in the G-5 was an attorney with considerable experience in environmental law. Future deploying units should request augmentation by an environmental law expert in peace operations.455 2. Ensure that environmental teams are available early in the deployment. Monitoring the environmental status ofan area is critical early in deployment. Two distinct causes account for this. First the terrain considered operationally important to commanders may be environmentally suspect, even dangerous to U.S. forces.456 Second is the ~laims process. Conducting an early environmental survey of the property can set a baseline for measuring later claims ofenvironmental damage.457 That survey then becomes one of the critical docum~nts for the base camp\u00b7 decommissioning process when force requirements dictate the closure ofparticular camps.458 prevention ofimmediate threats to the human health and safety, legal responsibility, and maintaining the good name ofUS Anny environmental stewardship.\") 454 E-mail, 03/01/98 8:08am, from MAJ E.

INTELLIGENCE LAW 1. Advise commands about the limits on collecting information on U.S. persons. Congress placed strong limitations on the collection of information by U.S. military intelligence operations ofU.S. citizens. Congressional interest stems from a concern about the liberty interests of American citizens. The regulation governing intelligence operations limits collecting information about U.S. persons to select categories. These categories include physical security investigations, counterintelligence, threats to safety, and foreign intelligence.459 Judge advocates frequently found themse~ves called on to assist in the interpretation of this regulation and the limits that it places on operations in a deployed environment.460 Additionally, judge advocates can assist their units by providing oversight and coordination of counterintelligence activities, tasks in which their supported units are not likely to have much experience.461 cause WUlecessary harm to the environment, and subject the US Government to unfavorable publicity and future damage claims.\") 459 U.S. DEP'TOF ARMY, REG. 381-10, U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES paras. 2-1, 2-2 (1 Jul. 1984).

(J) Because the supported unit (a brigade, in this instance) had little institutional expertise with counterintelligence, that unit tended to set its own agenda. Some of the mission choices of the counterintelligence unit seemed unwise, such as the decision to gain valuable information by travelling to bars and cafes in downtown Brcko at night-in uniform--to ask people questions about possible threats to the IFOR (this segment of the AAR conference was not transcribed, but is on videotape on file with CLAMO). This problem appears to be Army-wide.

Judge advocates must know how to mark, handle, store, and destroy classified documents and materials. R. MILITARY JUSTICE 1. Resolve UCMJ jurisdictions immediately (pre-deployment). a.

These factors led the U.S. forces to establish jurisdictions using the options indicated in the bullet comments above. The key is to fully explain the options and to lock the Commanding General down on a decision. Have the CG approve a formal action memorandum, selecting one of the foregoing options. Have a good grasp on how much time is required to execute each of these options. For example, setting up a rear command requires a new Unit Identification Code (UIC) and requires the Secretary of the Army to appoint a new General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA). Then the G-1 must reassign soldiers remaining behind to the new unit. Next the newly appointed GCMCA must select a new 1996); DEP'T OF ARMY, REG. 600-20, ARMY COMMAND POLICY para. 2-5.b (30 Mar. 1988); and 1st Armored Division Regulation 27-10-1. 465 Telephone interview with COL Denise Vowell, former Staff Judge Advocate for IID and Task Force Eagle (22 Oct. 1998). The commanding general retained GCMCA over all HD troop whether deployed or at home station (Germany). The existing SPCMCAs picked up jurisdiction over deploying unit personnel that remained in the rear. 466 METT-T is an analytical framework designed to assist commanders in the military decision making process. It stands for mission, enemy, troops, terrain and weather, and time available. See generally; DEP'TOFARMY, FIELD MANUAL 100-5, OPERATIONS (Jun. 1993). 172 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS court-martial panel, administrative separation boards, etc. Judge advocates must brainstorm, apply METT-T analysis, and war game the process and integrate these steps into the plan. 467 b. Expect other issues to accompany jurisdiction realignment. The initial jurisdictions established for Operation Joint Endeavor proved effective, but still provided challenges to the administration of justice in the rear. USAREUR used area jurisdiction, where jurisdiction is based on geographical assignment of the soldier, not where the crime occurred nor the soldier's particular unit of assignment: The 1st Armored Division Commander ofTask Force Eagle took his flag, hence his jurisdiction, into theater-he exercised jurisdiction over all soldiers assigned to Task Force Eagle.468 In 1995, the 1st Armored Division establ~shed the following jurisdictions:469 The Commander, 1st Armored Division (1AD), retained General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA) over all deploying units assigned or attached to 1AD. The Commander, IAD, relinquished GCMCA authority over non-deploying units in 1AD's jurisdictional area to the Commander, V Corps. The Commander, IAD, created a 1AD Rear (Provisional) Command and appointed a lieutenant colonel as the 467 See supra note 463. 468 The 21st Theater Anny Area Command (TAA COM) (Forward) exercised jurisdiction over all non-Task Force Eagle soldiers deployed to Hungary, Croatia, BiH, Austria, and Slovenia. Later 2 lst TAACOM (Forward) was disbanded and replaced by USAREUR (Forward), with jurisdiction going to V Corps. Sister services handled UCMJ actions for the non-Army U.S. military personnel assigned in the Bosnian theater of operations. 469 See supra note 464. 173 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 commander. This commander exercised Special Court\u00ad Martial Convening Authority (SPCMCA) over all non\u00ad deploying lAD units assigned or attached to the lAD Rear (Provisional) area jurisdiction. The Commander, 53d Area Support Group (ASG) exercised SPCMCA over all non-divisional units assigned or attached to the lAD Rear (Provisional) area jurisdiction. The Commander, lAD, realigned seven total Summary Court-Martial Convening Authorities (SCMCA) under the above two SPCMCAs-four under the lAD Rear Provisional Commander and three under the 53d ASG Commander. Each SCMCA included personnel/units within their geographic area. 1 AD promulgated local regulations which had \"savings clauses\" to pick up any military personnel in the community not otherwise accounted for, which assisted in resolving potential problems with reserve augmentees. 470 With the vast majority of lAD soldiers deployed into Bosnia, this jurisdictional alignment worked very well. However, judge advocates should prepare for challenges in the administration of justice, two ofwhich are discussed below. (1) Conductfrequent and detailed military justice trainingfor rear detachment commanders. Many ofthe rear detachment co_mmanders were junior officers with little or no command or UCMJ experience. First lieutenants and captains commanded rear detachment battalions. An aggressive and comprehensive military justice training program for rear detachment 470 IAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 29. <l) 174 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS commanders is necessary to ensure proper administration ofmilitary justice and to minimize problems ofoverreaching command authority. Rear detachment judge advocates had to guard against allegations of unlawful command influence.471 Due to their inexperience and junior grade, many rear detachment commanders did not truly view themselves as being in command. Often very junior to the deployed commanders, and in frequent communication with the deployed commanders, they sought or received advice in military justice matters from the deployed commanders who no longer had jurisdiction over personnel in the rear. Another problem was rear detachment commanders who believed their authority to be greater than it actually was.\u00b7 One major commanding a provisional rear detachment battalion thought that, because he was in a command position otherwise occupied by a lieutenant colonel, he could reduce non-commissioned officers. Although his misunderstanding-based upon AR 27-10-was underst.andable, he nonetheless was unable to promote to the grades of ES and E6 under AR 600-8-l 9. He therefore did not have the appropriate authority to reduce soldiers ofthose grades. Judge advocates must continually educate commanders on the limits oftheir authority.472 (2) Expect delays in military justice and administrative actions. The rear detachment provisional units in First Armored Division's area included only two SPCMAs, and both were located at Bad Kreuznach. Also, the GCMCA moved to Heidelberg, Germany, several hours from the SPCMCAs. Occasionally this led to delays in processing both UCMJ and administrative actions (e.g., appointment 471 MAJ William D. Palmer, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. III at 162. ~ 472 Id. at 30. ~ 175 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS JN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 ofArticle 32 investigating officers, processing of administrative discharges, awards, promotions, evaluations), especially in the other 1st Armored Division communities.473 2. Artfully and thoughtfully craft General Order Number One. General Order Number One (GO #1), a roughly two page document outlining prohibited activities deemed harmful to the mission by the commanding general, went through several reactionary changes. (See Appendix I for the text ofGO #1 and changes.) GO #1 contained provisions governing gambling, weapons and other munitions, currency exchange, war trophies, and respect for local culture. GO #1 's prohibition ofalcohol was essential to force protection and good order and discipline in an unstable environment. It was also the source ofmany legal and morale issues.474 The blanket alcohol prohibition caused difficulties to Operation Joint Endeavor almost immediately. Local culture deemed consumption ofsome alcohol a necessary part ofnegotiating, both politically and in the business community. Failure to accept an offered drink was viewed as a sign ofweakness or impotence, and could be considered an insult. This caused the first ofmany changes to GO #1. The first group excepted from\u00b7 the alcohol prohibition were members of the force serving with Joint Military Commissions and those attending official ceremonies where drinking was in line with \"local custom.''475 Next came an exception for service members who were on a special pass to Hungary (e.g., Budapest and Lake Balaton) and those in the 473 IAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 29. (l) Note: The Hanau field office consolidated four Special Court-Martial Convening Authorities (SCMAs) into one because ofthe deployment of IAD and V Corps. 474 Memorandum, Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe, subject: General Order #1, Operation Balkan Endeavor, Title: Prohibited Activities for US Personnel Serving in Operation Balkan Endeavor (28 Dec. 1995).

Because most of the persons doing JMC business or dealing with allies and local nationals in situations fitting the exceptions were officers and higher ranking NCOs, and because some people abused the exceptions, some soldiers perceived favorable treatment based on rank. The many exceptions that were made for officers with regards to gifts and war trophies aggravated this perception. Also, some Troop Contributing Nations (TCNs) were not subject to the same restrictions. A real morale problem developed among some troops. Eventually the on-duty alcohol exceptions were tempered with a one drink limit. One StaffJudge Advocate for Task Force Eagle simply stated that for judge advocates, there were no qualifying ceremonial occasions calling for drinkin.g.480 To avoid a bewildering array oforders and exceptions, as well as perceived tinequal treatment ofjunior and senior soldiers, units must be advised to consider a wide range ofpossible circumstances before promulgating the rules regarding consumption ofalcohol. 476 Memorandwn, General William W.

One would not want a court-martial charge ofviolating Article 92 by disobeying the General Order for Operation Joint Endeavor to be dismissed because the violation occurred after Operation Joint Endeavor changed to Operation Joint Guard.481 Commanders should consider prohibiting or restricting relationships between soldiers and local nationals and perhaps even Troop Contributing Nation personnel. Such relationships could endanger the United States position of impartiality in the eyes of the Entity Armed Forces and local nationals. Finally, judge advocates and commanders must continually educate soldiers on the provisions ofGO #1. One key example was the weapons and ammunition policy. Soldiers love souvenirs which are representative oftheir trade. For this reason attempts to prohibit the collection ofweapons, ammunition, and military gear, as well as inert .mementos made from the like, must be worded with extreme care. The initial General Order #1, which hoped to prevent acquisition ofsuch items by outlawing the retention ofproperty \"seized or captured during military operations,\" failed to accomplish its goal. Soldiers proceeded to find and retain abandoned property, as well as to purchase such \u00b7items from local civilians.482 Through the publication ofa FRAGO the_ 481 This was a lesson learned cited by LTC Manuel Supervielle, Chair, International and Operational Law Department, The Judge Advocate General's School, based on court cases arising during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. No documents to date have cited a similar problem in the Balkan operations, but it is one to remember given the ever changing operations. 482 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 42-43. (1) Especially popular were mortar casings and small arms shells which had been polished and stamped with words or pictures-such as flags-to commemorate the operation. CPT Matthew D. Ramsey, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 153. There continues to be difficulty in employing a consistent standard across units and ranks in this area. See Memorandum, CPT John L. Clifton, IV, for Commander, Division Engineer, subject: Legal Opinion (2 Aug. 1996) (opining that a colonel could accept gifts of an inert mine and mine probe without violating the General Order #1). ~ 178 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS command resolved these issues, but future deploying forces need to be sensitive to the great importance ofclarity in these situations.483 3. Expect rear detachment workload to increase proportionately. Although the senior leadership and the majority of the soldiers will deploy in an operation such as Joint Endeavor, judge advocates remaining behind should not expect the workload to decrease. Frequently, soldiers are not deployed because they are already pending some action or are viewed as potential disciplinary problems. The combination of problem soldiers with less experienced and junior rear detachment commanders created an explosive scenario in the criminal law area. Rear detachment judge advocates must prepare to spend significant amounts of time trying cases, conducting boards, and assisting a less proficient chain ofcommand with nonjudicial punishment and other matters. 484 4. The most common crimes in a deployed environment are violations ofGeneral Order Number One, disobedience, and disrespect. In descending order, the most common crimes and offenses during the Balkan operations have been violations of General Order_ Number One, disrespect, disobedience, sleeping on guard, and 483 IAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 43. cri 484 The experiences ofone large branch office prove instructive in this regard: The rear detachment at Baurnholder had approximately 1,000 soldiers in it versus a normal garrison environment of 5,000. However, our experience was that we issued 204 Article 15's during that deployment year versus 358 Article 15's for the previous non-deployment year. We executed 8 courts-martial during the deployment year versus 18 during the non-deployment year. William D. Palmer, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 68. <l) LAWAND MIUTARY OPER4TIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 179 accidental weapons discharges.485 Commanders handled most offenses through non-judicial punishment and resignations in lieu ofc_ourt\u00ad martial (Chapter 10). There have been very few (less than ten) court\u00ad martials in over two years. During 1st Armored Division's second tenure in Bosnia, there were only two court-martials through February 1998, a Bad Conduct Special (BCD-Special) court-martial for aggravated assault (one soldier locked and loaded an M 16 as his fight with another soldier escalated) and a BCD-Special for theft ofphone services.486 While there is never an excuse for criminal misconduct or for not placing the mission first, looking at underlying trends can help a commander reduce the likelihood ofcrime. Many of these crimes were likely attributable to the cramped living conditions, the nonstop yet tedious pace, lack of a way to \"get away from it all\" for any period, and troops feeling uninformed.487 5. \u00b7Use vehicle support to enable Trial Defense to see soldiers .\"on circuit.\" The presence ofa Trial Defense Service (TDS) counsel at each camp in a geographically dispersed deployment is neither necessary nor possible. In order to provide service to soldiers throughout the area ofresponsibility (AOR), defense counsel \"rode circuit\" among the camps of the MND(N) area as well as in Hungary. This technique required units at smaller camps to wait occasionally for TDS representation, particularly for nonjudicial punishment counseling. However, with support from the SJA office, extensive use of logistics convoys, and, in one instance, a helicopter dispatched by the affected 485 See Interview ofLTC Cayce, supra note 330 ~;Interview ofLTC Salata and MAJ Jacobson, supra note 164 ~;Interview of and AAR Memo by CPT Dauenheimer, supra note 178 ~; and Interview of CPT Elizabeth R.

Every TDS counsel should be trained and deployable. Because unit needs in the military justice area fluctuate during deployments, every available TDS counsel near the theater should be prepared to deploy. The TDS was able to support the commanders and soldiers ofTask Force Eagle with timely and effective representation because the Regional Defense Counsel had required each defense counsel to process through the SRP, and undergo the required STX training. Predeployment preparation and training enabled new TDS counsel to quickly deploy, particularly in conflict cases.490 7. Peculiar issues will arise-the Laufenberg Amendment. On September 30, 1996, Congress passed the Lautenberg Amendment to the Brady Bill,491 making it a crime for anyone convicted ofa misdemeanor crime ofdomestic violence to ship, transport or.possess any firearm or ammunition. It also made it a crime to issue individual firearms or ammunition to anyone convicted ofa misdemeanor crime ofdomestic violence. This law applies to all Army issue and privately owned firearms and ammunition except issued crew-served weapons. By its terms, this law could not and did not apply overseas. However, Department ofDefense policy made it 488 MAJ Peter G.

This law has caused problems both domestically and overseas. Fortunately, the number of affected persons in the Balkan operations has remained low. The prohibition on weapons and ammunition handling by those persons with a qualifying conviction directly conflicts with force protection measures. Affected pilots can fly their planes, but carry no sidearm for protection if shot down. Affected soldiers can man TOW and other large crew-served weapons systems, but cannot carry an M16 to handle a firefight. Department'ofDefense Form 2760, dated October 1997, was circulated for soldiers to fill out certifying whether or not they may have had a qualifying conviction. Commanders were called upon to check \"local unit files.\" The CO NUS solution ofmoving subject soldiers to permanent staff duty, gym crews, etc. was not available. The solution has been to move such soldiers, and many DOD civilians, out oftheater. S. LEGAL ASSISTANCE Wherever you have Judge Advocates among soldiers, you will have the practice of Legal . 492Asszstance. 1. Alljudge advocates should prepare to practice legal assistance. Judge advocates at all levels, from IFORJSFOR headquarters down to the base camps, practiced legal assistance. Trial Defense attorneys also provided legal assistance. One base camp judge advocate said she spent as much as 40% of her time handling legal 492 Interview with CPT Nicole Farmer, Chief ofLegal Assistance, 1st Armored Division {Fwd) (Feb. 1998) ~.andInterview with MAJ Mieth, supra note 214. ~ 182 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS assistance issues.493 The latest Task Force Eagle ChiefofLegal Assistance said she devoted 30% ofher time to legal assistance, with the remaining 70% being devoted to civil and administrative law issues.494 Legal assistance issues primarily concerned financial problems, the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act, and family law. Accordingly, access to domestic law resources from the soldiers' home stations-U.S. and German-was key. 2. Preparefor last minute (predeployment) family care plan failures. Commanders must scrupulously follow family care plan guidance in Dep't. ofArmy, Regulation 600-20, Army Coinmand Policy (DA Form 5305-R, Statement ofUnderstanding and Responsibility, DA Form 5304-R Family Care Plan Checklist). Even so, when faced with the specter oflong-term deployments, many family care plans will fail just before deployment. Many failures are legitimate-care providers will often back out at the last minute. Some soldiers, however, view family care failures as a means of avoiding deployment. Commanders can deploy the soldier, keep them in the rear, or keep them in the rear and begin separation procedures. If the commander deploys the soldier, a family member may be left without care. On the other hand, leaving the soldier behind may cause a critical gap in the unit (when it is too late to get a replacement), espedally if the soldier\u00b7is in a critical or shortage MOS. This situation can hurt morale for two reasons. First, many soldiers may perceive that the family care plan failure was intentionally used to get out ofthe deployment. Second, another soldier, possibly untrained for the MOS, will have to pick up the slack as an additional duty. \u00b7 Commanders and judge advocates must prepare for and establish procedures to deal with this situation. Encourage col11Il1anders to 493 Interview with CPT Elizabeth (Libby} Carty, CJA, Camp Bedrock (21 Feb. 1998). 494 Interview ofCPT Farmer, supra note\u00b7 492. ~ LAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONSIN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 183 regularly validate family care plans to minimize last minute family care plan failures. 3. Create an advance packet to improve the SRP process. Judge advocates wrote and distributed a packet ofmaterials that included information papers on wills, will worksheets, powers of attorney, and the claims process. Legal personnel distributed these materials to company level before units were scheduled for the Soldier Readiness Program (SRPs ). Thus soldiers and family members were able to think about their legal needs before they reached the SRP point. They arrived at the legal station with prepared questions and the information necessary to designate beneficiaries.495 4. Adapt the tax program to the situation--consider the costs and benefits ofelectronic filing. For the first time during a major deployment, an SJA office had the equipment and communications to electronically file taxes.496 Soldiers did not use the program as extensively as expected. Possible reasons for this were the filing extension available for deployed soldiers,497 the availability of the service only at the Division Rear which many soldiers could reach,498 and that soldiers did not have the required documents.499 Nonetheless, an extensive tax program was established, complete with some 90 unit tax advisers (UTAs). 495 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 37-8. <J) CPT Scott E.

Resolve questions ofaccess to AAFES and other service facilities. Access to AAFES facilities, MWR events and dining facilities raised numerous legal issues. Everyone wanted access to U.S. facilities-host nation civilians, contractors, troop contributing nations, and other NATO personnel. At AAFES facilities, these people could buy items not available on the economy and without paying taxes. Dining facilities provided readily available, decent chow. SOFAs excluded non-NATO troop contributing nation forces and locally hired contractor employees from these facilities. Inconsistent contract terms, however, caused problems by establishing PX privileges for some locally hired contractor employees, while excluding others.500 An early, consistent approach to AAFES and other facility use and access prevents violations of law and regulation. It also could prevent aggravation to would-be-customers and to the host nation that is foregoing tax revenues. Even with a set policy as to facility access and use, enforcement presents another problem. Many locally hired AAFES employees would allow anyone to purchase .goods ifno supervisors were watching. Similarly, many of the dining facilities did not have effective cash-collection procedures. Ifa person who was authorized to use the dining facility only on a reimbursable basis arrived, the staff would often record them as just another authorized military user.501 soo CPT Matthew D. Ramsey, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. II at 150. (l) Because of their work with translators, the chain ofcommand occasionally advocated to have increased availability to AAFES for local nationals, in violation ofthe SOFA. Judge advocates had to contend with this understandable impulse.

Educate forces about accepting foreign gifts. Grateful soldiers, government officials, and other civilians frequently offered gifts to U.S. forces. These ranged from a tank and several handguns given to the division commander502 to handmade coffee grinders worth a few dollars.503 The advice ofjudge advocates at all levels played a crucial role in ensuring compliance with the Joint Ethics Regulation (JER). 504 Attorneys provided guidance on which gifts could be retained and which could be accepted as gifts to an appropriate museum, and the method for doing so.505 Judge advocates must constantly balance U.S. law with local gift-giving customs courtesies. Finally, U.S. reserve component personnel play a big role in today's operational environment. One United States Army Reserve judge advocate noted that reservists are not widely exposed to the Joint Ethics Regulation and related issues.506 Judge advocates should develop ethics training programs accordingly. 3. Supervise the conduct ofcommand investigations. Deployed judge advocates should expect to spend considerable time and effort participating in significant or high profile investigations.507 For example, judge advocates were sent with an Assistant Division Commander to investigate allegations of equivalent ofNATO personnel within the meaning ofthe Dayton Accords.

PERSONNEL Several personnel issues arose during the operations in Bosnia with implications for future legal operations. The Balkan operations saw the necessity of\"split-base operations.\" Operations were split on two levels. 1st Infantry Division, I st\" Armored Division on their second rotation through Bosnia, and now the 1st Cavalry Division have had to support a \"forward\" operation (in Bosnia) and, at the same time, maintain operations at the home station garrisons. (Note: I st Armored Division did not face this challenge on their first rotation because nearly the whole Division deployed into Bosnia for Joint Endeavor). This created challenges for deploying units as they strove to provide effective legal support both to the deployed units and soldiers as well as to the rear activities and personnel. Essential to split-based operations at this level was the creation ofa permanent Deputy Staff Judge Advocate position in Bosnia.514 This Deputy provided much needed continuity in BiH. The positioning of the chieflegal NCO, augmentation by members of the reserve component, and staffing decisions made about subordinate headquarters were also key to solving these difficulties. The second level at which operations were split-based was within BiH itself. Friendly units in BiH were geographically located by base camp and isolated by force protection measures. Initially\u00ad during Joint Endeavor, lst Armored Division's first rotation (IFOR)\u00ad brigade combat teams and other brigade-sized units occupied these base camps. Later, as the number oftroops in Bosnia was reduced, units occupying these base camps changed from brigades to battalions. This did not, however, change the need for judge advocate support at each base camp. Thus, each battalion caine to have a judge advocate. This was a significant change from prior practice and doctrine, which called only for judge advocates at brigades . . 514 LTC Kevan Jacobson was the first judge advocate to fill ~is position. 188 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS 1. Deploy the ChiefLegal NCO (CLNCO) early. Particularly in an immature theater, the support of a senior noncommissioned officer is vital to mission success. Many of the early site and equipment issues are handled through NCO support channels. Ifthe Chief Legal NCO (CLNCO) is not available for deployment with the Staff Judge Advocate (because he or she is responsible for the overall movement of the office, for example), some other senior NCO should accompany the Staff Judge Advocate.sis When engaged in split-based operations, a strong warrant officer or NCO in the rear \u00b7 detachment is also indispensable. He or she will be called upon to push supplies forward, and to help coordinate contacts, actions, and requests in the rear.s 16 2. Prepare for reserve augmentation. During the\u00b7 operations in Bosnia, augmentation by reserve personnel occurred at every level and proved essential to the success of the legal mission.s17 In order to use these assets effectively, it is critical to identify requirements early. Backfilling ofdeployed personnel is an important role because the garrison legal mission does not cease upon deployment.sis Several communities (branch offices) in Germany were without legal assistance attorneys until reserve augmentees arrived. Five reserve judge advocates backfilled positions in Germany from legal assistance attorney to officer in charge (OIC) of a branch office. In addition, reserve augmentees greatly improved soldier readiness processing during the predeployn~ent preparation and sis SFC Joachin Trejo, comments in note 30, Vol. I at 109-110. ~The CLNCO will also play a critical role in ensuring the proper employment of legal specialists throughout the command, and therefore needs to be mobile.

Other reservist judge advocates deployed to the Stabilization Force's headquarters, base camps, and the Intermediate Staging Base in Hungary. Making the deployment a success for the reserve officers and enlisted soldiers also takes substantial planning. A sponsor should be \u00b7 assigned quickly, and the office should prepare to assist with housing, transportation, finance, medical, and personnel support. Many ofthe augmentees will not have been on active duty for as long as the 270 days for which they are called.520 Generally the most critical need for the arriving reservist-especially in an OCONUS situation-will be transportation.521 Finally, be prepared for surprise arrivals. Despite the thorough work in the assignment/call-up area, reservists occasionally were mobilized by their home reserve units or in response to volunteer calls out ofARPERCEN. Until their arrival, no one in the chain of command or the technical chain knew that they were coming. 522 519 MAJ William D.

The mission may callfor pushingjudge advocates down to lower than normal echelons andfor providing judge advocates to mission-specific organizations. Once Task Force Eagle replaced brigade combat teams with battalion task forces, Staff Judge Advocates decided to support these now battalion-sized base camps with judge advocates.523 The operational situation left SJ As with no other choice. Without judge advocates at the base camps, many obstacles and problems would have critically hindered legal support to operations, e.g., loss of situational awareness, loss of direct support to ground commanders, and transportation and communication problems.524 Although it will not always be possible nor desirable to support battalions with their own attached judge advocates, the Sinai Desert observer mission has used this configuration for more than sixteen years. Also, a judge advocate has supported a battalion task force in Macedonia (as part ofUNPREDEP) for several years. Under some circumstances, it proves to be an effective method for supporting widely dispersed units. 525 Judge advocates supporting dispersed battalions or brigades in this fashion must be \"jacks of all trades\"\u00ad m See Appe~dix D(4), Judge Advocate Disposition. After lAD reassumed the mission from lID in Oct. 1997, they chose to configure about the same as llD had. They had 12 Judge Advocates and 15 enlisted personnel in the area of operations. There were 7 JAs at their main headquarters (Eagle Main)-the Staff Judge Advocate (Forward), the Deputy Staff Judge Advocate (Fwd), Chief of Operational Law, Chief ofAdministrative Law and ofMilitary Justice (combined), a Legal Assistance/Civil-Administrative Law attorney, Chief ofClaims, and the Joint Military Commission (JMC) attorney. Eagle Main had 7 enlisted-I E7, 1E6,3 E5s and 2 E4s. 1 03 JA and 1 E4 were the Trial Defense Service (TDS). 1 03 JA, 1 E6 and 1 E2 served Camp Comanche, the IAD's 4th Brigade (aviation assets). 1 03 JA and 1 E5 served a battalion task force at Camp Bedrock and also the hospital at Guardian Base. 1 03 JA and 1 E4 served a battalion task force at Camp McGovern and also Camp Colt. And 103 JA and 1 E4 served the battalion at Camp Dobol and also Camp Demi. 524 MAJ Sharon E. Riley, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. III at 128. ~ 525 BG John D. Altenburg, Jr., comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. III at 187. ~ 191 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 proficient in all areas oflaw. They will be responsible for advising the commander on rules ofengagement, interpreting and implementing international agreements, issues offiscal law, foreign and personnel claims, military justice, legal assistance and more. Home station training ofthese versatile judge advocates is especially important because they are usually junior in grade and vary in experience. The nature ofthe SFOR mission called for the assignment of judge advocates to organizations to which they were not usually assigned. The SFOR Office ofthe Legal Advisor consisted of the Legal Advisor (LEGAD) to the SFOR commander-duty rotated between two Colonels normally serving as the Staff Judge Advocate and Deputy Staff Judge Advocate for USAREUR, three Majors, one NCO and one Bosnian civilian attorney. In IFOR, two judge advocates served in the Division Assault Command Post, providing a vital early legal presence for the deployment. Other officers served as legal advisors to the Joint Military Commission and other mission-specific organizations such as the Crisis Action Team. One judge advocate even temporarily became a liaison officer to a British armored division.526 b. A senior judge advocate must be on the ground. To manage the manpower and assets spread among base camps and mission-specific organizations, it was essential to have a senior judge advocate forward, on the ground. First Armored Division's Staff Judge Advocate, initially assigned a major to be the \"Deputy SJA forward\" in Bosnia. Thus, there was always a senior judge advocate on the ground to serve as the senior legal advisor to commanders and to manage the other judge advocates. One important function ofthe senior judge advocate was to ensure the judge advocates did not become subjeCts of\"mission creep\"-performing too much non-legal ' 26 IAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 59. (J) 192 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS work.527 On the advice of the task force Staff Judge Advocates, the JAG Corps leadership decided later to create an additional slot-the deputy in Bosnia. This was the key to the continuity in units rotating in and out oftheater. c. Judge advocate support must be mobile. Each judge advocate must be ready to pick up and go in support ofa commander and/or the mission at distant sites and locations. The judge advocate cannot become settled in a routine of staying at oue Tactical Operations Center (TOC) tent or one building. Commanders grew accustomed to taking \"their Judge\" with them on missions lasting hours to days. Handling claims (intake and payment) meant frequent travel to distant and remote areas. To use the I st Armored Division's vernacular, you must be a \"JAG with a bag\"\u00ad have an overnight rucksack and the Rucksack Deployable Law Office (RDL) ready to go on a moment's notice.528 The Staff Judge Advocate, Deputy StaffJudge Advocate, or Operations Lawyer was thus ready to travel with a representative of the command group at any time. This proved particularly valuable to a subordinate brigade commander whose staff had been integrated into the division. That commander was always able to take a judge advocate with him when his mission required that he travel to one ofhis geographically separate units.529 4. Support the morale ofyour legal personnel. Senior leaders must motivate their judge advocates, Legal NCOs and legal specialists. They must communicate with their people, rotate them, and instill a strong sense of duty and sacrifice~ With a mission whose end is still not in sight after almost three years, communication 527 See Interview ofLTC Vowell. supra note 146. (J). 52s Id. 529 MAJ Sharon E. Riley, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. III at 131-133. (!) 193 LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 with subordinates is essential. Keep them informed.530 Troops must be rotated in and out of the theater and afforded R&R. Staffjudge advocates viewed six to eight months as about the ideal rotation. TDS viewed two to three month rotations as ideal.531 Finally, senior leaders must instill a sense of duty and commitment.532 The majority of criminal offenses fell within the realm of disrespect, disobedience, and General Order Number One violations. This illustrates the morale problems that develop in a long, tedious rotation with personnel living in crowded, less than ideal conditions. V. EQUIPMENT AND MILITARY TRAINING As in previous deployments, legal support to operations was possible or1ly because of soldier training and equipment. The train-up gave judge advocate officers and enlisted soldiers both proficiency and confidence in a range ofcommon soldier tasks. 533 The Balkan . operations confirmed the validity ofpast lessons learned, many cited in the Haiti Lessons Learned volume: The importance ofmodem automation equipment534 530 Id. 531 Interview ofLTC Cayce, 330. ~ 532 Interview of LTC Salata, supra note Staff Judge Advocate (Fwd), lAD. lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 60: ~ TFE JAs and Legal Specialists had weapons qualification, protective mask confidence training, and a nearly three-week train-up in Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels for peace operations, to include situational training exercises oriented on mine awareness. Upon deployment, the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate's senior enlisted leadership recognized that the offic~'s Legal Specialists were highly proficient in MOS-related skills. Despite that proficiency, junior soldiers needed hands-on, remedial training on tent setup, basic vehicle maintenance, map~reading skills, and other common task skills. 534 SFC Joachin Trejo, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at I 00. ~See also HAITI AAR at 162-5. ~ 194 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS The necessity ofpre-packing legal resources and forms for deployment535 The value ofpacking in a vehicle or hand-carrying the most critical resources to eliminate problems of loss and dela/36 The vital nature ofover-all soldier training537 There were, however, some new observations: a heightened emphasis on preventing equipment shortfalls before deployment, a recognition of the importance of decentralized training, and a recommendation to prepare for intra-theater deployments in future operations such as this. Particularly in a dispersed theater, the success or failure of the provision oflegal support to the force will often hinge on the abilities ofjunior judge advocates and 71 Ds at brigade and battalion levels. Many of these officers and enlisted soldiers have been, and will continue to be, first-term soldiers. The solution to the problem of transforming a recent law school graduate or enlistee into the professional command judge advocate or legal specialist ofan isolated brigade remains what it has always been: \"training, training and more training. \"538 535 SFC Joachin Trejo, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 106. {l) See also After Action Report, US Army Legal Operations, Operation Restore Hope, 5 Dec. 1992 -5 May 1993 at 4.

(l) LAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONSINTHEBALKANS.1995-1998 195 1. Prepare Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) office equipment before deployment. Advances in technology require that staff judge advocate offices maintain current equipment to the greatest extent possible. It is a reality, however, that much ofthe latest equipment will only become available just before or even during a deployment. 539 Deploying offices must also be aware ofthe danger that equipment which is designated for the SJA office may be redistributed among other staff sections during train-up exercises ifthere is no judge advocate presence in the field. 540 \u00b7 a. Stockpile supplies. The seven-day-a-week operations expended supplies much more quickly than originally expected. Supplies such as paper, pens, and printer cartridges thus became major concerns, not only for the SJA office, but for all staff sections.541 How supplies were brought to the theater was as critical as what was brought. Key resources and equipment should be carried or packed on vehicles, and CONEXs should be packed to support a longer operation than 539 SFC Joachin Trejo, comments in OJE-AAR, supra not~ 30, Vol. I at 100. (J) 540 Particularly MSE telephone sets. See id. at 102. 541 lAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 62. (J) Additionally, \"maintenance\" in the Information Age has a slightly different meaning than it has historically: The Office of the Staff Judge Advocate learned from its Mountain Eagle experiences, and while deployed to BiH and CRO, that preventive maintenance supplies are invaluable to successful field and garrison operations. Such supplies should include notebook and desktop computer keyboard covers, compressed air cans to blow dust out ofkeyboards and hard drives, fine hair brushes to do periodic screen and keyboard dusting, alcohol or \"baby wipes\" to clean hardware surfaces, and clean cloths for the same purpose. Ifat all possible, deploying legal offices should also bring along 110/220V transformers, power adapter plugs and extension cords, surge suppressers, power conditioners and continuous power supply equipment, and operating system dis.cs (in the event ofa hard drive \"crash\"). There is no guarantee that signal support will have these items in theater, or even in the rear detachment area. Failure to keep equipment clean and secure might result in reports of survey, or at very least a shortfall of weeks or months while computer equipment is \"evacuated\" to a CSS-AMO shop in the rear. 542 SFC Joachin Trejo, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 106. (J) 196 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS (six months worth to start).543 Plan on the supply system not working fast or well in the beginning. No space should go unused. SJA offices are well advised to \"deploy with items necessary to create comfortable, professional work and off-duty conditions.\"544 Space and furniture were scarce. A field desk may save having to build one yourself. 545 b. Stock you legal references and resources. Many judge advocates initially found themselves stuck only with what they brought themselves for legal research and reference. This was true not only for the first units arriving, but also for each rotation thereafter: departing units and people took their resources with them, leaving the incoming units to fend for themselves.546 Many judge advocates lacked basic, essential references, such as the GF AP, SOF As, Geneva and Hague Conventions. The most widely recommended general resource was the Operational Law Handbook.547 It is essential to bring the specific regulations, directives, forms, and field manuals that apply to each specific area oflaw (e.g., fiscal, contracts, claims). Legal personnel should prepackage many ofthese resources onto a computer hard drive or CD-ROM to save space and weight. c. Internet access is essential. This was the Army's initial \"Internet deployment,\"548 and the first to test many of the latest technological changes. Numerous judge advocates cited Internet access as the prime resource for research, 543 See Interviews of SFC Murray, NCOIC, Office ofthe Staff Judge Advocate (Fwd) <J), lAD and Spearman, Chief Legal NCO, lAD. <J) 544 IAD-AAR, supra note 145 at 63. <J) 545 See Interview ofCPT Carty, supra note 493. <J) 546 See Interview of LTC Salata and MAJ Jacobson, supra note 164.

There is also the risk ofdownloading computer viruses that can render the computer inoperable. 2. Assign personnel to the lowest possible echelons during training events. As was noted earlier soldiers-both officer and enlisted\u00ad performed military duties well. Nonetheless, units found that they would have been better served by integrating both common-task and MOS-specific events550 into pre-deployment training. The most efficient way to accomplish this is to decentralize the legal centers during training events, so that they reflect the arrangement that will occur during deployments. Judge advocates, NCOs, and legal specialists should train with the units they support.551 Such a strategy allows a legal specialist to build a relationship with the deploying battalion552 and to better learn soldier skills from line units.553 549 See, e.g., Interview ofLTC Vowell, supra (l); and Interview ofLTC Salata and MAJ Jacobson, supra note 164 (l). A program called \"net to phone\" allowed toll free calls to subject matter experts at The Judge Advocate General's School and in Washington. 550 SFC Joachin Trejo, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 98.

Vehicles were unnecessarily deadlined because \"people don't always want to abide by that,\" resulting in loss of the glow plugs, which disables the vehicle. See SFC Trejo, comments in OJE-AAR, supra note 30, Vol. I at 105. (l) 198 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS 3. Prepare/or intra-theater travel and deployments. Because ofthe wide geographic dispersal of units in BiH during Joint Endeavor, the command group frequently traveled throughout the theater. Such travel often was a response to a particular event or crisis that required legal support for the command. As a result, the SJA office created the \"JAG with a bag\" concept, discussed in paragraph U.3.c. above. While mentioned in paragraph N.2.a. above, training for the stringent convoy requirements in Bosnia bears further mention. Four vehicles with internal and external communications, a crew served weapon, and a combat lifesaver were the minimum permissible for a convoy. Judge advocate offices must scrap for vehicles, consider assignment ofa crew-served weapon to the section, and seek to train their personnel on combat lifesaving and crew served weapons, among other soldier tasks. Prior planning and home station training can make convoys for claims investigations and the like considerably easier.554 4. Communications are always a problem--plan how you will communicate. Communications, both within and outside the theater, were a problem. Many camps had bad phone systems, no Internet access, no secure communications, and no FAX capabilities. Talk to the signal and communications experts. Know the communications architecture that will exist and become a part ofit. Do not forget the need for interoperability. For example, United States forces used the STU-III system for secure transmissions, but NATO stocks the STU-II-they cannot talk to each other. Thus, some judge advocates needed both systems.555 SS4 Id. at 103-104. sss See Interview ofMAJ Mieth, supra note 214. ~ LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, 1995 -1998 199 APPENDICES\u00b7 200 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS Appendix A(l): Historical Maps 1350 llOLYROMAN EMPIRE HISTORICAL YUGOSLAVIA 1529 SERBIA MACEDO~IA FORMER YUGOSLAVIA 1991 Appendix A(l) AGREED CEASE FIRE LINE(ACFL) \\. .-..... ... \\ I I . ...., .

The UN established UNPROFOR on 21 February 1992 to create the conditions for peace and security in the former Yugoslavia (UNSCR 743). UNSCR 758 enlarged the mandate to encompass the delivery of international humanitarian assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina. On 7 April 1992, the UN authorized UNPROFOR's deployment to Croatia and, later, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) (UNSCR 795). With the 20 December 1995 transfer of authority from UNPROFOR to IFOR, UNPROFOR ceased to exist. JTFPP commanded all U.S. forces operating in support of UN operations in the Balkans (JTFPP is discussed below). United Nations Preventive Deployment (UNPREDEP) -(31 MAR 95 \u00ad Present). On 31 March 1995, the UN changed the name of the FYROM part of UNPROFOR to UNPREDEP (UNSCR 983). On 1 February 1996, the UN made UNPREDEP an independent mission [UNPREDEP is the first and only UN operation to have a preventive mandate]. UNPREDEP is a monitoring mission between FYROM and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Albania. UNPREDEP has 700 troops from 27 nations. United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) (92-95). This is an outgrowth of UNPROFOR like UNPREDEP. UNCRO's mandate included implementing the 1994 cease-fire between Croatia and its secessionist Serb population, facilitating economic agreefDents, and monitoring Croatia's borders. UNCRO ended in 1995 after Croatia regained control of all Serb-he.Id territory {except for Eastern Slavonia-\u00b7 see UNTAES) United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES)- (15 JAN 96-15 JAN 98). UNSCR 1037 established a transitional administration to govern the peaceful integration of the region into Croatia's legal and constitutional system. It authorized an international force to maintain peace and to otherwise assist in the implementation of the agreement. 30 nations contributed forces totaling 2,847 personnel. Appendix C LAWANDMILITARYOPSINTHEBALKANS, 1995-1998 205 Operation Able Sentry -(18 JUN 93 -Present). On 18 June 1993, the UN authorized the deployment of UNPROFOR personnel to the FYROM. As part of the UNPREDEP, 300 U.S. soldiers (per rotation) observed, monitored, and reported troop movements along the FYROM border with Serbia and Albania. This operation continued after UNPROFOR became UNPREDEP. Operation Joint Endeavor (OJE)-(20 DEC 95-20 DEC 96). NATO-led multinational force from 20 December 1995 to 20 December 1996. The Implementation Force (IFOR) was the military force of OJE. Operation Joint Guard (OJG) -(20 DEC 96-20 JUN 98). NATO-led multinational force 20 December 1996 to 20 June 1998. The Stabilization Force (SFOR) was the military force of OJG. Operation Joint Forge (OJF) -(20 JUN 98 -Present). NATO-led multinational force from 20 June 1998 to a date to be determined. The SFOR is the military force of OJF. Naval Operations Maritime Monitoring Operations- (JUL 92-NOV 92). NATO ships began monitoring operations in the Adriatic Sea in July 1992. These operations were in support of the UN arms embargo (UNSCR 713) and sanctions against the FRY (UNSCR 757). These efforts were limited to registering possible violations. NATO aircraft assisted the monitoring effort. Extended Monitoring Operations -(NOV 92 -JUN 93). NATO and Western European Union (WEU) forces began enforcing the UN sanctions and embargo (UNSCR 787). These operations included stopping, inspecting, and diverting ships, as required. Operation Sharp Guard -(8 JUN 93 -1 OCT 96). This operation began on 8 June 1993 (maritime operations actually began in November 1992). 14 NATO and WEU member states,. to include U.S. forces, contributed naval and air forces to Operation Sharp Guard. This operation put the NATO and WEU forces under the OPCON of COMNAVSOUTH and stepped up enforcement of the UN sanctions and embargo. The forces suspended enforcement of sanctions on 22 November 1995 (UNSCR 1022) and Operation Sharp Guard was terminated on 1 October 1996. \u00b7NATO and WEU forces challenged 74,192 ships, inspected 5,951 ships at AppendixC 206 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS sea, diverted and inspected 1,480 ships in port, and caught 6 attempting to break the embargo. Air Operations Operation Provide Promise -(3 JUL 92 -15 MAR 96). Joint Task Force Provide Promise (JTFPP) commanded all U.S. forces operating in support of UN operations in the Balkans. The U.S. contributed in four ways: Humanitarian Airlift to war-tom Sarajevo. This was the longest running humanitarian airlift in history supplying over 160,000 metric tons of food, medicine, and supplies (18,000 tons were air dropped). UN field hospital in Zagreb, Croatia serving a UN military population of over 47,000. Operation Able Sentry. As part of the UNPREDEP, 300 U.S. soldiers (per rotation) observed, monitored, and reported troop movements along the FYROM border with Serbia and Albania. This mission continues under USAREUR. UN reconnaissance operations involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Monitoring Operations -(OCT 92-MAR 93). NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control System aircraft began monitoring operations in October 1992. These operations supported the UN established no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina (UNSCR 781 ). These operations were limited to registering violations. Extended Monitoring Operations -(31MAR93- 12 APR 93). On 31 March 1993, UNSCR 816 authorized enforcement of the no-fly zone and extended it, banning all fixed and rotary wing aircraft except those authorized by UNPROFOR. Operation Deny Flight -(12 APR 93 -20 DEC 95). This NATO enforcement operation included 12 NA TO members, flying from airbases in Europe and from aircraft carriers in the Adriatic Sea. It enforced the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina (UNSCR 816), using over 200 fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and flew nearly 100,420 sorties by December 1995. On 28 February 1994, NATO aircraft shot down four warplanes violating the no-fly zone. This was NATO's first-ever military engagement. On 4 October 1995, NATO aircraft fired missiles at a Bosnian Serb radar sites after air defense radar locked onto NATO aircraft. The Transfer of AppendixC LAWANDMILITARYOPSINTHEBALKANS, 1995-1998 207 Authority from UNPROFOR to NATO on 20 December 1995 terminated the mandate of Operation Deny Flight. Close Air Support (CAS) to UNPROFOR- In June 1993, NATO offered UNPROFOR CAS. On 19 November 1994, NATO extended CAS to protect UNPROFOR troops in Croatia (UNSCR 958). On 10-11 April 1994, NA TO provided CAS to protect UNPROFOR troops in Gorazde, Bosnia-Herzegovina (a UN\u00ad declared Safe Area). On 11 July 1995, NATO CAS protected UNPROFOR troops from Bosnian Serb forces advancing on Srebrenica (a UN-Declared Safe Area). Despite the NATO CAS, Srebrenica fell to Bosnian Serb forces. On 9 October 1995, the UN asked again for NATO CAS to protect UNPROFOR troops from artillery shelling from Bosnian Serb forces. NATO aircraft attacked a Bosnian Serb command and control bunker near Tuzla. UN/NATO Air Strikes -From August 1993 to August 1994, NATO provided air strikes, upon request from the UN, to protect Sarajevo and the other UN-designated Safe Areas. One such decision was to enforce a weapons free exclusion zone around Sarajevo and to respond to any heavy weapons attacks against the other Safe Areas. Both UN and NATO commanders had to agree before commencing operations-this limited the effectiveness of the air strikes (a.k.a. \"dual key\" approach). NATO carried out the following operations for UNPROFOR. On 5 August 1994, NATO aircraft attacked a target in the weapons free exclusion zone around Sarajevo. On 22 September 1994, NATO aircraft attacked a Bosnian Serb tank after an attack against an UNPROFOR vehicle near Sarajevo. On 21 November 1994, NATO aircraft attacked the Serb-held airfield in Udbina, Croatia. This was in response to the use of the airfield to launch attacks into Bosnia-Herzegovina Safe Areas. On 23 November 1994, conducted air strikes against air defense radars in Otoka, Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was in response to \u00b7 two attacks from a surface-to-air missile site against two NA TO aircraft. \u00b7 Appendix C 208 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS On 25-26 May 1995, NATO aircraft struck Bosnian Serb ammunition depots in Pale, Bosnia-Herzegovina. This attack was in response to numerous violations of the exclusion zones and the shelling of the Safe Areas. In response, the Bosnian Serbs took 370 UNPROFOR troops hostage and used them as human shields to stop further air attacks. On 4 August 1995, NATO aircraft struck Croatian Serb air defense radars near Udbina airfield and Knin, Croatia. \u00b7 Operation Deliberate Force -(30 AUG 95 -20 SEP 95). Operation Deliberate Force was NATO's response to continued artillery attacks on Sarajevo. This UN and NATO enforcement operation began on 30 August 1995 (UNSCR 836 and earlier NATO decisions simplified the UN/NATO \"dual key\" approach to targeting). On this date, NATO aircraft began a series of attacks against Bosnian Serb military sites around Sarajevo and other places in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This operation sought to reduce the threat to Sarajevo and the other UN-designated Safe Areas, force the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb heavy weapons from the exclusion zone around Sarajevo, allow complete freedom of movement for UNPROFOR forces and non-governmental organizations, and secure unrestricted use of the Sarajevo Airport. On 20 September 1995, NATO and UNPROFOR determined that the mission was accomplished and stopped the air strikes. NATO reserved the right to resume operations. NATO aircraft flew 3,515 total sorties.

It was distributed down to company level, and often to individual persons, teams and platoons. This Handbook was a collaborative effort. However, the Judge Advocate led the way in its creation. Legal interpretation, guidance and authorship was necessary for most every section ofthe handbook. This Handbook provided commanders and soldiers an immediate answer for most ofthe issues and questions faced in theater. It should serve as a model product for future missions.

In December 1996, the Security Council created a Stabilization Force (SFOR) as legal successor to IFOR. SFOR is led by NATO, but includes 17 non-NATO countries. There are about 31,000 troops in SFOR. Essential Tasks: Ensure force protection and deter a resumption of hostilities or new threats to peace. Control the airspace over Bosnia-Herzegovina and control military traffic over key ground routes. Monitor the movement and training of Entity Armed Forces (EAF). Ensure safe conditions for the implementation of the non-military aspects of the Dayton Peace Accords. Assist the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other international organizations in their humanitarian missions. Prevent serious crimes or interference with civilian freedom of movement. Monitor and support the clearance of minefields by the Bosnians.

The official name of the Dayton Peace Accords is the General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP). The Parties who signed the GFAP in Paris on 14December1995 were the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Republic of Croatia, and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (the U.S. is not a Party to the GFAP). Bosnia-Herzegovina remains a single state, but comprised of two Entities. The Entities are the Muslim and Croat Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Bosnian Serb Re~L;Dlika Srpska. The Parties' forces ceased all hostilities and withdrew behind a 2-km zone of separation (ZOS). Bosnia-Herzegovina has a central government in Sarajevo. The Parties agreed to a constitution for Bosnia-Herzegovina that creates a three\u00ad member presidency, a two-house legislature, and a constitutional court. All of Bosnia-Herzegovina's people have the rig~t to move freely throughout the country without harassment or discrimination. Displaced persons and refugees (DPREs) have the right to return home or obtain compensation from civil authorities. The Parties committed to cooperate fully with the prosecution of persons indicted for war crimes (PIFWCs) and violations of international and humanitarian law. The Parties reported to IFOR, and must continue to provide updated reports to SFOR, on the following: Positions and descriptions of all known unexploded ordnance, explosive devices, demolitions, minefields, booby traps, wire . entanglements and other physical hazards to safe movement. Locations of lanes through the Agreed Zone of Separation (ZOS) that are free of all such hazards. Positions and descriptions of fortifications, barriers and other man\u00ad made obstacles,\u00b7 ammunition dumps, command headquarters and communication networks. AppendixK LAW AND MILITARY OPS IN THE BALKANS 1995-1998 407 + Positions and descriptions of all surface-to-air missiles and launchers, including mobile systems, supporting radars, and associated command and control systems. + Locations, types, and quantities of any toxic chemical or biological warfare agents (including irritants). Locations, types, and strengths of personnel and weaponry of all forces. Locations and descriptions of all fixed and rotary wing aircraft. Any other information of a military nature requested by SFOR. In furtherance of the GFAP, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sponsored additional agreements signed by the Parties in Vienna and Florence. The January 1996 Vienna Agreement (which expanded on the GFAP, Annex 18, Art. II) established procedures for the Parties to monitor each other's military forces, under OSCE supervision. The June 1996 Florence Agreement (which expanded on the GFAP, Annex 1 B, Art. IV) established limits for the Parties' weapons in five key categories: artillery, main battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, helicopters, and combat aircraft. AppendixK 408 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS Chapter 4 REGULATING THE POSSESSION OF WEAPONS References: GFAP, Annex 1A, 315, 1563, 1942, and 2211. Bottom Line: Persons carrying weapons must have a permit or fall into a permitted category described in this Section. SFOR commanders may confiscate unauthorized weapons. Report weapons confiscations to MND(N) HQ, which must approve their destruction or return. Civilians, including off-duty EAF may carry side arms or hunting and sporting weapons (\"civilian weapons\") subject to the following requirements: When in possession of a civilian weapon, a civilian must have a valid civilian weapons permit (see sample in section 2 of this chapter), and the weapon must be registered at the local police station. If a civilian is carrying a concealed side arm in public, he or she must have a concealed weapon permit issued by the local police, in addition to the ordinary weapons permit. Hunting and sporting weapons must be used only for shooting sports or hunting. + In the ZOS, civilian weapons permits must be endorsed by an MND. MND(N) has not yet granted any such endorsements. Therefore, civilian weapons found in the ZOS, even with a valid permit, may be subject to confiscation. If a civilian is truly using the weapon for hunting, the commander on the ground has the discretion to allow the person to retain the weapon, with a warning that weapons are not otherwise allowed in the ZOS. Even if a civilian has a valid permit issued by the local police, SFOR may confiscate a weapon if it is carried or used in a threatening or negligent manner. Armed civilian groups will be disarmed and disbanded, and may be detained by the civilian police, the IPTF, or SFOR. The Vienna Agreement defines an armed civilian group as \"any group of 3 or mor~ armed persons not wearing uniforms.\" (Art. I, para. 29). However, our policy is that the on-scene commander decides what is or is not an armed civilian group that needs to be disbanded. For example, a legitimate hunting party may not need to be disarmed and disbanded. AppendixK LAW AND MILITARY OPS IN THE BALKANS 1995-1998 409 Privately-owned businesses may not use long barreled or military weapons to guard their businesses. + Civilian guards may only carry side arms in visible holsters, and they must havea valid civilian weapons permit. + The Entity governments may classify privately-owned businesses as sensitive government sites, which are guarded by an armed police force (consult SFOR CJ2 for approved sites). Civilian Police: See Law Enforcement chapters for rules on their carriage of weapons. Military Officers: + Outside the ZOS, any general officer and his party of three (3) bodyguards or MPs, may carry unconcealed side arms when performing official duties in uniform. + In the ZOS, any general officer and his party of three (3) bodyguards or MPs may carry unconcealed side arms while in or transiting the ZOS on SFOR business, with prior MND(N) approval. If the general officer has an SFOR Faction Commander's ZOS Permit {see chapter on SFOR checkpoints), presume he has prior MND(N) approval and do not search his vehicle at SFOR checkpoints unless reasonable grounds warrant a search. Only the general officer must have a Commander's permit. + Outside the ZOS, military officers below the rank of one-star general who have a legitimate civilian weapons permit may carry side arms. Officers who do not have a legitimate weapons permit, but who have written authority from their Corps or separate Division HQ to carry side arms, may do so only while on dutY and in uniform. Military Personnel: + Military personnel going to, conducting, or returning from MND\u00ad approved military events or training are authorized to carry the weapons listed on the approved movement and training request. Ammunition and weapons must be moved in separate vehicles. + Military personnel with weapons going to or from a remote authorized place of duty must have individual proof of a standing arrangement between the MND and the lowest practical level of command (company or battalion}. The military personnel must have an SFOR Permit for the Carriage of Long Barreled Weapons, as shown in this Handbook, and an SFOR-stamped letter of explanation. + MNDs may grant written permission in exceptional circumstances for soldiers to carry long barreled weapons and ammunition to escort arms, ammunition, or sensitive items. Such escorts must carry an SffiR~rm~ \u00b7 EAF Military Police: AppendixK 410 CENTERFORLAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONS + EAF MPs may carry side arms on authorized official duty, while in uniform, with clearly identifiable MP insignia. See the section on EAF MPs. + EAF MPs are allowed to carry side arms in the ZOS when escorting OSCE inspection parties. The following conditions apply: (1) not more than eight MPs; (2) clearly identifiable with OSCE forms 10, 11, or 19; and (3) traveling in MP vehicles only. Military Sites Guards: + Military guards may carry side arms within fifty meters of authorized sites. Guards must be in uniform with their side arms not concealed. + Military guards may carry long barreled weapons only within the perimeter of the site. + Ordnance Factory Guards: \u00b7 HQ MND(N) approves each site's number of guards, who must be civilians from a private security force or from the Ministry of Defense. These civilian guards may carry unconcealed side arms, within the perimeter of the site, if they have valid civilian weapons permits. The guards may carry long barreled weapons in emergency situations if they have an IPTF permit. Sensitive Government Installation Guards: These guards must be either civilian or specialist police, who as police may carry side arms without permits. + If carrying long barreled weapons, they must remain within the perimeter (or under exceptional circumstances, within fifty meters of the perimeter) of the installation they are guarding. Guards carrying long barreled weapons outside the perimeter must have an IPTF permit. Foreign Civilians: To carry a weapon, foreign (non-Bosnian) civilians (non-SFOR) and their official civilian bodyguards must have either a Diplomatic Identification Card or an SFOR Weapons Authorization Certificate. MND(N) personnel encountenng armed foreign civilians should request one of the above listed items, and may confiscate the weapons of individuals unable or unwilling to produce one. Issue a receipt for any weapon confiscated. HQ SFOR decides whether to issue weapons permits for bodyguards and other authorized personnel on a case by case basis, and will generally authorize only the possession of side arms. Foreign civilians may not carry weapons without advance authorization. + Personnel belonging to NGOs, private organizations, and governmental charity organizations are not authorized to carry weapons in BiH. AppendixK LAWANDMILITARYOPSINTHEBALKANS 1995-1998 411 MND(N) soldiers are not authorized under normal circumstances to carry weapons when dressed in civilian clothes.

SFOR commanders have the authority to confiscate any military or civilian weapons carried without a valid permit or other proper authorization. After confiscating weapons, MSCs must submit a Request for Destruction/Return to MND(N) JMC within forty-eight hours (see chapter 12). The senior ground commander always has the authority to confiscate a weapon, even if the bearer has a permit, if: the individual poses a potential or actual threat to SFOR or its mission. the validity of the permit is questionable. the weapon is used or carried in a threatening or negligent manner. If you confiscate a weapon because of the civilian's weapons permit is questionable, coordinate with the IPTF to deliver the weapon to the civilian police. Use the minimum force necessary to confiscate unauthorized weapons or detain individuals. Deadly force is only authorized in response to hostile intent or acts. IChapter 5 FOR uses to ensure force protection, to keep weapons out ofthe ZOS, and to compel compliance with treaty provisions. Purposes of SFOR checkpoints: Securing approaches and entrances to SFOR locations. Securing the population and sensitive areas from in~ltrated weapons or armed groups. Enforcing treaty provisions, including keeping unauthorized weapons and soldiers out ofthe ZOS, and preventing interference with civilian freedom of movement.

The following are specimens of internationally accepted Diplomatic passports issued In Bosnia & Herzegovina: a. Corps 1A, may detain anyone who obstructs friendly forces, interferes with the execution ofthe SFOR mission, or commits a serious crime in the presence ofSFOR personnel. A detainee is a person involuntarily taken into SFOR custody. Persons should be detained if SFOR personnel see them commit or attempt to commit murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, or any other serious crime. + A serious crime is any act that causes, or could reasonably be expected to cause, death or serious bodily harm to anyone. Whom SFOR may detain: Persons who obstruct friendly forces or SFOR progress\u00b7. + Persons who attack SFOR property. Members of armed civilian groups. Persons engaged in violent demonstrations or riots. Persons who commit or threaten to commit serious crimes. Persons conducting surveillance or suspicious, repetitive behavior that might indicate surveillance against MND(N) forces, base camps, and convoys. MND(N) troops may confiscate film from persons conducting unauthorized surveillance on MND(N) forces. MND(N) will implement a proactive and vigorous counter-surveillance program for all base camps to minimize the threat of surveillance. Report all detentions immediately through command channels, and exhaust all appropriate non-forcible means before detention. Length of detention: SFOR will hold detainees only long enough to investigate fully the circumstances that caused their detention. + SFOR will normally release detainees within seventy-two hours. + Should it be necessary to hold detainee for more than seventy-two hours, obtain a legal review by the Staff Judge Advocate (MSE 553\u00ad 3568). + Give temporary refuge to anyone who surrenders to SFOR, and obtain instructions from the MND(N) Commander through lhe chain of command. Do not tum over detainees to local authorities without the approval of the MND(N) Commander. AppendixK 422 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS Detention Standards: Disarm detainees. Confiscate only items that pose an immediate threat. Do not use searches to humiliate, harass, or molest. Use a scanner or same-sex search when possible. Provide armed SFOR cover when conducting a search. The senior SFOR soldier present is authorized to release any detained person, if appropriate. Treat detainees humanely. Provide food, water, and first aid. Do not physically or sexually abuse detainees. Do not exchange money or gifts. Do not use detainees for manual labor or subservient tasks. Keep detailed records on all detainees. IChapter 7 PERSONS INDICTED FOR WAR CRIMES (PIFWCs) References: GFAP, Annex 1A, Art.

SFOR will not conduct manhunts. Note: MSCs will disseminate PIFWC posters down to squad level. Detain PIFWCs identified during the regular course of duty, if the situation permits. The MSC commander decides whether to attempt detention. On-scene commanders will apply the rules of engagement (ROE) and prudent military judgment. Report detention to MND(N) HQ Battle CPT (MSE 553-2301/553\u00ad 3356/5564 704}. Task Force Eagle CP will use Blue Dart to notify of PIFWC detention.

You will soon be transferred to their custody, and they will provide you details of the charges against you. I caution you that you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but that whatever you say will be recorded and may be given in evidence. Do you understand that?\" After the initial detention, and preferably through a U.S. interpreter, read this secondary caution to the PIFWC in a language he understands: \"You are detained as a person believed to be indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. You have been charged in that indictment with having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. Arrangements will now be made for you to be transferred without delay to the international tribunal in The Hague to answer these charges. The tribunal has been informed of your detention, and members of the prosecutor's office will meet you as soon as possible. They will give you full details of the charges against you when they arrive. The tribunal will, as appropriate, ensure that you can consult with legal counsel. You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say will be recorded and may be given in evidence. Nothing else is going to happen until you are transferred to the custody of the tribunal. Do you understand?\" Troops may search the detainee. Searches must not be intended to humiliate or embarrass, and should be conducted by a member of the same sex if possible. Treat detained PIFWCs in accordance with the Detention Standards in the previous Section. Evacuate PIFWCs according to the above references and orders from your chain of command. Chapter 8 WAR CRIME SCENES References: GFAP, Annex 1A, Art. II, 424 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS Bottom Line: SFOR is not responsible for seeking out and investigating war crimes. However, ifSFOR soldiers discover a suspected war crime scene, they will preserve the evidence under the guidelines below, and report It through the chain ofcommand to MND(N) HQ, who will forward it to SFOR CJ3 COORD. SFOR will not investigate or excavate any suspected evidence, but will provide a secure environment for investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Report suspected mass graves or dead bodies as fully as possible in the following format: + Line 1-Time of discovery. + Line 2-Location, including the vicinity name and eight digit grid coordinates. Line 3-What was found? + Line 4-Why it is suspicious? Line 5-If reported to military authorities by a civilian, his or her name, address, and contact details. Make initial reports as soon as the tactical situation permits. On order, MND(N) units may conduct reconnaissance of specified locations to identify and report possible tampering with suspected mass graves. Tasked units will perform a visual ground and/or air reconnaissance on suspected mass graves, including still and video photography, and will report signs of possible tampering (e.g., the presence of excavation, or heavy equipment in the vicinity of the possible grave site). If tampering is discovered at any identified mass gravesites, be prepared to establish observation posts (OPs) or checkpoints (CPs) to monitor access to the site. If a patrol finds someone tampering with a site under surveillance, it should act to prevent any further damage to the site. The patrol may detain the individual(s) involved, and hand them over to the civil authorities after making a full report through the chain of command. Be prepared to prevent e~cavation equipment from entering gravesites. Deter further tampering with suspected gravesites through patrolling and force presence. MND(N) soldiers will not: Clear mines for ICTY; Transport ICTY personnel, equipment, or evidence; or Protect witnesses, except in accordance with the ROE rule about preventing serious crimes. . MND(N) may provide to the ICTY on a case-by-case basis: A liaison team to the ICTY team investigating a specific mass grave or suspected war crime site. AppendixK LAWANDMILITARYOPSINTHE BALKANS 1995-1998 425 Billeting (although ICTY will usually \"live on the economy\"}. Area security to prevent military intervention in the vicinity of the investigation site. Emergency medical care and medical evacuation. ICTY vehicle recovery and repair within limits of technical knowledge and parts availability. Liaison Teams: SFOR has no duty to provide direct security for ICTY investigators. However, MND(N} may direct that a liaison team, a low profile security team, be assigned to an ICTY investigation. Liaison teams remain removed from evidence collection activity, but within sight and communications range of ICTY team. The ICTY teams understand that they must defer to the tactical decisions of the senior liaison team member. Media Inquiries: All questions regarding the investigation should be directed towards ICTY. Be prepared to respond to ICTY-generated media inquiries about the discovery of war crimes evidence. + ICTY, not SFOR, determines the significance of war crimes evidence. ROE note: ICTY personnel are persons with designated special status. Reporting procedures: Provide oral report of ICTY activities daily to MND(N) G3 Battle CPT, MSE 553-2301. Follow this with a written report the CDR's ASSESSREP. . Non-ICTY exhumations. The OHR, IPTF, civilian police may coordinate legitimate non-ICTY exhumations with the consent of the Entities. Exhumations taking place in the ZOS must be coordinated with SFOR. Chapter 9 PRISONER RELEASE References: GFAP, Annex 1A, Art. II, para. 3; Art. IX, para. 1; Annex 6, Art. I; 11, Art. I, para. 1; SFOR SOP 3411; SFOR 1996; TFE FRAGO 2312: MND(N) Policy on Prisoner Release, distributed at MND(N) JMC on 20 August 1997. The Parties agreed in the GFAP (Annex 1A, Article IX) to release by 19 January 1996 all prisoners taken during the conflict. Therefore, anyone still imprisoned is an illegally-held \u00b7prisoner,\" and not a POW. In the fall of 1997, the VRS and AFBiH commanders in the MND(N) AOR declared in writing that they have no knowledge of any former POWs stilr in their custody. \u00b7 ICRC is responsible for prisoner releases. AppendixK 426 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS The IPTF should be called if civilian police have held the prisoners. MND(N) units should not volunteer their facilities for prisoner releases. SFOR will support ICRC and IPTF prisoner releases only by providing requested area security, emergency logistical support, or intelligence. SFOR will never offer payment or payment in kind for prisoners. Chapter 10 CIVILIAN CROWDS OR DEMONSTRATIONS References: .GFAP, Annex 1A, Art, II, para. 3; and Annex 11, Art. 1, para. 1; COMSFOR's Guidance on Property, Presence, Crowds, and Police (March 1997); CALL Newsletter No. 96-11; 28 April 1996 Information Paper; TFE FRAGO 2667. Bottom Line: Civilian law enforcement agencies, not SFOR, are responsible for maintaining civil order and ensuring civilian freedom ofmovement. SFOR is not structured for civil disturbance or riot control and should avoid getting involved in efforts by the local civilian authorities to quell civil disorder through appropriate measures. Unless a crowd, armed or unarmed, presents a threat to SFOR, its mission, or anotherparty, the Entities must take responsibility for police work. Indicators that a crowd movement may be a threat: Groups of more than fifty people, and groups that are entirely or mostly military-age males. Gatherings of women and children as a screen for a following crowd of military-age males. Advance media promotion. Failure to coordinate with police and government authorities on both sides of the IEBL, or with UNHCR or IPTF. Gatherings of counter-demonstrators, or persons intending to oppose the movement. Presence of weapons or any expression of hostile intent. + SFOR will: Immediately bring the crowd action to the attention of the local police. Take actions to delay, defuse, frustrate, or otherwise influence the crowd to disperse, if necessary: Close established checkpoints when a hostile confrontation is expected. . Establish temporary checkpoints to control the movement of hostile crowds. Disarm hostile civilian groups outside the ZOS. AppendixK LAW AND MILITARY OPS IN THE BALKANS 1995-1998 427 Take a position of tactical advantage over the crowd, regardless of whether the police are present, and observe, record (taking photographs if possible), and report. Disengage before being surrounded by the hostile crowd. Use force in accordance with the ROE. Support legitimate, controlled, non-threatening movement across the IEBL. Arrange advance meetings of IPTF, local political authorities, local police, and UNHCR. \u00b7 Enlist the support of faction military commanders. Ensure they understand that their forces may not become involved directly either to provide security or to block movement. Military faction support is limited to using their influence with civil authorities. Monitor properly coordinated events. Hold the Parties accountable when they fail to meet their responsibilities to ensure freedom of movement and to control civil violence. SFOR will not: Assume responsibility for controlling civil disturbances. Provide security for demonstrators. Interpose themselves between a crowd and its possible objective, or between crowds. \u00b7 Enter a crowd (except in accordance with the ROE to stop a serious . crime). Legal notes: A civilian crowd that meets peacefully and moves with no hostile intent is not illegal. However, such a crowd has the potential to become a mob and commit criminal acts. COMSFOR is the release authority for the use of riot control measures. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures: The most likely confrontation sites are at the IEBL. The next most likely confrontation site is the marchers' destination (e.g., a cemetery or village). Keep the crossing or visiting group on a bus. Check passengers for weapons. Halt the bus before it reaches a confrontation site. Do not allow passengers to dismount if there is an uncontrollable crowd at the destination. Prevent a counter-protest group from forming at the confrontation site. Establish temporary checkpoints on routes leading to the confrontation site. Check for weapons. Appendix K 428 CENTER FOR LAWAND MILITARY OPERATIONS Halt vehicles as far away as METT-T permits; force personnel to walk to the confrontation site. + Avoid conspicuous, stationary SFOR presence at a location where such a presence may draw a hostile crowd (i.e., next to a political party headquarters). When a hostile crowd gathers: Inner Ring: + Connect IPTF with the local police. Connect the SFOR MSC Commander with senior town officials. Keep civil police in front if a crowd gathers. Confiscate weapons from unauthorized persons. Using caution, get photos and video of participants, particularly agitators, and others who are not working to defuse the situation. Outer Ring: Be prepared to seal off Weapons Storage Sites that could affect situation. Be prepared to counter a misinformation campaign. Be prepared to meet with senior local officials. Be prepared to stop all traffic through affected SFOR checkpoints.

It is very tellingfrom many aspects. It talks about the mission from the top down to the specific mission ofthe claims convoy. It discusses Rules ofEngagement. attitudes ofthe Serbs toward the United States. and more. Bottom line: even the seemingly smallest oftasks and missions was a major undertaking, requiring planning and preparation. VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT OF FOREIGN CLAIMS CONVOY BRIEFING 9 AUGUST 1996 CPT __ OIC, FOREIGN CLAIMS CONVOY COMMANDER Good Morning! I'm Captain . I'm the convoy commander this morning. I'm the OIC for the mission. Sergeant First Class , who's driving the lead vehicle, also from the JAG Office, is the NCOIC of the mission. Today we're going out to pay claims. We're going to pay six claimants on the Serb side-six Serbian claimants for maneuver damage. As you know, when our tanks are rolling across the countryside, they ten up a lot of stuff. And today, we're going out to compensate individuals. These are not government officials. These are just regular people who had their property damaged by the United States Army. We typically have to go on back roads to find the claimants. Them are two cases today. We do not know exactly where we're going because all we have is the claimants name and his hometown. So we have to go to the town and our interpreter hops out and asks people in that town, \"Where does this guy live?, and then we go find the guy. So, it makes for interesting convoying. But, many times we have to tum our vehicles around. So what I'm going to do this morning is I'm going to talk about safety and I'm going to talk about the accomplishment ofour mission. Appendix 0 LAW AND MILITARY OPS IN THE BALKANS, 1995-1998 437 First, I want to talk about safety. We have five vehicles in the convoy today, and I'm going to talk to you about the order of the vehicles in a minute. But, the five vehicles are supposed to stay together at all times. If we have any kind of problem today with any of the vehicles, we're all stopping, okay? We are a unit. We operate as a unit today. We're not going to be getting too far separated. I want the five vehicles to stay together. When we are passing through the Zone of Separation, we can go a little bit further apart because of the danger of mines. But, other than that, when we are in regular non-mine territory, try to stay close together, okay? Now, let's look at the route first. We're leaving Dubrave Air Base and we are heading east on Route Hawk and then we're going to Osmaci which is a small Serb village. We're going to pay a claimant there. Then we're getting back on Route Sparrow and we're going to Zvomik and we're going to pay a claimant in Zvornik and then we are going to take Route Camel south, which is one of the prettiest routes I've seen in Bosnia. It's night on the Drina River the whole way. And we'll be passing a lot of beautiful scenery there, going through some mountain tunnels. We're going to end up in Vlasenica where the Id Brigade Headquarters is located. We're going to pay two claimants there and hopefully a third claimant there, if we can find him. We're going to eat lunch there at the 2'd BOE dining Hall which is one of the best chow halls in theater. On the way back, we're going to pay one claimant. We should be back as early as 3:30-as late as 5:30 this afternoon, okay? Now, when we cross the Zone of Separation here, in the Kalesija\u00ad Melici area, it's important you follow certain guidelines when you're driving your vehicles. First and foremost, you do not stop your vehicle on the side of the road. Everybody knows that. But, I want to reiterate it. That means that the way this vehicle is parked right now is not acceptable if we're stopping in the ZOS because the driver has to get out on dirt, okay? So, it should be further over here, so that people on both sides of the vehicle when they're getting out are getting out on hardtop. Does everybody understand that? [Affirmative response from everybody.) AppendixO 438 CENTERFORLAWANDMILITARYOPERATIONS I don't want any feet anywhere near grass an)where near the ZOS. Is everybody clear on that? [Affirmative response from everybody.) Okay. Let's talk about traffic control. When we stop our five vehicles on the side of the road when we're going to pay a claimant, I'm going to put an NCO in charge of the convoy while Sergeant and I and others go in to pay the claimant, okay? Sergeant is also the Class A agent on this mission. That means, that he actually has the money that we're going to pay the people in cash. I'm the Foreign Claims Commissioner. I'm the one that decides how much they get paid. Sergeant is, in the sense, the banker. He's the one that has the money. I'm not supposed to touch the money. He's the one that has the money, okay? So, Sergeant has to go in and pay the claimants with me today. I see some other good NCOs here today. So, I'm going to put one of you in charge when we go in. And you're going to be in charge of security of our vehicles and raffle control. Now hopefully, we're going to be able to park each time in a situation where our vehicles are off the road. But if our vehicles have to be in the road blocking one of the lanes of traffic I'm going to require you to put one person on each end. I want you to stop the traffic. I don't want you to kind of slow it down. I want you to stop it at both ends and then let it pass one direction at a time. Now, in order to stop a vehicle in Bosnia, you have to get in front of the vehicle, okay? You have to stand in its way and stop it. They do not know what these Army hand signals mean. They do not know what this means [gesturing]. Okay? So you have to literally get in front of them. And especially with trucks, that can be a real interesting experience because they're not really interested in stopping. And you have to stop them. The reason I say that is, we could have a serious injury if a truck is going past our convoy 25-30 kilometers and somebody is walking out from behind a Humvee. Humvees make a lot of noise when they're running. You can't hear the traffic that's coming by. \u00b7 AppendixO LAW AND MILITARY OPS IN THE BALKANS, 1995-1998 439 So, I want any vehicles that are going past our convoy to be crawling past. So, I'm going to ask-alright, we've got three interpreters on this mission. So we're fortunate. I'm going to ask the interpreters to also help out to be able to teach the person at either end how to say \"sporija,\" which means \"slowly.\" You're going to tell the people to go slowly, okay? And if they don't go slowly enough, then you're going to go back to them, stop them again, and tell them, \"puno sporija,\" which means, \"very slowly,\" okay? And you're going to emphasize that until they go slowly enough. Let me talk to you about if we get into a bad situation today. Now, we've been here in Bosnia for over seven months now. We have not had any fighting to speak of. Today could be the first day. We need to be prepared for that. I know that everyone kind of acts lulled to sleep. But we need to be prepared for something bad happening. If something happens, we're going to react to it. First of all, when we leave base today we're going to put a magazine in our weapons. We are not going to chamber rounds. We are not going to take our weapons off safe. Does everybody understand that? Everybody knows that, right? [Affirmative response from everybody.) Okay. The only time that you're going to load your weapon off safe and chamber a round is if I tell you to. Or, if I'm not able to tell you to, then you're going to use the good training the Army has given you, okay? We're going to follow the chain of command. We have a Major here today, we have NCOS, we have a Lieutenant. If I'm incapacitated, obviously, people who are supposed to take charge, I expect you to take charge. I expect you to do what you are trained to do, okay? Most importantly, I expect everybody to use their good common sense. It's not our job to engage the enemy, okay? It is our job to safely return to this base tonight. Our job is to pay foreign claims today. So, if we get into a situation where we are being fired on, our primary coal is to protect ourselves and get to a safe position. There are plenty of M1 Tank commanders and Bradley commanders in 2nd Brigade that have been itching to fire ever since we came to Bosnia. And they wrn be more than willing tp fire all of their large weapons. That is their mission when needed. Today we have only five Humvees and a M-60. So, we are riot prepared to do major combat. Appendix 0 440 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS First and foremost, we are going to use our vehicles to escape the situation, okay? If we are able to, we're going to try to drive out of the Situation. Drive forward, backward, sideways. Whichever way we have to go to get away. If we cannot use our vehicles, we're going to go to plan B. What is plan B? I don't know what plan B is. But, we'll come up with it at the time. I will be in charge. I will give orders. I expect everybody to follow those orders just as if we were in an organized unit okay? And that includes the way in which the rules of engagement work. In other words, decisions about whether or not we're going to actually fire our weapons, depends on the degree of threat with which are being confronted. Okay. We're going to have a good time today-We always have a good time on our claims missions. I know Sergeant Day has been before. I think you're the only that's been before. I got a lot of new people that haven't been on our missions before. This is our 20th mission. We've gotten to see a great deal of the countryside because we go on a lot of the back roads to find the claimants. The damage is usually done on a main MSR route. BUL the claimants don't live where the damage was done. They live up on a mountainside in a small house. So, we have to go find them The rear vehicle is. going to be in charge of the speed of the convoy. The rear vehicle decides how fast we go. Obviously, the front vehicle to a degree decides how fast we go. But, if there's one of the vehicles that can't keep up with the lead vehicles, the rear vehicle radios us and tells us. Tne rear vehicle is going to tell us every time we go through a tum, that they have completed the tum. So, the first four vehicles go through the tum. When the fifth vehicle goes through the tum, \"New York\" calls\" \"North Carolina\"' and says, \"North Carolina, we're through the tum-over.\" If we're going past a slow moving tractor, same thing. Many times when you're in the mountains, the front vehicle cannot see the rear vehicle because of the curves. When we pass a vehicle, many times the front vehicle makes a decision to pass a slow moving vehicle with enough space for perhaps two vehicles to get around, okay? Those first two vehjcles are going to then slow down and wait for a spare for the next three vehicles to have a chance to pass. There's very few places in Bosnia where there's ~nough room for Appendix 0 LAW AND MILITARY OPS IN THE BALKANS, 1995-1998 441 five vehicles to pass a slow moving vehicle. Especially in the mountains. So, you just got to be patient. Don't do anything that's dangerous. If you're in the third, fourth, or fifth vehicle, I don't want you to hurry and try to make a dangerous pass. We're going to be up there waiting for you. We're going to go slow until you have a chance to pass. So, wait for a good space to pass. Okay? The order of the vehicles today is ... the Civic Center from Tuzia West underneath Lieutenant is the fourth vehicle, and the Air Force vehicle is the fifth vehicle. Okay-any questions'? All of you have been well trained by the United States Air Force and United States Army. We are going to be on the Serbian side today. I always like to remind people that our efficient United States Air Force bombed the Serbs for about eighteen months. So, there's always going to be some people over there that don't like us. We have found that most people treat us very friendly because we are paying them. But, you know, if you see a situation that you're worried about I want you to bring it to my attention or one of the NCO's attention immediately, okay? The most important thing today is safety and security. I want everybody to come back safe. And if you got any situation that you're concerned about-if you see anybody with weapons-there's going to be one place where you're going to see a VRS soldier guarding a place that's . right across the street from where we're going to pay the water company. Don't w6rry about that. That's an army post. That is a containment area. They're allowed to have their people there. But, if you see somebody with a weapon-even worse, if you see somebody pointing a weapon, that's a serious thing that everybody needs to know about immediately, okay? Don't take your time coming up to tell me about it. I want you to run and tell me about it, okay? Alright. We're going to go out the east gate and we're going to tum right when we get to the east gate. Any questions? [Convoy member asked a question.] Yeah. It's on the front page of your itinerary. Did you get one? Appendix 0 442 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS [Affinnative response from convoy member.) Okay. Frequencies and passwords-good question. On the front page of your itinerary. Okay. Let's rock and roll.

SALATA LTC, JA Staff Judge Advocate Appendix Q(2) 454 CENTER FOR LAW AND MILITARY OPERATIONS Appendix Q(3): Sample Claims Status Report SAMPLE CLAIMS STATUS REPORT The following is a summary of the claims received at the Tuzla Airbase SJA. This report includes potential claims and claims filed at.the Brigade SJA Offices. Date of Amount Incident Claimed Neg. Amount Date Paid CLAIMS PAID Mr. Selimovic Safet 13 Jan 1996 3,300 OM 5500M 22 Feb 96 A U.S. Apache helicopter flew over Mr. Safet's house. The rotor wash knocked off 180-200 roof tiles, knocked over a fence, filed his house with soot, knocked over a stack of hay, and frightened his wife and children. I estimated that the tiles cost 2 OM a piece and the loss of about 1/3 of the hay was worth 60 OM. A professional roofer earns 35 OM per day. The remainder of the agreed amount was for the other miscellaneous damages. Mr. \u00b7Glavinic Hamdija 13 Jan 96 640M 640M 22 Feb 96 A U.S. Apache helicopter flew over Mr. Haindija's house. The rotor wash knocked off 22 roof tiles and tore off metal flashing. Iestimated that the tiles cost 1.5 OM a piece and the metal cost 20 OM. Since this wa5 the most reasonable claim I have received, I was not going to squabble over the remaining few marks. Mr. Mandalovic Seiko 14 Jan 96 4,600 OM 4,350 OM 22 Feb 96 The vehicle accident claim involves a U.S. Soldier. The accident occurred in Zivincie. The vehicle is a 1985 Opel Askona-C diesel. Originally the claim and estimate of repairs were for 9,839 OM. However, Mr. Seiko stated he could get the repairs done at a cheaper repair shop. He stated that he paid 7,000 OM for the vehicle in August 1995. kle has no receipts for the vehicle. According to Mr. Setko the diesel engine is brand new. The U.S. driver was cited for excessive speed. The only issue is the value of the vehicle vs. costs of the repairs. CLAIMS RECOMMENDED FOR APPROVAL Ourakavid Redzo 20Jan 96 5000M 5000M Pending A U.S. bulldozer buried about a 100 meters of his fence. His property is below a helicopter landing site. When they expanded the parking lot, they covered his fence with tons of dirt. The owner does not want us to remove the dirt. He only wants to replace his barb wire and wood post fence. Barb wire fences and posts cost about 6 DM per meter. This claim could be a lot higher. I will not argue about the price. Appendix Q(3) LAWANDMILITARYOPSINTHEBALKANS, 1995-1998 455 CLAIMS VOUCHERS SUBMITTED FOR PAYMENT Kovacevic Samid 19 Jan 96 2,239 OM 989 OM Pending This vehicle accident involved a U.S. soldier The claimant is claiming 1000 DM for stress, 250 OM for lost wages, and 989 OM for damage to his vehicle. According to the repair shop, the 1980 Zastava was totaled. They estimated the value at 1522 OM less 533 OM for salvage value. They used a standard 35% for salvage value. We settled on the cost of the vehicle (989 OM) Mrs. Zulic Devieta 23 Jan 96 SOOOM 3500M Pending A U.S. vehicle damaged the comer of her home and destroyed a few fruit trees. The woman is poor, elderly, and blind. There appears to be about 70 tiles missing and some structural roof damage. In my opinion, the value of the damage is about 300 OM. I will negotiate a fair settlement.
