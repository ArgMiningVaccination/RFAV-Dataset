UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Introduction to UCI The University of California David P. Gardner President The University of California was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the University's development was strongly influ\u00ad enced by leading educators and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward emi\u00ad nence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses\u00ad Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. All of the campuses adhere to the same admissions guidelines and high academic standards, yet each one has its own distinct character. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, and a school of veterinary medi\u00ad cine, as well as professional schools of business administra\u00ad tion, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The University's libraries are among the finest in the United States. In just over a century, the University has become one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher educa\u00ad tion. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished academic achievements. On its nine campuses, the University has a total of 14 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Sci\u00ad ence membership on all campuses numbers 214-greater than the total for any other college or university system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agri\u00ad cultural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 locations throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricul\u00ad tural and urban populations, and a broad program of continu\u00ad ing education for adults in the arts, business, and professions. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy and with support from other agencies, the University operates three national research facilities: the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory adjoining the Berkeley campus; the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, California; and the Los Alamos National Scientific Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Other major research facilities include Lick Observatory, White Mountain Research Station for high\u00ad altitude research, Laboratory of Radio Astronomy, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Institute of Transportation Studies, Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sciences Laboratory, Hormone Research Center, and Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of Uni\u00ad versity Professors. The University Professor title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recog\u00ad nized nationally and internationally as scholars and teachers of exceptional ability. A University Professor may visit a number of University of California campuses during the aca\u00ad demic year, holding conferences with students and staff and speaking before general public audiences. A list of University Professors may be found on page 291. University Administration. Under the State Constitution, governance of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the Univer\u00ad sity, and with the President's advice, appoint the Chancellors, Directors of major laboratories, Provosts, and Deans who administer the affairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the University as a whole. The Board of Regents includes seven ex officio board members, and 18 regular members who are appointed by the Governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an ad\u00ad visory committee. In addition, The Regents appoint a student Regent for a one-year term as a voting Board member with full rights of participation. A constitutional amendment pro\u00ad vides that \"Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural, and social diversity of the State, including ethnic minorities and women.\" They shall have \"full powers of organization and government; subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure com\u00ad pliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.\" The President is executive head of the total institution. Each of the nine campuses has a Chancellor as its chief administra\u00ad tive officer. The Chancellor is responsible for the organiza\u00ad tion and operation of the campus, including academic, stu\u00ad dent, and business affairs. For the names of University Regents, Officers, and Chancellors, see page 290. The Academic Senate, consisting of faculty and certain admin\u00ad istrative officers, determines the conditions for admission and degrees, subject to the approval of The Regents, authorizes and supervises courses and curricula, and advises the Univer\u00ad sity administration on the important matters of faculty appointments and promotions and budgets. Students participate in policymaking at both the campus and Systemwide levels. The Irvine Campus Daniel G. Aldrich, Jr. Chancellor The University of California, Irvine has achieved distinction nationally and internationally because of the high quality of its programs, faculty, and alumni. The campus challenges its students both academically and personally and relies on the commitment, curiosity, imagination, and judgment of faculty and students to assure its continued intellectual and cultural vitality. Since the campus opened in 1965, enrollment has grown to approximately 11,000, including 8,500 undergradu\u00ad ate students, 1,500 graduate students, and 1,000 medical stu\u00ad dents and residents as 6f fall1982. UCI is committed to the pursuit and transmission of knowl\u00ad edge. It makes available to its students opportunities for gain\u00ad ing knowledge, training, skills, and credentials which in turn can provide the basis for enhanced social and economic opportunities. With regard to making these opportunities available to all students, UCI has the responsibility to estab\u00ad lish and implement programs that go beyond legal minimums to ensure that all qualified segments of the public have access and equal opportunity to participate in the University's aca\u00ad demic programs. Academic Goals The University of California, Irvine offers programs designed to provide students with a foundation on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. The programs and curricula are based on the belief that a student's collective University experience should provide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellec\u00ad tual identity and life-long learning. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984The Irvine Campus 5 UC IRVINE - 1983-19846 The Irvine Campus An important aspect of the educational approach at UCI is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Independent research in laboratories, field study, involvement in writing workshops, and participation in fine arts productions are normal elements of the UCI expe\u00ad rience. In many departments special programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activ\u00ad ities are integrated into the curriculum. The Irvine campus provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholarship at all levels, to the exploration of the accumulated knowledge of mankind, and to the devel\u00ad opment of new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, Irvine has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic under\u00ad standing of the problems of society. Academic Structure Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on funda\u00ad mental areas of knowledge, while at the same time provide for interdisciplinary and professional study. Five basic Schools represent five fundamental areas of knowledge: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and profes\u00ad sional studies are offered in the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Program in Social Ecology, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the Office of Teacher Education. The UCI-California Col\u00ad lege of Medicine provides educational programs for medical and health sciences graduate students, medical residents, and practicing physicians. Programs in physical education, recrea\u00ad tion, and intercollegiate athletics are provided by the Department of Physical Education. The Office of Academic AHairs has responsibility for all pro\u00ad grams of instruction and research. Matters of educational policy, including approval -of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The Irvine Division is part .of the Academic Senate of the University of California. The Office of the Vice Chancellor Student Affairs provides students with a broad range of special services and programs designed to carry out the University's commitment to create an environment supportive of an educational endeavor of the highest quality. Student Affairs programs and services offer students the opportunity to supplement their formal educa\u00ad tional experience by becoming involved in diverse aspects of the University. Such programs and services can broaden the student's University experience by providing opportunities for personal development in addition to intellectual growth. The Dean of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for a vari\u00ad ety of activities relating to the undergraduate educational environment .at the Irvine campus. These act.ivities include coordination of academic .advising services, instructional improvement .activities, consultation and liaison with a vari\u00ad ety of Academic Senate committees responsible for under\u00ad graduate academic policies, instructional use of \u00b7computing, and advising campus administrative officers about under\u00ad graduate educational issues ..

UC IRVINE - 1983-1984The Campus Setting UCI's location offers the cultural and economic resources of an urban area along with access to the scenic, recreational areas of Southern California. Located 40 miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in 1,510 acres of coastal foothills near Newport Beach, UCJ lies amid rapidly growing residential communities and a dynamic national and multinational business and industrial complex that affords many employment opportunities. Even so, the campus remains an oasis of green-a natural arboretum planted with trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adja\u00ad cent to the campus lies UCI's outdoor laboratory, the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which is home to a wide variety of migratory and nonmigratory water fowl and other wildlife. The UCI Medical Center, located in the City of Orange on a 33-acre site, is a major teaching hospital for the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine. A major redevelopment pro\u00ad gram is in progress at the Medical Center and includes the recently opened six-level Medical Center Tower, which pro\u00ad vides space for many of the varied activities at this compre\u00ad hensive health education, service, and research facility. Within a few miles of the campus are major department stores; branches of world-renowned boutiques; dozens of outstanding restaurants, many offering cuisines from a vari\u00ad ety of other countries; and major hotels. Cultural opportuni\u00ad ties include repertory theatres, orchestras, choral groups, dance companies, galleries, and museums. The John Wayne Airport is two miles from campus. Yet, in part, the Irvine area retains some of its traditional character as a beach-although not a sleepy-resort. The Portuguese dory fishing fleet at Newport, one of the last private fleets on the West Coast, comes ashore every morn\u00ad ing and evening to sell the day's catch, and the sun and surf crowd mingle with the art and artisan crowd at Laguna Beach during the summer and winter festivals. The temper\u00ad ate, Mediterranean climate stimulates year-round water\u00ad oriented activities such as windsurfing, sailing, and tidepool\u00ad ing. The spring, summer, fall, and winter find students\u00ad many of whom live in the nearby beach communities of Bal\u00ad boa Island, Balboa Peninsula, and Newport Beach-enjoying the warm sun and gentle sea breezes. Boating enthusiasts set sail in Newport Bay in 14-or 30-foot sailboats or in canoes, available from the UCI Sailing Club. Local mountain and desert recreation areas are within easy reach, and the UCI Cooperative Outdoor Program provides low-cost rental equipment for hiking and skiing, and instruction for other recreational pursuits. The metropolitan attractions of Los Angeles and San Diego are approximately an hour's drive from the campus. Bus transportation between the campus and major housing areas, shopping centers, and beaches is convenient, and bi\u00ad cycling is popular. Both the campus and the surrounding communities are designed to encourage bicycle traffic, and trails connect UCI to many student housing areas and to the waterfront areas of Newport Beach. Instructional and Research Facilities University Library Calvin J. Boyer University Librarian The UCI Library is a component of the extensive University of California Library system, whose libraries contain more than 15 million volumes. These libraries are committed to a resource-sharing plan which will strengthen the resource base and usefulness of UCI's own library system. Established The Irvine Campus 7 in 1963, the UCI Library collection has been carefully selected and developed in conjunction with the campus academic plan. The UCI Library system includes the Main Library, the Phys\u00ad ical Sciences Library, and the Biomedical Library. This impor\u00ad tant resource for study, teaching, and research contains more than 1,037,000 volumes, including more than 14,000 cur\u00ad rently active serials subscriptions. Except for those materials which comprise the Medical Center Branch Library, all of these volumes are housed on the general campus. In addition, a student may request books from other University of Cali\u00ad fornia libraries and from national and international libraries. The Main Library is designed to provide maximum shelving and reader space. With the exception of materials housed in special units, all periodicals and books are on open shelves and easily accessible to all readers. The following Library departments provide specialized services to the users of the Main Library. The Reference Department contains an open-shelf collection numbering some 22,000 volumes. Librarians in the Reference Department assist in the use of the reference tools and are prepared to find answers for a wide variety of library and campus questions. Informal instruction and guides designed for specific service areas are available. Formal instruction is offered through a course which introduces students to library research techniques (Humanities 75: Biblio Strategy). Bibliographical sessions for classes can be arranged by appli\u00ad cation at the Reference Desk. The Government Publications Department contains a collec\u00ad tion of more than 400,000 publications issued by the U.S. government, Canada, the State of California, and interna\u00ad tional organizations. This department also contains the Orange County Public Affairs Collection, a resource of cur\u00ad rent documents on local affairs issued by both governmental and nongovernmental agencies. The Department of Special Collections contains noncirculat\u00ad ing holdings of rare books and early printed works, note\u00ad worthy or finely printed editions, exceptionally costly or fragile items, and manuscripts. Special subject collections include French literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Rene Wellek collection of the history of criti\u00ad cism, California history and literature, British naval history, contemporary poetry, dance, historical costume, and political pamphlet literature. The University Archives, which shares quarters with the Department of Special Collections, is the official repository for records having permanent value in documenting the his\u00ad tory of the UCI campus. These include publications and other records of administrative and academic units, student organi\u00ad zations, and campus support groups. The Library Media Center collects, organizes, and makes available to library users nonprint materials which support campus academic programs. The Center also houses the David S. Saxon collection of recorded music which contains cassette tapes of classical and other music. The Center pro\u00ad vides a playback area which allows for on-site consultation of materials in its collection. Terminals connected to campus computers are also available, along with an audio cassette tape duplication service and a media classroom. The Center provides a media reference and advisory service to the cam\u00ad pus. A collection of film classics is also retained at the Center. UC IRVINE - 1983-19848 The Irvine Campus The Serials Department includes a reading room in which current periodical and journal issues are on display. This De\u00ad partment also provides reference service on microform collec\u00ad tions housed in the microform room. This room is equipped with a variety of microform readers and has facilities for copying from microfilm and microfiche. The Main Library Copying Service, supplemented by coin\" operated copying machines, makes it possible to obtain reproduction service at all times when the Main Library is open. Required or collateral reading materials are placed in the Reserve Book Room by faculty members for their students. Reserve materials circulate for short periods of time and are listed on computer-produced lists by course numbers. Other Main Library facilities include coin-operated type\u00ad writers, individual study seating, book lockers, and rooms containing study aids for blind and partially sighted students. When the University is in session, the Main Library is open 90 hours per week. The Physical Sciences Library is located in the Physical Sci\u00ad ences Building, and contains over 58,000 volumes on mathe\u00ad matics, physics, astronomy, and chemistry. The collection includes more than 900 current serial titles. Hours of service are the same as those in the Main Library, and copying ser\u00ad vices are available. The Biomedical Library (formerly the Medical Sciences Library) is located in the UCI-California College of Medicine, and contains a collection of some 110,000 volumes of medical and biological literature, with subscriptions to more than 1,600 serial titles. Among the audiovisual services provided are microform reader/printers, video tape players, and slide projectors with tape players. The Biological Sciences branch of the Biomedical Library is located in the Science Lecture Hall, with a large collection of current journals. The Medical Center Library is located at the University of California Irvine Medical Center. Its collection includes 28,000 volumes and several hundred clinical journal sub\u00ad scriptions. This library serves primarily as the library for the Medical Center and is part of the campus library resources. Modern methods for increasing the speed and efficiency of library service have been or are being installed throughout the UCI Library system. The Library subscribes to a computer-based cataloging service which enables it to make books available rapidly. A computer-based circulation system is installed in all libraries. On-line literature searching ser\u00ad vices are offered in a variety of machine-readable data bases. Information on this service may be obtained at the reference desks in all libraries. Interlibrary loan service is available on a national and inter\u00ad national basis to all faculty, students, and staff. Bus service to UCLA is offered Monday through Saturday for faculty and students who need to use the UCLA libraries. Computing Facility The Computing Facility provides interactive and batch com\u00ad puting services to students, faculty, and staff on four multi\u00ad user computer systems (a Xerox Sigma-7, a Digital Equip\u00ad ment Corporation DECsystem-10, a DEC PDP-11/45, and a DEC VAX 11/750) and a dozen single-user graphics micro\u00ad computer systems (Terak 8510/a's). These systems can accommodate more than 200 users at a time. The Facility also provides, for research use only, computing services on a DEC VAX 11/780. Staff provide technical, operational, and managerial support for certain departmentally owned com\u00ad puter systems as well. Computing at UCI is distinguished by the campus' commit\u00ad ment since its founding to make computing an integral part of the academic program at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and by the commitment to extensive use of interactive computing. Almost half of the students are involved with some form of instructional computing every year. The Facility operates a data communication network which provides access to all the multi-user systems it operates and to other systems from more than 700 incoming lines. The network serves private offices throughout the campus, gen\u00ad eral terminal areas on campus, and almost 50 lines connected to the public telephone system. The systems at the Computing Facility support a wide vari\u00ad ety of applications packages and programming languages. The Facility provides orientation sessions and instructional seminars for students, faculty, and staff on various aspects of using local systems. It also provides documentation and con\u00ad sulting support to users of these systems. Regular instruction in programming and other aspects of computing is provided by the Department of Information and Computer Science, other academic units, and University Extension. Information about campus computing services is available at the Computing Facility's Office of Production Services, 364 Computer Science Building, telephone (714) 856-5953. Research The University of California, Irvine is among the leading 75 research universities in the United States. In 1981-82 UCI received approximately $37 million from federal and state agencies and private organizations for the support of basic and applied research and for other scholarly activity. One of UCI's goals is to rank among the top 50 research universities in the country by the end of this decade. Research is an inte\u00ad gral part of all schools and departments, and many of UCI's research programs have achieved national and international distinction for their work. The research programs at UCI have a positive impact on both undergraduate and graduate education. Research is critical to graduate education because of the research-oriented nature of doctoral study. At the undergraduate level, research at UCI provides undergraduate students with access to a faculty made up of researchers at the forefront of their fields. As a consequence, the knowledge received by UCI students is the latest and most up-to-date available. The Graduate Studies and Research section (see p. 71) describes additional research activities and organizations. Laser Microbeam Program The Laser Microbeam Program (LAMP) was established on the Irvine campus in 1979 as a national facility in the area of laser microbeam biotechnology. LAMP functions as a research, training, and service facility, and provides inter\u00ad action between the laser industry and the academic biomedi\u00ad cal research community. The facility serves as a resource to promote research in cell biology, developmental biology, neu\u00ad robiology, genetics, oncology, and clinical medicine. Micro\u00ad surgery is performed at subcellular, cellular, and tissue levels. The program is conducted in the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine and is funded through a grant from the Biotechnology Resources Program of the National Institutes of Health. For further information, telephone (714) 856-5139. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Natural Land and Water Reserves System The University of California manages and maintains a sys\u00ad tem of 26 reserves that are representative of the State's habi\u00ad tat and geographic diversity. These serve as outdoor labora\u00ad tories for students, faculty, and staff, and are intended primarily for purposes of education and research. The reserves are administered by local campus management committees who control their uses.

UC IRVINE - 1983-198410 The Irvine Campus UCI Medical Center and Community Clinics The UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) is a fully accredited gen\u00ad eral and emergency care hospital located in the City of Orange. UCI-California College of Medicine faculty and resi\u00ad dent physicians are the professional staff for medical services at the Center; a full complement of inpatient and outpatient services in virtually all medical specialties is offered. The Medical Center provides the only designated comprehensive emergency service in Orange County; it is also the desig\u00ad nated Countywide Level I tertiary trauma referral center. The Center serves as a principal facility for teaching and re\u00ad search programs for the UCI-California College of Medicine. Licensed for 493 beds, the Medical Center currently serves 17,500 inpatient admissions, 106,150 outpatient visits, and 46,500 adult and pediatric emergency visits. The availability of advanced technology and the nationally recognized expertise of members of the staff have made UCI Medical Center a regional referral center for the diagnosis and treatment of many medical problems. For example, a recently acquired artificial pancreas for use in the care of dia\u00ad betic patients is one of just a few in the country. One of the nation's major burn centers, and the only one in Orange County, is located at the Medical Center. UCIMC also serves as a center for the surgical replantation of severed limbs. In addition, UCIMC is recognized for its programs for high-risk obstetrical patients and critically ill infants and is the regional perinatal center for Orange County. A major redevelopment program is underway at the Medical Center to provide an enhanced professional, functional, and a more attractive environment for patient care and educational programs. The recently opened six-level Medical Center Tower houses diagnostic radiology services, emergency and trauma facilities, obstetrical facilities, and private and semi\u00ad private patient rooms. The redevelopment program includes plans for renovating existing buildings, removing out-dated structures, and constructing new facilities, including a medi\u00ad cal sciences library. The library should be completed in fall 1983 and is planned as the first component of a proposed modular facility system that will include buildings for inpa\u00ad tient and outpatient diagnostic services and for instructional and research programs. UCI clinical facilities also include the Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC) in Santa Ana and the North Orange County Community Clinic (NOCCC) in Anaheim. Both clinics provide educational experiences and patient ser\u00ad vices in primary care. Important components of UCI's medical education and re\u00ad search programs are also conducted at affiliated hospitals and clinics, in particular, the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach; Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach; and Childrens Hospital of Orange County. For further information about University-operated clinical facilities and other facilities associated with the UCI Clinical Services System, see the UCI-California College of Medicine section. Southern Occupational Health Center In 1980 the University established occupational health cen\u00ad ters in Northern and Southern California.

University Program for High School Scholars Through the University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS), qualified high school students may enroll in UCI courses, receive grades based on the same standards as full\u00ad time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. UCI enrollment is concurrent with the par\u00ad ticipant's junior-or senior-year high school enrollment. UPHSS is designed to provide the high school student with an enriched education at a substantially advanced level. Stu\u00ad dents are given the opportunity to take courses of interest beyond those which their high schools offer. Along with the academic advantages, participants have a chance to expe\u00ad rience an early orientation to University life. For further information, please see page 33. How to Use the Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, descriptions of schools and departments, and descriptions of student activities and services. Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. Courses described in the Catalogue are subject to change without notice, and some listed courses are not offered each year. The quarterly Schedule of Classes, a publi\u00ad cation available from the Registrar's Office shortly before registration begins each quarter, provides more current information on classes to be offered, instructors, how to enroll, enrollment restrictions (for example, open to majors only, or consent of instructor required), class hours, room assignments, and final examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for even more up-to-date information. Admission to UCI does not guaran\u00ad tee enrollment in any particular course. Please refer to Major Campus Publications, page 49. Presentation of information in the UCI General Catalogue is divided into five main concepts: 1. Introduction to UCI: Introductory material about the Uni\u00ad versity and the Irvine campus 2. Preadmission Matters: Information of interest to potential students Contact with UCI Preparing for University Work Undergraduate and Graduate Degrees and Areas of Study Majors and Careers Placement Testing Student Affirmative Action Expenses and Fees Financial Aid Undergraduate Admissions 3. Information for Admitted Students Planning an Undergraduate Program Enrollment and Other Procedures Orientation, Major Campus Publications, and Supplemen- tary Educational Programs Academic Regulations and Procedures Program of Academic Support Services Campus and Student Life Campus and Student Services 4. Information on the Division of Undergraduate Studies and Research 5. Schools and Programs: Individual descriptions of the aca\u00ad demic programs available at UCI UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Following these major sections of the Catalogue is informa\u00ad tion about University and UCI officers, University Profes\u00ad sors, student discipline and conduct, student records, an index, and campus and locality maps. For a more detailed description of each section of the Cata\u00ad logue, students should refer to the Table of Contents. Academic Units Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on five fun\u00ad damental areas of knowledge, while at the same time provid\u00ad ing for interdisciplinary and professional study. In the Cata\u00ad logue, the five basic Schools are presented first: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and profes\u00ad sional studies are presented next: Information and Computer Science, Social Ecology, Engineering, Management, Medicine, and Teacher Education. The program in physical education, recreation, and intercollegiate athletics is presented last. Included in the academic unit descriptions are the following kinds of information: a. A brief description of what areas are covered in the School or Program and a brief statement of the educational philoso\u00ad phy and orientation of the unit. b. Lists of faculty members, the institutions from which they received their highest degrees, and their academic areas of interest. c. Requirements for the undergraduate and graduate degrees offered. d. Special areas of study offered (referred to as concentra\u00ad tions, specializations, emphases, tracks, subareas, modules, or options). e. Advice about planning a program of study, and other information relevant to the academic progress and experience of students majoring in fields within each School or Program. f. Courses offered, divided into undergraduate and graduate course listings; those units that are departmentalized present their courses according to the department. Course Listings Undergraduate courses are classified as \"lower division\" and refers to courses numbered 100- 199. Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate courses. \"Lower division\" usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, \"upper division\" to junior-senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper\u00ad division courses when upper-division standing is not a pre\u00ad requisite. Prerequisites for courses should be noted carefully; a course has no prerequisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) normally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a course number usually designates a laboratory course. The \"(4)\" or \"(4-4-4)\" designation following the course title indicates the unit credits toward the 180 quarter units needed to graduate. Each \"4\" represents four quarter units. The letters F, W, or S after the course number and title indi\u00ad cate the quarter(s) in which the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring. The word Summer appears if the course is offered in Summer Session of the academic year covered by this issue of the UCI General Catalogue. While efforts have been made to provide information on when a course is How to Use the Catalogue 13 offered, such information is not always available in time for inclusion in the Catalogue. The designation (4) F, W, S indi\u00ad cates a single course offered that can be taken only once for credit; a (4-4-4) F, W, S designation indicates that credit may be earned in each quarter. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a roman numeral at the end of the course description. UC IRVINE - 1983-198414 Preparing for University Work Preparing for University Work A carefully planned program of high school courses provides students with the best preparation for University work. It can give them a definite edge in their undergraduate studies and the opportunity to do advanced preparation for their chosen field of study. Most important, if students master cer\u00ad tain basic subjects and skills in high school, they substantially increase their chances of success at the University. The \"a through f\" requirements for admission to the Univer\u00ad sity of California are minimum entrance standards. Complet\u00ad ing the required high school courses with satisfactory grades will not automatically prepare students for freshman work in every subject, much less in their major or program of study. Many entering students discover that they are not ade\u00ad quately prepared for basic University courses, such as English composition and calculus, which they are expected to take in their freshman year. Also, many undergraduate majors, par\u00ad ticularly those in the sciences and mathematics, require more high school preparation than that necessary for admission to the University. This lack of preparation can cause problems for students who do not choose a major until after they enter the University, or for those who prepare for one major but later decide to change to another. For these reasons, students should take courses that will pre\u00ad pare them beyond minimum levels of competence in reading, writing, and mathematics. A student who i~ well-prepared for University work will have taken four years of English in high school, three to four years of mathematics, two to three years of foreign language, two to three years of laboratory science, one year of history, and one or more years of art or humanities. It is important to appreciate that good study skills and study habits are essential for doing well at the University. For example, students will need to know how to be effective in reading a textbook, how to approach word problems in sci\u00ad ence and mathematics, how to take useful notes in lectures, and how to plan and enforce their own study schedule. These skills are developed in the more advanced courses in high school. In addition, University courses often assume that background material is fresh in the student's mind and thoroughly mastered. Therefore, a student should take as challenging a high school program as possible, with a full academic course load through the senior year. If a student takes more than the minimum number of courses required in an \"a through f\" subject, only the highest grade(s) will be used in determining the grade point average. Thus, by taking a challenging academic program in high school, a student can improve the probability of success at the University without jeopardizing their qualifications for admission. Reading Many students are not prepared for either the kinds or amounts of reading demanded of freshmen at the University. Each student should become proficient in reading and under\u00ad standing technical materials and scholarly works and should learn to read analytically and critically, actively questioning the author's intentions, viewpoint, arguments, and conclu\u00ad sions. Students should also become familiar, and comfortable, with the conventions of standard written English, and with various writing strategies and techniques. Reading expe\u00ad rience should include original works in their entirety, not just textbooks and anthologies, and should encompass a wide variety of forms and topics. Writing Effective critical thinking and proficiency with the written language are closely related, and both are skills which every University student must master. By University standards, a student who is proficient in English composition is able to (a) understand the assigned topic; (b) select and develop a theme by argument and example; (c) choose words which aptly and precisely convey the intended meaning; (d) con\u00ad struct effective sentences, i.e., sentences that economically and successfully convey the writer's ideas and display a vari\u00ad ety of structures; (e) demonstrate an awareness of the con\u00ad ventions of standard written English, avoiding such errors as sentence fragments, run-together sentences, faulty agree\u00ad ments, and improper pronoun references; and (f) punctuate, capitalize, and spell correctly. A student planning to attend the University must take Eng\u00ad lish courses in high school that require the development and practice of these skills. University entrance requirements include at least four years of English composition and litera\u00ad ture that stress expository writing: the development of per\u00ad suasive critical thinking on the written page. Mathematics Many undergraduate majors require preparation in mathe\u00ad matics beyond that necessary for admission to the University. All majors in the natural and life sciences, engineering, and mathematics require calculus. Many majors in the social scic ences require statistics or calculus, sometimes both. If a stu\u00ad dent has selected a major that requires either calculus or sta\u00ad tistics, that course should be taken during the freshman year at the University. Calculus is also required for undergraduates preparing for careers in environmental sciences, dentistry, medicine, optometry, pharmacy, and biostatistics. Many students are not aware of the large number of fields outside the natural and mathematical sciences which require calculus or statistics as prerequisites. Students should prepare for University courses in calculus while still in high school. In addition to the two years of mathematics required for admission, a second year of algebra and a year of precalculus mathematics are essential. These courses should include (a) basic operations with numerical and algebraic functions; (b) operations with exponents and radicals; (c) linear equations and inequalities; (d) polynomials and polynomial equations; (e) functions and their graphs; (f) trigonometry, logarithms, and exponential functions; and (g) applications and word problems. Students who plan to enter a field which requires statistics should take at least the second year of algebra. Students not proficient in basic and intermediate algebra will be at an enormous disadvantage in the University. It will be necessary to take one or more precalculus courses before tak\u00ad ing calculus, and preparatory courses may be essential before taking statistics. The necessity to take these preparatory courses could seriously delay a student's progress in under\u00ad graduate studies. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Undergraduate and Graduate Degrees and Areas of Study Degree Titles Titles of degrees awarded may not correspond exactly with specific fields of study offered at UCI. For example, graduate students in Anatomy, Microbiology, and Physiology and Bio\u00ad physics all earn the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences.

UC IRVINE - 1983-198416 Undergraduate Areas of Study Undergraduate Majors, Concentrations, and Associated Areas of Study Undergraduate majors are offered in all of the bachelor's degree programs on the list of degree titles; the degree pro\u00ad grams are referred to as \"majors\" in the following list. In association with these majors, UCI offers many formal Con\u00ad centrations, three of which are available in more than one academic unit. A Concentration may be thought of as a particular area of study requiring less units of work than does a major; it is similar to a \"minor,\" which is not officially offered at UCI, in that areas of concentration pursued by students are not listed on the baccalaureate diploma. Students can concentrate their elective courses (meaning those courses that are not needed to fulfill specific requirements) to complete the equivalent of a minor and to pursue other areas of study.

Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. (Students entering the School of Humanities as freshmen may declare a major in a specific department or program upon entrance. If they do not wish to declare their major as an entering freshman, the next opportunity to do so will be at the end of the sophomore year.) In preparation for choosing a major, students need to famil\u00ad iarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its many programs. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. Much depends on initiative-on how fully a student takes advantage of opportunities that come through sugges\u00ad tions for further study and through informal communication with faculty and students. The General Catalogue is a good place to find specific infor\u00ad mation about programs available, requirements for majors, and course offerings. At UCI a number of traditionally separ\u00ad ate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is influenced by a wide range of interactions among disciplines. As a complement to class\u00ad room study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, laboratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and fine arts productions. In addition to consulting the Catalogue, students are encour\u00ad aged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors about the opportunities which are open to them. They may go to any department in order to learn more about its pro\u00ad grams of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limitations. While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. All students are expected to choose a major by the beginning of the junior year. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students need to keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and prevent moving to a major in a different field, without delaying the time to graduation. Furthermore, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between ex\u00ad posure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under considera\u00ad tion. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree require\u00ad ments of any two programs. Once a student decides on a major, the actual procedure to formalize the decision is not complicated. A form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be com\u00ad pleted whenever a student who has no major is ready to declare one, or whenever a student wishes to change from one major to another. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Unaffiliated (Undeclared) Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sopho\u00ad mores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major until they have been on campus for a while. Such students partici\u00ad pate in the General Studies Advising Program (GSAP) which is administered by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. The goal of GSAP is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are expected to choose their major by the beginning of their junior year. To make a good decision about what major to declare, the student should know what programs UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of his or her abilities and interests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of his or her vocational goals and of the academic programs at UCI that will provide appropriate prep\u00ad aration for them. In GSAP students receive individualized counseling that helps them explore the variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own inter\u00ad ests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for possible careers .. Preprofessional Preparation Law Law schools want to produce lawyers to serve the entire legal spectrum (for example tax, criminal, entertainment, or immi\u00ad gration law), and this requires a wide range of academic backgrounds. Law schools look less for specific areas of study than they do for evidence of excellence in any academic pro-Unaffiliated Students/Preprofessional A good record in physics or classics, for example, will be preferred over a mediocre record in history or political science. The majority of law schools give equal preference to students from all academic disciplines. Courses that help develop writing and analytical skills (logic, writing, mathe\u00ad matics, and statistics courses, for example) build skills that are the key to doing well on the LSAT, succeeding in law school, and entering the legal profession. UCI offers a number of law-related courses that students in any major may take. The School of Humanities offers courses in logic and the philosophy of law. The School of Social Sciences offers courses in the study of law, interna\u00b7 tiona! relations, and economics of law and recommends that students take some political science courses as well. The Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology offers many law-related courses and offers its majors the opportunity to apply theories learned in the classroom to actual social environmental problems through its field study program. Students interested in applying to law school after complet\u00ad ing the baccalaureate degree should know that law schools look closely at five aspects of a student's application: grades, Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) results, the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities and law\u00b7related work experience. Students should be aware that not everyone who applies is admitted to law school. One consideration in selecting an undergraduate major is alternative career opportunities should one's career goals change or should experience with law school result in a decision not to enter the field of law. UC IRVINE - 1983-198420 Preprofessional Preparation/Careers Medicine and Other Health-Related Sciences Although leaders in health science education strongly recommend that students obtain a bachelor's degree prior to admission to the health sciences, there is no preferred major. Many students choose majors which may not be immediately related to their career objectives. Many students who plan to enter the health professions major in Biological Sciences because much of the basic course work for that major is the same as the preparation required for medical school admis\u00ad sion; however, students may major in any academic field as long as they also take the courses required by professional health science schools. The minimum amount of undergrad\u00ad uate preparation required by most medical and health-related schools includes the following: one year each of English, biol\u00ad ogy with laboratory, general chemistry with laboratory, organic chemistry with laboratory, physics with laboratory, and college mathematics, especially statistics. Courses in cell or molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, developmental physiology or comparative anatomy, and embryology are recommended, as is course work in computer science. In addi\u00ad tion, some health sciences schools have certain nonscience course requirements or recommended courses in, for exam\u00ad ple, English and/or a foreign language. Facility with the Span\u00ad ish language is very helpful in California medical schools and in other areas of the United States with large Hispanic populations. Although many factors ultimately are considered when reviewing applicants for admission, admission committees look carefully at the following seven areas: college grade point average (science and nonscience grades are evaluated separately and evidence of improvement in work during the undergraduate years is important); results of the New Medi\u00ad cal College Admissions Test (MCAT), the Dental Admissions Test, and other aptitude examination scores; the student's personal essay and/or personal interview; in-depth letters of recommendation; practical experience in the health sciences, whether paid or volunteer, is regarded favorably as an indica\u00ad tion of exposure to and interest in the health sciences; extra\u00ad curricular activities which demonstrate the applicant's ability to interact successfully with others; and research experience-especially in a biological, medical, or behavioral science. Since medical programs cannot accommodate all qualified applicants, and competition for entrance is keen, it is impor\u00ad tant to keep in mind alternative career opportunities should one not be accepted to medical, dental, pharmacy, optometry, podiatry, or veterinary school, or should one decide to pursue instead one of the expanding number of health-related pro\u00ad grams now available. Business The contemporary business executive or manager must be a creative thinker, make complex decisions, and have the ability to perceive and participate in the full scope of an enterprise while understanding its role in the economy. Effective man\u00ad agement requires leadership ability, strong problem-solving skills, effective oral and written communication skills, analyt\u00ad ical skills, an understanding of economic trends, and a basic knowledge of behavioral processes in organizations. Although UCI does not offer a prebusiness program leading to an undergraduate degree, it does offer the two-year Con\u00ad centration in Management Studies as a supplement to any undergraduate major. This Concentration can provide stu\u00ad dents with a broad understanding of management theory and practice. In addition, the concentration can help students determine whether they wish to pursue a career in business or management or undertake further study in management at the graduate level. This undergraduate concentration is offered through the Graduate School of Management. Students can also supplement their major course work to develop the skills needed for business and management by taking electives such as calculus and basic statistics, econom\u00ad ics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, psychology and sociol\u00ad ogy, computer science, and political science courses. Most graduate programs in business administration or man\u00ad agement do not require prior undergraduate course work in business. However, most programs do look for supplemen\u00ad tary course work that is relevant to the student's intended graduate or professional work. For admission purposes, graduate schools of business look at five areas: grades, scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the applicant's statement of pur\u00ad pose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and evidence of leadership in school and community activities and work expe\u00ad rience. The latter is becoming an increasingly important pre\u00ad requisite for many programs. Career Opportunities Any major can lead to any number of careers. Some examples of careers frequently led to by majors available within the academic units at UCI are listed below. The eight academic units at UCI which offer undergraduate education leading to the bachelor's degree provide students with a variety of opportunities to explore a wide range of interests leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. The lists which follow are meant to indicate to students the many and varied career areas pursued by UCI graduates, and to make students aware of some of the vast array of career choices available. Addi\u00ad tional discussions of careers are presented in individual aca\u00ad demic unit sections. Biological Science Career Areas Audiology Bioanalysis Biochemistry Cell Biology Clinical Chemistry Dentistry Developmental Biology Dietetics Environmental Management Forestry Health Administration Industrial Hygiene Marine Biology Medical Technology Medicine Microbiology Oceanography Optometry Plant Biology Pharmacy Podiatry Prosthetics Design Research Sales Social Work Speech Pathology Teaching Veterinary Medicine The health field is one of the fastest-growing career areas in the country. Work sites may include private corporations, educational institutions, hospitals, health care complexes, private foundations, city and county governments, state agencies, the federal government, and many others. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Engineering Career Areas Aerospace Communications Computers Construction Electric Power Electronics Engines and Fuels Environmental Control Process Control Public Works Transportation Water Resources The above is a sample of the many fields in which UCI Engi\u00ad neering graduates work. Their activities typically involve them in one or more of the following: design, research and development, manufacturing or construction, operations, consulting, applications and sales, management, or teaching. At UCI they will have had the choice of civil, electrical, mechanical, or environmental engineering, but they will fre\u00ad quently find challenging positions in related areas for which their general and specialty courses at UCI, followed by formal or informal, on-the-job training will qualify them, such as aeronautical, biomedical, chemical, or industrial engineering. Approximately half of UCI's Engineering graduates eventu\u00ad ally obtain advanced degrees (at UCI or elsewhere), and almost all engage in some sort of continuing education to keep abreast of advances in technology. Many Engineering graduates have used their engineering background to enter graduate programs and obtain degrees in the fields of admin\u00ad istration, law, medicine, physics, or mathematics. Fine Arts Career Areas Advertising Animation Arts Administration Art Therapy Broadcasting Choreography Commercial Art Curating Direction Environmental Design Instrument Repair/Tuning Interior/Industrial Design Jewelry Design Librarianship Lighting Marketing Medical Illustration Photography Physical Fitness Printing Production Publicity Public Relations Publishing Retail Sales Set/Stage/Costume Design Teaching Tourism Writing The exceptionally talented Fine Arts graduate may choose to become a professional actor, art historian, artist, dancer, or musician. However, there are many other careers to explore in numerous arts-related areas, or the Fine Arts graduate may wish to combine part-time professional performance with supplemental work. The field of arts administration is an increasingly important career area, offering opportunities to work with opera and dance companies, repertory theatre companies, museums, state and local arts councils, com\u00ad munity arts organizations, and arts festivals. Humanities Career Areas Advertising Banking Broadcasting Foreign Service Government Service Insurance International Relations Journalism Law Library Science Management/ Administration Marketing Personnel Public Administration Public Relations Publicity Publishing Research Retail Sales Social Welfare Teaching Technical Writing Tourism Translating/Interpreting Writing Careers 21 Diverse career fields available to Humanities graduates include entry-level positions in both the public and private sectors or professional-level opportunities combining the degree with further specialization. Humanities graduates may also elect to enter professional programs such as law, library science, or public administration. Frequently, business and industry utilize Humanities graduates for management training programs in banking, retail sales, and insurance. Graduates with special skills in oral and written communica\u00ad tions may look to positions with newspapers, advertising agencies, public relations firms, radio and television stations, and publishing houses. Technical writers are currently in demand, particularly those who have had some preparation in engineering, computer science, and the sciences. Opportunities for graduates fluent in foreign languages exist in government, business, social service, counseling, foreign service, and international trade, among others. Information and Computer Science Career Areas Applications Programming Software Maintenance Business Applications Software Management Scientific Applications Systems Analysis Text Processing Systems Design Marketing of Computer- Systems Programming related Products Graduates of the Department of Information and Computer Science have found employment as programmers, systems analysts, and in sales and service of computers and software. Some of the graduates work for companies which manufac\u00ad ture computer hardware and/or develop computer software. Most of the graduates work for organizations which use computers and computer services to solve a variety of prob\u00ad lems ranging from business data processing to the simulation of integrated circuits. Physical Science Career Areas Analytical Chemistry Biochemistry Computers Electronics Engineering, Applications in Food Chemistry Forensic Chemistry Geochemistry Inorganic Chemistry Medicine Nuclear Chemistry Nuclear Reactors Optical Devices Organic Chemistry Pharmacology Physical Chemistry Physics and Applied Chemistry Psychological and Laboratory Data Quality Control Radar Radiation Chemistry Solid State Devices Statistics Graduates of the School of Physical Sciences have back\u00ad grounds appropriate for a variety of areas in research and management. Career opportunities for chemists are found in federal, state, and local government as well as in private industry. Water districts, crime labs, and major chemical and oil companies are good resources for employment. Chemists may also work in research and development and in jobs deal\u00ad ing with health, pollution, energy, fuel, drugs, and plastics. Mathematics graduates find employment in both government and the private sector in such technical fields as operations research, computer programming, marketing research, actu\u00ad arial work, banking, retail management, and scientific research. Physics graduates find employment as computer programmers, laboratory technicians, systems analysts, test engineers, safety engineers, radar specialists, quality control technicians, technical writers, and high school and college teachers, as well as in research.

In the public sector, a wide variety of opportunities are available in city, county, state, and federal government. In addition, a number of private and government-sponsored agencies provide career options for the Social Science gradu\u00ad ate in the so-called \"helping professions.\" Job categories may range from drug abuse counselor to the administrator of a senior adult center. Placement Testing UCI is establishing a system of placement testing which will aid students in formulating coherent plans of study and which will assess strengths and weaknesses in their academic preparation for the University. These tests, which will occur before registration for classes, will also be of help to academic advisors in working with students who are planning aca\u00ad demic programs and career choices. Currently, placement testing is being given in the areas of writing, mathematics, chemistry, and, where indicated, English as a second language. The writing examination will be given on July 15, 29, and August 12, 1983. The precalculus placement examination will take place on March 7, July 15, July 29, August 12, and Sep\u00ad tember 20, 1983. The preliminary examination in chemistry is scheduled for July 15, July 29, August 12, and September 20, 1983. Testing dates for winter quarter, 1984 will be announced in the Schedule of Classes. Detailed information about these tests is presented in the booklet \"Instructions and Information for Newly Admitted Students,\" which is sent from the Office of Admissions to all newly admitted students. Student Affirmative Action Student affirmative action involves the provision of equal opportunities for admission and success at the University, and specifically for increased enrollment, greater retention, and higher graduation rates of underrepresented students. Educational Opportunity Program The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) for low-income and/or underrepresented students may provide, according to the student's circumstances, special admissions consideration, assistance with financial aid application and procedures, and referral to advising, tutoring, and learning skills services. The goal of EOP is to encourage representation of low\u00ad income and/or underrepresented students at UCI by assisting them in enrolling and succeeding at the University. The Edu\u00ad cational Opportunity Program is designed to assist students in overcoming obstacles by providing counseling on admis\u00ad sions and financial aid, and referral to advising, tutoring, and learning skills services. A special summer session is offered to those students identified as most likely to benefit from this support program. Special assistance on a continuing basis is available to all EOP students through the Counseling Center, the Tutorial Assistance Program, Learning Skills Services, and the Special Services Office. Additional information and personal admissions counseling may be obtained from the EOP/SAA staff; please call (714) 856-5410. Students from low-income and/or underrepresented back\u00ad grounds are encouraged to apply. EOP assists those who are regularly admissible to the University, and also those who may not have met all of the regular admissions requirements but who can offer evidence supporting their ability to achieve at the University level. With the exception of American Indi\u00ad ans, only residents of the State of California are eligible to apply for EOP sponsorship. American Indian applicants must document their tribal affiliation. Admission Prospective students interested in EOP must complete the regular UC admission forms and follow all procedures. Appli\u00ad cants should take particular care with the required essay and indicate their interest in EOP by marking the appropriate places provided on the application. Applications may be obtained from counseling offices in California high schools and community colleges or the UCI Office of Admissions. Applicants who require special admissions consideration are advised to submit two letters of recommendation from teachers, counselors, persons in the community, or employ\u00ad ers, which document the student's background, motivation, and academic potential. In those cases where entering the University at this time would not seem appropriate, the EOP staff may recommend a program of study in a community college or elsewhere, in order that the student may qualify for UCI at a later date. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Financial Assistance Personal financial resources should not be the determining factor in deciding whether or not to attend college. All stu\u00ad dents admitted to UCI, including EOP students, are eligible for financial assistance on the basis of demonstrated need. Funds can be provided to cover room and board, fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, when a student or family is unable to fully meet these expenses. Financial aid is com\u00ad prised of a combination or \"package\" of grant, loan, scholar\u00ad ship, and/or part-time employment based on the individual circumstances of the applicant. See Financial Aid, page 28. Undergraduate Student Affirmative Action ()utreach Program The purpose of the Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program is to attract underrepresented minority students who are regularly admissible to UCI. Campus representatives visit high schools, community colleges, and community cen\u00ad ters to meet with students, parents, teachers, and school offi\u00ad cials to discuss educational opportunities at UCI. The pro\u00ad gram also includes a series of seminars and workshops aimed at orienting students to specific academic disciplines, particu\u00ad larly mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry, biol\u00ad ogy, and engineering where minorities historically have been underrepresented. Early ()utreach Partnership Program Young students are the focus of two partnership programs: Partnership Junior High and Partnership Senior High. Both programs are designed to ensure that more students from underrepresented groups become eligible for admission to the University. Students, parents, and teachers are provided information and skills development sessions and are advised about appropriate University preparatory course work. For information about these programs, please call (714) 856-6362. Academic Enrichment Program Open to selected high-achieving high school students from underrepresented groups, the Academic Enrichment Program stresses academic preparation in the areas of writing, human\u00ad ities, fine arts, computer science, and mathematics. Students participate in seminars, field trips, and discussion groups both on the Irvine campus and at their high schools. For further information, please call (714) 856-5997. Special Services The Office of Special Services provides students from eco\u00ad nomically disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented groups with support services to help them achieve their aca\u00ad demic goals and earn their University degree. Professional counselors, along with peer counselors, maintain a close liai\u00ad son with academic departments in assisting students, espe\u00ad cially freshmen and sophomores, who are having difficulty with their course work. Monitoring of academic progress of each of these students is a primary responsibility of the Spe\u00ad cial Services program. Support programs such as orientation counseling and study skills advising provide students with the resources to help them attain good academic standing. Referrals to other campus support services also are provided. Special Services also sponsors and administers a summer residential program for underprepared students who other\u00ad wise demonstrate an ability to succeed at the University. The Office is located in 901 Trailer Complex, telephone (714) 856-6234. Graduate and Professional ()pportunity Program Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram (GPOP), positive steps are being taken to increase the Student Affirmative Action/Expenses and Fees 23 participation of minorities, and women in certain fields, in the graduate academic and professional programs of the Uni\u00ad versity. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admis\u00ad sion process, and every effort is made through GPOP advis\u00ad ing and support to ensure that all students will have a rea\u00ad sonable chance to attain their academic objectives. UCI does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, or marital status. Expenses and Fees Estimated Expenses NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate estimated figures are based on three quarters of attendance. Figures for first-year medical students are based on 10 months of attendance and are higher for second-through fourth-year students, who attend for a calendar year. All fees are subject to change without notice, and the University may impose additional fees. The following is intended only as a guide in computing average expenses. Fee payment dates are announced in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Special Expenditures Special expenditures beyond the cost of books and basic sup\u00ad plies may be associated with certain courses of study. For example, field study assignments may involve transportation expenses; students who take a dance class may be required to wear a certain type of shoe; a student may need a calculator. A student who has special expenses associated with a course should make an appointment to see a financial aid advisor. Fees Under terms of the Alan Pattee Scholarship Act a surviving child of a California resident who died as a result of accident or injury incurred in the performance of active law enforce\u00ad ment or active fire suppression and prevention duties is eligi\u00ad ble to apply for waiver of certain fees. Additional information concerning this Act is available from the Registrar's Office. Registration Fee The University Registration Fee is $178 per quarter. The full fee is required of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. This fee, which must be paid at the time of registration, is a charge to each student for services which benefit the student and which are complementary to, but not a part of, the instructional programs. No part of this fee is remitted to students who may not desire to make use of all or any of these services. Graduate students studying out of the State may be eligible to pay one-half of the Registration Fee.

'Refer to the chart below for a breakdown of fees. 3Actual costs will depend upon a student's program. <Based on costs for a first-year medical student attending for 10 months; in 1982-83, average costs for each of the second through fourth years was approximately $11,534. The $50 advance deposit on the Registration Fee (Under\u00ad graduate Acceptance of Admission Fee), required of new undergraduates, is applied to the full fee when the student registers. Continuing students are required to pay all out\u00ad standing fines and other debts, in full, at the time they pay their Registration Fee for an upcoming term. Medical students are required to pay the full Registration Fee for each fall, winter, and spring quarter, and a reduced Regis\u00ad tration Fee for each summer quarter. As of spring 1983, the fee for summer quarter, 1983 is $80. Educational Fee The Educational Fee for undergraduate students is $264 per quarter. For graduate students the Educational Fee is $284 per quarter. Medical students are required to pay the Educational Fee for each quarter in which they enroll, including the summer quarter. Part-Time Status Undergraduate and graduate students on approved part-time status (enrollment in 10 units or less per quarter for under\u00ad graduates and in eight units or less per quarter for graduate students) pay the full University Registration Fee and one\u00ad half the Educational Fee paid by students on full-time status. Those part-time students who also have been determined to be nonresidents of the State of California also are assessed one-half the Nonresident Tuition, in addition to the Registra\u00ad tion and Educational Fees. Students seeking part-time status must obtain the approval of the appropriate academic dean, and part-time status can be granted only for reasons of financial need, health, or family responsibilities. Part-time status lapses at the end of each academic year. A student must, therefore, reapply each year that part-time status is desired. Associated Students Fees The Associated Students Fee is $13 per quarter for under\u00ad graduates and $9 per quarter for graduate and medical stu\u00ad dents. The undergraduate student fee is administered by the Associated Students of UCI; the graduate and medical stu\u00ad dent fees are administered by the Associated Graduate Stu-dents and the Medical Students Organization, respectively. These funds provide social activities, lectures, forums, con\u00ad certs, and other activities at either a reduced charge, or no charge, to UCI students. The fees are required of all students.

Nonresident Tuition Fee and California Residence Students who have not been residents of California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determina\u00ad tion date are charged, along with other fees, a Nonresident Tuition Fee of $1,120 for each quarter or $3,360 per year for each year of attendance required by the curriculum, whether such year extends over three or four academic quarters. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California campuses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester system, the day instruction begins for the semester. Nonresident undergrad\u00ad uate and graduate students on approved part-time status shall pay one-half the Nonresident Tuition. Inquiries from prospective students regarding residence requirements for tuition purposes should be directed to the Residence Deputy. No other University personnel are auth\u00ad orized to supply information relative to residence require\u00ad ments for tuition purposes. Any student, following a final decision on residence classification by the Residence Deputy, may make written appeal to the Legal Analyst-Residence Matters (590 University Hall, University of California, 2200 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94720) within 120 days after notification of the final decision by the Residence Deputy. General In order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes upon admission, an adult student must have established his or her residence in California for more than one year im\u00ad mediately preceding the residence determination date for the term during which the student proposes to attend the Uni\u00ad versity and relinquish any prior residence. An adult student must couple his or her physical presence within the State of California for one year with objective evidence that such presence is consistent with the student's intent in making California his or her permanent home and, if these steps are delayed, the one-year dura tiona! period will be extended until BOTH presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. Physical presence within the State solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes does not constitute the establishment of Cali\u00ad fornia residence under State law regardless of the length of the student's stay in California. Nonresident Tuition/California Residence 25 Relevant indicia which can be relied upon to demonstrate one's intent to make California his or her permanent resi\u00ad dence include, but are not limited to, the following: register\u00ad ing and voting in California elections; designating California as the student's permanent address on all school and employ\u00ad ment records, including military records if one is in the mil\u00ad itary service; obtaining a California driver's license or Cali\u00ad fornia Identification Card, if a nondriver; obtaining California vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resi\u00ad dent, including income earned outside the State; establishing UC IRVINE - 1983-198426 California Residence an abode where one's permanent belongings are kept within California; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indicia in other states during any period for which residence in California is asserted. Docu\u00ad mentary evidence may be required. No single factor is con\u00ad trolling or decisive. All relevent indicia will be considered in the classification determination. The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under age 18) child maintains his or her place of abode is the residence of the unmarried minor child. When the minor lives with neither parent his or her residence is that of the parent with whom he or she maintained his or her last place of abode, provided the minor may establish his or her resi\u00ad dence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by his or her own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by relinquishment of a parent's right of control. A man or a woman establishes his or her residence. A wife's residence shall not be derivative from that of her husband, or vice versa. Procedures New and returning students are required to complete a Statement of Legal Residence. The student's status is deter\u00ad mined by the Residence Deputy who is located in the Regis\u00ad trar's Office. All students classified incorrectly as residents are subject to reclassification and to payment of all nonresident fees not paid. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts by the student, the student also is subject to University discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents must immediately notify the Residence Deputy. Exceptions 1. A student who remains in this State after his or her par\u00ad ent, who was theretofore domiciled in California for at least one year immediately prior to leaving and has, during the student's minority and within one year immediately prior to the residence determination date, established residence else\u00ad where, shall be entitled to resident classification. This classifi\u00ad cation will continue until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident so long as, once enrolled, he or she maintains continuous attendance at an institution. 2. Nonresident students who are minors or 18 years of age and can evidence that they have been totally self-supporting through employment and actually present within California for the entire year immediately prior to the residence deter\u00ad mination date and have evidenced the intent to make Cali\u00ad fornia their permanent home may be eligible for resident status. 3. A student shall be entitled to resident classification if immediately prior to the residence determination date he or she has lived with and been under the continuous direct care and control of any adult or adults other than a parent for not less than two years, provided that the adult or adults having such control have been California residents during the year immediately prior to the residence determination date. This exception continues until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident student, so long as continu\u00ad ous attendance is maintained at an institution. 4. Exemption from payment of the Nonresident Tuition Fee is available to the natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse who is a dependent of a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty. Such resident classification may be maintained until the student has resided in California the minimum time necessary to become a resi\u00ad dent. If a student is enrolled in an institution and the member of the military (a) is transferred on military orders to a place outside the state where the member continues to serve in the armed forces of the United States, or (b) is retired as an active member of the armed forces immediately after having been on active duty in California, the student is entitled to retain resident classification under conditions set forth above. 5. A student who is a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty, except a member of the military assigned for educational purposes to a State\u00ad supported institution of higher education, shall be entitled to resident classification until he or she has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident. 6. A student who is an adult alien is entitled to resident clas\u00ad sification if the student has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence in accordance with all applicable provisions of the laws of the United States and has thereafter established and maintained residence in California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. Nonimmigrant aliens having visa classifi\u00ad cations A E, G, I, or K should consult the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office for further information about their ability to become California residents for tuition purposes. 7. A student who is a minor alien shall be entitled to resident classification if the student and the parent from whom resi\u00ad dence is derived have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, provided that the parent has had residence in California for more than one year after admission to permanent residence prior to the residence determination date for the term. 8. The 1980 Refugee Act provides that refugees found admissible as immigrants shall be regarded as \"lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence as of the date of such alien's arrival into the United States.\" A refugee who has had residence in California for at least one year immediately prior to the residence determination date may be classified as a resident for tuition purposes if the stu\u00ad dent can demonstrate that he or she has been lawfully ad\u00ad mitted to the United States as a refugee (verification may be in the form of an I-94 or other official document from the Immigration & Naturalization Service or a U.S. Embassy), and that he or she has demonstrated the requisite intent to make California their permanent home. Asylees who have approved asylum petitions should contact the Residence Deputy for determination of their residency status. 9. Children of deceased public law enforcement or fire sup\u00ad pression employees, who were California residents and who were killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppres\u00ad sion duties, may be entitled to resident status. Reclassification California law requires that students classified as nonresi\u00ad dents seeking reclassification as residents demonstrate that they are financially independent. This factor is in addition to the other requirements necessary for a resident classification. Graduate students who are teaching assistants, research as\u00ad sistants, or teaching associates employed on a 0.49 percent or more time basis are exempt from the financial independence requirement. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984For detailed information refer to Reclassification of Nonresi\u00ad dents below. Note also that students must petition in person at the Registrar's Office for a change of classification from nonresident to resident status. All changes of status must be initiated prior to the late registration period for the term of attendance for which the student seeks reclassification. Reclassification of Nonresidents The California Education Code was amended effective July 1, 1981 to reflect consideration of financial independence as an additional factor for students seeking to reclassify from non\u00ad resident to resident for tuition purposes. To be reclassified as a resident under the new legislation, a student must meet the residency requirements stated above and must also demonstrate that he or she has been finan\u00ad cially independent according to the criteria specified in the new law. Students seeking reclassification should be prepared to fur\u00ad nish information verifying their financial independence for the calendar year in which reclassification is sought and in each of the three immediately preceding calendar years. Under the new law, a student is considered financially inde\u00ad pendent if during each of the four years he or she: 1. has not been claimed by nonresident parents as an exemp\u00ad tion for federal and state income tax purposes; 2. has not received more than $750 from the nonresident parents; and 3. has not lived in the nonresident parents' home for more than six weeks. Failure to satisfy all of the financial independence criteria for the entire period will not necessarily result in a denial of resi\u00ad dence status if the dura tiona! requirement of one year is met and the showing of intent is sufficiently strong. Financial independence is of greater significance for the current and immediately preceding calendar years. Failure to satisfy all three of the financial independence criteria for the current and immediately preceding calendar years normally will result in a determination of nonresidence. Financial independence, or want of it, for the second and third calendar years immediately preceding the year in which reclassification is requested will be considered together with all other relevant factors in determining intent, with no spe\u00ad cial weight attached to the financial independence factor. Time Limitation on Providing Documentation. If additional documentation is required for either an initial residence clas\u00ad sification or a reclassification but is not readily accessible, the student will be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the applicable term to provide such documentation. Inquiries and Appeals The student is cautioned that this summation is not a com\u00ad plete explanation of the law regarding residence. The student should also note that changes may have been made in the rate of nonresident tuition and the residence requirements between the time this catalogue statement is published and the relevant residence determination date. Regulations have been adopted by The Regents, and a copy is available for inspection in the Registrar's Office. Waivers of Nonresident Tuition Nonresident Tuition waivers may be granted to spouses and dependent, unmarried children under age 21 of University faculty members who are qualified for membership in the Academic Senate. Inquiries regarding these waivers should be directed to the Registrar's Office. California Residence/Fee Refunds 27 To the extent funds are available, Nonresident Tuition waiv\u00ad ers may be granted to the unmarried, dependent children under age 21 of a full-time University employee whose per\u00ad manent assignment is outside California and who has been employed by the University for more than one year imme\u00ad diately prior to the opening of the term. Inquiries regarding these waivers normally should be directed to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Fee Refunds New undergraduates who cancel their registration before the first day of instruction are entitled to a refund of Registra\u00ad tion Fee paid except for the $50 nonrefundable Acceptance of Admission Fee; other fees paid are refunded in full. For all continuing and readmitted students, and new graduate and medical students, there is a service charge of $10 for can\u00ad cellation of registration or withdrawal before the first day of instruction. The Associated Student Fee and the University Center Fee are refunded only for cancellation of registration prior to the first day of orientation. After instruction begins, a withdrawal form, available from the Registrar's Office, is necessary. Students who withdraw from the University during the first five weeks of instruction will receive refundsJ of Registration Fee, Educational Fee, and Nonresident Tuition Fee, less the $50 nonrefundable Under\u00ad graduate Acceptance of Admission Fee, on the following basis, effective with the first day of instruction and the effec\u00ad tive date of withdrawal: 1-14 calendar days, 80% 15-21 60% of 22-28 40% of amount paid; 29-35 calendar days, 20% of amount paid; 36 calendar days and over, 0%. The effective date of withdrawal is normally the date the student's official notice of withdrawal is received by the University. However, under extenuating circumstances, the Assistant Vice Chancellor Student Affairs, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, or the College of Medicine Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs, as appropriate, may determine that the effective date of withdrawal occurred prior to the filing of the notice. It is presumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Claims for refund of fees must be presented during the fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) in which the claim is applicable. To obtain a refund, the student must surrender the identifica\u00ad tion card to the Assistant Vice Chancellor Student Affairs, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, or the College of Medicine Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs at the time of withdrawal. Refund checks are issued by the Accounting Office and are generally received by mail about four weeks after the official withdrawal. If any portion of a student's fees has been paid by the Uni\u00ad versity or outside sources, that portion of the refund will be returned directly to the source of those funds. Students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UCI during a quarter will have to repay a portion of their aid based on the same schedule as UCI's refund policy. Housing Refund Policies UCI Housing Contracts provide students with complete housing refund policies. 1lf no credit for courses is received, a full refund of the Registration Fee of the regular session will be granted to all students entering the armed forces prior to the sixth week of the quarter. No refund thereafter. UC IRVINE - 1983-198428 Financial Aid Financial Aid Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; almost one half of enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Students who demonstrate that they need financial assistance in order to attend are eligible for financial aid through the Financial Aid Office. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, the Office also offers some scholarships based on academic excellence. Students who receive financial aid will receive funds from one or more of the following sources: scholarships, grants, loans, and Work-Study. These sources are described briefly in the following sections; more detailed information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the Student Aid Application for California (SAAC) and the necessary supporting documents each year. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. The SAAC, addi\u00ad tional forms, information regarding the application process, and financial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students may be found in the Financial Aid Prospec\u00ad tus which is available in the Financial Aid Office. The usual priority deadline for loans, Work-Study, and most grants is around February 9. The application deadline for Cal Grants A and B is usually around February 9 for the following aca\u00ad demic year. The University expects the student and the par\u00ad ent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educational costs to every extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis of the SAAC and supporting documents determines the amount a student and the student's parents can be expected to con\u00ad tribute toward the cost of the student's education. For inde\u00ad pendent students, the analysis determines the amount a stu\u00ad dent and/or spouse can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business and farm equity; and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and non\u00ad taxable income such as Social Security and Veterans' benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants also are required to apply for a Pell Grant, and in addition eligible California resi\u00ad dents are required to apply for a Cal Grant A or a Cal Grant B. UCI Policy on Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Effective fall quarter, I982, the following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for financial aid apply to all undergraduate and graduate students receiving financial aid awards administered by the Financial Aid Office. NOTE: The regulations governing satisfactory progress for financial aid are separate and distinct from UC Irvine's policy for satisfactory academic progress. I. Grade Point Average and Unit Requirements All incoming and continuing students (undergraduate, gradu\u00ad ate, and part-time) who qualify for need-based financial aid must complete a minimum of six units per quarter to be elig\u00ad ible for aid during that quarter. A student who fails to com\u00ad plete this minimum (I) will be disqualified and will be billed for all aid monies received; (2) the student's financial aid will be canceled, and all aid monies received for that quarter will be repayable at once and; (3) the student will be barred from registration until all financial aid monies have been repaid. Although no minimum grade-point-average requirements apply during the first three quarters as a financial aid recip-ient, to remain eligible after that time, students must comply with the following requirements: a. Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative grade-point-average of 2.0 for the prior three quarters for which they received financial aid. Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade-point-average of 3.0 for the prior three quarters for which they received financial aid. b. Undergraduate students must complete a minimum of 36 units for the prior three quarters on financial aid. All units under 36 must be completed while not receiving financial aid before additional aid may be received. Graduate students must enroll in a minimum of 36 units and complete a minimum of 24 units for the prior three quarters on financial aid. 2. Time and Limits on Eligibility a. Undergraduate student eligibility: I) Entering freshmen are eligible for all types of financial aid for a total of I5 quarters of attendance. 2) Advanced-standing transfer students will have trans\u00ad cripts from previous postsecondary institutions evalu\u00ad ated to determine the number of remaining quarters of financial aid eligibility at UCI. 3) Students will not be granted additional quarters of elig\u00ad ibility solely by reason of changing field of study or pursuing more than one major. 4) Students acquiring a second bachelor's degree will have six quarters of additional financial aid eligibility. b. Graduate student eligibility: I) Limited status (California education credentials) stu\u00ad dents: four quarters 2) Limited status (noncredential) students: four quarters 3) Master's degree designed for completion in three quar\u00ad ters: five quarters 4) Master's degree designed for completion in six quar\u00ad ters: eight quarters 5) Master's degree designed for completion in nine quar\u00ad ters: eleven quarters 6) Ph.D. students will be eligible for 2I quarters of need\u00ad based financial aid following the completion of their baccalaureate degree. 3. Remedial Courses Required remedial courses will count toward the unit require\u00ad ment of the satisfactory academic progress for financial aid policy. 4. Exclusions Units for the following grades will not be counted toward meeting the satisfactory progress for financial aid: F, Failure; I, Incomplete; NP, Not Pass; U, Unsatisfactory; W, With\u00ad drawal; NR, No Grade Reported. 5. Appeals After termination of financial aid, a student will be con\u00ad sidered for financial aid only when one of the following con\u00ad ditions is met: a. Sufficient units are completed and/or the minimum cumulative grade-point-average requirement is satisfied. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984b. It is established through the financial aid appeals process, that the student encountered some type of extenuating circumstances during the quarter(s) in question which hindered academic performance (i.e., prolonged hospitali\u00ad zation, death in the family, etc.). Appeals Procedure Students wishing to appeal must submit a letter to the Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office stating reasons for failing to meet the unit or grade-point-average progress requirement, and whether or not they have solved their difficulties. The Campus Ombuds\u00ad man's assistance may be sought in the preparation of appeals. Undergraduate students also may be required to submit a degree check, course plan, or letter from their dean. All rele\u00ad vant material will be presented to the Financial Aid Appeals Board (the Board is composed of Financial Aid professional staff). Once the material has been reviewed, the Board will decide whether or not the student's eligibility for aid will be reinstated. In the event the Board decides not to accept a stu\u00ad dent's appeal, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Board. If the student decides to exercise this right, a final recommendation based upon the interview and written material, will be made by the Board and for\u00ad warded to the Director of Financial Aid for a final decision. For graduate students, the appeal is reviewed by (1) the stu\u00ad dent's Graduate Advisor and (2) the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, who will make the final recommenda\u00ad tions to the Director of Financial Aid. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achievement, and promise. Although a few honorary scholar\u00ad ships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence alone, most also require that an applicant demonstrate financial need. To be considered for a scholarship, undergraduate stu\u00ad dents must file an Undergraduate Scholarship Application, available from the Financial Aid Office. Filing deadlines vary each year, but the usual deadline is late January for the fol\u00ad lowing academic year. Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise, without reference to financial need. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or upon completion of the sophomore year of college. Medical students are eligible dur\u00ad ing any year of their study in medical school. The appoint\u00ad ments range from four years for students entering from high school and first-year medical students, to two years for undergraduate students appointed after their sophomore year. Regents' Scholars receive a $100 honorarium for each year of their appointment. In addition, a stipend is awarded each year to Regents' Scholars who submit a complete finan\u00ad cial aid application and demonstrate financial need. University scholarships are offered to students entering their freshman or junior year who show evidence of high scholas\u00ad tic attainment. Students who demonstrate financial need may receive stipends ranging up to $1,200 per academic year. These stipends are renewable by submitting an application for consideration each year. Other scholarships are available to students who meet special eligibility requirements. For additional information, contact the Financial Aid Office. For information on Air Force ROTC scholarships, see page 50. For additional information, contact the Financial Aid Office. Financial Aid 29 Grants Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need.

Note: Students may no/ receive both Cal Gran/ A and Cal Gran/ B. If offered both, the Financial Aid Office recommends lak\u00ad ing Cal Gran/ B over Cal Gran/ A. UC IRVINE - 1983-198430 Financial Aid Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) pro\u00ad vides grant aid for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens who are undergraduate students and have demonstrated financial need. These federal grants range from $200 to $2,000 per year, depending upon financial need. UC Grant\u00b7ln-Aid (CIA) is funded by the University of Cali\u00ad fornia and provides grant aid for full~time students who demonstrate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon financial need. Loans National Direct Student Loan (NDSL) provides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens.

Student Employment The Career Planning and Placement Center assists UCI stu\u00ad dents and their spouses in obtaining part-or full-time employment during the academic year and summer vacation. It is not necessary to be a financial aid recipient to apply for jobs through the Center. Students with Work-Study awards may obtain on-campus or off-campus job referrals in the Career Planning and Placement Center. The Center is located in Student Services I. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Undergraduate Admissions The Office of Admissions welcomes inquiries on any aspect of becoming eligible for the University of California and on planning for transfer. Admissions counselors are available in 245 Administration Building, and inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. General information on application filing is available by telephoning (714) 856-6703; for specific questions regarding admission or eligibility, telephone (714) 856-6705. The University's undergraduate admission requirements, which are the same on all campuses, are based on two princi\u00ad ples: (1) the best predictor of success in the University is high scholarship in previous work, and (2) the study of certain sub\u00ad jects in high school gives a student good preparation for Uni\u00ad versity work. The information on admission to UCI given below is organ\u00ad ized as follows: Categories of Application Admission to Freshman Standing Admission to Advanced Standing Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission to International Students Application Procedures Additional Information Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to com\u00ad plete a program of studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has earned a California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency but has not enrolled since then in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions imrnediately following graduation are excluded. An advanced standing (transfer) applicant is a high school graduate who has been a registered student in a regular or extension session of a college or university other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. An intercampus transfer applicant is an undergraduate stu\u00ad dent who is currently or was previously registered in a regu\u00ad lar session at another campus of the University of California and has not been registered in another collegiate institution. See page 48. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent residence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California res\u00ad idents. Refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a 'student who was formerly registered and enrolled on the Irvine campus and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enroll\u00ad ment. See page 48. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. Undergraduate Admissions 31 A University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) applicant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to register and enroll on a reduced fee basis in UC Irvine courses concurrently with high school courses. Admission to Freshman Standing The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or earned a California Certificate of Proficiency and who has not enrolled in a regu\u00ad lar session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer ses\u00ad sions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer ahead to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. NOTE: Applicants still of freshman level and who have com\u00ad pleted more than 12 transferable units since high school graduation should refer to the section on Admission in Advanced Standing. Advanced standing credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if completed after the tenth grade and if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college or com\u00ad munity college which conducted the course. Freshmen applicants who have not yet decided on a major should refer to the section on Planning an Undergraduate Program. Requirements To be eligible for admission to the University as a freshman, an applicant must meet the Subject, Scholarship, and Exami\u00ad nation requirements. It is also possible to qualify for admis\u00ad sion by examination alone, as explained in the section Admis\u00ad sion by Examination Alone. Subject (\"A Through f\") Requirement Students must complete certain high school courses with at least a grade of C in each semester of each course in the sub\u00ad ject areas listed below. This course sequence is often called \"a through f\" pattern and must appear on a list of courses that high school principals certify meet University requirements. This list is called \"Courses to Meet Requirements for Admis\u00ad sion to the University of California\" and can be obtained from school counselors. The Office of Admissions will determine the equivalency of courses for graduates of out-of\u00ad State high schools. a. History-1 year One year* of United States history, or one-half year of United States history and one-half year of civics or American government, taken in the ninth grade or later. b. English-4 years Four years of English: composition and/or literature, univer\u00ad sity preparatory in nature. All English courses taken must require frequent and regular practice in writing expository prose compositions of some length. Not more than one unit of English as a second language (ESL), which must be on the certified course list, will be accepted. c. Mathematics-2 years Two years of mathematics: algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, elementary functions, and mathematical analysis. Courses such as arithmetic and business mathematics are not accepted. A year course in high school is equivalent to one credit/unit. UC IRVINE - 1983-198432 Undergraduate Admissions d. Laboratory-! year A year course in one laboratory science, taken in the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade. e. Foreign Language-2 years Two years of one foreign language. Any foreign language with a written literature may be used. f. Advanced Course- I or 2 years This requirement must be satisfied by one of the following: 1. Mathematics A total of one year of advanced mathematics: intermediate algebra, trigonometry, or other comparable mathematics courses; or, 2. Foreign Language Either an additional year in the same language used for \"e\" above or two years of a second foreign language; or, 3. Science A year course in any laboratory science completed in addi\u00ad tion to the laboratory science used for \"d\" above. The subject requirement can be fulfilled with 11 or 12 high school units. Grades in these courses are the only grades used in calculating the grade point average. However, the University requires all applicants (except those with a Certifi\u00ad cate of Proficiency -see p. 37) to complete at least 16 units. Thus, 3-4 units can be taken in elective courses, which pro\u00ad vide an excellent opportunity to strengthen preparation for the University. Additional courses in mathematics and science are essential in the preparation for majors in engineering, mathematics, the sciences, and many other fields of study. Scholarship Requirement Students who attain a grade point average of 3.30 (where the letter grade A = 4, B = 3, and C = 2)* in \"a-f\" courses taken after the ninth grade will be eligible to enter the University regardless of their scores on standardized tests. Students with grade point averages below 3.30 but greater than 2. 77 will be admitted to the University if they achieve specified scores on the standardized test. (See the Eligibility Index.) Grades received in courses taken in the ninth grade or earlier are not used in determining the scholarship average, although subJect requirements (except laboratory science) may be satisfied with grades of Cor better in these courses. If students successfully complete more than the minimum units within each required subject, only the best grades are used in calculating their grade point average. Grades are counted on a semester basis unless a school gives only year grades. Any a-f course in which a student received a grade of D or F may be repeated once .. The new grade earned in the repeated course, and shown on the high school transcript, will be used in computing the grade point average for admission. If a repeated course first was taken before the tenth grade, the repeat will be treated as if the course were taken for the first time. Examination Requirement All freshman applicants must submit test scores as described below. Applicants for admission to the fall quarter should take the tests by December or January of the senior year, if possible, so that the scores will be available to the Admissions Offices on those UC campuses where enrollment demands are expected to be heavy. When preliminary screening of fresh\u00ad man applications is necessary in oversubscribed majors, having *Effective fall quarter, 1984, weighted grade points of 5, 4, 3, respec\u00ad tively, will be awarded by the University in up to four units of cer\u00ad tified honors courses completed in the eleventh and twelfth grades. available scores from tests administered prior to December aids the review process. The following tests are required: 1. One Aptitude Test-Either: A. The Scholastic Aptitude Test-SAT-(the verbal and mathematics scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting); or B. The American College Test-ACT- composite score. 2. Three College Board Achievement Tests, which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, level 1 or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign languages, sciences, or social studies. The Achievement Test in Litera\u00ad ture may not be substituted for the English composition test. Admission by Examination Alone A student can qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the SAT is 1,100. (If ACT is pre\u00ad sented, the minimum score is 26.) Also, the student's total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,650 or higher, or at least 1,730 if a nonresident of Califor\u00ad nia, with no score less than 500 on any individual Achieve\u00ad ment Test. If test scores are available to UCI at a time earlier than the evaluation of an applicant's subject and scholarship requirements, and if they meet the above totals, the campus may be able to expedite notification of admission. This option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The College Board Achievement Tests cannot be taken in academic sub\u00ad jects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken. Eligibility Index Applicants are admissible if their a-f grade average and test score totals are higher than the combinations below: A-F ACT* or SAT** A-F ACT* or SAT** GPA Composite Total GPA Composite Total 2.78 35 1600 3.05 22 970 2.79 35 1580 3.06 21 950 2.80 34 1550 3.07 21 920 2.81 34 1530 3.08 20 900 2.82 33 1510 3.09 19 880 2.83 33 1480 3.10 18 850 2.84 33 1460 3.11 18 830 2.85 32 1440 3.12 17 810 2.86 32 1410 3.13 16 780 2.87 32 1390 3.14 15 760 2.88 31 1370 3.15 14 740 2.89 31 1340 3.16 14 710 2.90 30 1320 3.17 13 690 2.91 30 1300 3.18 12 670 2.92 29 1270 3.19 11 640 2.93 29 1250 3.20 10 620 2.94 28 1230 3.21 9 600 2.95 28 1200 3.22 9 570 2.96 27 1180 3.23 8 550 2.97 27 1160 3.24 8 530 2.98 26 1130 3.25 7 500 2.99 26 1110 3.26 7 480 3.00 25 1090 3.27 6 460 3.01 25 1060 3.28 6 430 24 1040 3.29 5 410 24 1020 3.30 5 400 3.04 23 990 *ACT is scored in intervals of 1 point from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 35. **SAT is scored in intervals of 10 points from a minimum of 400 to a maximum of 1,600. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent with the junior or senior year of high school is available to certain accelerated students (see p. 31). Through the Univer\u00ad sity Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS), qualified high school students may enroll in UC Irvine courses, receive grades based on the same standards as full-time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. To continue at UC Irvine after high school graduation, a UPHSS student need only complete a change-of-major peti\u00ad tion and enroll as a full-time student. Also, UPHSS status entitles students to Intercampus Transfer (ICT) privileges should they decide to attend another campus of the Univer\u00ad sity of California after high school graduation. High school students wishing more information about the Program should contact the Office of Admissions or their high school counselor. Admission in Advanced Standing The University defines an advanced standing (transfer) appli\u00ad cant as a high school graduate who has been a registered stu\u00ad dent in another college or university or in college-level exten\u00ad sion classes other than a summer session immediately follow\u00ad ing high school graduation. An advanced standing applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. Advanced standing applicants who are not residents of Cali\u00ad fornia should refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. Advanced Standing Admission Requirements The requirements for admission in advanced standing vary according to the high school record. Advanced standing appli\u00ad cants who have a California Certificate of Proficiency must also meet regular University entrance requirements. The high school eligibility for advanced standing applicants will be determined by one of the following, depending on the high school graduation date: (1) students graduating from high school June 1979 or later are eligible if they meet the Eligibil\u00ad ity Index (p. 32); (2) students graduating from high school before June 1979 are eligible if they have earned a 3.0 grade point average on the required high school subjects. In any case, if fewer than 12 units have been completed since high school graduation, the examination requirements for fresh\u00ad men also apply. Nonresident applicants must also meet addi\u00ad tional requirements discussed in the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point average! of 2.00 or better. If the grade point average fell below 2.00 at any one college attended, the student may have to meet additional require\u00ad ments in order to qualify for admission. The grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of acceptable units attempted into the number of grade points earned on those units. A student may repeat courses completed with a grade lower than Cup to a maximum of 16 quarter units without penalty. The scholarship standard is expressed by a system of grade points and grade point averages earned in courses accepted by the Univer\u00ad sity for advanced standing credit. Grade points are assigned as fol\u00ad lows: for each unit of A, 4 points; B, 3 points; C, 2 points; D, 1 point; I and F, no points; P/NP, no points but are included in the unit total. Undergraduate Admissions 33 An advanced standing applicant must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. A student who met the Eligibility Index or whose high school scholarship average in the required subjects was 3.00 or better may be admitted any time after establishing an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better. If a student has completed less than 12 quarter or semester units of transfer\u00ad able college credit since high school graduation, the student must also satisfy the examination requirement for freshmen. 2. A student who met the Eligibility Index or whose high school scholarship average in the required subjects was 3.00 or better but had not studied one or more of the required courses in high school may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better in another college or university; and b. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in the high school subjects lacked; and c. completed 12 or more quarter or semester transferable units, or met the examination requirement. 3. A student who was not eligible for admission as a fresh\u00ad man because (a) the Eligibility Index was not met and the student lacked the required subjects, or (b) because of low scholarship or a combination of low scholarship and a lack of required subjects, may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.40 or better in another college or university; and b. completed 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer; and c. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in high school subjects that the student lacked (high school deficiencies equivalent to two one-year courses may be waived)* or completed, with a grade of Cor better, (1) one college course in mathematics at least as advanced as the equivalent of two years of high school algebra or one year of algebra and one year of geometry, (2) one course in English of a level transferable to the University of California, and (3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a for\u00ad eign language which is transferable to the University of California. Students considering admission in advanced standing should refer to page 37. Admission for a Second Bachelor's Degree Some students may wish to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are subject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. *Effective fall term, 1984, transfer applicants will no longer be per\u00ad mitted to transfer to the University without having satisfied the freshman entrance requirements of four years of college\u00ad preparatory English and two years of mathematics (part of the \"a-f\" requirements). UC IRVINE - 1983-198434 Undergraduate Admissions Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates dur\u00ad ing a regular academic quarter should complete an Applica\u00ad tion for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplementary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, avail\u00ad able from the Office of Admissions. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. Nonresident Admission Requirements NOTE: Admission requirements for applicants who are not California residents vary slightly from requirements for Cali\u00ad fornia residents. Nonresident Freshman Applicant A nonresident freshman applicant must (1) graduate from a regionally or state-accredited high school; (2) complete satis\u00ad factorily the \"a through f\" pattern of subject requirements listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test\u00ad either the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) (verbal and mathematics scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) composite score-AND three College Board Achievement Tests which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, Ievell or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign languages, sciences, or social studies. (The Achievement Test in Litera\u00ad ture may not be substituted for the English composition test.) Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to California residents only. To be admitted by examination alone, a nonresident applicant must score either 1,100 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 26 on the American College Test. The total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,730 or higher with a score of at least 500 on each test. Nonresident Advanced Standing Applicant A student who met the admission requirements for freshman admission as a nonresident must have a grade point average of 2.80 or higher in college courses that are accepted by the University for transfer credit. A nonresident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.40 grade point average in the subjects required for freshman admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of transferable work with a grade point average of 2.80 or higher. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of that work, two units of the required high school subjects may be waived.* A student who lacked any of the required subjects in high school must complete, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in those subjects, or (I) one college course in mathematics at least as advanced as the equivalent of two years of high school algebra or one year of algebra and one year of geome\u00ad try, (2) one course in English of a level transferable to the University of California, and (3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language which is transfer\u00ad able to the University of California. *Effective fall term, 1984, transfer applicants will no longer be per\u00ad mitted to transfer to the University without having satisfied the freshman entrance requirements of four years of college\u00ad preparatory English and two years of mathematics (part of the \"a-f\" requirements). Exceptions to Nonresident Admission Requirements For admission purposes only, a person residing outside of Cali\u00ad fornia may be determined by the Office of Admissions to be a bona fide resident and may be considered under California resident admission requirements if the applicant: is a spouse of a University of California faculty member; is a spouse of military personnel assigned to California; is a military dependent who has been granted a nonresident fee waiver; is an immigrant who has lived in California for a year and has chosen California as a place of residence; is a minor applicant whose parent or legal guardian appears to be a legal resident of California (as determined by the University for tuition purposes); has spent any two years or the last term enrolled in a California high school; has spent the last term (in at least 12 transferable units) enrolled in an accredited California col\u00ad lege or university; has been physically present in California continuously for at least one year prior to the quarter for which registration is requested; or if one parent has received a degree from the University of California or is a full-time employee of the University of California. Nonresident Tuition Fee Refer to page 25 for information regarding residence classifi\u00ad cation for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. Bona fide residents are still held for Nonresident Tuition. Admission of International Students The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant\u00ad a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States-are evaluated in accordance with the gen\u00ad eral regulations governing admission. An application, official certificates, and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted to the Office of Admissions early in the appro\u00ad priate application filing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the necessary passport visa. International applicants whose native language is other than English will be required to demonstrate their English profi\u00ad ciency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a min\u00ad imum score of 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Lan\u00ad guage (TOEFL). The admission of otherwise eligible appli\u00ad cants who do not meet this requirement will be deferred until it is possible for them to demonstrate an adequate level of English ability. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice, P.O. Box 899, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Students must request the Educational Testing Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Office of Admissions) with a grade of C or better will also clear the English proficiency requirement for interna\u00ad tional applicants. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL score of 550, all international students must take an English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in English as a Second Language courses during the freshman year with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Uni\u00ad versity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. International students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commit\u00ad ments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate students are considered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay the nonresident tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admis\u00ad sion of international students to the Office of Admissions. English Language Proficiency of Permanent Resident, Refugee, and International (F-1 Visa) Students Any permanent resident, refugee, or international student whose first or native language is other than English and who has a score on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) of 350 or less, or any such student without aver\u00ad bal SAT score, must, regardless of the student's TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score, take an English as a Second Language Placement Test prior to the first quarter of enrollment. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in English as a Second Language courses during their first year of enrollment and prior to enrolling in any other writing courses. This English as a Second Language Placement Test will be conducted by the staff in the Office of English as a Second Language, School of Humanities, prior to the begin\u00ad ning of each quarter. Information concerning exact times, locations, and a description of the placement test can be obtained by contacting the Office at (714) 856-6781. Credit for Native Language Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. Application Procedures Application Filing Periods Application packets for undergraduate admission to the Uni\u00ad versity are available from the counseling office of any Cali\u00ad fornia high school or community college, or from any Uni\u00ad versity of California Admissions Office. Submit completed application and related materials to the Office of Admissions, 245 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717 on or after the appropriate date below: Winter quarter, I984 Spring quarter, I984 Fall quarter, I984 Winter quarter, I985 Spring quarter, I985 July I, I983 October I, I983 November I, I983 July I, I984 October I, I984 The beginning of the application filing period is the same for all campuses. Each campus will accept for consideration all applications filed during the first month of the filing period. Undergraduate Admissions 35 After the first month the closing deadline will vary from campus to campus. Students are encouraged to file their applications early in the filing period to be assured considera\u00ad tion for the program and campus of their choice. Once the priority filing deadline has passed and/or enrollment quotas have been filled, additional applications cannot be accepted. The Office of Admissions will handle these additional applica\u00ad tions according to information the student has provided on the application. At UCI, the Office of Admissions will process the application if the student has indicated a willingness to consider an alternate UCI major and if enrollments for that major are still open. If this is not possible, the application will either be returned to the student or forwarded to another UC campus where enrollments are still open. Application Fee There is a nonrefundable fee of $30 for filing an application for admission. Checks or money orders should be made payable to Regents-UC and attached to the application form. Change of Campus If, after applying for admission, the student's plans change and he or she prefers to attend a different campus of the University, the student should write to the Admissions Office of the preferred campus. The student's letter should state (I) the student's intended major, (2) the quarter or semester for which the student is applying, (3) the level for which the student is applying (whether freshman or advanced standing), (4) the name of the campus to which the student originally applied, and (5) the reasons the student wishes to change to a campus different from the one origi\u00ad nally applied for. Processing a change-of-campus preference takes several weeks. However, the student's admission priority will be assigned based on the date the student's request for a change was made. The student should be aware that special program commitments (such as the Educational Opportunity Program or UCLA's Academic Advancement Program) do not transfer from one campus to another. NOTE: If the student requested housing or financial aid information at the originally chosen campus, the student should inquire of the new campus housing and financial aid offices whether pertinent records have been transferred and about priorities, deadlines, and availability of financial aid and housing. Transcripts The Office of Admissions requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. All applicants are responsible for requesting that the high schools from which they graduated and each college attended send official transcripts of work promptly to the UCI Office of Admissions. Applicants should request that transcripts be sent at the same time they file their application for admission to the University. If a student is applying for admission as a freshman, a pre\u00ad liminary transcript (sixth semester) showing work through the junior year should be requested from the high school. The transcript should list the courses the student is now tak\u00ad ing and those the student plans to take. (A seventh-semester transcript is not usually required; however, the Office of UC IRVINE - 1983-198436 Undergraduate Admissions Admissions may request one if it is needed to complete an evaluation of an applicant's eligibility at that time.) A final transcript that includes courses and grades for the senior year and a statement of graduation or a California Certificate of Proficiency must also be provided. A transcript from the last college attended is required if any college courses are completed before or at the time of high school graduation. Those applying for admission in advanced standing should have their graduating high school send a transcript im\u00ad mediately to the Office of Admissions which will also need a transcript from each college attended. A preliminary tran\u00ad script from the present college should list the courses cur\u00ad rently in progress and those planned before transfer. Attendance at any other schools or colleges after application to the University has been filed is considered to be part of the record and must be reported to the Office of Admissions. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they can\u00ad not be returned or forwarded in any form to another college or university. Examination Arrangements Students should make arrangements to take the required tests with the College Board, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, California 94704, or P.O. Box 592, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 for SAT and Achievement Tests. For the ACT, stu\u00ad dents should write to the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, Iowa 52240. (Test fees should be paid to the testing services, not the Univer\u00ad sity.) At the same time the test is taken, students should request that their scores be reported to the Office of Admis\u00ad sions. To prevent confusion or unnecessary delay, it is impor\u00ad tant to use precisely the same form of the student's name on both the application for admission and the test materials. Also, final notification of admission cannot be released until scores have been received by the Office of Admissions. In 1983-84 SAT and Achievement Tests will be offered con\u00ad currently on the following Saturday mornings: October 15, 1983 (SAT only January 28, 1984 in California, Florida, Georgia, April 7, 1984 (SAT only) Illinois, North Carolina, South M 5 1984 Carolina, and Texas) J ay ' November 5, 1983 une 2 1984 December 3, 1983 The 1983-84 ACT Tests will be offered on the following dates: October 29, 1983 December 10, 1983 February 11, 1984 March 31, 1984 June 9, 1984 Details on testing are available from the College Board, the American College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. Notification of Admission Candidates for the fall quarter will be notified whether their applications have been retained for consideration at UCI immediately after they are received. Most candidates who applied early in the filing period will receive notice of their admissibility by April 15. (There are similar notification peri\u00ad ods for other quarters.) Delays will occur if required records have not been received by the Office of Admissions. Since each application is considered individually, the length of time before notification is subject to some variation depending upon the unique circumstances of each applicant. If offered admission by the University, a student will be asked to sign and return a Statement of Intention to Register, accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $50. This amount will be applied toward payment of University fees, provided the student enrolls in the quarter to which the student has been admitted. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University hous\u00ad ing, and receipt of communications from the Financial Aid or Housing Office does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Reapplication and Deferred Admission Privilege In general, an application for admission is effective only for the quarter for which it is submitted. If a student is not eligi\u00ad ble for admission, or if a student is admitted and does not enroll, the student must file a new application with the required fee in order to be considered for admission. to another quarter. The new application will be considered in light of the admission requirements in effect and the space available on the campus. However, qualified applicants for undergraduate admission may request to have their admission deferred until a later quarter. Requests for admission deferment should be addressed to the Director of Admissions. Every consideration will be given to deferments requested for valid reasons, though applicants should be aware that responses to such requests may vary from quarter to quarter or major to major due to changing enrollment conditions. Educational Opportunity Program Applicants who wish to be considered for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) should refer to page 22 for sup\u00ad plementary application procedures. Part-Time Study UCI offers several possibilities to pursue part-time study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree. Part\u00ad time study opportunities are available in academic units. in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. For part-time study, quarterly course enrollment is limited to 10 units or less for undergraduate students and to 8 units or less for graduate students; these limits include physical education units. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time stu\u00ad dents apply to part-time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, for graduate students) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In approved part-time status, one-half of the Educational Fee and one-half of the Nonresident Tuition (if applicable) are assessed. Undergraduate petitions are available from aca\u00ad demic counselors or the Registrar's office; graduate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Divi\u00ad sion of Graduate Studies and Research. Since there are cer\u00ad tain restrictions on receiving undergraduate credit for part\u00ad time course work, undergraduates interested in part-time study should read, in addition to the Undergraduate Admis\u00ad sions section, the sections on Expenses and Fees, and Finan\u00ad cial Aid. Graduate students should refer to the Graduate Studies and Research section. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Additional Information Recommended Subjects Many University programs require or recommend specific preparatory subjects to give students the needed background in their chosen fields of study. The lack of such preparation, particularly for advanced standing students, may delay graduation from the University. Details about these recom\u00ad mendations can be found in Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects, a University publication sent each year to high school and community college counselors. Subject A and American History and Institutions To be eligible for a bachelor's degree from UC Irvine, stu\u00ad dents must meet a number of requirements, including those of the University of California, the Irvine campus, and the individual school and major. There are two requirements\u00ad Subject A (English Composition) and American History and Institutions-which all University of California students must satisfy in order to graduate. For specific information on these requirements and ways to satisfy them before entrance to UCI, refer to page 42. College-Level Courses The University gives unit credit to students for courses they have completed in other accredited colleges or universities. To be accepted for unit credit, the courses must be consistent with those offered by the University. All applicants with questions regarding transfer of credit should contact the Office of Admissions. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) The University does not grant credit for the College Level Examination Program. Advanced Placement The Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board are taken, usually during the senior year, in conjunction with courses taken in high school. Students will receive 10 quarter units of University credit for each examination (except Latin, Physics C, Part 1, 2, and Mathematics AB which earn five quarter units each) in which they earn a score of 5, 4, or 3. A maximum of 10 units can be earned for the following: a com\u00ad bination of Physics Band Physics C; English Language and Composition and English Composition and Literature if both examinations are presented; in Studio Art a student may submit either a General Portfolio or a Drawing Portfolio, but not both. These credits will apply toward the total required for graduation from the University. Information about spe\u00ad cific application of Advanced Placement toward subject credit may be obtained from the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges. High School Proficiency Examination The University of California will accept the California Certif\u00ad icate of Proficiency, awarded by the State Department of Education upon successful completion of the California High School Proficiency Examination, in lieu of the regular high school diploma. However, all other University entrance requirements (subject pattern, grades, tests) must be met. The date of high school graduation on University records will be the date of the certificate. Entrance by standardized test scores will remain an option for the student ineligible on the basis of high school record. Physical Examination All new students and those returning after an absence of two or more quarters require physical examinations and health clearances, respectively, before the first day of the quarter. See Student Health. Undergraduate Admissions 37 L __ Planning for Transfer to UCI The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the educational needs of students who transfer from other Cali\u00ad fornia collegiate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institu\u00ad tion. Information regarding eligibility for transfer may be found in the section on Admission in Advanced Standing, page 33. Unit Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The University of California grants unit credit for courses completed in other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the Univer\u00ad sity as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equivalent advanced standing credit from institu\u00ad tions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) California Community Colleges Students may find it advantageous or necessary to complete the first two years of a University of California undergradu\u00ad ate program at one of the California Community Colleges, which are an integral part of the State's system of higher education. High school graduates who cannot be accommo\u00ad dated at their first University of California campus prefer\u00ad ence may choose to attend a community college and transfer to their preferred University campus at a later time. A stu\u00ad dent may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) toward a University degree in a community college. No further unit credit may be transferred from a community col\u00ad lege, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The community college counselor, with the aid of that college's transferable course list, can advise students about courses which will transfer to the University. Lists for each community college are updated annually and tell which courses will transfer and UC IRVINE - 1983-198438 Undergraduate Admissions for how many units. In addition to the community college counselor, staff in the Office of Admissions and Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges keep current copies and can advise students about the transferability of courses. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the Univer\u00ad sity of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agen\u00ad cies. While limitations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maxi\u00ad mum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four-year institu\u00ad tions. However, see page 43 for UCI graduation require\u00ad ments, including requirements for units earned in residence at this campus. University of California J::xtension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in residence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify accep\u00ad tance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Extension courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the respective faculties. Course Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all campuses of the University. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all bar\u00ad riers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, many community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's University, school, and departmental major requirements may be readily communicated to prospective transfer students. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges for specific informa\u00ad tion on planning a program for transfer. The University of California bulletin Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects should also be consulted for planning the lower-division course of study for all programs offered on the campuses of the University of California. Requirements Requirements at UCI are in four categories: University of California, UCI, school, and departmental or major. Courses not specifically applicable to these are considered to be elec\u00ad tives. See pages 42-45 for a description of these requirements. University of California Requirements: Subject A and American History and Institutions Among the means of meeting the Subject A requirement is the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) transfer course in English com\u00ad position with a grade of Cor better. The American History and Institutions requirement may be met by completing in high school one year of U.S. history or one semester of U.S. history and one semester of U.S. government with a grade of at least C, or upon certification by another California collegiate institution. UCI Breadth Requirement The current UCI breadth requirement applies to new stu\u00ad dents who entered UCI or any other accredited college fall term, 1980, and thereafter. Transfer students who sub\u00ad sequent to high school graduation attended a regular term in an accredited college any time prior to fall 1980 have the option of satisfying this requirement through (1) the UCI 6- 3-3 distribution (see below), (2) the current UCI breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, or (3) one of the other options indicated below. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any lime during the undergradu\u00ad ate years, except in the case of the upper-division Writing re\u00ad quirement. Transfer students should not feel that the breadth requirement must necessarily be completed in the lower division. See pages 43-44 for details on the breadth requirement. Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general breadth requirements of that col\u00ad lege will be considered to have met the total breadth require\u00ad ment of UCI. Students who transfer from a community col\u00ad lege and who have met the general breadth requirements of any campus of the University of California prior to transfer will also be regarded as having met the breadth requirement. Students who, upon transfer, have not completed whatever breadth requirements may have been in progress for another campus of the University of California may elect to complete at UCI either that program or whatever UCI breadth require\u00ad ment is applicable to them-the UCI6-3-3 distribution or the new UCI breadth requirement. Students who transfer from colleges on the semester calen\u00ad dar and who elect to satisfy the breadth requirement by ful\u00ad filling the UCI 6-3-3 distribution may do so by completing four semester courses (minimum 12 semester units) in one school outside the major and two semester courses (min\u00ad imum six semester units) in each of two other schools out\u00ad side the major. Students transferring from another institution who first at\u00ad tended college in fall 1980 or thereafter may satisfy the new UCI breadth requirement (p. 43-44) by completing a year se\u00ad quence (two semesters work, minimum six semester units, or three quarters work, minimum 12 quarter units) in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Students transferring to UCI should refer to the following detailed guidelines on how to satisfy the breadth requirement in each area: I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement may be met by a year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be com\u00ad pleted with a minimum grade of C-(1.7), or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C-. Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division requirement. Any student entering with only one semester or one quarter of English composition through which the Subject A Requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the writing requirement. The upper-division writing require\u00ad ment normally should be completed at Irvine. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: general biology, gen\u00ad eral chemistry, basic physics, the physical sciences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavorial Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year of work in any of the following areas: anthro\u00ad pology and comparative culture, economics, political science, psychology, sociology, or social ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take both courses in the same area or one course from each of any two areas; students on the quarter system may elect to take three courses in one area, or two courses from one area and a third from another area. History, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a social or behavioral science. (See IV, Human\u00ad istic Inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, comparative litera\u00ad ture, dramatic literature, art history, history of music, nature and theory of art. Performance courses may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Com\u00ad puter Science. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: probability and statis\u00ad tics, calculus, logic, linguistics, computer science, or comple\u00ad tion of the second year in a foreign language. In satisfying the above requirements, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than two semester courses or three quarter courses in Philosophy toward breadth. Transfer students should check with the academic counselor in their prospective major, the Office of Admissions, or the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges about courses that may be used to satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. A complete description of the breadth requirement is on pages 43-44. NOTE FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: In addition to the courses taken to fulfull the UCI breadth requirement, students majoring in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional year sequence from one of the following breadth areas: Social and Behavioral Sciences (III), Humanistic Inquiry (IV), or the Foreign Languages or Lin\u00ad guistics section of Category V. For purposes of this require\u00ad ment, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that a year sequence of a single foreign language at the first level is acceptable. Undergraduate Admissions 39 NOTE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: By satisfy\u00ad ing the lower-division Writing requirement (I) and complet\u00ad ing a year sequence of courses selected from classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, or comparative literature toward the Humanistic Inquiry (IV) breadth requirement, students majoring in Biological Sciences can also satisfy the Humanities requirement for their major. The courses and descriptions listed elsewhere in this Cata\u00ad logue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. However, it is strongly advised that they consult with their counselors to verify the transferabil\u00ad ity of such courses and the applicability to the breadth requirement. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and which has been determined by a community college as acceptable toward completion of the breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. School Requirements Since school requirements occasionally cross school lines (e.g., physical science requirements for all majors in the School of Biological Sciences), courses taken to fulfill a school requirement may at the same time be applicable toward the University breadth requirement unless the school designates otherwise. Also, courses taken to fulfill a departmental major requirement may at the same time fulfill a school require\u00ad ment or, within prescribed limits, the University breadth requirement. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement are liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower\u00ad division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. Departmental or Major Requirements Courses to be applied toward departmental or major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in content and purpose than is the case with courses applicable to the breadth requirement (see p. 43-44 and departmental sections). Prospective transfer students should consult with their counselors as to the applicability of courses toward UCI requirements. Prospective transfer students should address specific inquir\u00ad ies about their programs to the respective schools or depart\u00ad ments at UCI. Community colleges wishing to clarify the status of transfer courses should consult with the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges at Irvine or the Univer\u00ad sity of California campus closest to them. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Information for Admitted Students Planning an Undergraduate Program Academic Advising At the time of admission every undergraduate student at UCI is assigned for purposes of academic advising to the school or program that corresponds to the student's selection of major or school or to the General Studies Advising Pro\u00ad gram if they have not declared a major. New students are encouraged to arrange appointments with an academic coun\u00ad selor as soon as possible after they have been admitted to plan their academic programs. Thus, the optimum time to initiate contact with an academic counselor is before the stu\u00ad dent enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the student determine whether classes the student wishes to choose are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the proposed classes fit within the student's educa\u00ad tional goals, and whether the classes will help meet some of the various requirements for graduation. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and academic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or program to which a student is assigned for pur\u00ad poses of academic advising. Thus, all requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, and change area of academic concentration must be processed through the office of that dean or director. Each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising by faculty members. These systems differ among the academic units. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. In each instance, how\u00ad ever, every student will have a faculty advisor. Responsibility for informing students of the names of their advisors rests with the dean or director of the appropriate academic unit. This is normally done by letter, but students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or director (see separate listing). A student may request a change of advisor through the chief academic advisor or the dean of the unit. A change in area of concentration often involves a change in advisor. This will always be the case when the change of concentration is to a different school or program; the new school or program will assign a new ad\u00ad visor and inform the student. In some schools and programs consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Students are respon\u00ad sible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned for academic advising purposes. Irrespective of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, the student is respon\u00ad sible for initiating and maintaining periodic contact with the assigned faculty advisor. An appropriate time for the initial con\u00ad tact is during the week prior to the beginning of the student's first classes at UCI, or earlier at the time of registration if this is possible. Thereafter, consultation between student and advisor at the time of registration for each subsequent quar\u00ad ter is desirable. The actual frequency of these meetings will be determined by the desires of the student, the ~dvisor, and the governing regulations. It is the obligation of the faculty advisor to help the student plan an appropriate program of study and interpret the academic regulations of the campus, but the student is solely responsible for meeting the academic regula\u00ad tions and remaining in good academic standing. In addition to faculty members, academic counselors are available in each unit to assist students with major selection, program planning, and petitions. Also, peer academic advisors (trained upper-division and graduate students) can help stu-dents plan their programs, select or change majors, and arrange for tutoring as necessary. Besides furnishing counsel on such matters, these advisors dispense general campus information and refer students to the appropriate faculty and staff personnel for assistance with specific problems. Each quarter, new students are required to go to the appro\u00ad priate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes for advice concerning class enrollment and to pick up a Class Verification and Identification Card. These plans for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Advising Personnel Biological Sciences Grover C.

Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those requirements in mind when selecting courses. Further, students should supplement their under\u00ad graduate programs by anticipating foreign language require\u00ad ments at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. For information about graduate or professional study in a given field, students may consult the graduate advisor or an academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to the area of interest. Also, the Career Planning and Placement Center frequently sponsors seminars on specific career areas and offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. Supplementary Educational Programs There are several supplementary educational opportunities available to students at UCI: University Extension, Summer Sessions, the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps pro\u00ad gram, and two Universitywide activities-the Education Abroad Program and the Education at Home Program. The Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to experience a different culture while making progress toward degree requirements. The Education at Home Pro\u00ad gram enables participants interested in early American his\u00ad tory and culture to spend a quarter in Williamsburg, Virginia; Philadelphia; and Washington, D.C. For further information on each of these five programs, please see pages 50-51. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree There are four requirements that must be met to obtain a baccalaureate degree from UCI: University, UCI, School, and departmental. Each is described below. University Requirements I. English (\"Subject A\"). Every undergraduate must demon\u00ad strate upon entrance to the University an acceptable level of ability in English composition. This requirement may be met before entrance by: a. Achieving a grade 5, 4, or 3 in either of the two College Board Advanced Placement Examinations in English; or b. Achieving a score of 600 or better in the College Board English Composition Achievement Test; or c. Completing the California State University English Equiv\u00ad alency Test with \"Pass for Credit\"; or d. Entering the University with credentials from another col\u00ad lege which show the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) course in English composition with a grade of Cor better. NOTE: High school English courses will not satisfy this option. Those students who have not met the Subject A requirement before entrance must satisfy the requirement before the beginning of their fourth quarter at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the requirement by that time will be ineligible to enroll for a fourth quarter. This requirement may be met after entrance by one of the four following means: One is by taking and passing the Subject A Placement Exam\u00ad ination that is given during the summer and during Academic Advising and Orientation Week prior to the beginning of fall classes. Transfer students who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement should also take this examination before en\u00ad rolling at UCI. A second option, open only to those enrolled in the Humanities Core Course, is by taking and receiving a grade of Pin the Writing Workshop. (NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core Course MUST be enrolled in the Writing Workshop.) Third, students scoring from 550 to 600 on the College Board English Com\u00ad position Achievement Test may enroll in WR 39A-B or Humanities 15-16 and can satisfy the Subject A requirement through achieving a grade of C-(1.7) in any quarter of either sequence. Fourth, students scoring below 550 on the College Board English Composition Achievement Test-and who have followed neither of the first two routes described above-can satisfy the Subject A requirement through taking Writing I and receiving a grade of Pin that course. 2. American History and Institutions. This requirement may be met by one of the following: a. Completion in high school of one year of United States history with grades of C or better, or one semester of United States history and one semester of United States government with grades of Cor better. b. Receiving a score of 5, 4, or 3 in the Advanced Placement Examination in United States History. c. Receiving a score of 500 or higher in the College Board Achievement Test in American History and Social Studies. d. Presentation of a certificate of completion of the require\u00ad ment at another California institution. e. Completion at another institution of one year of college\u00ad level United States history with grades of Cor better, or one course in United States history and one in United States government with grades of Cor better. f. Completion at UCI, with a grade of Cor better, a lower\u00ad division, four-unit course in American history and Social Sci\u00ad ences 230. g. Passing an examination in these subjects. (Students should contact the Undergraduate Study Office, School of Humani\u00ad ties, for further information about the examination.) UCI Requirements 3. Credit for 180 quarter units, earned by examination, by other evaluation, or course work. A course normally offers four quarter units of credit. 4. A grade average of at least C (2.0). 5. Candidates for the baccalaureate must attain at least a C (2.0) average in all of the courses required in the major pro\u00ad gram and at least a C (2.0) average in the upper-division courses required in the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors programs. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. (In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major.) UC IRVINE - 1983-19846. Credit for the last three quarters of work immediately preceding graduation earned in residence on the Irvine cam\u00ad pus (i.e., a minimum of one year full-time attendance at UCI). Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior depart\u00ad mental approval, to students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program. 7. Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major requirements) those in effect at the time of entrance or those subsequently passed after entrance. Stu\u00ad dents transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements those in effect at the time of entering the other collegiate institution, those in effect at the time of transfer to UCI, or those subsequently passed. A student who seeks readmission to UCI more than three consecutive quarters after withdrawing from student status must adhere to the graduation requirements in effect at the time of readmission or those subsequently passed. Breadth Requirement 8. The current UCI breadth requirement became effective with new freshmen who entered UCI or any other accredited college in fall term, 1980, and thereafter. Candidates for the bachelor's degree must satisfy the current UCI breadth requirement. The requirement is designed to ensure that UCI graduates will have been exposed to a broad spectrum of fundamental areas of intellectual experience. It is a gradua\u00ad tion requirement and therefore need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, three four-unit courses are required in each of the following areas: Planning an Undergraduate Program 43 I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science The specific course combinations in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. These course combinations were selected to ensure the following: (I) that students, in meeting the requirement, be exposed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an academic area and (2) that in meeting the requirement students be exposed to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. Only with respect to the lower-division writing requirement is it necessary to pass the first two courses sometime before the student's junior year. It is, of course, a good idea to begin satisfying the breadth requirement as early as possible, as many upper-division courses have as prerequisites courses that may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement. NOTE: In satisfying the breadth requirement, a student may count toward breadth no more than three courses taken within the disci\u00ad pline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than three Philosophy courses toward breadth. UC IRVINE - 1983-198444 Planning an Undergraduate Program I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writ\u00ad ing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to developing the verbal skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this com\u00ad mitment, but the concern for and attention to clear, accurate writing is expected of faculty and students in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, students must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses and normally must be completed prior to the junior year (or in the case of transfer students within the first year of residency). The third course must be an upper-division course, and it must be taken only after the successful comple\u00ad tion of 84 quarter units (achievement of junior status) and completion of the lower-division requirement. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C-(1.7) or better. Students may select from the courses specified below: 1. Writing 39A-B, Expository Writing. 2. Humanities 15-16, Humanities Writing Sequence, taken in conjunction with an associated course as designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. During the winter and spring quarters of the 1983-84 academic year, Humanities 15-16 will be associated with such courses as English 28, History 29, and Comparative Literature 50. Students must enroll concur\u00ad rently in the associated course selected. NOTE: Students held for Subject A who have scored between 550 and 600 on the College Board English Composition Achievement Test may enroll in Writing 39A or Humanities 15 (see 1 and 2 above); completion of either course with a grade of at least C-(1.7) will simultaneously fulfill the Subject A Requirement. 3. Any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course, Humanities lA-B-C. Students held for Subject A may begin this option provided they concur\u00ad rently enroll in the Writing Workshop. 4. Students who complete Writing 39A or Humanities 15 with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substitute as the second course of the lower-division Writing Requirement one of the following courses in creative writing, nonfiction, or journal\u00ad ism: Writing 30, 31, 32, or 38. Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The requirement may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: 1. Writing 139. 2. An upper-division course in creative writing, nonfiction, or journalism. Such courses frequently have special prerequi\u00ad sites. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division Writing Requirement. 3. An upper-division course designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for satisfaction of the requirement. 4. By examination (refer to the quarterly Schedule of Classes). \u00b7 Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the Writing Requirement should refer to page 54 for further information. II. Natural Sciences. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Biological Sciences: Students may select any three courses from Biological Sciences IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, 80, 8I, 82. Chemistry: from I4, IS, 19, 20; I8A, B, C. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. Students must select three courses from one of the following areas, or two courses from one area plus a third from another area. The first course taken in any area must be an introductory course numbered I-12. Anthropology and Comparative Culture: E89, Ecology IV. Humanistic Inquiry. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Arts: Art History 40A-B-C; Art Studio SSA-B-C; Philosophy I, 4, 5; IO, I2, and either ll or 13. Literature: English and Comparative Literature CL SOA-B-C, E 6-7-8, French SOA-B-C; Humanities 30A-B-C; Russian 20-30-40; Spanish SOA-B-C. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Computer Science: ICS I, 2, 2L, 3; or 10, I, 2, 2L. Foreign Languages: 2A-B-C; Spanish 2A-B-C. Linguistics: Linguistics 50 and two courses from Linguistics llO, 120, or Social Sciences SOA; Social Sciences I53F-153H. Logic and Mathematics: Mathematics 2A-B and 2C, 7, or I3; SA-B-C, Philosophy 130 and I32; Social lOOA-B-C. Prior to fall quarter, I980, the UCI breadth requirement was met by students taking courses in three schools outside the school of the major (Schools of Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, or Social Sciences) or, upon UC IRVINE - 1983-1984approval of petition to their academic dean, by taking courses in Information and Computer Science, Social Ecology, Engi\u00ad neering, or the Graduate School of Management. Specifically, such students took 24 units in one school outside the major and 12 units in each of two other schools outside the major. Normally a student took six four-unit (standard or full) courses in one school outside the major and three four-unit (standard or full) courses in each of two other schools outside the major (referred to as the UCI 6-3-3 distribution). The re\u00ad quirement did not apply to students majoring in Engineering. All students planning to transfer to UCI should see page 38 for details on fulfilling the UCI breadth requirement. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. Planning an Undergraduate Program 45 School and Departmental Requirements In addition to the University requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Information on spe\u00ad cific school and departmental or major degree requirements, as well as courses offered, can be found elsewhere in this Catalogue. The student should have determined an area of concentra\u00ad tion no later than the beginning of the junior year, having made certain that the background and the preparation pre\u00ad requisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. New and continuing undergraduate students should read the section on Planning an Undergraduate Pro\u00ad gram; transfer students should also read the section on Plan\u00ad ning for Transfer to UCI. UC IRVINE - 1983-198446 Enrollment and Other Procedures Enrollment and Other Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information con\u00ad cerning enrollment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment and Payment of Fees To receive academic credit for regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be offi\u00ad cially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Enroll\u00ad ment does not become official until all required fees have been paid, and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition has been completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments as indicated on the Class Verification and Identification Card are correct. The Schedule of Classes is provided by the Registrar's Office with registration materials approximately six weeks before the beginning of each quarter. The most important form in the registration materials is the Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion. It should be filled out carefully, according to the instruc\u00ad tions provided on the form and in the Schedule of Classes. A quarterly calendar of dates for submission of enrollment materials and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary signatures on the Enrollment in Classes Petition for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seriously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Submit the completed class enrollment and student infor\u00ad mation forms to the Registrar. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obligations must be satisfied at this time also. Class Verification and Identification Card After payment of fees and submission of enrollment mate\u00ad rials, a Class Verification and Identification Card is available for each student. The Card lists the courses in which a stu\u00ad dent is enrolled. If any courses requested could not be sched\u00ad uled, they are listed also, with the reason why the student is not enrolled in the course. Changes to course enrollments after receipt of the Card are handled through Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Cards, available from the stu\u00ad dent's academic dean's office or the Registrar. New undergraduate students are required to call in person at their academic deans' offices to secure their Class Verification and Identification Cards and advice concerning their academic programs. Continuing undergraduate students and graduate students should consult the quarterly Schedule of Classes for instruc\u00ad tions on where to secure their cards. The Class Verification and Identification Card is certification of the student's class enrollment and is evidence that the stu\u00ad dent is registered at UCI and is entitled to Library privileges. In addition, the Card provides identification for Associated Students functions. If the Card is lost, there is a $3 replace\u00ad ment charge. Inquiries regarding the replacement of lost cards should be directed to the office that issued the Card. Late Enrollment and Payment of Fees Students who submit enrollment materials and pay fees within the published periods are not subject to late service fees. Those who do not submit an Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion to the Registrar's Office during the published period are subject to a late service fee of $50. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published period for payment of fees are subject to a late service fee of $50. If fees are not paid by the established deadline prior to the beginning of instruction, the student is subject to both late service fees (total $100) if allowed to enroll and pay fees after the deadline. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, students are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the pub\u00ad lished deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. The Registrar does not have authority to allow a student to pay fees after the deadline date or to waive the late fees, except in unusual cases where the University is responsible for the late transaction. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Change of Class Enrollment After official enrollment materials have been filed with the Registrar, a student may add or drop courses, change sections of a course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, available from the student's academic dean's office. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units (excluding Physical Education) nor fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permis\u00ad sion of the student's academic dean. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limita\u00ad tions to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. During the first six weeks of each quarter, a student may add classes provided approval to add each class is granted by the instructor in charge. To add a class, a student must obtain the instructor's signature of approval on an Add card, carefully complete the Add card, and submit the card to the student's academic dean's office or the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the sixth week of instruction. To drop a class or change the grading option during the first two weeks of the quarter, a student must obtain the signa\u00ad ture of the instructor in charge as evidence of notification on a Drop or Change of Grading Option Card and submit the card to the student's academic dean no later than the end of the second week of instruction. Students may drop classes from the third through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, only with the permission of the instructor in charge. A student wishing to drop a class during this period must obtain the signature of approval from the instructor in charge on a Drop card and submit the card to the student's academic dean. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984After the sixth week of a quarter, students may drop a course only with the permission of the instructor and the student's academic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and not subject to disqualification, and only if drop\u00ad ping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student and/or of the class as a whole. To drop a class after the sixth week, a student must complete a Drop card, obtain the instructor's signature of approval, and submit the card to the student's academic dean for the dean's action. Graduate students must have the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research to drop a course after the sixth week. A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of classes. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop card is received in the Registrar's Office. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equipment is issued is responsible for the equipment when dropping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is accounted for. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class for which they expect credit. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop card must be filed or the student will receive an F grade in the class. Courses may not be added or dropped retroactively. Students are urged to verify their offi\u00ad cial enrollment during the eighth week of the quarter. Stu\u00ad dents enrolling for the next quarter will find this information included with enrollment materials for the next quarter. Those students not enrolling for the next quarter can verify their official enrollment by inquiring at the Registrar's Office. There is a $3 service charge for all add, drop, or change tran\u00ad sactions received in the Registrar's Office after the second week of classes. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed dead\u00ad line; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status action is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situa\u00ad tion. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice, and the student will be dropped from all courses and will be entitled to no further services of the University except assistance toward reinstatement. A student who desires to be reinstated must satisfy the condi\u00ad tions which caused the lapse of status and pay a $10 rein\u00ad statement fee at the Cashier's Office. The student should then make arrangements to have all of the courses dropped reinstated on his or her academic record by following the procedures outlined in the Notice of Lapse of Status letter mailed to the student prior to dropping of the courses. Transcript of Records The transcript of a student's academic records will be released only upon receipt of a signed request of the student authorizing the release. Application may be made in person or by mail; telephoned requests cannot be honored because Enrollment and Other Procedures 47 payment is due in advance. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $3 for the first copy and $1 for each additional copy ordered at the same lime. All outstanding debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose transcript is being sought can be honored only (I) if the request is accompanied by a written authorization signed by the student whose transcript is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Registrar. Such transcripts can be released by the Registrar only to another college, university, or educationally related agencies such as the Law School Data Admissions Service (LSDAS) or the American Medical College Applica\u00ad tion Service (AMCAS). Such transcripts cannot be released to the person making the request in the student's stead. When a student orders a transcript sent to another college, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the stu\u00ad dent to provide a complete, accurate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a transcript to be received by another institution or agency. Verification of Student Status. There is a $3 fee for each verification of student status performed by the Registrar's Office either at the window or by mail. Needs for which such verifications are performed include reference checks, bank loans, applications for good-student-driver insurance rates, Social Security, etc. Diplomas Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are avail\u00ad able, which is about 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then call in person at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to deliver their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to locations outside the United States. There is a service charge of $2 for certified mail, $3 for registered air mail, payable to Regents\u00ad UC. All outstanding debts due to the University, with the exception of long-term financial aid loans, must be paid\u00b7in full before a student's diploma will be released. See Commence\u00ad ment, pages 48 and 60. Cancellation Prior to Start of Instruction A student who pays fees for a regular academic quarter and then decides to leave the University prior to the first day of classes must submit a Notice of Cancellation, with the identi\u00ad fication card attached, to the appropriate dean's office. With the exception of new undergraduate students, there is a $10 service charge for cancellation prior to the first day of classes. UC IRVINE - 1983-198448 Enrollment and Other Procedures Withdrawal from the University after the Start of Instruction After classes begin for a regular academic quarter, an enrolled student who decides to leave the University before the end of that quarter must submit an official Notice of Withdrawal. A student who fails to submit a Notice of With\u00ad drawal will receive failing grades in all courses and severely jeopardize his or her academic standing at the University. Undergraduate students must submit the notice, with the identification card attached, to the Assistant Vice Chancellor Student Affairs. Graduate students must submit the notice to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, and students in the College of Medicine must submit it to the College of Medicine Director of Admissions and Records. In extenuating circumstances, such as illness or emergency, the student should notify the appropriate dean or office as soon as possible in order to initiate withdrawal procedures. The effective date of the withdrawal will be determined by the appropriate dean. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which en\u00ad rollment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of with\u00ad drawal is after the end of the sixth week of classes. A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to withdraw and intends to return within one year may submit both the Notice of Withdrawal and an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Further informa\u00ad tion about leaves of absence appears in the Graduate Studies and Research section. If a student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal Notice of With\u00ad drawal is not necessary. See page 27 for information on fee refunds. Readmission: Undergraduate Students Students are strongly urged to consider the policy below in formulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time of dropping out and who have filed readmission applications. Readmission is not automatic. A student must file an Applica\u00ad tion for Readmission with the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which readmission is desired and pay a nonrefundable $30 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office. If a student has been academically disqualified from the Uni\u00ad versity or has left the University while on probation or sub\u00ad ject to disqualification, the student must apply for readmis\u00ad sion in the manner prescribed above. The application, how\u00ad ever, will be forwarded to the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. If the dean decides that the student is serious about academic life, and/or that the student has dis\u00ad played capability at another academic institution, the student will most likely be allowed readmission to the University. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be sub\u00ad mitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $30 is charged for each Application for Readmission. Remittance by bank draft or money order payable to Regents-UC must be attached to the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The Application for Readmission must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admission applications. Please refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Intercampus Transfer: Undergraduates Only An undergraduate student in good standing may transfer from the UCI campus to another campus of the University of California. To do so, the student should first check with the UCI Registrar to see which of the campuses are accepting transfers and which majors are being encouraged by each campus. The student then obtains an Intercampus Transfer Application form from the UCI Registrar's Office and files the form with the UCI Registrar by the deadline prescribed for the quarter in which the student wishes to transfer. The filing periods are: winter quarter-July 1-31; spring quarter\u00ad October 1-31; fall quarter-November 1-30. After these dates, applications are accepted only until quotas are filled. A student may apply for only one campus in any given quarter. A nonrefundable fee of $30 is required for all Intercampus Transfer Applications filed with the Registrar's Office. California Residence All inquiries with regard to the requirements for the estab\u00ad lishment of California residence (including exceptions per\u00ad taining to minors, certain classes of refugees and permanent residents of the United States, and dependents of military personnel stationed in California) should be directed to the Residence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717, (714) 856-6124 or the Office of the Legal Analyst\u00ad Residence Matters, 590 University Hall, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, 2200 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94720, (415) 642-2822. Please refer to the Fees section for informa\u00ad tion on the Nonresident Tuition Fee and California residence. Commencement Students who graduate any quarter of the academic year may participate in the year-end graduation ceremony. Com\u00ad mencement protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in late spring and also is available in the office of each academic counselor. See Diplomas, page 47. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Orientation, Major Campus Publications, and Supplementary Educational Programs Orientation Orientation programs include Academic Advising and Orien\u00ad tation Week, held in the fall; the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP), a 36-hour live-in experience on campus for new students and their parents; and Uni-Prep, a week-long, intensive program in September to help new students develop increased social and intellectual skills. All of these programs are sponsored by the Student Support Services Office, located in 201 and 209 Administration Building, (714) 856-7244. Academic Advising and Orientation Week, commonly known as \"0-Week,\" offers academic and social activities for new and returning students and is scheduled the week prior to the beginning of fall quarter classes. Students who enroll later in the academic year (winter or spring quarter) partici\u00ad pate in an abbreviated, one-day orientation prior to the beginning of the appropriate quarter. The Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) is com\u00ad prised of three different sessions held on weekends during the summer. SPOP is designed to help new students with their registration materials and offers informative sessions on academic programs, extracurricular activities, housing choices, and much more. Participants and their parents live in residence halls for the weekend program. There is a fee for the program that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall 1984 will be sent information about SPOP in the spring. Uni-Prep is a five-day program for entering students held in early September. Participants live in the residence halls and attend workshops and other activities designed to provide them with information about shaping their academic and personal lives at UCI. A fee is charged that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall1984 will be sent information about Uni-Prep in the spring. Major Campus Publications Several major publications available on campus provide information about academic programs, student activities and services, enrollment in classes, and specifics pertaining to the individual departments and schools. Some of these publica\u00ad tions are described here; others are mentioned in Antidote (the student handbook). UCI General Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, as well as specific descriptions of schools and departments and the courses they offer, degree requirements, major requirements, the UCI breadth requirement, and various academic policies and procedures. It is available beginning in mid-July from the University Book\u00ad store, the Cashier's Office, and University Extension; copies are $1.50 ($4.00 by mail). Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the academic year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. Current information on specific courses offered in any one quarter is available in the Schedule of Classes and in quarterly informa\u00ad tion published by some of the academic units. Schedule of Classes The Schedule of Classes contains updated information on fees, how to enroll in classes, and final examination sched-Orientation, Publications, and Supplementary Education Programs 49 ules. Most importantly, it lists all classes to be offered that quarter and the time, room, and instructor scheduled for each. If there are any enrollment restrictions on the class, such as consent of instructor required, these are noted. It also contains Academic Senate regulations concerning cheat\u00ad ing and plagiarism, grading, and final examinations. Just prior to the first day of instruction for each quarter, the Regis\u00ad trar's Office issues an addendum to the Schedule that lists added and cancelled classes, changes in time, instructor, or classroom assignments, and other such information. Because the Schedule of Classes is published several times each academic year, it also is a timely source of information on new policies and procedures, or changes in fees or proce\u00ad dures, that could not be included in the Catalogue because of the latter's less frequent publication schedule. Except for the fall edition, the Schedule of Classes is pub\u00ad lished just before the beginning of each quarter; the fall Schedule is available in mid-spring for the convenience of students already attending UCI who will be continuing at UCI in the fall. The Schedule is distributed to new students when Registration Packets are mailed and also is available from the Registrar's Office and the University Bookstore. Replacement copies cost 25\u00a2 each. Departmental and School Announcements These publications contain the most up-to-date information available regarding a wide assortment of academic informa\u00ad tion of immediate, timely interest to students, and all stu\u00ad dents are strongly urged to read them. The publications come in various forms, from brochures of several pages to one\u00ad sheet photocopied announcements, and contain information specific to the individual academic unit. These publications usually are posted on departmental bulletin boards, are avail\u00ad able in academic counselors' offices, or can be obtained from departmental offices. Antidote Antidote is the student handbook, published in the fall and available (at no cost) beginning Academic Advising and Orientation Week (\"0\" Week) while supplies last. Antidote is meant to be a handy resource guide on clubs, activities, and procedures. Arranged alphabetically, Antidote contains a broad spectrum of information for students, ranging from how to obtain a leave of absence to jobs to Third World and minority student activities to \"Zot.\" Its Quick Cure Index directs readers to answers not only in Antidote but also to room and telephone numbers of campus offices that can pro\u00ad vide additional information. UCI Journal The UCI Journal is published monthly during the academic year by the UCI Alumni Association and the Public Informa\u00ad tion Office. The Journal contains feature stories, commentar\u00ad ies, and other timely reports on UCI research, events, stu\u00ad dent life, educational policy, and alumni activities as well as a monthly calendar of events on campus. With a circulation of 50,000 the Journal is the only general-interest publication of UCI that serves members of the UCI community both on and off campus. Copies may be obtained from media distribution boxes in the Administration Building, Library, classroom buildings, residence halls, and cafeterias. Further information may be obtained by contacting the Public Information Office, 524 Administration Building, or calling (714) 856-6922. UC IRVINE - 1983-198450 Orientation, Publications, and Supplementary Education Programs UCitems UC!tems is the campus newsletter and events calendar pub\u00ad lished by the Public Information Office biweekly during the academic year. UC!tems reports on University and campus policies, accomplishments, and activities as they relate to faculty, students, and staff. Copies are available in media dis\u00ad tribution boxes in the Administration Building, Library, class\u00ad room buildings, residence halls, and cafeterias. Further information may be obtained by contacting the Public Infor\u00ad mation Office, 524 Administration Building, or calling (714) 856-6922. Campus Services and Campus Activities Publications Many campus offices that provide services or activities have brochures available describing what they offer. Many of the activities and events mentioned are available to the off\u00ad campus community. Publications include, but are not limited to, those about the services available at the Career Planning and Placement Center, the quarterly announcement of fine arts events, and the Cooperative Outdoor Program quarterly. Supplementary Educational Programs Summer Sessions Two summer sessions are held on the Irvine campus. Session I is from June 25 to August I, I984. Session II is from August 6 to September I2, I984. Students may enroll in either ses\u00ad sion or both sessions. Those who enroll in both sessions and take an academic program equivalent to a regular quarter may accelerate their progress toward a degree. A wide variety of courses from the regular sessions is planned, supplemented by experimental offerings available only during the summer. Admission is open to all university students, to high school graduates, to qualified applicants over I8 years of age, and to qualified high school students who have completed their junior year. Admission to Summer Session does not constitute admission to a regular session of the University; therefore, official transcripts of educational records are not required. Fees for Summer Session are the same for out-of-State students as for California students. Information regarding Summer Session may be obtained from the Summer Session Office in the University Extension Building, (714) 856-5493. Application forms and course list\u00ad ings are available in March. University Extension University Extension offers more than I,200 courses and special programs each year, many of them innovative and experimental in content, format, and teaching methods. Extension programs are designed for those adults in the community who wish to continue their education on a part\u00ad time basis for professional and career advancement, for expansion of cultural horizons, for development of scientific literacy, for growth in personal awareness and human interrelationships, and for enhanced understanding of the great issues of modern society. Utilizing the resources of the University, Extension offers credit and noncredit courses, seminars, conferences, lecture series, and certificate programs. Educational and career coun\u00ad seling is available to men and women through the Extension\u00ad sponsored Women's Opportunities Center, (714) 856-7128. University Extension programs are supported by fees charged to students. A free catalogue may be obtained from the Uni\u00ad versity Extension Office in the University Extension Build\u00ad ing, (714) 856-54I4. Air Force ROTC Through arrangements with Loyola Marymount University, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and the University of Southern California, two-, three-, and four\u00ad year Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) programs are available to all qualified UC Irvine students. Academic units earned in this program are counted as elec\u00ad tive units toward fulfillment of UCI graduation require\u00ad ments. Successful completion of the AFROTC program leads to a commission as an officer in the Air Force. Those stu\u00ad dents who qualify for and plan to enter the Air Force pilot training will be given flight instruction as a part of their last year in either the two-or four-year program. Two-and three-year scholarships are available to qualified students on a competitive basis. Four-year scholarships for incoming stu\u00ad dents must be applied for before December I5 in the year prior to entering college. All scholarship recipients receive full tuition (UC Educational and Registration Fees), required fees and books, and $IOO a month. Students on scholarship in the first two years of the program must successfully com\u00ad plete a course in English composition within two academic years from scholarship activation. Students in the last two years of the program must successfully complete a course in mathematical reasoning prior to commissioning. Students who accept a scholarship must agree to successfully complete at least one term of college instruction in a major Indo\u00ad European language prior to commissioning. To receive a brief descriptive pamphlet summarizing the three programs, ask at the UCI Admissions Office, 245 Administration Building. Education Abroad Program The Education Abroad Program (EAP) of the University of California offers upper-division students the opportunity to experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives. Admission requirements are (I) junior standing by the end of the spring quarter prior to departure, (2) an overall grade point average of 3.0 or better at time of application and departure, and (3) two years of college-level competence in the appropriate foreign language. Participants pay for normal UC fees as well as for room and board, trans\u00ad portation, and books. Students interested in the language, literature, art, culture, history, government, or social institu\u00ad tions of the countries where EAP study centers are located have the opportunity to gain substantially from first-hand academic experience. In addition, whatever their field of study, EAP participants can broaden their outlook and gain new skills as the result of study in a foreign country. Study abroad allows students to experience vastly different cultures and contrasting patterns of thinking while making progress toward a UC degree. Normally, students participate in EAP during their junior year, so generally application for EAP is made in the sopho\u00ad more year. However, students may apply for participation as fourth-or fifth-year seniors or as second-year graduate stu\u00ad dents. Students interested in EAP should contact the EAP Office early in the fall quarter concerning application dead\u00ad lines because of early deadlines for the United Kingdom and Ireland (early November). The deadline for Australia is May, and for most other countries is mid-January. Application forms are available in the EAP Office, located in Trailer 504, telephone (714) 856-6343 or 856-5456. Shortly after the deadline for receipt of applications, applicants will be interviewed by a UCI campus selection committee consisting of faculty and EAP returnees. The files of applicants selected by the UCI committee are then sent to the Universitywide EAP Office at the Santa Barbara campus for final selection. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Academic Program Generally, EAP students attend courses taught by faculty of the host university in the language of the host country; thus, language skills are very important. The academic program includes (I) an intensive preparatory course in the language of the host country (this does not apply to programs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Egypt, Ghana, and Kenya, in which English is the primary language); (2) a full year of academic courses; and (3) opportunity to audit courses within the host university. Students are expected to complete a minimum of 36 units during the academic year in addition to units earned in the intensive language program. Although units and grade points earned through the EAP are incorporated into the participant's University transcript and grade point average, the academic unit in which the partici\u00ad pant's major is offered determines which EAP courses will be accepted in satisfaction of requirements for the specific major. A number of majors require that certain key upper\u00ad division courses be completed in residence at UCI. EAP participants who satisfy all degree requirements while abroad and who expect to graduate upon completion of their year abroad should file for candidacy to receive their degree in September because, unfortunately, transcripts from abroad take a long time to reach the home campus and are not received in time for EAP returnees to be included on the June degree list. Such returnees, however, may participate in June Commencement. Study Centers The courses and fields of study open to EAP participants vary at each center; each of the host institutions has special areas of excellence and strength. Detailed information about each center is available in 'descriptive brochures for each country. They are available from advisors in the EAP Office. Below is a list of countries and universities participa-ting in the EAP during the 1983-84 academic year. Australia: University of Melbourne, Monash University, LaTrobe University, and the Australian National University Austria: University of Vienna Brazil: University of Sao Paulo Egypt: The American University of Cairo England: University of Birmingham, University of Bristol, University of Exeter, University of Hull, University of Kent, University of Lancaster, University of Leeds, University of Sussex, University of London (Westfield College), University of York France: University of Bordeaux, University of Grenoble, Uni\u00ad versity of Marseilles, University of Montpellier, University of Pau, University of Poitiers Germany: Georg-August University, Gottingen Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong Ireland: University of Dublin (Trinity College) Israel: University of Haifa and Hebrew University, Jerusalem Italy: University of Padua, Conservatorio Christian University Mexico: Universidad Nacional University of Bergen Peru: Universidad Catolica Scotland: University of St. Andrews, University of Stirling Academic Regulations and Procedures 51 Spain: University of Barcelona and University of Madrid Sweden: University of Lund U.S.S.R.: Leningrad State University Wales: St. David's University College, University College of Wales West Africa: University of Ghana (Ghana), Fourah Bay Col\u00ad lege (Sierra Leone), University of Benin (Togo) Education at Home Program In winter quarter, 1984, the University's Riverside campus will continue the Education at Home Program (EHP) for those students with special interest in early American history and culture. Those selected for participation in this program will spend nine weeks in Williamsburg, Virginia; one in Phila\u00ad delphia; and a concluding week in Washington, D.C. The program is open to all undergraduates from all campuses in the University of California system and to certain graduate students who have obtained prior approval from their gradu\u00ad ate advisor. Participants register for three courses through the Riverside campus' Department of History (History 157, 158, 159). Special arrangements for additional independent study (maximum of four units) may be made with the stu\u00ad dent's home campus. Costs for housing, food, and transpor\u00ad tation are the individual participant's responsibility. For further information, brochures, or application forms, please call the International Services Center at the Riverside cam\u00ad pus, (714) 787-3820. Preference is given to applications received by June 19; final application deadline is October 15. UC IRVINE - 1983-198452 Academic Regulations and Procedures Academic Regulations and Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information con\u00ad cerning academic regulations applying only to graduate stu\u00ad dents is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Grading System A -Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) 8 -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) I -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so designated by the Committee on Courses, for which the final quarter grade of a multiquarter sequence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR-No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, which\u00ad ever comes first, unless the instructor at the student's request clears the record or replaces NR with a grade). W -Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's permanent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be dis\u00ad regarded in determining the student's grade P.oint average and will not be considered as courses attempted in assessing the student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus suffixes may be attached to the grades B, C, and D; minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. Plus grades carry three-tenths grade point more per unit, and minus grades carry three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades. After each quarter, a copy of the student's permanent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the stu\u00ad dent will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a com\u00ad putation of grade point average at the University of Califor\u00ad nia, and a list of the University requirements completed (Sub\u00ad ject A, American History and Institutions, etc.). Requirements for a bachelor's degree include the accumula\u00ad tion of credit for 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI nor\u00ad mally offers four quarter units of credit, and the term \"course\" may be understood in what follows to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course per unit limes the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors at UCI are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or pro\u00ad cedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be cor\u00ad rected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Procedures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. Incomplete Grades An I or Incomplete grade is assigned by an instructor to a student when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for making up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I can no longer be replaced and will appear per\u00ad manently on the record. The student should consult the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. The ins/rue/or is no/ obligated to allow the maximum three-quarter period. It is strongly recommended that the student and the instructor prepare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. A form is available for this purpose. Once the work is com\u00ad pleted within a time agreed upon by the instructor, the stu\u00ad dent should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the office of the dean of the school in which the course was offered. The student should no/ reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete. How\u00ad ever, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assignment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the student's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is com\u00ad pleted and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units allempled in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of gradua\u00ad tion requirements is made are I's treated as F's. If the student's overall average is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified above. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Pass/Not Pass The Pass/Not Pass option is available at UCI to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in compu\u00ad tation of the grade point average which appears on a stu\u00ad dent's permanent record. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the stu\u00ad dent receives no credit for the class. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the following provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, candidates for the bachelor's degree may take a total of 12 more units in courses designated by academic units as Pass/ Not Pass Only. 2. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-, D, or F, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 3. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the 180-unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. But with the exception of courses designated by the academic unit Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major department, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. 4. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of a quarter without the approval of the dean of the student's school. 5. No student on academic probation may enroll in a course on the Pass/Not Pass option. (Physical Education courses are excepted.) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grades (Graduate Students Only) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only. Also, the grade S or U may be assigned provisonally in each but the last quarter of a gradu\u00ad ate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a provisional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. With the specific approval of the Graduate Council, other graduate courses may be graded on an S/U basis provided that each student enrolled in such a course receives a grade of S, U, or I (or if an undergraduate student, a grade of P or NP). Academic Regulations and Procedures 53 The grade S is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. Grades In Progress IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Academic Senate Commit\u00ad tee on Courses for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grades Not Reported A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subse\u00ad quent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grade Points and Grade Point Average Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C 2 points per unit; D, 1 point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit. Each undergraduate course counts one through eight units, and graduate courses range from one to 12 units each (see departmental course descriptions). Grade point average (CPA) is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total value of courses attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades are excluded in computing grade point average. Removal of Deficient Grades Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of D, F, or NP were received. Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each en\u00ad rollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a D, F, or NP was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based on all grades assigned and on total units attempted. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. UC IRVINE - 1983-198454 Academic Regulations and Procedures Satisfaction of the Writing Requirement The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division Writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C-(1.7) or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C-(1.7) or better in the lower-division courses: 1. Students who fail to attain a grade of C-(1.7) in one or both courses of the Writing 39A-8 sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 2. Students who fail to attain a C-(1. 7) in Humanities 15 normally should enroll in Writing 39A; students who fail to attain a C-in Humanities 16 should normally enroll in Writ\u00ad ing 398. Alternatively, a student who fails to attain a C-in either Humanities 15 or 16 may repeat these courses with the permission of a faculty advisor or academic counselor. 3. Students who fail to attain a C-(1.7) in at least two quar\u00ad ters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course normally should substitute Writing 398 if they need one quarter of additional work to complete the requirement, or Writing 39A-8 if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The fol\u00ad lowing applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C (2.0) or better in the upper-division course: Students who fail to attain a grade of C (2.0) in Writing 139 should repeat Writing 139. Students following any other approved upper-division option should enroll in Writing 139 if a C is not attained in the selected course. See page 44 for further information on the Writing require\u00ad ment portion of the breadth requirement. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who normally teaches that course. Detailed proce\u00ad dures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (1) to decide whether the course can be taken by examina\u00ad tion, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipulate whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as A 8, C, D, or F. A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the examination, grades and grade points will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. Independent Study: Undergraduates Only Another class option is available primarily to upper-division stu\u00ad derzfs af UCJ. The independent-study option allows the stu\u00ad dent to plan with the instructor a course having a clear rela\u00ad tionship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or similar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A de-scription of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent-study credit for undergraduates is normally limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, or their equiv\u00ad alent, as individually determined by the Committee on Courses. Normally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be completed by all participants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final exam\u00ad ination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 72 hours after the final examination. Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Class Level Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sopho\u00ad more, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0-40.4 40.5- 83.9 84.0-134.9 135.0 -180.0 Course Load Limits An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units a student must obtain the signature of the stu\u00ad dent's dean on the Enrollment in Classes Petition. Any action to add or drop courses after submission of the Enrollment in Classes Petition which will cause a student to be enrolled in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units requires approval by the student's dean. This approval is certified by the dean's signature on the Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, as appropriate. Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing a student must main\u00ad tain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic probation if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on proba\u00ad tion has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Normal Progress Requirement Regular undergraduate students will become subject to pro\u00ad bation or subject to disqualification from further registration in the University if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaureate degree. (A) Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units completed at the end of quarters enrolled. Normal Subject to Subject to Quarter Progress Probation Disqualification 1 12-15 8-11 7 2 24-30 16-23 15 145-150 142-144 141 11 162-165 160-161 159 12 180 (B) A student who at the end of a given quarter of enroll\u00ad ment has completed no less than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (A) is making normal progress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Probation\" category under (A) is subject to being placed on probation by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. A student who at the end of a given quarter of en\u00ad rollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" cate\u00ad gory under (A) is subject to disqualification by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. (C) Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on academic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (A) are subject to disqualification. A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. (D) For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Probation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Advanced Standing Quarter Entrance Units at Entrance 1 0-14 2 15-29 3 30-44 4 45-59 8 105-119 9 120-134 10 135-149 (E) Units earned under the following three circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (D) above: (1) Advanced Placement Examina-Academic Regulations and Procedures 55 tion; (2) College Level Examination Program; (3) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. (F) The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (in\u00ad cluding baccalaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaureate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by the faculty offering the curriculum in which such stu\u00ad dents seek to enroll. This determination will be made con\u00ad sistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with University residence requirements. (G) The Normal Progress requirement described above is not to be confused with the Normal Academic Progress require\u00ad ment for Financial Aid. The former has to do with academic standing, the latter with receipt of financial aid. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a student becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the stu\u00ad dent's school. If the record indicates little probability that the student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enrollment. Each school and program is obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may appeal probation and disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the Uni\u00ad versity of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. Honors Quarterly Undergraduate Honors Quarterly undergraduate honors are awarded in each school to students who achieve a quarterly grade point average of 3.5 or better in a minimum of 12 graded units. Honors at Graduation Students may graduate with honors, summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude. The criteria used by each school in selecting candidates for these honors are included in each school's section of the Catalogue. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Graduate Scholarship Requirements For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning graduate student course load requirements and satisfactory academic progress is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment in University Extension If a UCI student wishes to enroll in a University Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire program of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research). UC IRVINE - 1983-198456 Program of Academic Support Services Credits from Other Institutions: Undergraduate Students UCI undergraduate students who wish to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements should secure approval from the Office of Admissions and their aca\u00ad demic dean. The Office of Admissions is responsible for determining if these credits are transferable to UCI, and the academic dean or director of the academic unit which offers the student's major is responsible for determining if the cred\u00ad its are applicable to major and breadth requirements. If such courses are determined by the Office of Admissions to be transferable, and if such courses do not duplicate other credit granted and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. Forms for securing such authorization are available in the Office of Admissions and in deans' offices. Credits from Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for acceptable graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through Univer\u00ad sity Extension prior to first enrollment in graduate study at UCI. To receive such credit, the student must initiate a for\u00ad mal petition after enrollment in graduate study. Approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean is required. While enrolled at UCI or on a Leave of Absence a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. See the Graduate Studies and Research section for further information about graduate transfer credit and the Univer\u00ad sity's Intercampus Exchange Program. Program of Academic Support Services The Program of Academic Support Services (PASS) is a campus-wide academic assistance program focused on improving students' knowledge in the areas of writing, read\u00ad ing, analytical thinking, science, and mathematics. These pro\u00ad grams are intended to meet the individual needs of UCI stu\u00ad dents in a coherent, pedagogically sound, and enriching manner. Although these programs are not offered for aca\u00ad demic credit, they are designed to be an academic resource for the entire range of students at UCI: from assisting enter\u00ad ing students in remedying problems of underpreparation to aiding students in cultivating their academic proficiency in areas in which they feel their understanding may be less ade\u00ad quate than desirable. It is hoped that students who desire assistance will find a PASS program that is suited to their needs and that will make their education at UCI more suc\u00ad cessful and rewarding. Learning Skills Learning Skills staff provide programs designed to streng\u00ad then and develop a student's reading, writing, analytic, and study skills, in order to enrich and enhance the student's edu\u00ad cation at UCI. These programs are neither discipline- nor course-specific, but aim to assist participants in developing abilities that all University students need, regardless of field or major. In certain areas, however, programs have been developed to meet the needs of students enrolled in high\u00ad attendance courses (for instance, Writing I, Humanities Core, Chemistry IO, and ICS I). In these programs the goal is to increase a student's comprehension of course content. Services are delivered in a variety of ways: single-or several\u00ad session workshops, ongoing classes, individual appointments, and self-help laboratories. Tutorial Assistance Program The objective of the Tutorial Assistance Program (TAP) is to aid undergraduate students in comprehending and retaining course subject matter and in developing the understanding necessary for successful independent learning. Through indi\u00ad vidual and small-group tutorials, TAP activities are designed to engender student confidence and to cultivate, by maximiz\u00ad ing a student's participation, his or her ability to work with and articulate aspects of the course. Tutoring is available in the following disciplines: the biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, engineering, the fine arts, the humanities, management, mathematics, physics, social ecology, and the social sciences. Writing Laboratories The Writing Laboratories seek to provide in-depth writing assistance of a focused and methodical nature to students who may find Writing I difficult because of insufficiencies in their University preparation. This assistance, furnished to newly admitted students, addresses specific compositional weaknesses and endeavors to provide students, at an early stage of their coursework, with the verbal skills necessary for a rewarding education at UCI. Assistance is given in the form of workshops attached to special sections of Writing I. Limited in size to small groups and individual tutorials, the Writing Laboratories will allow tutors to give intensive and individualized attention to students. Placement Testing Placement testing is being given in the areas of writing, mathematics, chemistry, and English as a second language. This testing will provide students with a knowledge of their academic preparation prior to their enrollment in classes. Therefore, it will enable them to formulate effective plans of study and help them enroll in courses for which they have the necessary preparation. For further information, please seep. 22.

On-campus residences are available for 1,550 single under\u00ad graduate students in Mesa Court and Middle Earth .. UCI's residence hall program emphasizes small-group living. Each hall houses from 40 to 60 students and a student resident assistant. The small-scale buildings provide excellent oppor\u00ad tunities for social interaction, student government, and lead\u00ad ership experience. Liberal use of wood in building design and attractive landscaping help to create a home-like environ\u00ad ment. The residences are divided into suites of four or five double rooms, with living room and bath; each residence also contains a lounge and recreation and study rooms. A limited number of single rooms also are available in each residence hall. Every room has carpeting and draperies, and is fur\u00ad nished with a bed, desk, chair, chest of drawers, closet, and bookshelves for each student. Both Mesa Court and Middle Earth have complete food service and dining commons for their residents. The halls are, however, closed during the Christmas and spring recesses. Each hall tends to have distinctive characteristics and often focuses on a specific interest or life-style. Examples include halls devoted to the fine arts, the humanities, languages, the outdoors, or crafts. Students who live in the residence halls participate in a prepaid meal plan. Meals are served cafeteria\u00ad style, and the menu offers a wide selection of food, with fresh fruit and an array of salads daily. Meals are served three times daily on weekdays (brunch and dinner only on Saturday and Sunday) in the Mesa Court and Middle Earth Commons. The Student Programs Offices at Mesa Court and Middle Earth have the significant responsibility of providing student residents with an environment conducive to their intellectual, social, and personal growth.

Undergraduate applicants must indicate their interest in on\u00ad campus housing by marking the appropriate item on the UC Undergraduate Application for Admission in order to receive an application for housing. Prompt return of the Housing Application is important as housing priority is given based on the date of receipt of the completed housing application. In addition, priority is given to those students who live outside a 20-mile radius from campus who apply for the undergradu\u00ad ate residence halls or undergraduate apartments between November 1, 1983 and June 29, 1984. Due to the large demand for housing, students wishing to live on campus should apply for admission on November 1, when the appli\u00ad cation filing period opens, if they wish to live on campus the following fall. Continuing UCI undergraduates are required to participate in a lottery late winter quarter in order to com\u00ad pete for space in the residence halls or undergraduate apart\u00ad ments for the following academic year. The application for admission allows the students to request information about off-campus housing as well. Students who become eligible for residence hall contracts will be obliged to pay approximately $100 as a reservation fee at the time the contract is returned to the University; any can\u00ad cellation, regardless of the circumstances or time of year, will result in a nonrefundable penalty fee. The cost of room and board in the residence halls is paid in quarterly payments. Students who live off campus may wish to take advantage of the Nonresident Meal Contract. This contract, good for any quarter, enables a student to eat 19 meals per week in Mesa Commons. For spring quarter, 1983, the price of the meal plan was $6 per day. Off-Campus Housing The Office of Off-Campus Student Services is designed to meet the needs of students who live off campus. Services include off-campus housing referral, landlord/tenant counseling, bus route/carpooling information, and special activities. Student advisors coordinate the program under the direction of Student Support Services staff. The Office is located in 209 Administration Building, (714) 856-7247. Ombudsman An Ombudsman is available to assist students, faculty, and staff with any problems or concerns they may encounter while at UCI, including those related to student conduct and discipline. The Ombudsman is located in 260 Administration, telephone (714) 856-7253. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Student Health Service All fully registered students are eligible for Student Health Service benefits under the UCI program. Student Health facilities include a complete outpatient clinic, staffed by phy\u00ad sicians and nurses, supported by an x-ray and clinical labora\u00ad tory. General medical clinics are held 8:00a.m. to 4:00p.m. every day during the week. Specialty clinics are held at vari\u00ad ously scheduled times by appointment and include Dermatol\u00ad ogy, Gynecology, Orthopedics, Mental Health, Birth Control, Minor Surgery, Nutrition/Weight Control, and Ear, Nose, and Throat. Emergency service is provided after regular hours and on weekends when school is in session. An infir\u00ad mary provides inpatient care for students who need bed care. The main telephone number for Student Health is (714) 856-5301. A basic insurance program also is available which provides limited coverage for emergency care and hospitalization when such care is required but not available at the Student Health Service. Each fully registered student at UCI will automatically have this limited Health and Accident Insur\u00ad ance plan in effect. To assure coverage each student is required to have a current medical history and physical examination on file at the Student Health Service. Undergraduate students are mailed medical history and physical examination forms after they return their $50 Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee; graduate and medical students should visit the Center when they arrive at UCI to obtain and complete the forms. Students should check with the Student Health Service for information on the benefits and limitations under the insur\u00ad ance plan. Student Health coverage extends from the first day of the quarter to but not including the first day of the following quarter, but begins only after the student has paid the full Registration Fee and has been issued the Class Verification and Identification Card. There is an exception for spring quarter coverage which extends only to the last day of that quarter. Optional additional insurance for students, spouses, and chil\u00ad dren and coverage for the summer or one unregistered quar\u00ad ter each year is available. Enrollment in this plan is limited to a short time at the beginning of each quarter. Stop by the Student Health Center for more information and application forms during the first week of each quarter to ensure coverage. Student Health coverage provides as many services as possi\u00ad ble without additional charge; however, some services are available only on a fee-for-service basis. Some of the services available at charges are immunizations, allergy desensitiza\u00ad tion injections, prescriptions from the Student Health Phar\u00ad macy, dental services including minor surgery, elective labora\u00ad tory tests, and, time permitting, physical exam- inations for employment, insurance, or a marriage license. Physical Examinations and Health Clearances. All new stu\u00ad dents and students returning to UCI after an absence of two or more quarters are required to have a complete physical examination within 90 days prior to the first day of the quar\u00ad ter. Students returning after participation in the Education Abroad Program must comply with this requirement upon their return to UCI. The examination should be performed by the student's own physician. If this is impractical, the examination can be obtained at the Student Health Service for a moderate charge. Please call for an appointment. Failure to comply with the physical examination requirement results in loss of insurance eligibility and services provided by the Student Health Service. Campus and Student Services 63 UC IRVINE - 1983-198464 Campus and Student Services Professional counseling and help for emotional problems are available through the Mental Health Division of the Student Health Services. Psychiatric and psychological services, weight control clinics, and headache and biofeedback relaxa\u00ad tion training are available. Eye care is available on a fee-for\u00ad service basis to students and their spouses at the Eye Clinic located in the Student Health Center. Appointments with the Ophthalmologist can be made by calling (714) 856-5304. The Student Health Service encourages preventive medicine. It supplements but does not supplant the family physician. Full and mutual cooperation between the Student Health Service and the family physician is encouraged. Health education courses are offered for academic credit through the UCI Office of Teacher Education. Health Science Experience for Teachers, training in Peer Health Advising, and field work opportunities are available. Health education programs offered through Student Health include CPR, First Aid, Blood Drive, UCI Student Health Center Work Expe\u00ad rience, UCIMC Emergency Care Patient Counseling, Plaque Control, and Student Health Advisory Committee.

Orientation programs include the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP), a 36-hour live-in experience on campus for new students and their parents; Uni-Prep, a week-long, intensive program in September to help new students develop increased social and intellectual skills; a spring information program for UCI applicants; and Academic Advising and Orientation Week, held in the fall. The Student Support Services Office directs the programs for disabled and international students, students who reside off campus, veterans and nontraditional students, and under\u00ad graduate administrative interns. In addition, the Office pro\u00ad vides programming for the Cross-Cultural Center, advises the Minority Programs Committee and the New Student Services Program. The Office is located in 201 and 209 Administration Building, (714) 856-7244. The Disabled Student Services program of support services is designed to provide a productive learning environment within the mainstream of campus life and to offer disabled students opportunities to ensure their effective participation in the academic community. The Disabled Student Services staff assists students with any and all concerns from the point of admission through the completion of the academic program. Specialized services include reader service for the blind, priority registration, provision of notetakers and inter\u00ad preters, liaison with faculty and campus departments, and on-campus transportation. In addition, a van is available (by reservation) for off-campus transportation for academically related purposes such as trips to the UCLA Library. There is a Disabled Student Center on campus which offers a comfor\u00ad table atmosphere where students may rest, relax, or socialize with other students. All buildings on the Irvine campus are accessible to wheelchairs. Disabled students who require accommodations for the class\u00ad room (such as the service of an interpreter or notetaker) are strongly urged to contact the Disabled Student Counselor as soon as possible after admission in order to acquaint them\u00ad selves with the policies and services of the campus. The Office is located on the first floor of the Student Services I building, (714) 856-7494. The Office of International Services provides services to international students, permanent residents, refugees, and international faculty members and scholars and their families include assistance with visa and immigration forms and the interpretation of government regulations. In addition, the staff provides information about all the necessary services for effective participation in the University community including housing, tutoring, orientation, registration, financial aid, and student activities. The staff refers students to other campus support services as necessary. The Office is located in 201 Administration Building, (714) 856-7249. The Nontraditional Students Program offers services to stu\u00ad dents returning to school after an interruption in their edu\u00ad cation. The staff assists with programming, counseling, orientation, and other student activities. This Office is located in 201 Administration Building, (714) 856-7249. The Veterans Program emphasizes support services for vet\u00ad eran students. Considerable assistance for veterans with Veterans Administration benefit certification, tutorial ser\u00ad vices, work-study, orientation, and outreach programs is available through this office. Veterans are reminded that in order to receive VA educational benefits they must adhere to the standards of satisfactory progress and attendance which are described in the UCI General Catalogue on pages 42-45 and pages 52-56. Veterans should check with the Office for additional information regarding Veterans educational requirements. The Office is located in 209 Administration, (714) 856-6477. New Student Services provides assistance and information to students who are in the process of being admitted to UCI. Programs for these students and their families include UCI on Wheels, workshops at new student orientation, and basic advising on enrollment and registration procedures. New Student Services also operates the Information Center in the lobby of the Administration Building, (714) 856-6345.

Rodriguez Dean Graduate education and research, two major areas of respon\u00ad sibility of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, are vital and integral parts of academic life at UCI. Programs leading to doctoral or master's degrees are offered in over 35 academic and professional areas. Many of UCI's graduate programs and research activities have achieved national repu\u00ad tations for excellence, and several are internationally recog\u00ad nized as leaders in their respective fields. UCI graduate pro\u00ad grams continue to grow and to evolve in directions that are consistent with the University's teaching, research, and pub\u00ad lic service missions. Graduate study at UCI provides the excitement and satisfaction that spring from the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, as well as from meet\u00ad ing new challenges. The Dean of Graduate Studies and Research has general ad\u00ad ministrative responsibility for graduate education and research. Graduate education responsibilities include admis\u00ad sions, enrolled-student actions and advising, degree awards, fellowship and assistantship administration, Teaching As\u00ad sistant training, and the Graduate and Professional Oppor\u00ad tunity Program, which facilitates the involvement of minor\u00ad ity students and women in graduate education. In the area of research, the Graduate Dean has responsibility for the administration of extramurally funded training grants, gen\u00ad eral research administration, and research policy develop\u00ad ment and implementation. The Division of Graduate Studies and Research also is ad\u00ad ministratively responsible for Organized Research Units, Focused Research Programs, the Office of Contracts and Grants Administration, and other campus research activities. The following sections describe areas of graduate education and research, and include information about academic regula\u00ad tions and policies important to applicants and graduate students. Graduate Education With the exception of programs conducted by the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research administers graduate education, in accordance with academic policies established by the Academic Senate and by the Grad\u00ad uate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibility for under\u00ad graduate studies. A great deal of information about graduate education at UCI is published in the UCI General Catalogue and in the annual Graduate Study Announcement. The staff of the Division Office is ready to help answer questions about admission, academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assistance, student services, and other mat\u00ad ters of concern to applicants or graduate students. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram (GPOP), positive steps are being taken to increase the participation of minorities, and women in certain fields, in the graduate academic and professional programs of the Uni\u00ad versity. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admis\u00ad sion process, and every effort is made through GPOP advis\u00ad ing and support to ensure that all students will have a rea\u00ad sonabla chance to attain their academic objectives. UCI does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, or marital status. Graduate Studies and Research 65 Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philosophy, or Science (or an acceptable equiv\u00ad alent) from a recognized academic institution. A grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or better normally is required. Applicants for programs leading to M.A., M.S., or Ph.D. degrees must submit scores from the Graduate Record Examination General Test; for M.B.A., M.P.A., M.B.P.A., or Ph.D. degree applicants the Graduate Management Admis\u00ad sion Test (GMAT) is preferred by the Graduate School of Management. Most graduate programs have additional admission requirements. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the specific graduate program and by the Graduate Dean on the basis of such factors as academic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, and examples of previous work. A criti\u00ad cal question is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be satisfied by the graduate programs on this campus. The University of California does not have the capacity to accommodate all applicants who meet the min\u00ad imum admission requirements. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to assess the professional placement opportunities that are anticipated in the field of interest. It is generally recognized that the number of traditional academic appointments in certain disci\u00ad plines is limited. There are, however, other attractive career options, many of them as yet unrecognized, for highly moti\u00ad vated men and women who demonstrate intellectual strength, integrity, and discipline in earning an advanced degree from a respected university. UCI is committed to help\u00ad ing graduate students develop, in addition to their academic training, the communication and problem-solving skills that also may be critical to future careers. How to Apply Application forms and the annual Graduate Study An\u00ad nouncement giving application deadlines for each program are available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. For fall quarter admission, application by February 1 is required by some programs and strongly encouraged for all others. Some academic units will accept applications for win\u00ad ter or spring quarter admission, for which the deadlines are October 15 and January 15, respectively. Two complete sets of official records covering all postsecondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of attendance, are required. A summary of credit transferred and recorded on the transcript issued by the institution granting the degree will not suffice, except in the case of graduates of the University of Califor\u00ad nia. Records must include official evidence of all college-level degrees conferred. To be official, record copies must bear the Registrar's signature and the seal of the issuing institution, and should be sent directly from the Registrar to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. University of California transcripts also must be requested by applicants, including those who are UCI undergraduates. Until a complete official academic record including certification of degrees awarded has been received, final admission and registration will not be granted. One set of transcripts and all other credentials is retained by the Division and may not be withdrawn by appli\u00ad cants or students for any purpose. The second set is for\u00ad warded to the appropriate academic unit, retained there, and UC IRVINE - 1983-198466 Graduate Studies and Research may be used by the student in conferring with faculty ad\u00ad visors. Three letters of recommendation are required. Letters from professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study are preferred. The application must be accompanied by a $30 Application Fee in the form of a check, draft, or money order for the exact amount made payable to Regents-UC. The Application Fee is nonrefundable. In order for the applicant to receive full consideration, it is necessary that letters and official tran\u00ad scripts be received before the published deadlines. Where students have work in progress at the deadline dates, final transcripts covering such work must be received before a provisionally admitted student is officially enrolled. A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each applicant by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recom\u00ad mendation. All applicants are advised to await this official notification of admission before making definite plans or arrangements for attending UCI. Admission of Foreign Students Foreign applicants are subject to the standard admission requirements and must provide satisfactory evidence of financial support in order to obtain necessary visa docu\u00ad ments. Since it normally takes much longer to obtain creden\u00ad tials and process foreign applications, foreign students are urged to apply at least six months prior to the deadline dates. All foreign applicants, except those from countries where English is the primary language, must take the TOEFL Exam\u00ad ination (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Ordinarily a score of 550 or better is required. Upon admission and prior to the first day of instruction, the spoken and written English communication skills of a student who has not attained a TOEFL score of at least 600 or who is being considered for appointment as a teaching assistant or reader will be evalu\u00ad ated. The primary purpose of this policy is to identify poten\u00ad tial communication problems and to recommend an appro\u00ad priate program for the development of language skills. Limited Status University of California academic regulations provide for the admission of students to Limited Status for two purposes: (I) to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a prescribed set of courses; or (2) to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to a graduate degree. While Limited Status is intended to serve a broad range of educational objectives, the most common objective for which the Graduate Dean offers Limited Status admission is study leading to California education credentials. The general requirements for admission to Limited Status are the same as those for graduate admission, with the exception that Graduate Record Examination scores are not required. Admission to Limited Status is ordinarily for a period of three quarters (one academic year) and does not imply admission to a UCI graduate degree program at some later date. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate stand\u00ad ing, admission is offered by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon the recommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Graduate courses taken while in Limited Status ordinarily qualify for transfer credit toward advanced degree requirements, but will not satisfy minimum degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventu\u00ad ally might be admitted. Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed Graduate Advisor or Director of Graduate Studies. The Graduate Advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitoring the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The Graduate Advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program require\u00ad ments and the academic policies of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, approving study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many academic units the Graduate Advisor is instrumental in the selection of students for assistantship and fellowship appointments, and in the super\u00ad vision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who coor\u00ad dinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both Graduate Advisors and Deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guidance; however, student academic peti\u00ad tions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. Academic Policies The academic policies described in this section of the Cata\u00ad logue apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education credentials. Other regula\u00ad tions and procedures of importance to graduate students are covered in the Academic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections and in the description of each graduate program. Scholastic Requirements A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Council, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of ' both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfac\u00ad torily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic session (unless on an approved Leave of Absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satis\u00ad faction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's per\u00ad manent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, certain examinations passed, unit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory progress is not eligible for any academic appointment, such as Reader, Research Assistant, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. Grading With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory (S/U). Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only, with the approval of the Gradu\u00ad ate Council. A grade of Sis equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incom\u00ad plete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incomplete grades do not affect a graduate stu\u00ad dent's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment, but stricter limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequen\u00ad tial courses extending over two or more quarters, for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript nota\u00ad tion must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. After one quarter, an NR becomes an F which will remain permanently upon the student's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Academic Regulations section. Graduate Studies and Research 67 Academic Disqualification After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required exami\u00ad nation within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the faculty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet academic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Graduate Dean ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to submit other information or comments in writing, or to request a second review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Graduate Dean, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic record of that student. Following the formal notice of disqualification, the student may appeal to the Graduate Dean only on the basis of procedural error. Academic Residence A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an academic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may be earned by com\u00ad pleting at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two Summer Sessions. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecutive sessions. Enrollment Policy Full-time academic enrollment ordinarily is expected of grad\u00ad uate students at the University of California. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-division courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in com\u00ad bination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by both the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recog\u00ad nizes the legitimate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to increasing those opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part\u00ad time students wherever good educational reasons exist for so doing. Under this policy, part-time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less, including enrollment in Physical Education classes. Within the guide\u00ad lines and limitations on the application form available in the Division Office, graduate students may petition for part-time UC IRVINE - 1983-198468 Graduate Studies and Research status and, if the petition is approved, shall pay the full Uni\u00ad versity Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee, and one-half the Nonresident Tuition Fee (if applicable). Continuous Registration A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular aca\u00ad demic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Enrollment is not offi\u00ad cial until all required fees have been paid and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition is completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the Enrollment and Other Procedures section. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of California for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absentia. Unless an official Leave of Absence (see below) has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of reg\u00ad istration has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, a student who does not register by the final deadlines for any regular quarter will lose graduate standing, and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resuming graduate study in the University, a former student must successfully apply for readmission. A readmitted stu\u00ad dent must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be conferred earlier than the second quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. A graduate student in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may submit an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Leave of Absence A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a Leave of Absence. A Leave of Absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon the recommendation of the student's aca\u00ad demic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a University fellowship, research grant, or financial aid pro\u00ad gram, and may not hold an academic appointment or compar\u00ad able University employment. During a period of leave, a stu\u00ad dent may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn academic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institution approved in advance by the Graduate Dean). Leave may not be granted to students who intend to make use of most University resources or facilities (including housing), and it may be revoked if they do so. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic session following the expiration of leave will lose graduate standing and will be subject to the readmission policy de\u00ad scribed below. Readmission A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting an Application for Readmission with a $30 fee, which is nonrefundable. The Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research may grant readmission when recom\u00ad mended by the academic unit. If readmitted, a student's pre\u00ad vious academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the Gradu\u00ad ate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student must regis\u00ad ter and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which wili be conferred no earlier than the second quarter following readmission. Intercampus Exchange Program A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one year of graduate study at the home campus and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the Deans of the respective Graduate Divisions is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participat\u00ad ing student's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the University in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange student is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Graduate Division Office of the student's home campus and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties for late filing of the study list. Transfers of Credit At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work completed at another institu\u00ad tion or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one\u00ad half the units required may be accepted from another Gradu\u00ad ate Division of the University of California. After enroll\u00ad ment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another pro\u00ad gram must be recommended by the academic unit to which UC IRVINE - 1983-1984the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a Leave of Absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at ari.other institu\u00ad tion or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equi~alent was assigned. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quar\u00ad ter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preced\u00ad ing UCI Summer Sessions, provided that the formal date of admission precedes Summer Session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI Summer Sessions. Graduate Degrees Master's Degrees The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be sub\u00ad mitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree normally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require Graduate Studies and Research 69 .__.,---\u00b7 a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a comprehensive examination cover\u00ad ing a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course require\u00ad ment. Some programs will have course requirements exceed\u00ad ing the minimums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the descrip\u00ad tion of the specific program for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of Fine Arts (M.F.A. in Fine Arts) and by the Program in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon creative expression and professional devel\u00ad opment. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instructors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually including Summer Session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evidence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Master of Pub\u00ad lic Administration (M.P.A.), and Master of Business and Pub\u00ad lic Administration (M.B.P.A.) degrees are awarded by the Graduate School of Management upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the devel\u00ad opment of professional managerial skills. UC IRVINE - 1983-198470 Graduate Studies and Research Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intellectual syn\u00ad thesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time res\u00ad idence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full-time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary examination on the student's mas\u00ad tery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon suc\u00ad cessfully demonstrating a high level of scholarship on this examination and after further study, the student will con\u00ad tinue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when qualifying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council. The proposed candidacy coml)1ittee list must be sub\u00ad mitted to the Division Office (on the Ph.D. Form I) at least two weeks before the final qualifying examination is to be given, so that formal appointment can be made before the examination date. The Report on Qualifying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form II) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Following a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the $25 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research (on behalf of the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination if required. The chair of the doc\u00ad toral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guidance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in res\u00ad idence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied. The In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant By action of each academic unit, the Graduate Council, a.nd the Academic Senate Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs, a Normative Time has been established for each Ph.D. program. This is the expected number of 12-month years from first enrollment to completion of the Ph.D. for students entering with normal preparation who are able to study without serious interruptions. The Normative Time established for UCI Ph.D. programs is five years in all fields except (years in parentheses): Biological Sciences (four or five), Comparative Culture (six), Comparative Literature (six), Engineering (four), English (six), French (six), German (six), History (six), Information and Computer Science (four or five), Management (six), Physics (six). A Ph.D. student in good standing will be eligible for a quar\u00ad terly grant equal to the Educational Fee if: 1. the student is a formal candidate for the Ph.D., as of the first day of the quarter; 2. the student's accrued time since first enrollment is less than the Normative Time for completion of the Ph.D. estab\u00ad lished for that graduate program (accrued time is equal to elapsed time from first enrollment as a UCI graduate student less (a) up to three quarters of approved leave, and (b) any time between completion of a graduate program or formal withdrawal and readmission in a different field of study); 3. the student is not entitled to payment of the Educational Fee from an extramural fellowship, grant, or traineeship; and 4. satisfactory academic progress has been certified by the Graduate Advisor. Additional information about the In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant program and application forms are available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Theses and Dissertations Candidates for the Ph.D. and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a thesis or dissertation in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the thesis or dissertation ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. Soon after advancement to candidacy, those Ph.D. or mas\u00ad ter's candidates who are writing a thesis or dissertation should consult with the Manuscript Advisor in the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The Manuscript Advisor has the responsibility of ensuring that the established proce\u00ad dures and standards of UCI are upheld in the preparation of theses and dissertations. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the Gradu\u00ad ate Council, a copy of the dissertation (two copies of a mas\u00ad ter's thesis) must be filed with the Manuscript Advisor for placement in the UCI Library. The final copy must meet the University's requirements for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. Dissertations filed later than the end of the sixth week of instruction of an academic quarter ordinarily cannot be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. Ordinarily, a graduate student will be registered for the quar\u00ad ter in which the dissertation or thesis is submitted and the degree is to be conferred, and no additional fees are required. If the manuscript is submitted and accepted before the first day of the regular academic quarter in which the degree is to be conferred and the student was registered for the previous regular quarter, additional fees usually are not required. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984The Filing Fee Under certain circumstances, a student may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of reg\u00ad istration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any academic appointment or comparable University employment, or to receive any student service for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a requirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following readmission and will be accepted immediately following a Leave of Absence only under exceptional circumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee without a late service fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree require\u00ad ments are not completed during the quarter in which the Fil\u00ad ing Fee is paid, the student must subsequently register and pay all applicable fees. Conferral of Graduate Degrees Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should have received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. The student should consult the departmental Graduate Advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. No later than the beginning of the final quarter, the student should file a Graduation and Diploma Information form with the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. If a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation is to be submitted, the Manu\u00ad script Advisor should be consulted well in advance about the final format and the deadline for submission of the approved manuscript. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are avail\u00ad able, which is approximately 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students The University offers many types of financial assistance to graduate students. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants-in-aid, student loans, and Work-Study. Applicants interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate when applying for admission; continuing students should contact their program's Graduate Advisor. Most awards are made in April or May of the preceding academic year. Regents' Fellowships will be awarded to a number of promis\u00ad ing students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding scholars who are not resi\u00ad dents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supplemented by partial assistantship appointments. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the aca\u00ad demic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. Neither assistantship includes remission of Graduate Studies and Research 71 fees or tuition, but a graduate assistant who is not a Califor\u00ad nia resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram, a number of fellowships and assistantships are awarded to first-and second-year graduate students on the basis of need and academic promise. All fellowship awards and assistantship appointments are made in accordance with the affirmative action policies of the University. Grants for doctoral research and a limited number of disser\u00ad tation fellowships are awarded each year; additional informa\u00ad tion is available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The Division Office also provides information and assistance to students who wish to apply for fellowships from federal agencies, foundations, and other non-University sources. The Expenses and Fees and Financial Aid sections contain information about assistance based upon financial need that is administered by the Financial Aid Office, including grants, loans, and Work-Study awards. A Financial Aid Prospectus is available from the Financial Aid Office. Research The University of California is the State's primary research institution. Most scholarly research and creative activities are supported by University funds or by grants and contracts from federal and state agencies, foundations, corporations, and individual sponsors. In addition to University funding, more than $37 million from extramural sources was awarded to the University of California, Irvine in the 1981-82 fiscal year for basic and applied research and for other scholarly activity. Under direction of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Re\u00ad search, the Office of Contracts and Grants Administration (OCGA) is responsible for the submission of proposals, acceptance of grant and contract awards, and negotiation of all awards for extramurally funded research, training, fellow\u00ad ship, and public service programs. The OCGA maintains a Resource Center containing the most current information about extramural funding sources for student and faculty research. While most research takes place at the academic unit level, the academic quality of many of UCI's educational programs is enhanced by Organized Research Units and Focused Research Programs that extend beyond unit boundaries. Organized Research Units An Organized Research Unit (ORU) ordinarily consists of an interdepartmental group of faculty, students, and other re\u00ad searchers engaged in a continuing program of research, sup\u00ad ported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some ORUs is directed toward the solution of complex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phe\u00ad nomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. Organized Research Units established on the Irvine campus by The Regents of the University are the Cancer Research Institute, the Developmental Biology Center, the Institute of Transpor\u00ad tation Studies (ITS), and the Public Policy Research Organi\u00ad zation (PPRO). Cancer Research Institute The Cancer Research Institute is an Organized Research Unit established by The Regents of the University in early 1980 to provide leadership and support for researchers work\u00ad ing toward understanding and controlling cancer. The lnsti- UC IRVINE - 1983-198472 Graduate Studies and Research tute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and direct\u00ad ing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from sev\u00ad eral departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the UCI-California College of Medicine. The ORU provides a central source of information concerning cancer-related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and clinicians can assess advances that may be of immediate value in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection of chemicals or conditions that cause cancer. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell function, tumor cell surfaces and control of proliferation and metastasis, viral carcinogenesis, environmental carcinogene\u00ad sis, and clinically related studies. Developmental Biology Center The Developmental Biology Center is an Organized Research Unit that provides a focus within the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences and the UCI-California College of Medicine for research in several related areas of developmental biology and genetics. The major goal of the Center is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the control of growth and the generation of spatial patterns of differentiation during development. Experimental techniques from the fields of cell biology, embryology, genetics, neurobiology, and endocrinol\u00ad ogy are applied to developing insects, hydra, fish, amphibians, and birds. The work carried out in the Center has potential implications in such areas as the control of growth and regeneration of lost body parts and the cause and prevention of cancer, nervous system anomalies, and birth defects in man. Research in the Center also involves the analysis of insect developmental hormones which may provide new methods to control agricultural pests and disease vectors. Institute of Transportation Studies The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) was established to foster research, education, and training in the field of transportation. The Institute has been an Organized Research Unit within the University of California since 1947, with its main branch located on the Berkeley campus. The Irvine campus branch was established in 1974. Emphasis at Irvine has been on the development of a strong interdisciplinary research capability. Completed and ongoing research projects have involved faculty and students from the Graduate School of Management, the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences, the School of Engineering, the Program in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy, the UCI-California College of Medicine, and the Department of Information and Computer Science. Research at Irvine focuses upon transportation systems planning and evaluation, fiscal and administrative management of public transit systems, labor relations in the transit industry, and energy and environmental issues. Current projects include \"Comparative Analyses of Transit Performance,\" \"Chaining Behavior in Urban Trip Making,\" \"The Impact of Changing Women's Roles on Transportation Needs,\" \"Evaluation of Private Sector Provision of Urban Commuter Services,\" \"Transit Investment Alternatives,\" and 'Transit Labor Rela\u00ad tions.\" A portion of Institute funding is used to sponsor post\u00ad doctoral research fellowships and visiting professorships. The Institute maintains an extensive research collection to support these activities. The 12,000-volume collection includes books, journals, dissertations, and technical reports in the field of urban transportation. A wide range of services is offered including computer-based literature searching. Students and faculty are encouraged to meet with the Infor\u00ad mation Center's trained personnel to discuss research needs and strategies. Public Policy Research Organization The Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) is an Organized Research Unit established to foster empirically grounded research into problems of public policy. In pursuing its broad policies studies mission, PPRO has focused its effort since 1973 on information technology and public policy and more recently has developed research programs concerned with public management and human cost accounting. As a campuswide research unit, PPRO draws its research expertise from the full faculty and student resources of the Irvine campus. Of the 90 faculty and students currently doing research in PPRO, the majority are from the School of Social Sciences, the Department of Information and Com\u00ad puter Science, the Program in Social Ecology, the Graduate School of Management, and the UCI-California College of Medicine. Among PPRO researchers are experts in law, pub\u00ad lic administration, economics, public finance, political science, sociology, psychology, planning, and public health. PPRO projects are multidisciplinary by nature. Among the 22 projects currently in progress are studies of the effectiveness of Federal Civil Service reforms; the use of information sys\u00ad tems in U.S. and European local governments; the social and mental health impacts of economic change; the effects of environmental air on respiratory symptoms; the incidence of injuries to children in auto accidents; and case studies of the problems and costs faced by new users of computer technology. PPRO maintains extensive survey research, data analysis, and data archiving capabilities which support its research efforts and which serve researchers in various UCI academic units. A limited number of graduate assistantships and Work\u00ad Study positions are available to qualified UCI students who wish to participate in PPRO research projects or in the prepa\u00ad ration of research proposals. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs are established by the Chancellor for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdisciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single aca\u00ad demic unit. Because of the developmental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. Six groups of faculty, students, and other researchers have been recognized as Focused Research Programs. Alternative Sources of Hydrocarbons Researchers from the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences and the Departments of Molecu\u00ad lar Biology and Biochemistry and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in the School of Biological Sciences are involved in the development of new sources of alternative and renewable petrochemicals from plant biomass. The project is being con\u00ad ducted in collaboration with Mexican scientists from the Uni\u00ad versidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and the Centro de Investigacion de Quimica Aplicada. Authority Studies Authority relations in a variety of social organizations and institutions (work places, schools, families) are the foci of a project involving faculty from the School of Social Sciences, the Department of History (School of Humanities), and the Graduate School of Management. Project goals are to UC IRVINE - 1983-1984develop broad theories about authority and a useful data archive on the subject. The initial theoretical emphasis is on problems of adaptation to unaccustomed authority relations and those raised by attempts to change occupational author\u00ad ity through self-management arrangements. Brain Function The Focused Research Program on Brain Function seeks to develop an understanding of the role of small groups of neurons in brain function. It involves the close interaction of theoretical physicists from the Department of Physics in the School of Physical Sciences and experimental neurobiologists from the Department of Psychobiology in the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, who utilize recent advances in studying cooperative phenomena in physical systems. Critical Theory Participants in this interdisciplinary program include faculty from the Departments of English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture, French and Italian, History, Philosophy, and Spanish and Portuguese in the School of Humanities as well as from the School of Fine Arts. The program is designed to provide a forum for debate among the competing theoretical move\u00ad ments in contemporary critical theory. A series of lectures and seminars for faculty and graduate students will be pre\u00ad sented during each of the first two years by two distin\u00ad guished visiting scholars and by members of the program. As a culmination, a major symposium will be held in the third year on issues being debated in current theory. Diabetes Mellitus Faculty participants include basic and clinical researchers representing the Departments of Pathology, Medicine, Pedi\u00ad atrics, Ophthalmology, and Neurology in the UCI-California College of Medicine and the Program in Social Ecology. The project is designed to establish an interdisciplinary research program directed at developing techniques to improve blood glucose control in diabetics and determining the psychological and biomedical results of the application of these techniques. A registry of diabetic patients in Orange County will be created as part of the program to provide a data resource for the study of diabetes from an epidemiological perspective. Vulnerable Populations Faculty from the Program in Social Ecology, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, and the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine are working to advance knowledge about \"vulnerable groups\" in the population. Interviews will be conducted with a random sample of Orange County residents, focusing on substantive issues such as population growth, housing, environmental quality, transportation, employment, and human services. A collab\u00ad orative effort of data collection and survey analysis will pro\u00ad vide systematic studies of the extent to which attitudes, life circumstances, and responses to change vary among distin\u00ad guishable populations. Educational Technology Center The primary focus of the Educational Technology Center is the interactive use of the computer as an aid to learning in many different areas. Emphasis is on inexpensive, graphic personal computers now available for schools and homes. The activities of the Center range from fundamental re\u00ad search to the development of learning modules. The Center is particularly interested in developing production capabilities which will lead toward the efficient large-scale production of highly effective computer-based learning modules. Graduate Studies and Research 73 Mexico/Chicano Research The Mexico/Chicano program was established in early 1981 to support faculty and graduate student activities in the areas of Mexican studies, Chicano studies, U.S.-Mexico relations, and collaborations with Mexican scholars. The program has made awards to faculty to coordinate ongoing research activi\u00ad ties, initiate research programs, and formalize existing ties with Mexican researchers and institutions. Graduate stu\u00ad dent awards support research and travel costs related to activities in the above areas. Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Project The Special Research Project on the Neurobiology of Learn\u00ad ing and Memory was established to foster multidisciplinary research which will provide an understanding of the neurobi\u00ad ological processes underlying learning and memory. Research efforts are stimulated and coordinated through research seminars, colloquia, and quarterly conferences, as well as col\u00ad laborative research projects. Participants include faculty from the Department of Psychobiology in the School of Biological Sciences, the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the UCI-California College of Medicine, the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Department of Phys\u00ad ics in the School of Physical Sciences, and the School of Social Sciences, as well as two faculty members from other UC campuses. The Project is housed in the new Biological Sci\u00ad ences Research Facility. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project Financed through private and federal funds, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) Project has been in operation at the University of California since the summer of 1972. The goals of the project are to create the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, a data bank of Greek literature from its Homeric beginnings to approximately A.D. 600; to conduct literary research using collected texts; and to apply technological innovation to these endeavors. The TLG's research activities are multifaceted, combining the traditional concerns and methodologies of philological and literary study with the most advanced features of computer technology. Included among the research foci currently pursued by the Project are the identi\u00ad fication of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials extant from various literary-historical periods; the develop\u00ad ment of procedures pertinent to the conversion of these materials into machine-readable form; the enhancement of automated text-verification routines; and the examination of criteria for data-capture of \"nonstandard\" source materials such as nonliterary (e.g., documentary) texts. The Project staff is in the process of establishing procedures to allow for nationwide access to data-bank resources located at UCI. The TLG data bank currently contains more than 42 million words of Greek text and is expected to grow to 70 million words in the future. Although a separate administrative entity, the TLG is closely related to the Department of Classics in many respects. Faculty members of the Department are involved to varying degrees in TLG research; Classics graduate students are encouraged to apply for TLG assistantships; UCI's library and research resources in Classics are immeasurably enhanced by the text and reference holdings acquired by the TLG for its own purposes; TLG-related conferences and visits by scholars from North America and Europe afford the Department and its students many contacts with eminent classicists of special competence. The establishment and availability of a data bank of ancient Greek literary and doc\u00ad umentary materials have made UCI a major source of re\u00ad search activity in the field of Classics.

Yahr, Ph.D. University of Texas, Associate Professor of Psychobiology No one can predict the future, but this much is known: the next quarter century is the time of the biologist who will be in the midst of many of the activities that govern major aspects of life. These include some of the most challenging intellectual problems, such as the mechanisms of memory and of learning, the molecular basis of embryonic develop\u00ad ment, and the rules that help predict the behavior of the environment. Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face mankind in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated men and women understand the contributions that biological sci\u00ad ences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of mankind. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biology in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportun\u00ad ity to avail themselves of the principles and ever-increasing knowledge of biology. The curriculm is designed to meet present and future educational needs of majors and non\u00ad majors. In keeping with the responsibilities of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. The School provides an excellent opportunity for undergrad\u00ad uates to participate in research, through the Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 program. Each quarter nearly 350 undergraduate students and 200 graduate and postdoctoral students partici\u00ad pate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admis\u00ad sion, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the eight-quarter Biological Sciences Core, with lectures and laboratories developing the major concepts of modern biology. Satellite courses expand upon and inten\u00ad sify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. In addition to the regular major in Biological Sci\u00ad ences, a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, also leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, is available at the undergraduate level. The degree requirements of these two programs are similar, with the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology placing a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences mean\u00ad ingful and interesting and to inform intelligent citizens of bio\u00ad logical phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, leading to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. See page 222. Degrees Biological Sciences ............... B.S., M.A.T., M.S., Ph.D. A concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is available at the undergraduate level. Opportunities are avail\u00ad able at the graduate level to specialize in Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Psychobiology, Anatomy, Microbi\u00ad ology, and Physiology and Biophysics. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the Program in Social Ecology) ....................... B.A. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Honors Graduation with Honors. Of the graduating seniors, approx\u00ad imately 12 percent may receive honors: 1 percent summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude.

Degree in Biological Sciences University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements Biological Sciences Core Curriculum (90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 105L, 106, 106L, 107); or 5A-B-C, 5LA-LB-LC; and Humanities 1A-B-C or another option of the lower\u00ad division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humani\u00ad ties or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biological Sciences Core Curriculum and three satellite courses. In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and Physics 18A-B-C can be used to satisfy the satellite requiremef1t:'Students with a double major in Psychology and Biological Sciences can also use Psychology 151A-B-C to satisfy the satellite requirement. No student may enter as a double major, but students inter\u00ad ested in other areas may possibly become double majors after the first quarter, if,the second school or program approves. A strong academk performance in the second area is requisite for accep~ance. as a double major. For information on requirements for the B.S. degree in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences with a concentration in Ecology and Environ\u00ad mental Biology, see page 78. UCI Breadth Requirement Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have completed the School requirements and who have passed any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alternative with a grade of C-(1. 7) or better will have satisfied the UCI breadth requirement, with two excep\u00ad tions: the upper-division writing requirement and Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences. Specifically, the Humanities Core or its alternative satisfies Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry; it also satisfies the lower\u00ad division writing requirement when two quarters of the writ\u00ad ing component are passed with a grade of C-or better. Chemistry and physics satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Category V, Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathemat\u00ad ics, Computer Science, is satisfied by completion of the School mathematics requirement. Planning a Program of Study Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the physical sciences, it is important for students to take their required physical sciences early. Note: The academic planning shown below is only a suggested program. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for individual academic planning. Freshmen will normally take eight units of the humanities re\u00ad quirement, Chemistry 1A, and a freshman seminar (Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences 2) during the fall quarter. Students with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics part of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may enroll in mathematics during the fall quarter. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A. During their freshman year, students will begin the Bio\u00ad logical Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. I UC IRVINE - 1983-198478 Biological Sciences Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry SIA), con\u00ad tinue the Biological Sciences Core, and complete the Humani\u00ad ties requirement if they have not taken it during their fresh\u00ad man year. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other schools to meet the UC:::I breadth requirement and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as fresh\u00ad men. Sophomores who have completed the mathematics requirement as freshmen may enroll in physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry may be required to take Physics SA-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. During their junior year, most majors continue the Biological Sciences Core and take physics if they have not yet done so. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and often become involved in the satellite course requirements. Since most satellites are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually preferable for students to have completed most of the Core before taking satellite courses. Finally, during their senior year, students complete the Core and may become involved in an area of specialization within the School. Individualized accelerated programs of study are designed for students entering the School with strong backgrounds in biology. Please see page 79 for details regarding the Fresh\u00ad man Honors Curriculum. A special program of study should be considered by students who enter the biological sciences with a weak background in the sciences and in writing skills. A weak background might consist of not completing high school chemistry or mathe\u00ad matics through trigonometry, and not satisfying the Subject A requirement before entering the University. This program allows a student to gain the necessary background skills and may require five years of study at the undergraduate level. Before beginning this program of study, students must see an academic counselor in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Sample Program -Biological Sciences Freshman Sophomore Fall Chern.

SIC Freshmen should complete Writing IA, Mathematics I, Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 2, and an additional humanities course (to satisfy the alternative to the Humanities Core) during the fall quarter. The winter quarter should include Chemistry 10 and continuation of humanities and mathematics. Continuation of humanities and mathematics, and an elective, are taken during the spring quarter. During the second year, students should begin general chem\u00ad istry (Chemistry lA-B-C), continue working on the breadth requirement and any remaining humanities requirements, and complete mathematics. During winter quarter, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sci\u00ad ences 90. The Biological Sciences Core, organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA-B-C), and elective courses should be taken during the third year. The fourth year should include Physics 3A-B-C, continuation of the Biological Sciences Core, biological sciences satellites, and possibly research or other electives. The fifth year should be relatively free to explore additional satellites and research and to complete any remaining Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences Core courses. Requirements for the B.S. Degree in Biological Sciences with a Concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology The School of Biological Sciences offers a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology which provides a second pathway to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences. The concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology differs from the regular undergraduate program in having a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Its principal objective is to afford the student an integrated, interdisci- Junior Senior Bio. Core Bio. Core Physics 3A, LA or Electived Bio. Satellite Bio. Satellite Research Elective Elective Bio.

Humanistic Inquiry). Normally students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower-division writing requirement. Students taking Humanities IA must also enroll in Writing Workshop (2 units) if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. bstudents with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may begin mathematics as freshmen. Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics portion of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics ZA. cStudents who have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics 3A-B-C and 3LA-LB-LC in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requirement in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. Physics 3A-B-C is the course for non majors and is fully acceptable for a degree in the Biological Sciences. Physics 5A-B-C which begins in the winter quarter, better prepares a student for Physical Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and for some graduate schools. dEiectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. eln addition to our listed biological sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C Physics 18A-B-C and Psychology 151A-B-C (for Biological Sciences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites.

Students who take the mathematics requirements in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. dEiectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. Required electives are Biological Sciences 174 or 186, Biological Sciences 169 or 179, and two courses from among various Engineering and Social Ecology courses. See School requirements for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology. plinary program in environmental studies within the frame\u00ad work of a broad and rigorous physical and biological sciences background. A vital goal is to allow the student completing the course of study to be broadly trained as a biologist, with the breadth of educational experience to view environmental problems from an informed ecologist's perspective. In addi\u00ad tion to completing basic required courses in the humanities and the physical and biological sciences, the student must complete a core of environmentally based courses from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology, and the School of Engineering. Ex\u00ad posure to current thought in several subareas of ecology is emphasized, and the acquisition of elementary statistical and computer skills is stressed. Opportunities to specialize in sev\u00ad eral general study areas are furnished. Students will study theoretical concepts and experimental relationships in terres\u00ad trial or aquatic systems through Ecology and Evolutionary Biology satellite courses, but may also choose to specialize in the demographic and planning aspects of environmental management through classes in Social Ecology, or the techno\u00ad logical approach to environmental problem solving through advanced course work in Environmental Engineering. Students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering (p. 240), offered by the School of Engineering. Students should also investigate the Applied Ecology major (p. 222), offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. The Applied Ecology major emphasizes ecology as it pertains to human needs, whereas the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology emphasizes ecology as a basic science. University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements Biological Sciences 90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, lOS, 106, 106L, 120, 166, either 171 or 174, and either 169 or 179; Chemistry IA-B-C, SlA-B and one quarter statistics; Physics 3A-B-C, 3LA-LB-LC; one of the following Social Ecol\u00ad ogy E12S, IA-8-C, or another option of the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humanities or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must attain a 2.0 grade point average in required Biological Sciences courses. Planning a Program of Study A normal program of study for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is similar to that for the regular Biological Sciences major, except that Biological Sciences 102 and 120 are normally taken in the sophomore year. In the junior and senior years a program of study in Ecology and Environmental Biology requires Information and Computer Science IA rather than Biological Sciences 107. In addition, required electives in biological sciences, engineering, and social ecology replace the requirement for three satellite courses. The UCI breadth requirement may be satisfied in the concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology in a manner similar to the regular Biological Sciences major. Further clarification on the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology may be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Special Programs and Courses Freshman Honors Curriculum Individually accelerated programs of study can be designed for freshman students who enter the School of Biological Sciences with strong backgrounds in biology and who have achieved scores of 4 or S in the biology section of the Advanced Placement Examination. Such freshmen are exempt from the first course in the Biological Sciences Core (Biological Sciences 90, Diversity of Life) and begin the second Core course (Biological Sciences 101, Evolutionary Biology and Genetics) during the fall quarter of their first year. This program enables participants to complete the I UC IRVINE - 1983-198480 Biological Sciences fourth Core course by the end of their first year. Any stu\u00ad dent with such Advanced Placement credit should contact the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for more informa\u00ad tion regarding this program. Biological Sciences 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences has the opportunity to pursue independent experimen\u00ad tal laboratory or field research under the direct supervision of a professor in the School of Biological Sciences or in the UCI-California College of Medicine as an apprentice scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scientist, the student is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of sci\u00ad ence and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptional students, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research experience, if they so desire, before they graduate. Although the School of Biological Sciences does not require training in a foreign language, some areas of research demand that stu\u00ad dents possess foreign language skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign language needs with their advisors to see if such training is important for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biological sci\u00ad ences is best accomplished by students working together with their faculty advisors. Excellence in Research Program The School of Biological Sciences believes that successful par\u00ad ticipation in creative research is one of the highest academic goals its undergraduates can attain and accordingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research certificates. Through undergraduate research and the Excel\u00ad lence in Research Program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and faculty, and possibly of see\u00ad ing their research papers published. Selected papers are pub\u00ad lished in the School's Journal of Undergraduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed .a min\u00ad imum of three quarters (with at least one quarter taken dur\u00ad ing the academic year of the symposium) are eligible to par\u00ad ticipate. They must be in good academic standing, have a grade point average of 2.3 or better, and be making normal progress in biological sciences. Marine Ecology Super Course For the winter quarter of odd years, Biological Sciences 181 (Advanced Marine Ecology) and 182 (Applied Marine Produc\u00ad tivity), or a similar grouping, are combined into a Marine Ecology Super Course. These courses, with a Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 research course, constitute a student's entire win\u00ad ter quarter curriculum. The course is limited to 20 students with selection based on a questionnaire and interview. Pre\u00ad requisites are completion of Biological Sciences 102 and con\u00ad sent of instructor. Terrestrial Ecology Super Course For the spring quarter of even years, Biological Sciences 167 (Field Botany), 184 (Insect Ecology), and 189 (Ecological Ener\u00ad getics) or a similar grouping, are combined into a Terrestrial Ecology Super Course. These courses, with a Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 research course, constitute a student's entire spring quarter curriculum. The course is limited to 20 stu\u00ad dents with selection based on a questionnaire and interview. Prerequisites are completion of Biological Sciences 102 and consent of instructor. Undergraduate Teaching Opportunities Through the Tutoring Program, students can immediately put to practice skills they have learned in their biology train\u00ad ing. This program provides opportunities for students to develop teaching abilities and to perform a worthwhile and necessary service. In the Tutoring Program, UCI students tutor other UCI students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Business Administration (M.B.A.), in Public Adminis\u00ad tration (M.F.A.), or Business and Public Administration (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of either the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's de\u00ad gree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor. Special Research Resources Special research resources include the Laser Microbeam Pro\u00ad gram (LAMP), a research, training, and service facility in the area of laser microbeam technology; the School of Biological Sciences Biohazard (P-3) Facility, which provides laboratory facilities for working with biological agents or biological molecules such as recombinant DNA which would be haz\u00ad ardous when used in open laboratories; the Museum of Sys\u00ad tematic Biology, a teaching and research facility which cur\u00ad rently contains material on local populations of plants, inver\u00ad tebrates, and vertebrates; the Developmental Biology Center, devoted to analyzing developmental mechanisms in amphibi\u00ad ans, insects, and other invertebrates; the Center for Neuro\u00ad biology of Learning and Memory, a research center for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying learning and memory; the UCI Arboretum, a botanical garden facility; the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which supports con\u00ad trolled marsh biota; the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, a high\u00ad desert habitat in San Bernardino County; and the UCI Eco\u00ad logical Preserve, which includes coastal hills on the campus, once under heavy grazing, but now returning to a more nat\u00ad ural state. It is important to note that the School has access to the on-campus UCI-California College of Medicine, there\u00ad by providing an opportunity for the sharing of both teaching and research activities. Advising: Academic, Career, Health Sciences Academic Advising The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program and provides academic counseling as well as special services particularly in the area of preprofes- UC IRVINE - 1983-1984sional career counseling. Undergraduate Biological Sciences students should consultthe Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for information on academic requirements for the degree, career opportunities, the Biological Sciences 199 Research Program, available tutoring for Biological Sciences courses, Biological Sciences student organizations, and scho\u00ad larship information. Students can also come to the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office to change a grade, change their major, apply for graduation, or for any other help they might need related to their academic career at UCI. All freshmen will be enrolled in small-group freshman seminars (Biological Sciences 2). All other new students will be enrolled in special sections of Biological Sciences 190. Upper-division peer advisors will be actively involved in these seminars. Peer Academic Advisors. The Peer Academic Advisors are upper-division Biological Sciences majors who bring with them valuable academic and social experiences. Their func\u00ad tions include counseling students\u00b7 in matters of major selec\u00ad tion, program planning, petitioning, tutoring, learning skills problems, and participation in cocurricular and extracurricu\u00ad lar activities. The Peer Advisors are located in the Biological Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. Office hours are posted at the beginning of each quarter, and anyone should feel free to drop by and discuss any social or academic problems. Career Advising Information on graduate and professional schools in the health sciences can be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Additional career information and job opportunities are available through the UCI Career Planning and Placement Office. The Student Affairs Office has devel\u00ad oped a complete career library and a close relationship with the Career Planning and Placement Center in an effort to provide current, relevant career information for biology stu\u00ad dents. Special events designed to provide career i.nformation are the annual Biological Sciences Career Fair and monthly career workshops, both of which are cosponsored by the Student Affairs Office and the Career Planning and Place\u00ad ment Center. Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Sci\u00ad ence degree include laboratory technology, publishing, tech\u00ad nical editing, pharmaceutical sales, and training programs in county, state, and federal agencies. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pursue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. A B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare stu\u00ad dents for employment in education, medical technology (usu\u00ad ally one year), physical therapy, and various other areas. Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which includes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and trop\u00ad ical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a Master's program. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them bacteriology, biochemistry, biometeorology, botany, cytology, ecology, fishery biology, genetics, home economics, microbiology, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, public health, range management, soil conservation, and zoology. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include medicine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and veterinary medicine. Biological Sciences 81 Health Sciences Advising Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs checked in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. They should also check deadlines for taking the New Medical College Admission Test or other required tests and applica\u00ad tion deadlines. The New Medical College Admission Test and the Dental Admission Test, required by most medical and dental schools, are administered in spring and fall each year on the Irvine campus. These tests should be taken in the spring, a year and one-half before the student plans to enter medical or dental school. Many of our students desire a career related to their educa\u00ad tion in the biological sciences. Students can go into medicine, dentistry, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, veterinary medi\u00ad cine, and related medical fields; into teaching; and into research in the biological sciences. In properly preparing for such careers, planning is essential early in a student's education. Leaders in dental, medical, and veterinary education recom\u00ad mend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of dentistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sciences may receive the required preprofessional training on the Irvine campus. This preprofessional training may be accomplished by (1) completing the major in Biological Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or department and ful\u00ad filling concurrently the specific course requirements of the dental, medical, or other professional school the student expects to attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose elec\u00ad tives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physi\u00ad cal chemistry, or other specific courses required or recom\u00ad mended by graduate schools. Health Sciences Advisory Committee The Health Sciences Advisory Committee consists of faculty and academic counselors in the School of Biological Sciences. The Committee offers specialized services, for a fee, to all students applying to postgraduate professional schools in the health sciences, including (1) a Committee interview and let\u00ad ter of recommendation for most professional school applica\u00ad tions, (2) a personal file containing the student's letters of recommendation, and (3) a service of sending all recommen\u00ad dations for a student to professional and graduate schools. Student Participation BSSA. The School of Biological Sciences highly recommends undergraduate participation in its student organizations. The Biological Sciences Student Association (BSSA) is an auton\u00ad omous student-run organization which provides a liaison among the administration, science faculty, Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office, other biology-oriented organizations, and other students. Some of its activities include teaching evaluations, an annual Biofaire, special quarterly events, pub\u00ad lication of a list of 199 research courses available in the Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, and a quarterly newsletter. AED. Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is an international honor society for students preparing for careers in the health pro\u00ad fessions. AED strives to stimulate an appreciation of health careers through interaction among prehealth students, health educators, and practitioners in a variety of health care fields. AED annually sponsors workshops on interview techniques and a series of talks on selecting, applying to, and financing I UC IRVINE - 1983-198482 Biological Sciences medical school. A blood drive, sponsored by AED and offered in conjunction with UCIMC and the Student Health Center, takes place every two months. Guest speakers from every aspect of the health care field highlight weekly meetings. BSSO. The Black Students in Science Organization (BSSO) was established to maintain a unified and supportive com\u00ad munity of successful Black science and prehealth professional majors at UCI. The group holds biweekly meetings; sponsors guest speakers; provides academic support in the form of study sessions, examinations, and study aids from previous courses; organizes trips to medical schools, hospitals, and conferences; arranges gatherings with doctors and medical students; hosts fund-raising events; and compiles and dissem\u00ad inates information on careers, conferences, hospital and laboratory positions, and issues affecting the Black commu\u00ad nity in particular. BSSO also works in close association with the UCI-California College of Medicine chapter of the Stu\u00ad dent National Medical Association. Major achievements have included \"BSSO Week\" and the cosponsoring of an annual \"UCI-CCM Third World Pre-Medical Awareness Conference.\" CCM. Chicanos for Creative Medicine has been established to promote interaction among Biological Sciences and pre\u00ad health science Chicano-Latino students at UCI. The aims of CCM are (1) to help members attain their career goals, (2) to provide resource information pertinent to the success of Chicano- Latino students at UCI, and (3) to create and main\u00ad tain a sense of awareness and attitude of being a Chicano\u00ad Latino student at UCI. Activities include guest lecturers speaking on their research; Latino professionals, including physicians, dentists, and other health professionals, speaking on their careers; field trips to communities lacking adequate health care; and quarterly fund raisers. The group works closely with the Chicano Medical Student Association of the UCI-California College of Medicine and with the La Raza Medical Association, a Statewide organization. Medspur. Medspur, conceived in 1977, is dedicated to serving prehealth professional students in both social and academic endeavors while at UCI. As the largest registered campus organization, Medspur brings together each year well over 500 students into the club who are interested in pursuing professional careers in human and animal medicine and in dentistry. Medspur's main goal is to bring students together in an environment conducive to the development of coopera\u00ad tion and friendship. Medspur is committed to providing members with the opportunity to learn about the realities of their prospective careers and the issues which face the health-care specialist. Medspur invites members of the medical community to speak about their professions and organizes interactions between undergraduate students, medical students, and faculty. In addition, Medspur sponsors dances, athletic events, MCAT preparation sessions, and examination reviews for Chemistry 1A-B-C, Chemistry 51A-B-C, and Biological Sciences 90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 105L, 106, and 106L. The highlight of each year is the annual UCI Medspur Southland Pre-Health Conference which allows students to explore all aspects of the health-care professions. Women in Bio Sci. Women in Bio Sci is a support group promoting general awareness for the advancement of women in the biological sciences and nontraditional professions. The group also works with other clubs and the Women's Resource Center. The group holds panel discussions, invites women in various areas of science for informal group presen\u00ad tations, participates in Wayzgoose and other campus activi\u00ad ties, and holds fund raisers. The Edward Steinhaus Society of the UCI Alumni Associa\u00ad tion. The Edward Steinhaus Society has been formed to ful\u00ad fill several objectives: (1) to serve the educational, social, and professional career aims of the alumni of the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, (2) to provide the School wlth an active and informed alumni support group, (3) to act as an interface between the School and the business, government, and local communities, (4) to assist current students in defining and reaching their career objectives, and (5) to serve as a refer\u00ad ence to all current Biological Sciences majors by providing them with information on career issues. The Chapter will provide Biological Sciences alumni with a continuing identifi\u00ad cation with UCI; provide a focal point for alumni activities on an intellectual, professional, and social basis; provide a strong link between the School and the local corporate and scientific communities; and provide continuing relevant feedback from alumni to the School. Graduate Program The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the bio\u00ad logical sciences. The four Departments of the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Psychobiology) and four Departments of the UCI-Cali\u00ad fornia College of Medicine (Anatomy, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology, and Physiology and Biophysics) cooperate in the conduct of a unified graduate program, administered by the School of Biological Sciences. The organization of the Departments encourages an interdisciplinary approach to scientific problems, especially at the graduate level. All programs of study, regardless of emphasis, lead to the degrees of Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) in the Biological Sciences (with the exception of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics which offers only the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences). At the current time, applica\u00ad tions for the M.A.T. are not being accepted. Each Department has a graduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of their individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated both by the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and by the program or the Department to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, and other qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the department(s) whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests. Some faculty are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. These faculty are from the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences; the Departments of Developmental and Cell Biology and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences; and the Department of Physiology and Biophys\u00ad ics in the UCI-California College of Medicine. This program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate stu\u00ad dents and faculty who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research prob\u00ad lems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in the Biological Sciences While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy programs are offered (with the exception of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics), emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph. D. programs. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offer\u00ad ings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the biological sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the student plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. Stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and academic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assistants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. Biological Sciences 83 Master of Science Plan 1: Thesis Plan -The student completes seven upper\u00ad division or graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan -The student completes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the student's field specialization. This program is terminated with a comprehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence -The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence- This level is attained by pass\u00ad ing an examination dealing with the student's particular interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have for\u00ad mally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dis\u00ad sertation on this research and defends it at an oral examina\u00ad tion during the final year of graduate study.

Schneiderman: Developmental biology and insect physiology Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology The Department of Developmental and Cell Biology is con\u00ad cerned with the de~elopment, physiology, structure, and function of organisms and their component cells. The main emphasis of the Developmental and Cell Biology graduate program is research training in developmental biology, com\u00ad parative physiology of animals, or cellular and developmental plant biology. The Department maintains facilities for research involving biochemistry; genetics; electron micro\u00ad scopy; cell, tissue, and organism culture; microsurgery; and neurophysiology. Students in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biol\u00ad ogy generally enter one of three graduate curricula. In the first year, those emphasizing comparative physiology take a three-quarter sequence of organismic physiology (Develop\u00ad mental and Cell Biology 210). Those emphasizing develop\u00ad mental biology take a series of three courses on molecular and cellular biology during the first year, followed by a total of five advanced courses during the subsequent years. Those emphasizing plant biology will take a three-quarter sequence with topics which center on plant molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. The selection of the first-year course program is made in consultation with a faculty advisory committee when the student first arrives on the campus. This committee monitors the student's progress through the first year after which the student's thesis committee is estab\u00ad lished and takes over the advising function. Students are able to diverge from this basic core into their areas of special interest by means of graduate seminar courses in subsequent years. At the end of the first year students in comparative physiology and cellular and developmental plant biology take an oral examination that covers a broad area in the general and related fields of interest to that student. Students in developmental and cell biology prepare and defend a research proposal and are examined in fields related to the proposal. Since many doctoral students in the Department undertake academic careers, the Department expects each graduate stu\u00ad dent to participate in a directed teaching experience during the graduate program. Students who enter with normal aca\u00ad demic preparation and pursue a full-time program df study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D degree within five years or less. Some faculty from the Department are members of an inter\u00ad disciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 82 for a description of the program.

Marsh: General entomology Eloy Eco-biological function of plant toxins; plant chemi- cal ecology; biological and cellular chemistry of plant products John T. Smiley: Plant-insect interactions Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology Ecology and evolutionary biology deals with the establish\u00ad ment of adaptations over evolutionary time and with the sig\u00ad nificance of these adaptations in ecological time. The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology focuses on problems at the population and community levels, with par\u00ad ticular emphasis placed on coevolved processes. While the Department has faculty specialists in plant and animal ecol\u00ad ogy and in marine and terrestrial ecology, primary attention is given to important ecological questions rather than to par\u00ad ticular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often centered at the interface of two or more of these specialties. Departmental research activities include eco\u00ad logical energetics, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator inter\u00ad actions, population and reproductive ecology, and community ecology. These research endeavors attempt to achieve a bal\u00ad ance between empirical and theoretical approaches to evolu\u00ad tionary and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the Department graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. program. All entering students are required to enroll during the first year in a two-quarter graduate core sequence. At the end of the first year, these students will complete an oral examination based upon the core courses and other materials the Department might require. Satisfactory performance on this examination is required for continuation in the graduate program. Students entering with a B.A. or B.S. degree will enroll in the graduate core for two consecutive years, while those entering with an M.A. or M.S. degree will enroll only for the initial year. Each entering graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory committee for guidance, with whom the student will meet at least once each quarter. All students are encouraged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee during their first year of residency. A comprehensive proposal is required before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the departmental faculty before the end of each academic year. Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be completed within five years. No more than seven years will be allowed for completion of the program. Prior to advancement to can\u00ad didacy for the Ph.D., students must satisfy two breadth requirements at the discretion of their advisory committee. One of these must be satisfied with a foreign language and the second by the attainment of an additional skill equivalent to a second foreign language (i.e., a second foreign language, UC IRVINE - 1983-1984demonstrated skills in computer-statistics, attainment of unusual technical expertise necessary for dissertation research, etc.). Advancement to doctoral candidacy by a com\u00ad prehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Appli\u00ad cants for this program should have a solid undergraduate program in biology and ecology, emphasizing both research and field work. In addition, course work in statistics, mathe\u00ad matics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are required to submit verbal, quantitative, and advanced biology GRE scores. The deadline for application is February 1.

The program makes extensive use of health science facilities, in addition to those of the School of Biological Sciences. The curriculum is designed to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in\u00ad depth comprehension of modern biochemistry and molecular biology and who are highly competent in a given subspecialty. The faculty's research interests include structure and syn\u00ad thesis of nucleic acids and proteins, regulation, metabolism, biochemical genetics, gene organization, and immunology. The first-year student is required to take a core of advanced courses (203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, and 209), to become associated with the laboratories of at least three different investigators, and to attend the 201A-B-C seminar series. During the first year, students are advised by members of the graduate committee. Upon successful completion of the first year, the student is given a comprehensive oral examina\u00ad tion to test breadth and depth of knowledge. Although further supplemental work may be recommended, the stu\u00ad dent normally begins a specific research project with a faculty member in the second year. The student, by passing an oral examination by the end of the third year on the proposed dis\u00ad sertation work, may advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students normally complete their degree programs after a total of five years of graduate study. Participation in the seminar series (201A-B-C) and completion of at least one satellite course per year (210-279) are expected of all continu\u00ad ing students. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of the training of graduate students at all levels. The graduate committee may waive some of the above requirements for candidates for the Master's degree. Applicants should have adequate undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Students who have not had an adequate physical chemistry course are expected to take Chemistry 130A-B-C during their first year.

Dearden, Acting Chair: Growth inhibition and pulmonary edema interactions Christine nervous system morphological plasticity Roland A. Giolli: Experimental neuroanatomy; visual system Herbert system E. Swett: Sensory-motor systems of the spinal cord The Department of Anatomy in the UCI-California College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, with specialized research train\u00ad ing in the neurosciences. Research programs in the neuro\u00ad sciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, the central neural regulation of circadian rhythms, forebrain organization, and organization and development of sensory systems. Research programs also include growth inhibition, cartilage, and pulmonary edema. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the following data. Students are encour\u00ad aged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous techniques in various species. Students in the Department of Anatomy have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to1con\u00ad duct innovative and fundamentally sound research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable anatomists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of gross, cellular, and subcellular anatomy; physiology; and biochemistry. In the first year, stu\u00ad dents are required to take neuroanatomy, microscopic anat\u00ad omy, embryology, gross anatomy, biochemistry, and physiol\u00ad ogy. Over the usual four-year training period the student is required to complete a practical course in statistics, four departmental seminar courses, four laboratory tutorials, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy or other departments on campus may also be taken; examples include pharmacol\u00ad ogy, psychobiology, cell biology, genetics, computer science, pathology, and physiology. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Only a minimum of the third year is spent taking courses. Each year following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the student and the Graduate Committee decide to which labora\u00ad tories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. An oral Qualifying Examination at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Commit\u00ad tee. The examination covers anatomy and focuses on the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee. The majority of the second, third, and fourth years is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written disserta\u00ad tion suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the stu\u00ad dent's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examination. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a pro\u00ad cess that normally will take four years to complete.

I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984100 Fine Arts School of Fine Arts Robert Garfias Dean The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is creating and performing works of art in an atmosphere in which the creative process is central. We are committed to the creative act: to making and performing. A program based on such a commitment requires a faculty experienced in the creative process. The faculty in the School of Fine Arts is comprised primarily of permanent artists-in-residence. Studio courses in all areas are taught by eminent faculty who have earned their living professionally and who continue to maintain profes\u00ad sional assignments and commitments. In addition to the permanent artists-in-residence faculty, vis\u00ad iting artists comprise about one-third of the staff, providing a constant inflow of ideas and personalities. A variety of artists challenges the students' sensibilities and encourages them to think and to create freshly and freely. The focus on the creative process, the professional and scholar-performer faculty, and the individual's commitment and courage provide, we feel, an ideal condition for the serious student in the arts who wants to be painting, sculp\u00ad turing, dancing, acting, singing, directing, choreographing, writing, or playing an instrument/six to 10 hours a day dur\u00ad ing the most sensitive and formative years of life. Our cen\u00ad tral concern is the development of a creative talent in an atmosphere of creative activity. In addition to programs con\u00ad cerned primarily with studio and performance activity, courses of study in the history and theory of the arts are offered as major areas of concentration. The School of Fine Arts is organized into areas of instruction rather than with formal departments. Undergraduate majors are offered in Fine Arts (General Interdisciplinary), History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Requirements include extensive studio and work\u00ad shop experiences, essential theoretical and historical back\u00ad ground studies, and exercises in criticism. The requirements for all performing and studio majors in the fine arts are designed to provide opportunities for the student-artist to work creatively for at least four hours a day from the fresh\u00ad man year through graduation. Courses in film writing and television are available in the Drama program. A student who wishes to pursue a double major by combin\u00ad ing two majors from the School of Fine Arts or by combining a major from the School with a major from another academic unit may do so with the proviso that only one major can be officially declared until the senior year. At that time, when the requirements for both majors are nearly completed, the student can be approved as a double major. In addition to producing student concerts, musicals, and dramatic performances, the School of Fine Arts presents a varied offering of cultural events each year, including distin\u00ad guished lecturers, world-renowned concert artists, outstand\u00ad ing dance and drama groups, jazz and folk performers, a film series, and a gallery program. The Fine Arts Village includes studio and classroom space for the areas of History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Specialized facilities for the studio art area include an Art Gallery and six well-lighted studios for drawing, paint\u00ad ing, sculpture, graphics, and ceramics. Power equipment for sculpture, two presses for graphics (intaglio), print making and lithography, and two kilns for ceramics are available. The Village Theatre, conventionally designed, contains an orches\u00ad tra pit, a large completely equipped stage, and seating for 420 people. The Concert Hall, seating 230, has a thrust plat-form stage, a Baroque pipe organ, and excellent acoustics. The Studio Theatre provides an experimental stage base without fixed seats, allowing complete freedom in determin\u00ad ing the style of production. The Little Theatre, located in Humanities Hall, and the Virginia and Norman Nixon Studio Theatre are intimate proscenium theatres for Drama Work\u00ad shops and graduate directing projects. All theatres are com\u00ad pletely equipped with modern sound and lighting systems, and students involved in productions work in completely equipped and professionally operated scenery and costume shops. Campus television studios are also located in the Vil\u00ad lage. Music students attend orchestra rehearsals in a special Village facility also utilized for choral and instrumental ensemble rehearsals. Practice rooms are equipped with Stein way and other practice pianos, and Steinway concert grands are used in concerts. A music listening laboratory is also available to music students. Dance classes in ballet, mod\u00ad ern, and jazz are held in four locations: the two main studios in the Fine Arts Village, Crawford Hall (gymnasium), and the Studio Theatre. In addition to their formal instruction and participation, stu\u00ad dents in the School of Fine Arts and qualified students from other academic areas are involved at a less formal level as participants, organizers, and coordinators throughout the year in the various production units, including University Chorus, UCI Symphony Orchestra, University Theatre, Stu\u00ad dent Exhibitions, Graduate Art Gallery, Dance Concerts, Dance Workshop, Drama Workshop, Music and Opera Work\u00ad shop, and Television Production. The opportunity is provided for all qualified UCI students to participate in the UCI Pep Band and Song Leaders, and to receive course credit for this participation. Those interested should see the instructor of Theatre Orchestra, Drama 173, about requirements for participation and enrollment in the appropriate course. All new Fine Arts students are assigned or may choose their own faculty advisors and are encouraged to meet with them during orientation week and periodically throughout the year to plan programs of study and to discuss educational and career objectives. In addition, students are invited to make use of the counseling services in the Fine Arts Counseling Office for assistance with programs, requirements, or any academic matter.

This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Business Administration (M.B.A.), in Public Adminis\u00ad tration (M.P.A.), or Business and Public Administration UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Fine Arts 101 UC IRVINE - 1983-1984102 Fine Arts/General Interdisciplinary (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of either the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the I80 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's de\u00ad gree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor. Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines repre\u00ad sented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate cur\u00ad riculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of the Concentration that participat\u00ad ing students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the contributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building. Honors Students who have distinguished themselves academically will be considered for honors at graduation. A general criteria is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus. In keeping with the Academic Senate Resolution no more than I2 percent of the graduating seniors may receive honors. Undergraduate Program Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: None (see under programs). Graduate Program The School of Fine Arts offers a program leading to the degree of Master of Fine Arts (in Fine Arts) with concentra\u00ad tions in Studio Art, Dance, Draina, and Music. The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is performance-the crea\u00ad tive act. Research activities are concerned with illuminating performance and inspiring the studio experience. The intel-lectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and per\u00ad formance. The aim of the program is, thus, to produce liter\u00ad ate artists who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, who are capable of integrating knowledge into creative acts, and who are disciplined to the point of freedom. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and professional excellence cannot exist without each other. Admission to the Program Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordinarily must be completed by March I as the number of graduate students that can be admitted to the School of Fine Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for audi\u00ad tions, interviews, and the submission of portfolios, composi\u00ad tions, and dossiers, as appropriate, by March I. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by March I, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Financial Aid Office. The School of Fine Arts has a modest number of teaching assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June I for the following academic year. Upon admission to the program the student will be assigned an advisor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of undergraduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if the student is to derive full benefit from graduate study. Fine Arts General Interdisciplinary The program in general interdisciplinary studies is designed for students who wish to combine the various disciplines in fine arts. Although participation in studio classes is required, the program emphasizes the study of the history, theory, and criticism of the arts' in three of the School's instructional areas. The nature of the\u00b7program provides each student the opportunity to plan a uniquely individual course of study with the approval of an advisor. Upon completion of this program, students will be awarded the B.A. in Fine Arts with General Interdisciplinary as the area of concentration. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: None.

History of Art George Bauer, Ph.D. Princeton University, Chair and Associate Pro\u00ad fessor of Art History (Renaissance/Baroque art) Linda Bauer, Ph.D. Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, Associate Professor of Art History (Renaissance/Baroque art) Hara Georgiou, Ph.D. Bryn Mawr, Associate Professor of Art History (Ancient art) Anna Gonosova, Ph.D. Harvard University, Assistant Professor of Art History (Medieval art) Philip Leider, M.A. University of Nebraska, Lecturer in Art HisJory (Modern art) The program in the history of art is designed to provide a comprehensive study of art as a humanistic discipline. The program is concerned with understanding the function and characteristics of the monuments of civilization. Artists' intentions and achievements are studied in their historical settings. Students majoring in the history of art should select appropriate courses in classics, history, literature, and philos\u00ad ophy, as well as in other areas of the fine arts. All majors in the history of art are encouraged to study a second language beyond the minimum program requirement of two years in a single language at the university level. Careers for the History of Art Major A Bachelor's degree in the History of Art is excellent prepa\u00ad ration for pursuing either a career as an art historian or museum curator, or professional study in an entirely differ\u00ad ent discipline. History of Art majors have gone on to gradu\u00ad ate and professional school to study art history, archaeology, law, library science, business '(in some cases with special focus in the fine arts), or teacher education. The study of the His\u00ad tory of Art is a valuable part of a liberal education that pro\u00ad vides a means of looking at the history and culture of both the past and the present through the world's great rna s terpieces. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: None.

The curriculum constantly relates studio practice to the development of the visual arts and current critical theory. It aims to develop a sense of visual awareness by as wide a range of the study of art as possible. The student majoring in art experiences the creative aspects of art by learning to think with the materials and techniques of the medium. Careers for the Studio Art Major UC Irvine's Studio Art faculty and gallery exhibitions have provided the starting point for a great many prospective practicing artists. An unusually high percentage of Studio Art alumni have gone on to successful careers as profes\u00ad sional, exhibiting artists. Many graduates teach at all levels and work in museums as curators or preparators (those who prepare the gallery for an exhibit and hang or install the works). A Studio Art major is also good preparation for further study at the graduate level. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: None. Program Requirements Studio Major: Art Studio 30A-B-C; Art History 40A-B-C or any three courses from Art History 20A-B-C-D-E-F; one year in lower-division studio courses in sequence; three courses in history of modern art; 12 upper-division studio courses (Art Studio 145 through 194).

General Information The M.F.A. program focuses primarily on development of experimental concepts and format relevant to contemporary issues as they affect visual arts, rather than on processes of traditional techniques and ideas. A small, personal environ\u00ad ment supports the individual's efforts in research, develop\u00ad ment, and exhibition of ideas by providing as much latitude for special needs as possible. By meeting with students on a one-to-one basis or in small groups, a variety of art experi\u00ad ences occur. Internships, selected field trips, contemporary exhibitions in the Art Gallery, contact with visiting profes\u00ad sional artists, and seminars provide the framework for the program. Because of the limited physical facilities, studio space is arranged privately. Admission Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, and submit by March I a port\u00ad folio of their creative work or 12 or more slides, on a #80 Kodak Carousel tray, of their most recent work. Normally, anyone who has earned an M.F.A. degree in Studio Art will not be considered for admission into the program. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984General Degree Requirements Normally two years of residence are required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quarters, exclusive of summer sessions. The student's progress and body of work will be reviewed by a faculty committee, on a regular basis, yearly.

The classical academic approach to ballet adheres to those principles developed from Noverre through Petipa and Cecchetti modified to accommo\u00ad date our current understanding of those laws of physics and of the human anatomy applicable to the study of dance. The workshops in contemporary dance explore and extend the various approaches to modern dance and jazz, concentrating on physiological and rhythmic problems encountered in con\u00ad temporary choreography. Studies in preclassic dance forms and their musical structures provide additional workshop experience as well as significant research materials for chore\u00ad ographic problems. Workshops in ethnic dance provide addi\u00ad tional choreographic resources in the context of their cultural setting. Theoretical and historical courses complement the practical work in workshops, choreography, and perfor\u00ad mance. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as dancers, as choreographers, and as teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make dance their vocation, have a serious interest in the the\u00ad ory, practice, and history of dance. The traditional technique of classical ballet constitutes a craft and style that serves not only as a physiological center for the logical training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. Workshop experiences build progressively on the techniques of ballet and extend through the contemporary idioms of modern and jazz. The aim is to develop kinetic resources, precision, flexibility, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive body. Careers for the Dance Major In addition to the perhaps more obvious careers in profes\u00ad sional dance, choreography, and teaching, a major in Dance also can serve as a basis for graduate study or job opportuni\u00ad ties in, for example, dance therapy, dance history, kinesiology/ anatomy, and dance notation. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: None. Performance Requirements Students planning to m<~jor in dance should develop basic ability in techniques of ballet and modern dance forms. Although freshmen entering with fewer than 12 units are not required to audition, a placement examination is offered. The evaluation of the examination indicates the level of ballet and modern at which the student is placed. Freshmen declar\u00ad ing the dance major are encouraged to take the placement examination, especially if they feel they could be placed at a higher level than Ballet I and Modern I. At the end of the freshman year the student should select one of the four major emphases with faculty approval. At the end of the sophomore year, the faculty will determine whether the stu\u00ad dent is making sufficient progress to proceed as an upper\u00ad division major. All advanced standing applicants (entering students with 12 units or more) to the University who have indicated an inter\u00ad est in majoring in dance are required to audition and will be notified by the School of the date. Evaluations of the stu\u00ad dent's audition will indicate whether or not the student may major in dance and will indicate the appropriate placement level in ballet and modern for students admitted to the major. This placement level determines the minimum amount of years it will take to complete the degree requirements. Inasmuch as the level of performance ability generally deter\u00ad mines the length of time in study, and all transfer students must anticipate meeting the total performance requirements for the B.A. degree, students deficient in level of perfor\u00ad mance in comparison to their level of academic study should be prepared to extend their studies in order to meet perfor\u00ad mance requirements.

Each major in drama experiences exacting and rigorous training in the mutually interrelated areas of the theatre: performance, design, literature, history, and criticism. The curriculum con\u00ad stantly relates studio practices, technical resources, and pro\u00ad ductional techniques to the development of dramatic litera\u00ad ture and current critical theory. The student specializes dur\u00ad ing the last two years of study in acting, directing, design, television, or criticism. The continuous production of plays, musicals, operettas, and operas constitutes the major activity of the program. Stu\u00ad dents are treated as members of a theatrical organization, and they acquire experiences in all phases of theatrical pro\u00ad duction in a professionally disciplined atmosphere. Dramatic production centers on an exhaustive analysis of the script and on the challenge of communicating the complexities of the plan to an audience in a unified and meaningful production. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as actors, directors, designers, critics, and teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama. Careers for the Drama Major A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employment in theatre or films. A professional career in act-ing demands, in addition to excellent training, great talent, great dedication, and not a little bit of luck: intangibles no drama program can promise or even imply. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and televi\u00ad sion. At least seven thriving repertory theatres in the coun\u00ad try have been created by UCI Drama graduates; all of these theatres regularly add new members from the UCI alumni. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists. Many embark upon careers in law, business, arts manage\u00ad ment, advertising, and teaching; others pursue further study earning the Master of Fine Arts degree at Irvine or elsewhere. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: None. Program Requirements One year survey in the development of dramatic literature (Drama 40A-B-C); one year in acting (Drama 30A-B-C); three courses in design (Drama SOA-B-C); one course in makeup (Drama 153); an introductory course in production theory (Drama 10); two upper-division courses in dramatic literature; six upper-division courses in addition to the two in dramatic literature mentioned above (these may be in studio work and/or dramatic literature, playwriting, film writing, television production, and criticism); two quarters in dance (these courses may be taken on Pass/Not Pass); two quarters of theatre production (Drama 101).

Admission Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study and hold a B.A., B.F.A., or higher degree. By March 1 applicants must submit dossiers of biographical information and theatrical experience, together with photo\u00ad graphs, essays, reviews, production books, and portfolios, as appropriate. Normally an audition is required for all applicants who intend to follow the curriculum in acting or music theatre; auditions are scheduled at UCI, San Francisco, and in New York City shortly after the appiication deadline. Interviews for appli\u00ad cants in directing are also required; for applicants in design, interviews are strongly recommended. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984General Degree Requirements Normally three years of residence is required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for nine quarters, exclusive of summer sessions. During the first year of residence each candidate will prepare, for credit, two graduate projects, in either acting, directing, design, theatrical research, or a combination of two of these. Satisfactory completion of these projects, as determined by the faculty, is prerequisite to entering the second year of the program. During the second year of the program the candidate will be examined on general familiarity with the history of the thea\u00ad tre and the principal works of dramatic literature. An assigned list of books and plays will form the basic syllabus of this examination. The required thesis normally consists of directing, designing, or playing a principal role in a major production, and collect\u00ad ing in essay form the evidences of research, analysis, and judgments which formed a part of the production experience. Each graduate student is expected to participate in produc\u00ad tions throughout residence at UCI.

Bailes Dean The School of Humanities sets for itself the goal of helping to develop both the analytical and creative powers of its stu\u00ad dents with particular respect not only to vocational goals, but also the larger questions of human conduct, the modes of human communication and symbolization, speculative thought, and the verbal arts. The School includes those basic disciplines of language, literature, history, and philosophy that deal fundamentally with the texture and dimensions of experience, both individual and social, past and present. The School takes as its concern a large portion of the liberal edu\u00ad cation not only of students who intend to major within its confines, but also of students who come to it from other parts of the campus. Because of the nature of the disciplines collected in the School, it is deeply concerned with language and its many facets. Further, though the School has estab\u00ad lished a number of specific major courses of study, it is intent on integrating the basic disciplines in a variety of ways at the undergraduate level and to some extent at the graduate level.

B.A., M.A., M.A.T., Ph.D. Honors Students are nominated for honors at graduation on the basis of scholarship and special achievements. To be nomi\u00ad nated the student must achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.40 and receive strong recommendation from the department. A minimum of 18 courses (72 units) in residence at a UC campus is a necessary condition for honors at grad\u00ad uation. To be eligible for nomination, the student must meet all honors criteria and must file an application for graduation by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year. Undergraduate Programs The School offers undergraduate majors in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, French, Ger\u00ad man, History, Humanities, Linguistics, Philosophy, Russian, and Spanish. It offers lower-division courses in Hebrew and lower-and upper-division courses in Italian and Portuguese. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores. The advisors are particularly interested in undergraduate education and espe\u00ad cially knowledgeable about University regulations, require\u00ad ments in and outside the School, course content, options to major, and other matters that may present difficulties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the various disciplines represented in the School. During that time the lower-division advisor is prepared to help the student keep options to major open, plan a coherent program of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humanities, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely with their advisors will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities partici\u00ad pate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serv\u00ad ing on committees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. Graduates of the School of Humanities often go on to gradu\u00ad ate and professional schools. An undergraduate major in the humanities is excellent preparation for future careers in law, teaching at all levels, business, journalism, administration, government service at all levels, and also medicine. Humanities Honors Program The Honors Program of the School of Humanities is designed to challenge superior students and provide them with unique opportunities for interdisciplinary work. Honors Program participants will have the added advantage of being able to pursue independent research with a faculty member and to participate in advanced seminars in humanistic inquiry. The Program is open by invitation to students from programs and disciplines outside the School of Humanities. In 1983-84, the Humanities Honors Program will offer the first of three honors sequences: Honors Humanities lA-B-C. Open by invitation to selected students, the course provides special discussion sections for honors students enrolled in the Humanities Core Course. In 1984-85, a year-long interdisci\u00ad plinary seminar will be added to the Program. Addition of an upper-division sequence is planned for 1985-86; it will com\u00ad bine critical analysis with the writing of an honors thesis in the student's major field. Honors students are invited to participate in special student\u00ad faculty colloquia as well as informal gatherings. Individual\u00ad ized counseling on courses and careers is available. Entering freshmen participants may request priority consideration for housing. For additional information, please contact the Office of the Dean, School of Humanities, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, CA 92717, telephone (714) 856-5132. Language Laboratory The Language Laboratory serves as the audio-lingual re\u00ad source center for the following languages taught in the School of Humanities: Spanish, French, German, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, and Hebrew. Students, faculty, and staff may listen to cassettes of audio material in the Laboratory, or they may check out cassettes and cassette players to practice at home. Members of the community are welcome to use the Language Laboratory facilities on campus. In addition to the languages offered in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, the Language Laboratory has a tape library that includes reels in Persian, Romanian, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch, Swed\u00ad ish, Norwegian, English, and Swahili. Arrangements can be made to provide these languages on cassette. Through the business office, the Language Laboratory oper\u00ad ates a translation referral service for students, faculty, staff, members of the community, and local businesses.

School Requirements Humanities IA-B-C, taken in the freshman year (transfer students may substitute appropriate course work in composi\u00ad tion, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission: apply in the Dean's Office); two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned lower-division ad\u00ad visor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. Consultation should be made by the second week of each quarter. School Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for each major must be completed success\u00ad fully at UCI. See individual major requirements for specific courses. Graduate Programs The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most depart\u00ad ments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. An exception is the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing). In addition to the sem\u00ad inars offered by the various departments, the School spon\u00ad sors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught jointly by faculty members from various departments. Further, several departments offer a few stu\u00ad dents the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students is accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the Office of Teacher Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of the various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student gradu\u00ad ate advisory committee, which directly advises the Dean. Department of Classics B.P. Reardon, D.U. Universite de Nantes, Chair of the Department and Professor of Classics (Late Greek literature, Greek novel) Luci Berkowitz, Ph.D. The Ohio State University, Professor of Classics (pastoral poetry, literary criticism) Theodore F. Brunner, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Classics and Director, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae ProJect (computer applica\u00ad tion to classical literature, Augustan literature) Peter Colaclides, Ph.D. University of Athens, Professor of Classics (linguistics, poetics, criticism) Richard I. Frank, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Associate Professor of Classics and History (Roman history, Classical tradition) Dana F. Sutton, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Associate Professor of Classics (Greek drama, satyr-play) Undergraduate Program The Department of Classics aims to provide the undergradu\u00ad ate student with an exposure to the origins and heritage of Western civilization. The Department is committed to a two\u00ad fold purpose: (I) disseminating interest in and knowledge of classical civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin language and literature; and (2), through English translation courses in classical literature, history, civilization, and mythology, helping students to appreciate the pervasive influence of Greece and Rome on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics and a major in Classical Civili\u00ad zation in which most of the required courses are in English translation. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, the basis of studying the Classics must be competence in both of the classical languages. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first year Latin or Greek the student has already been introduced to some of the major classical authors in the original. From then on, the student is concerned with reading and interpret\u00ad ing the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and will devote study to literary and textual criticism. In addition, students obtain an extensive background in ancillary fields such as ancient history, archaeology, art, drama, philosophy, and religion. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for those stu\u00ad dents who have no plans to pursue graduate studies in the classical languages, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound exposure to the classical world. The nucleus of this major consists of one year of study (or its equivalent) in either classical language and a minimum of 10 courses in English translation (seven of which are given by the Department) concerning such topics as classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, and drama. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civili\u00ad zation should obtain a copy of the pamphlet, \"The Classics,\" available in the departmental office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Latin will enroll in Latin IB, IC, 25, and 100 respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the approval of the Department Chair. Students with high school training in the classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision\u00ad making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the undergraduate majors, participate in all departmental meetings. They are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' inter\u00ad est in curriculum and personnel matters, and for the evalua\u00ad tion of both the academic program and the academic staff. Please direct inquiries regarding language placement, prereq\u00ad uisites, planning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings to the Office of the Chair, 142 Humanities Hall, (714) 856-6735/5896. Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agreement between the School of Humanities and the Uni\u00ad versity of Judaism in Los Angeles. Normally two years of Hebrew are offered which meet the Humanities foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement. Emphasis is on modern Israeli-spoken Hebrew, with some instruction in Biblical Hebrew during the second year. Hebrew language courses will not be offered in 1983-84 but may be resumed in 1984-85. Courses will con\u00ad tinue to be offered in aspects of Jewish history, philosophy, and literature (Classics 180A-B-C, 181, and 182A-B-C). UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 124. Departmental Requirements Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): five or more courses in the Greek seminar series (Greek 100); Greek 110; Latin 1A-B-C; Latin 25; two courses on the Latin 100 level. Classics (Latin emphasis): five or more courses in the Latin seminar series (Latin 100); Latin 110; Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 25; two courses on the Greek 100 level. Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study. Greek concentration-Greek 25; five courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin 25; two courses on the Latin 100 level; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Greek 120 recommended) or wtin concentration-Latin 25; five courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 25; two courses on the Greek 100 level; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Latin 120 recommended). NOTE: With the permission of the Department, an additional 100 series course in the same language may be substituted for Greek or Latin 25. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) 1A-B-C, or equiva\u00ad lent; Classics 35A-B-C; Classics 50A; at least one course each from the Classics 150, 160, and 170 series; three additional courses in classical history, classical philosophy, classical art, or classical civilization approved by the Classics Department. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discussion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possible moment, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various pro\u00ad grams. All majors are assigned to a faculty member for aca\u00ad demic advising. Career Opportunities The practical value of the study of the ancient world extends very distinctly into modern life. The discipline of Classics is primarily a valuable component of a liberal education; a knowledge of Greek and Roman language and literature, his\u00ad tory and philosophy, religion and mythology offers an excel\u00ad lent foundation for the investigation and appreciation of many aspects of modern civilization; in effect, it is an inter\u00ad disciplinary study. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in law, medicine, management, and other fields wel\u00ad come students with training in the Classics. So do many bus\u00ad iness corporations. In a world of rapid industrial develop\u00ad ment, in which highly specialized skills quickly become obso\u00ad lete because of changes in technology, many enterprises find it necessary to train prospective executives themselves, to suit their own needs. Businesses are well acquainted with the value of a classical training; they are aware that a student Classics 125 with a strong background in a respected and demanding major such as Classics has been trained in disciplined think\u00ad ing, ability to learn, and the ability to express oneself in clear, coherent, and cogent language, capabilities which they find valuable in a future manager. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the graduate in Classics or Classical Civilization. Most imme\u00ad diately, a major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate further study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excellent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines, such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, and linguistics, as well as for theological studies and for work in a wide range of humanities and social science subjects. Graduate Program The Classics graduate program emphasizes individual atten\u00ad tion under tutorial conditions and study in small groups. The number of students admitted is carefully limited and work is closely supervised. Each student is associated with various faculty members while developing general competence in the discipline, research methods, and teaching. The principal strength of the program is in the area of literature. The entering student should be qualified at least to the level of the B.A. in Classics; some students may be required to do additional work at the undergraduate level. Students entering with the B.A. are normally expected to complete the Ph.D. program in five years. Completion of a dissertation and its successful oral defense are required. A sample Ph.D. curriculum can be obtained on request from the Department. The M.A. degree may be conferred after two years of satisfactory work. Students meet in one group for regular course work consist\u00ad ing of three elements as follows: (1) a single weekly seminar, covering a different topic each quarter, which may meet on another UC campus in some quarters; most seminars are devoted to major literary topics; (2) a topically arranged directed reading course covering, in a three-year cycle, texts on the reading list; (3) tutorial instruction in Greek and Latin language and sty\u00ad lis tics and advanced prose composition. In addition to the above, instruction is given regularly in the tradition, methods, and tools of classical scholarship, includ\u00ad ing computer application to literature. In addition to course work, students are required to read extensively in the general field of Classics, under faculty guidance. Students take written examinations, and their progress is assessed periodically. Students are required to pass reading examinations in German and French at an early stage. After course work is completed, each student must pass an individ\u00ad ually designed qualifying examination, covering both the general field of Classics and the student's own interests, in order to become a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dis\u00ad sertation stage. The resources of the program are appreciably enhanced by contributions from other sources. In particular, cooperative arrangements are in force among the Classics graduate pro\u00ad grams of the UC campuses at Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara. Additionally, the program calls on visiting scholars, faculty from other UCI departments, and members of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (see below). UC IRVINE - 1983-1984126 Classics Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic studies, is closely affiliated with the Department of Classics.

Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is critical and theoreticaL Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in depart\u00ad mental affairs through two elected student committees, one of undergraduates, one of graduates, which are concerned primarily with matters of personnel and curriculum. The committees meet periodically with faculty committees of the Department, and the recommendations of student commit\u00ad tees become matters of record which accompany any recom\u00ad mendations emanating from the Department. Each quarter all students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate the particular course and teacher. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984128 English and Comparative Literature Careers for the English or Comparative Literature Major The study of literature helps students to express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, 'law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public relations, business, and management. An undergraduate major in either English or Comparative Liter\u00ad ature is also an especially good preparation for graduate study. The Undergraduate Majors Committee and the depart\u00ad mental faculty work closely with the Career Planning and Placement Center to help majors plan careers appropriate to the education in English or Comparative Literature at Irvine. Advisors encourage their students to investigate various careers-especially those outside the traditional fields for such majors (e.g., graduate study and law)-before these stu\u00ad dents have completed their undergraduate educations. Undergraduate Program The Department offers to the undergraduate three areas of study: The Program in Literary Criticism, which emphasizes a vari\u00ad ety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism of Eng\u00ad lish, American, and comparative literature. The Program in Writing, which offers an emphasis in the writing of poetry, fiction, or drama. Undergraduate courses in journalism and nonfiction are also available, including for\u00ad mal instruction and workshop experience for staff members of the campus newspaper. The aim of the program is to encourage the creative powers of students while introducing them to the discipline of reading and practical criticism, often in workshop situations. Under certain circumstances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the writing requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category I). See page 44. The Program in Comparative Literature, which though administratively a part of the Department, is basically inter\u00ad disciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other resources from the fields of the various modern and classical literatures and drama. The consciousness of the modern edu\u00ad cated person is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A student who completes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the history of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal competently with literary texts, whatever their period or national origins. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of liter\u00ad ary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bachelor's degree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bachelor's degree in Compara\u00ad tive Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. Students intending to major in English or Comparative Liter\u00ad ature should obtain a copy of Undergraduate Study in English and Comparative Literature from the departmental office. Comparative Literature is well-suited for students interested in a double major. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 124. Departmental Requirements English: Two courses from the E 28A-B-C or CL SOA-B-C groups (including either E 28A or CL SOA) and a third course either from those two groups or from E 6, 7, 8 or CL 8; CR IOOA; CR IOOB and CL 100 (approved seminars from the course groups numbered in the 103s and 104s may be substi\u00ad tuted for these courses); at least four courses from the E 101 group; at least five Department courses numbered above 101; competence in a foreign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quarters of work at Irvine (in clas\u00ad sical languages, IA-B-C and Greek or Latin 100 three times, though Greek or Latin 25 may be substituted for one of the 100 courses), plus (in modern languages) one course in a for\u00ad eign literature in which texts are read in the original lan\u00ad guage. Students selecting a writing emphasis have some flex\u00ad ibility in substituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally number more than the usual major. Residence Requirement for the English major: CR IOOA, CR IOOB, and three E lOis must be completed successfully at UCL Comparative Literature: Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or classical, to be able to read any standard literary or critical text in that language. If the stu\u00ad dent intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recommended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Litera\u00ad ture majors are normally required to take CL SOA-B-C . Transfer students may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these will include CR IOOA-B, CL 100, two courses (one 101 and one above 101) in a selected foreign language, or two lOis in two different foreign languages, or two years of a classical language; either E 103 or CL 103 or CL 104; appropriate study in English and American literature; and further study in literature or allied fields as recommended by the advisor. The Comparative Literature Program maintains a compre\u00ad hensive reading list in world literature, on which CL SOA-B\u00ad C is based. Students who have not taken and passed one or more of those courses may, by prior arrangement with the Director of the Program, take an examination on relevant parts of the reading list in qualifying for a Bachelor's degree in Comparative Literature. Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature major: CR IOOA and four upper-division English or Compar\u00ad ative Literature courses must be completed successfully at UCL Planning a Program of Study Students should plan, with their faculty advisors, coherent programs of study, including undergraduate seminars, work\u00ad shops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is pos\u00ad sible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an Eng\u00ad lish or Comparative Literature major as preprofessional train- UC IRVINE - 1983-1984ing in government, law, medicine, etc. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Department and people in their prospective professional areas. Students who intend to pursue a single subject or multiple subject teaching credential must consult with Professor Myron Simon (as well as with the Office of Teacher Educa\u00ad tion) to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. Graduate Program The Department's three principal areas of work on the un\u00ad dergraduate level-English and American Literature, Com\u00ad parative Literature, and the English major with writing emphasis-are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in English, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American literature as well; and the faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture may stress in their qualifying examinations and disserta\u00ad tions. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature programs unless they plan to con\u00ad tinue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, admits students to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair. A deliberate effort is made to maintain close adminis\u00ad trative and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be reached by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student or the candi\u00ad date for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English and Comparative Literature must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Advanced Literature in English Test; applicants must also submit sample papers and a statement about competence in foreign languages. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the academic year. The normal expectation, however, is enroll\u00ad ment in three courses each quarter, except for Teaching Assistants, who take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Students who are not teaching should be able to complete course work in two years. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can fre\u00ad quently be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English normally should be completed in five years or less; the Ph.D. in Com\u00ad parative Literature normally should be completed in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate stu\u00ad dents intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate English and Comparative Literature 129 departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, that teaching and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to participate in this program. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmental office. English Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (1) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demon\u00ad strated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (3) the submission of materials (including a statement about work accomplished and plans for future study, and a sample essay) to the Graduate Com\u00ad mittee, who will review and assess the student's progress, recommend whether further study toward the Ph.D. is advisable and, if so, give advice about areas for further study. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the comple\u00ad tion of a two-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two\u00ad thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in con\u00ad sultation with the student's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teach\u00ad ing seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book\u00ad length manuscript of poetry or short stories, or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program); proficiency in the reading of two acceptable for\u00ad eign languages, modern or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on designated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the stu\u00ad dent's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading competence in one of these languages must be estab\u00ad lished in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evi\u00ad dence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Com\u00ad petence in one of the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of transla\u00ad tion; the other language may be verified through examination. I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984130 English and Comparative Literature Upon completion of course work the student takes general examinations on literary theory and criticism; some particular literary form, genre, style, theme, or structure; a historical period; a group of authors; and a specific topic. The first four of these examinations are written; the fifth is oral. The stu\u00ad dent has the opportunity to present personal choices for the examination, but the choices must enable an individual to demonstrate breadth of knowledge as well as literary under\u00ad standing and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examination as is practical, the student presents an essay leading to dissertation for the approval of the doctoral committee. The dissertation itself must also be approved by the committee, which may or may not require an oral exami\u00ad nation on it. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. Comparative Literature There are at least four avenues by which the student may approach graduate work in Comparative Literature: 1. An undergraduate major in comparative literature equiv\u00ad alent to the one described above; 2. An English major, provided that a sufficient background in at least one foreign language is demonstrated (a beginning on a second foreign language is desirable); 3. A normal major in drama, with same proviso as I above; 4. A normal major in a foreign language, provided that a suf\u00ad ficient general background in world literature is demonstrated. Make-up work will be required before graduate studies can begin if one of these avenues has not been taken. At the graduate level, the study of Comparative Literature becomes more specialized, with the student engaged in a par\u00ad ticular area of research and concerned with such problems as the development of genres, interrelations between litera\u00ad tures, the theory and practice of translation, and other liter\u00ad ary questions transcending national boundaries. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a profes\u00ad sional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually required for all doctoral candidates, since these languages along with English are the accepted tools of international literary scholarship. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialty may require the mastery of other languages. The underlying assumption of language requirements is that, after the tool languages have been mastered, the professional scholar's own interests should determine the specific kinds and degrees of language skill to be acquired. At the graduate level, the nucleus of the foreign language re\u00ad quirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which, after a suitable theoretical preparation, the student plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary text. The translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly apparatus explaining and defending the technical decisions involved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Students entering the Master of Arts program should com\u00ad plete their course work in three quarters. This course work should include CL 220 (Problems in Translation) with a proj\u00ad ect in either French or German and appropriate graduate\u00ad level work in English, foreign languages, drama, comparative literature, and other areas as recommended by the advisor. Soon after beginning graduate work the student, with the advice and approval of the assigned advisor, will decide on a field of specialty, which will be emphasized in progressing toward the M.A. degree. (Normally this choice will be a pre\u00ad liminary step toward the selection of an area of specialty for the Ph.D.) Graduate study in Comparative Literature requires an excep\u00ad tional facility in foreign languages, and the student should not attempt a Master's degree without a thorough knowl\u00ad edge of one foreign language and literature and a considera\u00ad ble knowledge of a second language. Normally the greatest part of the student's work will involve the study of literary texts in the original languages. At the end of course work, normally about nine courses at the graduate level, the student will be examined on a reading list in world literature that the student's committee has approved. This list should be designed by the student in con\u00ad sultation with the committee and based on the general World Literature list for Comparative Literature. The student's own list should follow some organizing principle, such as an emphasis on the fields and languages of the student's special\u00ad ization. Nevertheless, every list should include works from all of the different groups represented on the general World Literature list. The M.A. examination is a three-hour written examination, which focuses on essay questions based on the student's approved reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's per\u00ad formance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program is designed to prepare the student for a professional career as a scholar and critic of literature. Details of the doctoral program in Comparative Literature may be obtained from the Director of the Program in Com\u00ad parative Literature. Normally the degree requires two years of course work (usually a minimum of three courses per quarter). Of these courses, the only required course is CL 220 (Problems in Translation), which is taken twice, with pro\u00ad jects in acceptable languages. The rest of the student's work will be in seminars or other graduate-level courses in Com\u00ad parative Literature, English, the various foreign language departments, or drama. In general an exceptional command of foreign languages is required, normally involving a professional competence in two or more foreign languages, either modern or classical. The doctoral student is encouraged to design and carry out a personal plan of study (the area of specialty) in a particular field of interest. The requirements for the doctorate also include an area of competence in literary theory and practical criticism; a student may also stress theory in preparation for the Qualifying Examination. Upon completion of the course work, the student will be examined in the following areas of knowledge: (I) mastery of a limited topic in literary theory or history of criticism, along with general knowledge of major critical texts in the history of literature; (2) an area of specialty as described above; and (3) major works and authors appropriate to the study of comparative literature. Following this examination, and upon recommendation of a candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Council, the student is formally admitted to candidacy. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984The study toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will culminate in the writing of a suitable dissertation, normally on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general literary and aesthetic problems not confined to any specific literatures may also be acceptable. Studies of the relation between literature and the other arts are also encouraged. Undergraduate Courses Satisfaction of the Subject A requirement is a prerequisite for all departmental courses except E 6, 7, 8 and CL 8. However, students scoring from 550 to 600 on the College Board Eng\u00ad lish Composition Achievement Test normally should be able to satisfy the Subject A requirement with the same courses they take to satisfy the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I).

It seeks to enrich the students' appreciation of their own civilizations and to create a deeper sense of international understanding. The program brings the students to participate in the crea\u00ad tive process of language, to think in French or Italian as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. Most classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the interdependence of the four basic skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Language Labora\u00ad tory is used to complement classroom activity. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departmental commit\u00ad tees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. Careers for the French Major The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in various sectors of the world of business and com\u00ad merce, where they can take advantage not only of their com\u00ad petency in communicating in French but also of their knowl\u00ad edge of French literature and civilization. They gain an inter\u00ad national perspective which provides them with a clearer pic\u00ad ture of their own cultural heritage. In practical terms, this perspective will allow them to operate efficiently in market\u00ad ing, publicity, and public relations, where sophistication has become essential. A number of students also follow careers in education, continue their studies in graduate school, or enter the diplomatic service. Undergraduate Program in French While preparing the student for graduate work and for the teaching profession, the French major is essentially a liberal arts program offering a broad, humanistic course of study. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contempor\u00ad ary literary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversation, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and phonetics) and writing enable the students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in French literature and linguistics and in French civilization and culture. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied in historical context. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical techniques. At the more advanced level, literature courses may emphasize a single author, movement, or genre within a historical period. The content of these courses changes yearly according to the interests of both faculty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodically to discuss literary problems which cannot be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings. I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984134 French and Italian Courses in civilization and culture explore aspects of French history, intellectual thought, and the arts. Courses are offered with a historical emphasis (for instance, the world of the Renaissance in France; the Age of Louis XIV; colonialism; anti-Semitism) and with a comparative orientation (for instance, poetry and painting; literature and society; women in literature; Paris and the history of art; literature and history). Courses in linguistics introduce students to aspects of the structure of the French language and to the application of linguistic techniques to problems of literary analysis. Students are placed in elementary and intermediate courses according to their years of previous study and their grades; no placement examination is given. One year of high school is equated with one quarter of work at UCI. A student may not go back more than one quarter and receive credit. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 124. Departmental Requirements French Major with Emphasis in Literature and Culture: French 11, 100A-B, 101A-B-C, and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least six of which must be in literature, culture, or civilization. French Major with Emphasis in Linguistics: French 11, 100A-B, 101A-B-C, two courses in French civilization, Linguistics SO, 110, 120, 130, and French 113, 131. Prospective elementary and secondary school teachers who choose this option should take as electives additional courses in French language, civilization, and/or literature. Work in French civili\u00ad zation is required by State credentialing authorities. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to ful\u00ad fill the literature and culture or the linguistics emphasis dur\u00ad ing the junior year. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with the departmental coordinator of advisors concerning career plans in the areas of teaching, industry, journalism, law, civil service, etc. Undergraduate Program in Italian Third-and fourth-year offerings provide an introduction to Italian literature and culture that serves as a basis for compo\u00ad sition, conversation, and phonetics. Tutorial and seminar courses are available for advanced stu\u00ad dents. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities, which combines Italian literature, culture, his\u00ad tory, art, and music. Graduate Program in French The Department stresses understanding rather than encyclo\u00ad pedic knowledge, experimentation with various critical approaches rather than the perpetuation of a tradition, crea\u00ad tivity rather than conformity. Internationally known scholars often participate in the graduate program as guest lecturers. Students choose their courses from three categories: (1) Crit\u00ad ical Theory: problems in French literature and criticism; (2) Comparative Methods; (3) Author, Genre, Period, Movement Master of Arts in French The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doctorate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral pro\u00ad gram. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses, with at least six in literature, one in linguistics, and one in writing and style. Particularly well-prepared students may receive special permission to take a minimum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. All entering graduate students are assigned a faculty advisor. Individual programs are arranged in consul\u00ad tation with the faculty advisors. During the spring quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course-by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign language in addition to French is required (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral comprehensive examination on material drawn from the class program and the Master of Arts reading list. The student writes essays demonstrating an understanding of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts as well as an ability to establish relationships among literary works of different periods, genres, or authors. The written examination also allows the student to present an original topic of research. The oral part of the examination allows elaboration on aspects of the written examination, but seeks primarily to test the ~tudents' broader knowledge. The Master's examination is given in mid-fall quarter and at the end of winter quarter. Students who are Teaching Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Doctor of Philosophy in French Upon successful completion of the Master's examinations and admission to the Ph.D. program, or admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Com\u00ad mittee is appointed to advise the candidate in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The formal Guidance Committee is composed of five members in fields closely related to the student's interest and projected area of specialization in which the dis\u00ad sertation will be prepared and one member who is not affil\u00ad iated with the School. One member of the committee will be expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two for\u00ad eign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A., including one graduate course in French linguistics, one graduate course in writing and style, and three graduate courses outside the Depart\u00ad ment in areas related to the field of specialization. Students entering with a B.A. degree are required to take at least three courses in each of these three course categories as they pro\u00ad gress to the Ph.D. degree; students entering with an M.A. degree must take at least two in each area. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in theory beyond the minimum number required. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candi\u00ad dates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsi\u00ad bility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is pos\u00ad sible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination -Written and Oral: Upon comple\u00ad tion of course work, the student takes a series of written open book examinations involving clearly defined problems of a critical or historical nature. The student may be given from one to three days to answer any part of the examination. The oral Qualifying Examination assesses the student's knowl\u00ad edge of French literature and understanding of a given liter\u00ad ary movement. The student will be examined on (a) five of the following six periods of French literature: Medieval; Six\u00ad Twentieth Century; or four of these periods plus the development of a single literary genre through all periods of French literature; (b) a given literary movement (e.g., Romanticism, Baroque, etc.) in a non-French literature. The written and oral parts of the examination are based both on material covered in the graduate seminars and on the Ph.D. reading list. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The disserta\u00ad tion must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recom\u00ad mended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed by the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the prepa\u00ad ration and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory.

Smith, Ph.D. Princeton University, Assistant Professor of German Wilfried M. Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Lecturer in German and Linguistics and Acting Chair (F) UC IRVINE - 1983-1984The Department of German sees its contribution in the con\u00ad text of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate Western culture. We can understand ourselves and our immediate culture more clearly through the study of allied and diverse languages and cultures. The study of German (which is closely related to English) and a comparative study of the historical and social development of German-speaking peoples provide the student with another aspect of our com\u00ad mon culture. The Department offers courses on the German language and on German literature. The study of German literature is pursued from various critical perspectives. Some courses emphasize its historical, social, and political signifi\u00ad cance and setting; in others literature is approached as an imaginative experience which transcends its immediate con\u00ad text. The history of German literature and criticism, the the\u00ad ory of literature and literary criticism, and the relations of German literature to other literatures are also studied in the Department's courses. Undergraduate Program The German major offers alternative emphases, one in litera\u00ad ture and another in linguistics. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses the student will develop an understanding of the nature of the language, based on linguistic principles, while learning the necessary skills. Use will be made of the Lan\u00ad guage Laboratory. At the end of the first year, students will have attained mastery of the basic structure of the language. At the intermediate and advanced levels the student's ability to read and write German will be gradually developed. A third-year course of two quarters will stress composition and provide an introduction to contemporary German. It will be followed by a course in phonetics which will aim to perfect the pronunciation as well as to introduce historical and dia\u00ad lectal variants. The introductory course in literature, also in the third year, will present a first view of some periods of German literary history, familiarize the student with German terminology used in the interpretation of literature, and use these concepts in practical interpretations. A certain number of courses in the series German 117, 118, 119, 120 will be designated as \"core courses\" which are especially recom\u00ad mended for majors. It is assumed that the student is familiar with basic concepts of literature in English. Students are given the opportunity to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year. The University's Education Abroad Program has study centers in, among other locations, Gottingen and Vienna. Students entering UCI with previous German training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will normally enroll in German 18, 1C, 2A, and 28 respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-or second\u00ad year German instruction. Credit is given for the Advanced Placement Test in German. Careers for the German Major German is excellent preparation for professional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sci\u00ad ences, business and management, and the computer sciences, and it is invaluable for advanced work in the humanities and the fine arts. An ability in German, when combined with other skills and specific training, can open up opportunities in German 137 communications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, government, science and technology, tourism, library ser\u00ad vices, and teaching. Recent graduates of the UCI German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign ser\u00ad vice, the airline industry, professional translating, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 124. Departmental Requirements German Major with Literature Emphasis: German 100A-8- C; German 101; eight courses drawn from German 102-199, the selection to be approved by the student's advisor; at least one course selected from the following: Linguistics 50; Com\u00ad parative Literature 50A-8-C; courses in German history and German philosophy (advisor's approval required). Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or intend to do graduate work in literature, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. German Major with Linguistic Emphasis: German 100A-8- C; German 101; five literature courses drawn from German 102-199, to be approved by the advisor; Linguistics 50, 110, 120; at least one of the following: Linguistics 130; Introduc\u00ad tion to Middle High German or History of the German Lan\u00ad guage (these courses are offered under German 220). The German major with linguistic emphasis is recommended especially for students who intend to do graduate work in lin\u00ad guistics or enter a linguistics-related profession. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical understanding of the nature of literature in its specific appli\u00ad cation to literature written in the German language. Courses also are offered elucidating the structure and history of the German language. The German Graduate Program is essentially a program lead\u00ad ing to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a terminal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate pro\u00ad gram in German with an M.A. from another institution, the Department will evaluate the student's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984138 German Master of Arts in German Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bachelor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Normally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered individually by the faculty. The min\u00ad imum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Depart\u00ad ment of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign language other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Whenever possible, a candidate is urged to complete this requirement before entering the program. Further require\u00ad ments follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should pre\u00ad pare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German literature, e.g., both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the can\u00ad didate's opinion, relate to the German works in the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criti\u00ad cism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially familiar. In its final form (e.g., including works read during the year both in and out of class) the list will be sub\u00ad mitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the student's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodological progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the candidate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the fol\u00ad lowing items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The discussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Course in University Teaching (399) One Year of Residence Ph.D. in German The Department requires a minimum of 22 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individually as to remaining course requirements. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, etc., suitable for the individual student's program of study. The course Introduction to Middle High German and one course in medieval German literature are required. The student also will participate in each of the German Department's collo\u00ad quia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current during the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candi\u00ad dates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervi\u00ad sion of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 22 re\u00ad quired courses for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the examination. In order to fulfill the written examination re\u00ad quirement the student will choose either (I) to present a lec\u00ad ture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examination (one part on a signifi\u00ad cant author, one on a major genre, and one on a historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed-book or take-home, by agree\u00ad ment with the candidate's examination committee. The exam\u00ad ination essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive examination is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the written examination. The stu\u00ad dent will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate will demonstrate reading competence in two languages or extensive compe\u00ad tence in one language other than German or English. Choice of this language depends on the student's area of specializa\u00ad tion. French and Latin are recommended. For the various ways in which these requirements may be fulfilled, the stu\u00ad dent should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the student should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the disserta\u00ad tion. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dis\u00ad sertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Com\u00ad mittee members on the title page of the dissertation.

The Department offers a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disciplinary skills: weighing evidence, expository writing, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. In addition to offering a number of lower-division history courses open to nonmajors, the Department requires all His\u00ad tory majors to participate in an introductory core course, His\u00ad tory 29A-B-C. This is a comparative course that acquaints students with the modern world by examining some of the basic characteristics of modernity and by focusing on the his\u00ad toric process of modernization in different societies over time. I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984140 History From this introductory course the student moves on to a ser\u00ad ies of upper-division courses, the contents of which range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., British History), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History), to historical analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors (e.g., Women and the Family in the United States). Students are also pro\u00ad vided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of colloquia in the following areas: social history, political history, international history, intellectual history, social thought, and comparative history. The colloquia are conducted as discussion groups and involve close reading and analysis of secondary texts. The senior seminar is a two\u00ad quarter research seminar in primary materials that cul\u00ad minates in the writing of a research paper. Faculty members in the Department of History work closely with their students. All upper-division History majors are assigned a faculty advisor, whom they are encouraged to consult at least once each quarter. Careers for the History Major The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to understand themselves and their world. Many students who complete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to graduate school in a variety of fields, includ\u00ad ing history, law, business, international relations, and teacher education. The study of history is valuable preparation for many other careers as well. The strong academic and profes\u00ad sional orientation acquired by History majors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, management, public relations, publish\u00ad ing, and government service. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 124. Departmental Requirements Fourteen courses are required, including History 29A-B-C (for which transfer students may substitute such year-long surveys as European, American, Asian, or Latin American history), six upper-division Historical Studies courses, three colloquia, and a senior seminar (two-course sequence) or two additional colloquia. Residence Requirement: Three historical studies and a senior seminar (or two colloquia) must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program The graduate program leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in History is designed to provide students with both basic historical skills and a rigorous grounding in historical theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in histor\u00ad ical method reflects the Department's conviction that scho\u00ad lars should be encouraged to deal with significant questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodo\u00ad logically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelation\u00ad ship of history and theory. Candidates for any advanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching experience as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a Teaching Assistant or Associate. Basic to the Department's curriculum is a year-long course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have utilized theoretical concepts and models. The History and Theory course also examines the phenomenon of modernization-the general world trans\u00ad formation of the past four hundred years-and seeks to understand the social institutions through which this process has occurred. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity in the modern world, to the groups which dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most satisfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self\u00ad consciousness and methodological facility have been system\u00ad atically and carefully developed. A three-quarter research seminar is offered every year and is required of all graduate students (including those entering with an M.A. degree). This course offers guidance in the selection of significant research topics, the formulation of coherent statements of historical problems, the carrying out of projects of original research, and the writing of research papers. The colloquium, a reading course that examines the chief his\u00b7\u00ad torical works in a \"time-place\" field, enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and devel\u00ad ops critical reading skills. Colloquia are offered yearly in American history and Modern European history, and biannu\u00ad ally in Early Modern European history, Latin American his\u00ad tory, and Ancient history. A student may prepare a disserta\u00ad tion in any of these fields. In addition, independent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop four fields of competence in preparation for a com\u00ad prehensive examination. These fields are: history and theory; first \"time-place\" field (field in which the dissertation is writ\u00ad ten); second \"time-place\" field; \"focus\" field (such as social, political, intellectual, or international history). The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Stu\u00ad dents have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages the entire historical commu\u00ad nity at Irvine in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. Master of Arts in History Requirements for Admission. Although it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also welcomes students who have previously specialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation, aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and examples of written work in history from their undergraduate classes. Students living in Southern California must arrange to come to UCI for an interview with the Department Chair or the Coordinator of Graduate Advising. Students are accepted for admission for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May I. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theo\u00ad retical and historical dimensions of the field in general, and of European, American, or Latin American history in particu\u00ad lar. Each candidate for the M.A. will choose a graduate ad\u00ad visor who will supervise the student's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in History and Theory (History iOOA-8-C), three in \"time-place\" colloquia (taken in sequence, as a unit), and three in a research seminar. Stu\u00ad dents intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirements. Normally a reading knowledge of one foreign language is required for the M.A. degree. Stu\u00ad dents in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substitute a sequence of courses in communications science, statistics, or comparable studies for the M.A. foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement. Language proficiency can be demon\u00ad strated either by achieving a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a departmental examination. Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive examination covering the student's major field (e.g., American, Early Modern Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three-quarter \"time-place\" colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. Doctor of Philosophy in History Requirements for Admission. Continuing students must have satisfactorily passed a departmental evaluation in order to be admitted to the doctoral program. This includes stu\u00ad dents entering with an M.A. from elsewhere who will be evaluated at the end of the first year. History 141 New students must undergo a more formal admissions procedure, submitting transcripts, letters (three), papers, and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. These documents must be supplemented by an interview whenever possible. The potential doctoral student is advised to begin graduate work on this campus, since the doctoral student who has taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in all of the same courses required of all incoming students. Greater experience will work to advantage later, in the second and third years, in speeding the student to examinations. Incoming students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May 1. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral stu\u00ad dents to prepare themselves in four different areas: 1. History and Theory. 2. The first \"time-place\" field (such as Modern Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the student's disser-tation. 3. The second \"time-place\" field (such as American History), which is designed as a second teaching field. 4. A \"focus\" field (such as social history, etc.), which is designed to enhance the student's capability for dealing with the problems and phenomena of the field, to make compari\u00ad sons, and to introduce the student to the theory and method of relevant related disciplines (e.g., sociology). The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquia series in both time-place fields, and a research seminar sequence. The normal academic load is three courses per quarter. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the same general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examinations. I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984142 History Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of one foreign language relevant to the field of graduate study, no later than the end of the second year in the program. Normally, completion of the M.A. foreign language requirement will fulfill this requirement. Proficiency can be established by a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a department test. Students in American history who have opted for a language substitute in completing the UCI Master's degree will be allowed to submit this work in fulfillment of the alternate skill requirements discussed below, and will not be subject to the time limit in achieving a foreign language competence. Additional language requirements depend on the subject the student selects for the first \"time-place\" field and must be met before the student takes the candidacy qualifying exami\u00ad nations. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in Amer\u00ad ican history may either demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language (by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test designed by the advisor), or complete, as a doctoral student, a sequence of courses in an alternate skill (e.g., communications science, statistics, computer work, content analysis, linguistics) that will be use\u00ad ful in mastering the chosen historical fields. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in a non\u00ad American subject must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second foreign language. This may be done either by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test arranged by the advisor. Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation. After completing the appropriate courses and other preparatory work (nor\u00ad mally seven to nine quarters after entering the graduate pro\u00ad gram at UCI), the student will take written examinations in the History and Theory and two \"time-place\" fields, followed by the oral Qualifying Examination in the \"focus\" field, first \"time-place\" field, and dissertation topic. Upon successful completion of these examinations, the student will be advanced to candidacy and will begin intensive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort are expected to require from one to two years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation will be held, focusing on the adequacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less.

As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Linguistics, and other majors in the School. The major in Humanities accommodates students who want to organize their undergraduate education around a humanistic perspec\u00ad tive on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; The Problem of Community; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation). The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consul\u00ad tation with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the stu\u00ad dent's own preference. At the end of the senior year the stu\u00ad dent will prepare, under the advisor's supervision, a long paper in the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in the Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. (See p. 42 and p. 115.) Inquiries by third-quarter sophomores should be addressed to the academic counselors in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Emphasis in Film Studies Participating Faculty Franco Tonelli, Ph.D. Louisiana State University, Director (film the\u00ad ory, French and Italian cinema) David Carroll, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University (film history and criticism, French cinema, film and society) Eugenio Donato, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University (film theory, Italian cinema) Oakley Hall, M.F.A. University of Iowa (fiction writing, film adaptation) Renee Riese Hubert, Ph.D. Columbia University (Surrealist film/ fantastic film, early comedy) Alejandro Morales, Ph.D. Rutgers University (Latin American film) Eric Rentschler, Ph.D. University of Washington (German film, his- tory and theory) A student may major in Humanities with an emphasis in Film Studies. The major centers on an interdisciplinary study of film history and criticism. The program is designed to study filmic concepts through a core of courses which will concen\u00ad trate on film theory, history of film, formal structures, ideol\u00ad ogy, and relationship to the other art forms. While the Emphasis in Film Studies emphasizes history and theory of film, through courses such as Humanities 50A-B\u00ad C, 197, and 198 it tries to expose the student to practical and/or technical aspects of the study of cinema as well. In these latter courses students acquire practical experience in script writing, directing, camera, sound, editing, and applied aesthetic. The Theatrical Film Symposium (Humanities SOC) brings in a visiting writer, producer, director, performer, or the like to screen their latest work and discuss it with the students. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984The School charges a laboratory fee of $12 per quarter to all students taking film studies courses. Students majoring in Humanities with an emphasis in Film Studies may spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through a program sponsored by the University's Education Abroad Program (EAP). Information is available in the Film Studies Office and from the EAP Office. Career Opportunities Besides providing students with a solid grounding in human\u00ad istic studies to allow them to pursue a number of educational or business opportunities, normally offered by a liberal arts major, an emphasis in Film Studies prepares students: (a) to seek a career at the production or commercial end of the rapidly growing entertainment industry; (b) to go to graduate school in film studies; (c) to continue literary studies con\u00ad nected with film.

UC IRVINE - 1983-1984146 Humanities Special Prograr Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines repre\u00ad sented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate cur\u00ad riculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of the Concentration that participat\u00ad ing students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the contributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building. Concentration in Women's Studies The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by studying systematically women in culture and society. The student will follow an interdisci\u00ad plinary course of study designed in consultation with a faculty advisor from the Women's Studies Committee. Two options of study are offered: (I) Humanities SOA-B-C, four upper-division women's studies courses (two in Humanities and two in Social Ecology or Social Sciences, which could include Social Sciences 183), and a senior-year paper or (2) Social Sciences 183A-B, four upper-division women's studies courses (two in Humanities and two in Social Ecology or Social Sciences, excluding Social Science 183), and a senior\u00ad year paper or seminar. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Business Administration (M.B.A.), in Public Adminis\u00ad tration (M.P.A.), or Business and Public Administration (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of either the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's de\u00ad gree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor.

However, some Ph.D. students in regular programs in the School may elect an interdisciplinary modifi\u00ad cation of their degree with the permission of the departments or programs concerned. Such students will do about 60 per\u00ad cent of their graduate work in a major field and about 40 per\u00ad cent in one or more minor fields. At least one of the student's courses will be in the Humanities series 200-230. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should contact the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies or the Graduate Ad\u00ad visor in their major department. Graduate Study in Critical Theory In all doctoral programs offered within the School of Human\u00ad ities it is possible to incorporate study in critical theory. Criti\u00ad cal theory at Irvine is understood in the broad sense as the study of the shared assumptions, problems, and commit\u00ad ments of the various discourses in the humanities. We take critical theory not as an adjunct to the study of one of the traditional humanistic disciplines but as a necessary context for the study of any humanistic discipline. In recognition of the interdisciplinary nature and goals of crit\u00ad ical theory, a School-wide Committee on Critical Theory, appointed by the Dean, coordinates the activities of theorists from literary, historical, philosophical, and linguistic fields of study. The Committee includes: UC IRVINE - 1983-1984148 Linguistics Murray Krieger, University Professor of English, Depart\u00ad ment of English and Comparative Literature; Director, Focused Research Program in Critical Theory David Carroll, Associate Professor, Department of French and Italian Peter Colaclides, Professor, Department of Classics Lucia G.

Additional theory courses are offered by the several departments. The Focused Research Program (FRP) in Critical Theory is an important resource for graduate students in Humanities doc\u00ad toral programs. To enable Humanities graduate students to be knowledgeable of the most recent developments in the field, the FRP augments its teaching and research resources by inviting visiting theorists for varying periods of residence. The campus library has strong holdings in critical theory, and students also have access to the resources of the recently acquired Rene Wellek Collection of the History of Criticism. The annual Wellek Library Lecture Series provides for an extended dialogue with major contemporary theorists. For further information, please contact the Committee on Critical Theory, School of Humanities, University of Califor\u00ad nia, Irvine; Irvine, CA 92717, (714) 856-6722. Graduate Courses Graduate courses in Humanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. These courses are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities, with the exception that students in philosophy may not count Humanities 230 as part of their degree program. Humanities 200, 210, 212, 220, and 230 introduce study in five disciplinary areas, either to students planning a degree in history or one of the literature departments or to those seek\u00ad ing familiarity with disciplines other than their own.

Terrell, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics Owen Thomas, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Profes\u00ad sor of Linguistics, English, and Educnlion Wilfried M. Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Lecturer in German and Linguistics (See also the School of Social Sciences for additional faculty in Linguistics.) Linguistics is concerned with descriptions of human lan\u00ad guages, with theories that seek to explain the nature of lan\u00ad guage, and with the various uses of language. Additionally, linguistics has potential relationships with other disciplines concerned with language. The undergraduate major in Linguistics is offered by the School of Humanities and by the School of Social Sciences. The UCI campus programs are administered by an inter\u00ad School Linguistics Committee. Students are able to select a Linguistics major in either School according to their interests. There are three ways to major in Linguistics as an under\u00ad graduate. They are designated as Tracks I, II, and III. Track I, General Linguistics, will appeal to students who wish to receive a broad introduction to the major subfields of Lin\u00ad guistics. Track I may be taken either through the School of Humanities or through the School of Social Sciences. Track II, Theoretical and Formal Linguistics, will appeal to stu\u00ad dents interested in areas of the cognitive sciences such as psychology and artificial intelligence. Track II is available through the School of Social Sciences. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Track III, Applied Linguistics (Language Teaching and English as a Second Language), will appeal to students interested in language teaching including but not limited to the teaching of English as a second language. Track III is available through the School of Humanities. Students may also major in Classics, French, German, and Spanish with an emphasis in Linguistics. Students are encouraged to consider a double major in Lin\u00ad guistics and either English or a foreign language. This is especially recommended for students following Track III. Students who double major may not satisfy requirements in one major with courses which count for the other major, unless the same course is required for both majors. Careers in Linguistics A major in Linguistics prepares students for a wide variety of careers-in teaching, law, publishing, and public service, among others. Linguistics at UCI is also excellent preparation for graduate work in a number of areas. General Linguistics prepares students for advanced work in the field; Theoretical and Formal Linguistics students may continue work in formal linguistics, psychology, or other areas in the cognitive sci\u00ad ences; and those who concentrate in Applied Linguistics may pursue careers in the teaching of English as a second lan\u00ad guage or in other language teaching.

Each discipline inevitably poses prob\u00ad lems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total frame\u00ad work of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as morality and religion, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understand\u00ad ing and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. Careers for the Philosophy Major The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excel\u00ad lent preparation for a variety of careers. Many undergradu\u00ad ates trained in philosophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or law. The analytical skills developed in philosophy courses seem to be especially useful in legal edu\u00ad cation; indeed, many UCI philosophy graduates have estab\u00ad lished fine records at top law schools. Former philosophy stu\u00ad dents also have used their skills to advantage in careers in government, business, teaching, law enforcement, and com\u00ad puter programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the graduate level, either in philosophy or a related discipline. Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, therefore, classes are severely limited in size in order to per\u00ad mit sustained dialogues between student and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all stu\u00ad dents. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and special disciplines. Among these are courses in the philosophy of science and of art. The staff should be con\u00ad sulted for advice about courses best suited to the specialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some professional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984152 Philosophy Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 124. Departmental Requirements Philosophy 30, Philosophy 10 and 12 and either 11 or 13; two of the following: Philosophy 140A-B; 14SA-B; 170A-B; two additional quarter courses from Philosophy 101-199. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program Students are encouraged to seek the counsel of any and all members of the Department whose recommendations the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual relationship between graduate students and professors in order to provide the students with optimum conditions for philosophical development and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Partici\u00ad pation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a committee of faculty members whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with the committee each quar\u00ad ter about progress and any administrative or academic diffi\u00ad culties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of March. When the student has satisfied residency, language, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Committee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the dissertation itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. Master of Arts in Philosophy There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and Portfolio require\u00ad ments for the Ph.D. (see below). Please refer to the Graduate Studies and Research section for information on the min\u00ad imum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not auto\u00ad matic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. Doctor of Philosophy in Philosophy There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., thus allowing course work to be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Ph.D. program is designed to take four years for the normally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within three years. A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The following five items are requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Tools of research, to be satisfied by demonstrating profi\u00ad ciency in a single appropriate foreign language* or by passing with a grade of B or better five to six courses at the graduate level in a discipline or disciplines outside of the Philosophy Department. Approval for the latter alternative will be granted by the Department only if, in its judgment, the courses form an integrated unit in light of the student's research interest. Logic, to be satisfied by (I) passing Philosophy 130A-B with a grade of B or better, or passing an examination prepared by the Department on equivalent material, and (2) passing with a grade of B or better one course in a mathematically rigor\u00ad ous subject that requires the student to carry out detailed mathematical proofs of significant theorems. Examples of such subjects are: Proof Theory, Model Theory, Probability Theory, Game Theory, Mathematical Linguistics, Topology, Classical Mechanics, Relativity Theory, etc. Philosophy 132 will satisfy this portion of the requirement. Other courses will satisfy it only with the approval of the Department. Portfolio of papers representing the student's best work in philosophy. The papers may be, or may be based upon, essays written for course work. The topics of the papers will cover four fields in philosophy as well as at least three of the fol\u00ad lowing historical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern, Kant and Nineteenth Century, and Twentieth Century. Examples of fields in philosophy are metaphysics, epistemol\u00ad ogy, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of religion, phi\u00ad losophy of science, aesthetics, and so on. Papers will be eval\u00ad uated by the faculty for the purpose of determining whether or not the student is ready to seek admission to candidacy. Advancement to candidacy and the writing of a thesis. Upon successful completion of the above requirements, the student will apply for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree by filling out the appropriate forms and returning them to the Philosophy Department Office. A Candidacy Committee including one or two members from an academic area outside of Philosophy is then appointed by the Graduate Council. This Committee administers an oral Qualifying Examination to determine whether the student is qualified to begin work designed to lead to the completion of a thesis. Upon passing this oral examination, the student becomes a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. The Doctoral Committee appointed by the Graduate Council supervises the student's further course work and research; as well as the actual writ\u00ad ing of the doctoral thesis. The defense of the thesis. At a suitable point during the development of the thesis, the Doctoral Committee adminis\u00ad ters an oral examination, the focus of which is the content of the thesis itself. If at all possible, this examination will be given while the student is still in residence. *The foreign language examinations are administered by the Department of Philosophy. They are two hours in length and con\u00ad sist of translating, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from two authors. Students wishing information as to courses to prepare them for these examinations and dates when these examinations will be given should consult the Philosophy Department Office, 500 Humanities Office Building, (714) 856-6526.

Russian is a language of the Indo-European family and is thus related to English, French, and German. Russian is an infinitely rich language, as is Eng\u00ad lish, and adapts itself well to a variety of styles and genres from lyric love poetry to the seeming harshness and brash\u00ad ness of the futurist poets. For the first two years, the Program in Russian emphasizes a combination of speaking, writing, and reading skills. At the end of the senior year, the student can expect to have at\u00ad tained a rather high level of proficiency in all language skills-reading, writing, speaking, and understanding. By then students will have read a number of selected literary texts-including a fair portion of the significant master\u00ad works-in the original. They will also have familiarized themselves with some of the historical background of the language and with its relation to other Slavic and European languages. And they will have achieved a reasonable degree of familiarity with the major cultural and social trends in Russian history. In addition to the regular Russian major with emphasis on language and literature, the Program in Russian offers a modified major with emphasis on linguistics. This major was designed for those students who have no plans to pursue advanced study in Russian literature, while they wish to focus on the study of the structure of Russian viewed within the framework of Slavic and general linguistics. The Program in Russian also offers a major with an emphasis in Russian civilization, which is geared to the interests of students who do not intend to specialize in Russian language and literature. This emphasis is based upon a multidiscipli\u00ad nary approach (through language, the arts, literature, history, study of institutions) to the rich variety of a culture that both before the Revolution and during the Soviet period has made an important contribution to mankind's heritage and en\u00ad deavors. Various specializations and challenging new career possibilities in today's world are available to students electing this option. Students planning to major in Russian should obtain a copy of the brochure \"Russian Language, Literature, and Civiliza\u00ad tion at UCI\" from the Office of the Program in Russian. Stu\u00ad dents entering UCI with previous training in Russian will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Russian will enroll in Russian 1B (or lOB), 1C (or 10C), 2A (or 11A), and 2B (or 11B), respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the approval of the Program Director. Students with high school training in Rus\u00ad sian should consult with the Russian staff before enrolling in Russian courses. The Self-Paced Courses: IOA-B-C/llA-8-C During the regular academic year, the Program in Russian offers students a self-paced option in the first and second years of language study. The Self-Paced Courses are designed to accommodate students who cannot attend regular class meetings, or who wish to progress toward language compe\u00ad tence at their own pace (please see lOA-B-C and 11A-B-C). Students interested in enrolling in the Self-Paced Courses should contact H. Wei!, Coordinator. UCI Summer Russian Institute and Practicum In planning their programs of study, students should note that certain courses bearing the designation Summer are also offered within the three-week UCI Russian Institute and Practicum (Russian 1A-B-C, 199, 220, 290, and The UCI Russian Language Institute is a three-week, total-immersion program in Russian lan\u00ad guage and culture for students of all levels, conducted entirely in Russian and encompassing all of the student's daily activities. The Practicum adjunct of the Institute affords prospective and practicing language teachers an opportunity for intensive language review and participation in established and experimental teaching methods. For information and reg\u00ad istration forms contact H. Wei!, the Director of the UCI Rus\u00ad sian Institute and Practicum, Program in Russian, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 124. Departmental Requirements Russian Major with Emphasis on Literature: Russian 100A\u00ad B-C; Russian 100A\u00ad B-C; 101A-B-C; two courses 180; Linguistics 50; 110; 120; 30; 40; 100A-B-C; 150A-B-C; two courses three courses from History 123A-B-C, Social Sciences 122A; choice of one course from 110A-B-C, 160, 170, 180. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The Program in Russian believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discus\u00ad sion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Russian with an emphasis on literature or on linguistics are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty as early as possible, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. After indicating an intention to major in Russian, the student is assigned to an academic advisor who will help in the task of selecting courses toward the completion of one of the three options open to students majoring in Russian studies at UCI. Special attention is paid to the unique aspects of the Russian field. In particular, students' attention is alerted to the com\u00ad bined academic and career implications and potentialities of these major options. Career Opportunities The major in Russian may lead to a career with the federal government, in private enterprise, or in education. The U.S. Departments of State, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Information Office, and the Library of Congress all hire people who can speak and write Russian. The United States Information Agency's Voice of America offers oppor\u00ad tunities in research, scriptwriting, editing, translating, and announcing. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Because of the importance of Russia in world politics and economics, private businesses and corporations dealing in the international marketplace increasingly employ persons skilled in Russian language and knowledgeable about Russian soci\u00ad ety and political institutions. Individuals with degrees in Rus\u00ad sian may find employment in private enterprise as interpre\u00ad ters and translators in the following areas: library science, communications media, science, and technology. Students who major in Russian may either go on to graduate programs or enter a career in education. Many students have entered teaching at the secondary level, while others, after graduate work in education, seek positions at colleges and universities. Since Russian is second only to English as a world language of science, the study of Russian provides access to a large body of the world's scholarly, scientific, and technical litera\u00ad ture. While the study of Russian language, literature, and civ\u00ad ilization provides training that may lead to careers similar to those described above, the major program is viewed primarily as a valuable component of a liberal education and an instru\u00ad ment for the investigation and appreciation of the modern world.

Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study and a placement test. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, students attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and ability to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary plane. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year course of two quarters stresses composition as opposed to translation. Further, a course in phonetics perfects pronunci\u00ad ation and presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works by genre rather than the study of many short selec\u00ad tions of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civilization combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although no major in Portuguese is offered, advanced litera\u00ad ture courses are available. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year. Elected representatives of the undergraduate majors, the graduate students, and the Teaching Assistants participate with full voting rights in Department meetings. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 124. Departmental Requirements Spanish IOA-B, 11, 101A-B-C; 110A, B, or C. In addition, the student will choose one or more of the following emphases: Literature and Culture: Seven upper-division courses in literature with a minimum of one in Spanish-American litera\u00ad ture. Two courses in Hispanic culture and civilization may be substituted if desired. Linguistics: Linguistics SO, 110, 120; Spanish 113 and any three upper-division or graduate Spanish linguistics courses such as 100A-B-C, 186, 200, 201, 204, 20S. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language: Spanish 100A (Multiple Subject) or 100B (Single Subject), Spanish 100C (ESL methods); one course in Chicano literature, one course in Chicano culture, Spanish 113, and two upper\u00ad division courses in literature at least one of which must be Latin American literature. (Education 140A-B-C is the same as Spanish 100A-B-C.) For students who plan to teach Spanish, the following courses are strongly recommended: Linguistics SO, Linguis\u00ad tics 140 (Second Language Acquisition), Spanish 113 (Spanish Linguistics). Also, Spanish 200 and Spanish 204 should be taken as seniors or as members of the credential program. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Career Opportunities Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in the foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and professional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, interna\u00ad tional relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by the Graduate School of Management, in whkh students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and a Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Management in five years rather than the usual six. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language are very use\u00ad ful preliminary emphases for many of the fields described above. These areas are closely related to the teacher prepara\u00ad tion program offered by the UCI Office of Teacher Education for students interested in the Bilingual/Cross Cultural Emphasis credential. .. , Graduate Program in Spanish and Portuguese Master of Arts in Spanish The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of the UCI undergraduate major. The student takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be at the graduate level. Two of the 11 courses must be in lirrguistics. Spanish 239A, Methods of Literary Criticism, is required of all literature majors. A maximum of two courses may be transferred from another university, but a maximum of five may be accepted from another University of California campus. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C) in a foreign language other than the major language is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken by the students and will also test the students' ability to express themselves correctly in Spanish. No thesis is required. The student may choose an emphasis in literature or linguistics. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than three years of graduate study. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate pro\u00ad gram. The comprehensive examination for the M.A. may be accepted as the written portion of the qualifying examination for the Ph.D. M.A. T. in Spanish This program is specifically directed at meeting the needs of working credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to provide a group of modern, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. It is structured so that working teachers can take courses in late afternoons and evenings. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign language other than Spanish. The program con\u00ad sists of 10 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as follows: three courses in Hispan.ic literature; three courses in Hispanic civilization and literature; three courses in Hispanic linguistics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. M.A. T. students are counseled by a faculty member in the Department. Spanish and Portuguese 159 Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The bilingual/cross-cultural emphasis is a specialization in addition to the regular teaching credential for high school (Single Subject) or elementary school (Multiple Subject). Undergraduates may plan from the beginning to aim for this emphasis by choosing the track in Bilingualism and English as a Second Language. See page 260. Ph.D. in Spanish The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree with a major in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio-historical studies. A number of courses outside of the Department are required. The Department thereby hopes to aid in the formation of Ph.D. candidates who are not narrow specialists but rather scholars acquainted with the various fields that relate to their discipline. The Department is con\u00b7 cerned also with the practical aspects of helping its graduates become good teachers. The secondary field can be Spanish literature, Spanish\u00ad American literature, Chicano studies, Spanish linguistics, literary theory, comparative literature, or a non-Hispanic literature. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and other languages relevant to the student's area of specialization is required. The choice of language requires Department approval. Course Requirements A minimum of 23 courses is required for the Ph.D. as follows: A. Two graduate courses in linguistics, diachronic and syn\u00ad chronic (the students who select Linguistics as a secondary field will substitute.two courses in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature); Spanish 239A-B; a course on the socio-historical context of the period of the stu\u00ad dent's specialization; a course in Brazilian or Portuguese literature (preferably related to the student's specializa\u00ad tion); two courses outside of the Department in non-Iberic literatures; two courses in Spanish or Spanish-American literature, whichever is not the major. Ph.D. candidates should take one course in each genre within their area. B. Additional courses for the major and the secondary field: I. Ten courses in the major, including one course on the\u00ad ory of the genre. Those students who major in twentieth-century Spanish-American literature are required to take Spanish 238A-B: Spanish-American Literature in the Colonial Period and in the Nineteenth Century. 2. Three courses in the secondary field. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984160 Spanish and Portuguese Candidates who have the M.A. degree from another univer\u00ad sity will be interviewed by two professors representing peninsular and Spanish-American literature, in order to eval\u00ad uate their past studies in terms of our doctoral program; it is recommended that the student's graduate advisor direct the doctoral dissertation and that the choice of dissertation and director be made as early as possible. Each incoming graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will supervise the student's program and with whom the student should meet at least once each quarter. All graduate students will be formally evaluated at the end of each year by the faculty with whom they have studied. Students pursuing a full-time pro\u00ad gram of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, all Ph.D. candidates without previous teaching experience are required to teach under supervision and at UCI one course in each of three quarters. All Ph.D. students will student-teach in an upper-division course related to the major. This will count as one of the required courses in the major. Comprehensive Examination The student is admitted to candidacy by passing, by a major\u00ad ity vote, an oral examination administered by a Candidacy Committee appointed by the Graduate Council. The Candi\u00ad dacy Committee is composed of five members, of whom four will be from the Department. The oral examination will be preceded by a written examination as follows: A. The student, in consultation with the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee, may choose one of the following options: 1. A comprehensive examination including a dissertation project. The student will then take parts 1, 2, and 3 of the examination described below, and will submit a dis\u00ad sertation project. 2. A comprehensive examination including the minor instead of the dissertation project, part 4 of the exami\u00ad nation described below. B. The written comprehensive examination will consist of three parts: 1. A genre in all periods. The student will demonstrate knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criticism. 2. A historical literary period, including all of the genres and the socio-historical context. 3. Textual analysis. A representative text in the student's genre of specialization will be given to the student at the time of the examination. If the genre is poetry, the text may be a complete poem or a section from,.a larger poem. In the case of the short story, novel, theatre, or essay, a relatively brief organic section will constitute the text. The student's analysis should be intrinsic; it should also demonstrate the relationship of the text to the total work as well as to the author's total produc\u00ad tion and the author's position in the literary history of the country or the continent. 4. Dissertation project. During the year preceding the comprehensive exams, the student will write a disserta\u00ad tion project of approximately 40 typewritten (double\u00ad spaced) pages which will be turned in one month before the comprehensive exams. The topic as well as the dis\u00ad sertation advisor will be chosen by the student. The essay should: a. Define clearly the topic of the dissertation and jus\u00ad tify it by discussing its significance. b. Discuss previous studies on this topic and prove the originality of the new study. c. Describe and justify the critical method to be followed. d. Include a bibliography of special, general, and theo- retical works. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate and nor\u00ad mally, but not necessarily, will fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. Three faculty members appointed by the Graduate Council will constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will not be given after the dissertation is completed, but rather at an appropriate point during its development. Such final examination normally will be given while the graduate student is in residence at UCI. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Com\u00ad mittee members on the title page.

Doedens Acting Dean The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chem\u00ad istry, Mathematics, and Physics. The faculty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of students ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scientists to those seeking a comprehensive under\u00ad standing that will prepare them for creative research in phys\u00ad ical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdepen\u00ad dent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the departmental structure of the School of Phys\u00ad ical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disci\u00ad plines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concom\u00ad itant increase in understanding of the physical universe pro\u00ad vides the major challenge to the student of the physical sci\u00ad ences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contem\u00ad porary civilization, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. In recognition of the contribution students can make to the academic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and departmental committees is given to undergradu\u00ad ate and graduate students. Degrees Honors Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candidates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approxi\u00ad mately 1 percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research and cumulative grade point average. The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have dis\u00ad tinguished themselves by their work in their major subject. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to non\u00ad majors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced pro\u00ad fessional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Introductory courses in chem\u00ad istry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for students in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addi\u00ad tion, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. Planning a Program of Study Every undergraduate student who has chosen to major in Physical Sciences is assigned a faculty advisor. The name of this advisor is communicated to the student prior to enroll\u00ad ment or may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean or of the appropriate Department Chair. Students are free to change academic advisors at any time. Each depart\u00ad ment also has a Chief Academic Advisor who is responsible for interpreting degree requirements and dealing with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff is also employed in the Associate Dean's Office and is avail\u00ad able to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In con\u00ad sultation with the advisor the student should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, the student may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-division work in each major. A student interested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry will usually include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a work\u00ad ing knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their University studies. This can be done by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science 1A or 1B, or Physics 1. Career Opportunities The majority of UCI Physical Sciences graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engineering, or postsecon\u00ad dary education. Some students enter professional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business adminis\u00ad tration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employ~ ment in private business or industry. In addition to technical areas directly related to their major fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, mar\u00ad keting, or sales. 3-2 Program Physical Sciences majors who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Physical Sciences 163 UC IRVINE - 1983-1984164 Chemistry Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements In addition to the courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI breadth requirement, students with a major in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional approved three-course group chosen from one of the follow\u00ad ing breadth categories: Category III (Social and Behavioral Sciences); Category IV (Humanistic Inquiry); or the Language and Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that any three consecutive foreign language courses are acceptable. Graduate Programs A program of course work and research leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is offered in each of the three departments of the School. The individual programs are described in the following announcements of each department. Department of Chemistry David A.

Williams, Ph.D. Princeton University, Assistant Professor of Chemistry (organometallic chemistry) Max Wolfsberg, Ph.D. Washington University, Professor of Chemistry (theoretical chemistry) Undergraduate Program The major in Chemistry is elected by students planning careers in the chemical sciences and frequently also by those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary education, business, and law. The curriculum of the Department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry 1A-B-C (or the two\u00ad quarter course Chemistry 61A-8) is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject mat\u00ad ter of this course serves also as a thorough introduction to the varied aspects of modern chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond this introductory level. Chemistry 51A-8-C is a one-year sequence in organic chemistry which is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain more advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of particular inter\u00ad est to the latter groups, among others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department emphasizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research under the direction of a faculty member. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Rus\u00ad sian, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and many graduate schools require the demonstration of such competence as a prerequi\u00ad site for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are encour\u00ad aged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to consult with their ad\u00ad visors and with the Office of Teacher Education early in their undergraduate careers. Chemistry majors who plan subse\u00ad quent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admission require\u00ad ments directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with their academic advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements: See page 164. Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: Mathematics 2A-8-C Physics 5A-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC, Chemistry 131A-8-C or 130A- 8-C, Chemistry 151. Electives: Four courses chosen from the elective list below. These must include at least two courses offered by the Chemistry Department (Chemistry 180 may be counted no more than once, and Chemistry 192, 194, 196, and 199 may not be counted) and at least one of the laboratory courses in the following laboratory course group: Chemistry 152, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 160, Chemistry 170, Physics 150, Physics 151, Physics 152, Physics 153. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Elective List: Chemistry 125, 135 and all Chemistry courses numbered 152-235, Bio. Sci. 106 (Biochemistry), Bio. Sci. 107 (Molecular Biology), Physics 111A-B (Classical Mechanics), Physics 112A-B (Electromagnetic Theory), Physics 113A-B-C (Quantum Physics), Physics 115 (Statistical Physics), Physics 116 (Thermodynamics), Physics 132 (Nuclear Physics), Phys\u00ad ics 133 (Condensed Matter Physics), Physics 134 (Modern Optics), Physics 150 (Electronics for Scientists), Physics 151 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 152 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 153 (Advanced Laboratory). Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four-or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Information and Computer Science, and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) Planning a Program of Study The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic require\u00ad ments above coincide with those of the School of Biological Sciences, and a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sci\u00ad ences does not require much extra course work. The Depart\u00ad ment is accredited by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergraduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. \u00b7while it is not necessary, it is desirable for stu\u00ad dents to pursue a course of study that the American Chemi\u00ad cal Society judges to merit a certified degree. A certified degree specifically requires that the following courses be included in the program of study: Mathematics 3 (any two quarters); Chemistry 152 and 153; Chemistry 160, 170, or 180. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemis\u00ad try 1A-B-C and 1LB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 51A-B-C and 51LA-LB-LC; the Physics 5A-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC sequences should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's discretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the School of Physical Sci\u00ad ences breadth requirement, the UCI breadth requirement, and the Chemistry Department scientific breadth require\u00ad ment. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in the year sequence of physical chemistry (Chemistry 131A-B\u00ad C or 130A-B-C) and in Chemistry 107 (fall) and 151 (winter). During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Depart\u00ad ment electives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University, School, and departmental requirements. There is no foreign language requirement, but Chemistry majors are urged to obtain reading competence in a foreign language through course work. Outlines of several typical programs of study for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Society-certified Chemistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences double majors have been prepared. Students are urged to obtain copies of the sample programs from their academic advisors, from the Chemistry Department Office, or from the Physical Sciences Associate Dean's Office. Chemistry 165 Graduate Program The Department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out independent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of graduate course work (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs all students are required to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' competence in the general areas of chemistry, e.g., organic, physical, inorganic, at the undergraduate level. The Area Examinations are designed to ensure a proper funda\u00ad mental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choosing the appropriate program of course work for each entering student. Students in the Ph.D. program are expected to demonstrate their knowledge of chemistry at the advanced level through satisfactory completion of a series of Cumulative Examina\u00ad tions. These examinations are designed to encourage the independent study of chemistry through reading of the clas\u00ad sic and current chemical literature and attendance at advanced seminars and colloquia. Normally, beginning with the second year of graduate study, students must take the monthly examinations until four have been passed. This requirement must be satisfied within 12 consecutive Cumula\u00ad tive Examinations. Following completion of the Cumulative Examination require\u00ad ment, participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral exami\u00ad nation for formal Advancement to Candidacy. This examina\u00ad tion normally comes in a student's third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's dissertation research project and a second original research proposition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses, including six graduate-level courses in chemistry. The M.S. Plan II (Course Work) program requires that the student complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses. Graduate stu\u00ad dents are expected to maintain a grade point average of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate pro\u00ad gram, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to par\u00ad ticipate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate career. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doctoral dissertation, which must describe the results of orig\u00ad inal research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suitable for publication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to pre\u00ad sent the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, following which the candi\u00ad date will be examined in public on the contents of the disser\u00ad tation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis pre\u00ad sented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984166 Chemistry under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's orig\u00ad inal research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. Some faculty from the Department of Chemistry are mem\u00ad bers of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemis\u00ad try group. The program provides an opportunity for interac\u00ad tion among graduate students and faculty from a number of UCI departments who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research prob\u00ad lems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. See page 82. The following lists specify requirements for each of the graduate programs offered by the Department of Chemistry. Master of Science in Chemistry Plan I (Thesis Plan) Completion of the Area Examination requirement. Completion of a minimum of seven approved courses, includ\u00ad ing six graduate-level courses in chemistry (as specified by the Department and excluding Chemistry 280, 290, 291, and 399) with maintenance of an average grade of B or better in all course work undertaken.

A grade point average of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses applicable to the M.S. degree. The student's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A-B-C and Mathematics 230A-B-C. The student must complete three additional approved courses, one of which must be an appropriate course offered by a department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C Mathematics 220A or 230A, Statistics (Mathematics 131A-B-C or 201A-B\u00ad C) or Differential Equations (Mathematics 142A-B-C or 29SA-B-C), plus two additional graduate courses in Mathe\u00ad matics. The student must complete three additional approved courses, including two appropriate courses offered by a department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematical Statistics concentration are Mathematics 201A-B-C and 201LA-LB-LC Mathematics 202 and 202L, Mathematics 204A-B and 204LA-LB, and three additional approved gradu\u00ad ate courses in Mathematics or an appropriate applied area. The student also must complete Mathematics 129A-B-C and 129LA-LB-LC. Ordinarily, the final examinations in the courses listed below will comprise the comprehensive examination for the Mas\u00ad ter's degree. Pure Mathematics: Mathematics 210C, Mathematics Applied 29SC. Statistics: Mathematics 201C Mathematics 202, and Mathematics 204B. The student must satisfy the language requirement for the Master's degree by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian; or by demonstrating program\u00ad ming proficiency in one higher level programming language. The residency requirement for the Master's degree ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters imme\u00ad diately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a leave of absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of study. Ph.D. in Mathematics To be admitted to the doctoral program in Mathematics, an applicant must have completed a Master's degree in Mathe\u00ad matics with distinction. When accepted into the doctoral program, the student em\u00ad barks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and individ\u00ad ual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. qualifying exami\u00ad nation and dissertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. should have both breadth and depth of knowledge. Breadth is dem\u00ad onstrated by advanced knowledge and competence in algebra and analysis. Depth of knowledge is demonstrated by pro\u00ad found familiarity with a well-defined subject in mathematics, e.g., Banach algebras, group theory, operator theory, probabil\u00ad ity theory, or topology. Mathematics 171 After an appropriate period of advanced study, the Graduate Studies Committee will invite the student to prepare for the qualifying examination (or recommend that the student withdraw from the program). This decision will be reached after consultation with the student's faculty advisor and a review of the instructors' evaluations of the student's per\u00ad formance in courses and seminars. To prepare for the qualify\u00ad ing examination, the student should study, in depth, two top\u00ad ics selected with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, including at UC IRVINE - 1983-1984172 Mathematics least one member of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Department. Following a successful examination, the com\u00ad mittee recommends admission of the student to candidacy for the Ph.D. The Ph.D. in Mathematics requires a demonstration of the ability to read the literature of mathematics in two of these languages: French, German, or Russian; and the ability to program in a higher level programming language. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to partici\u00ad pate in the teaching program of the Department. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative re\u00ad search in mathematics by writing and defending a disserta\u00ad tion that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathe\u00ad matics in the candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, guides and supervises the candidate's \u00b7research, study, and writing of the dissertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Physicists study the smallest structure of matter (quarks, nuclei, and atoms); the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disci\u00ad plines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. In the past Physics 175 century applications of phenomena encountered in the field of physics have led to more changes in our lifestyle than have occurred in the previous millenium. These changes have brought us a \"high\" standard of living on one hand, and a threat of societal extinction on the other. The knowledge gained in physical studies has affected our daily life, our view of life, our philosophies, and our religions. A subject of so great and general an influence is not only of interest to the specialist but should be understood in its scope, power, and promise for the future by every educated person. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984176 Physics The Department offers courses for students of various inter\u00ad ests, from those in the liberal arts to those in engineering and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as elementary particles, plasma physics, and condensed matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. Instruc\u00ad tion varies in approach from traditional lecture courses to seminars at various levels, to independently constructed pro\u00ad grams, and to experimental computer teaching. The faculty is generally young, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and univer\u00ad sity service to community action, literature, and national pol\u00ad icy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-faculty interaction, and faculty members lead the lower-division discussion sections. The Department tonsists of people committed to intellectual activities and is exciting to those who are so inclined. Undergraduate Program Courses in the Physics Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students with\u00ad out facility in mathematics whose main interests lie in the humanities or the arts to those students with professional goals in science and engineering. In addition to the regular Physics major, a concentration in Applied Physics and a con\u00ad centration in Biomedical Physics are offered. The three \u00b7lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summar\u00ad ized in the following table: Physics 3 Intended Audience Premedical students, , Biological Sciences Physics 5 Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering majors majors Mathematical Prerequisites Algebra and trigo- Math 2A (Calcu- nometry; concurrent Ius); knowledge enrollment in of computer pro- Math 2 gramming is recommended Preparation for Advanced Courses Physics SC with All upper-division permission courses in physics Requirements for Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42.

Departmental Requirements Physics 10-24 Non science majors None None Physics SA-B-C-D-E with laboratory; Physics lllA-B, 112A\u00ad B, 113A-B, and 115; two quarters of advanced laboratory (Physics 150-153); Mathematics 2A-B-C (or H2A-B-C); Mathematics 3A-B-C; three courses from llOA-B-C, 140A-B-C, 142A-B-C, or 144A-B with Physics llOA-B-C particularly recommended; and three additional coherently related upper-division courses chosen from the Schools of Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or the Department of Information and\u00b7 Computer Science. Students should be aware that alternative programs can be developed to meet their special interests and that graduate courses can be used to satisfy undergraduate requirements. Applied Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Applied Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus six courses in engineering approved by the Physics Department. One quarter of the advanced laboratory requirement may be waived with appropriate engineering laboratory work. Biomedical Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Biomedical Physics include the requirements of the Physics degree, except as noted below, plus the following: Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104 with associated laboratories; Chemistry lA-B-C with laboratory; a three or four quarter sequence of courses in a specific area. Suggested sequences are as follows: 1. Chemistry SlA-B with laboratory; Biological Sciences 106 and 107 2. Biological Sciences 105 plus two Psychobiology courses 3. Chemistry 130A-B-C 4. Radiological Sciences 200A-B plus one additional Radio\u00ad logical Science course Approval must be obtained from the program coordinator. Sequences other than those above may be acceptable. The requirement for three additional coherently related upper\u00ad division science courses does not apply to students in this concentration. Planning a Program of Study Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical stu\u00ad dents, students majoring in. Biological Sciences, and non\u00ad science majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics with strong orientation toward modern physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 10-24. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 with a grade of A or B may, with the consent of the Department, enroll in Physics SC. The premedical physics requirements may be met with Physics 3 or with Physics SA-B-C. Physics 5 is an intensive five-quarter course for students in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other areas interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics 5 should enroll in Mathematics 3A concurrently with Physics SC. Students planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics 5 need not enroll in Mathematics 3A. The recommended knowledge of computer programming may be gained by enrolling in Information and Computer Science IA or IB, usually in the fall quarter of the freshman year, or in Physics 1. Biological Sciences majors with facility in calculus should consider Phys\u00ad ics 5 as an alternative to Physics 3. Physics courses numbered between 10 and 24 are general education courses intended for nonscience majors. Physics 13A-B is particularly oriented toward students in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. The content and format of Physics 21-24 will vary from year to year. In general, these courses will not include regular laboratory work. Courses numbered 110 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. This series of courses in the upper\u00ad division curriculum is sufficiently broad to provide programs both for the Physics major who does not intend to pursue the study of physics beyond the Bachelor's degree level and for the Physics major preparing for a professional career in phys- UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Physics 177 Sample Programs -Physics A typical course program for Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate study in physics or astronomy is shown below. Three of the electives in the senior year may be physics graduate courses. A student with a weak back\u00ad ground may want to postpone Physics Il3A-B-C until the senior year.

The Physics major with a career goal in medicine, law, teaching, or business, for example, should emphasize the Physics 130 series, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. The Physics major preparing for graduate work in physics should cover most of the Physics 110 series. Any major who is so inclined can take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Able students may begin the Physics lil series in their sophomore year. Courses numbered between 110 and 116 emphasize the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. Those numbered between 130 and 149 emphasize particular domains of the structure of matter. Laboratory work is assigned to separate courses, 1S0-1S4. Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual consultation with a member of the Physics faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Since many graduate physics departments require a reading knowledge of one foreign language, Physics majors planning graduate work should, if possible, study some Russian, Ger\u00ad man, or French. Introductory courses in biology and chemis\u00ad try are also recommended options. Every Physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Physics majors with interests other than graduate work in physics or astronomy need not take as many physics courses as indicated above. Note also that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. As a guide to preparing a suitable program, the Department makes the following suggestions: Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should complete the Applied Physics requirements. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biology, or various interdisciplinary areas should contain: Chemistry lA-B-C and SlA-B-C. and Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104. The concentration in Biomedical Physics is offered for Phys\u00ad ics majors who wish to follow an integrated program which combines biology and/or chemistry with physics, and is suit\u00ad able preparation for a graduate career in one of these inter\u00ad disciplinary areas.

Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science should contain at. least: History 29A-B-C. Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. Sample Program -Applied Physics The Applied Physics concentration within the Physics under\u00ad graduate degree program is designed to provide appropriate education to students who anticipate a career in industrial or technological research. It combines the fundamental knowl\u00ad edge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the technical knowledge obtained from engineering courses, particularly electrical engineering courses. In addi\u00ad tion to the basic courses in physics, a student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the Physics Department. Examples of appropriate courses include completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics. A typical course program for Physics majors in the Applied Physics concentration differs from the Physics major pro\u00ad gram primarily in the junior and senior years. Engineering EE7S should be completed before the junior year. Fall Winter Spring Junior Physics IlOA Physics lilA Engr. EE113 Elective Engr.

Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required, except as noted in the Biomedical Physics requirements, as are six quarters of basic courses in biology and chemistry (see table). A sequence of three or four integrated additional courses which must be approved by the program coordinator com\u00ad pletes the program. Students who wish to follow the Biomed\u00ad ical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coor\u00ad dination of a program in the first and second years is essential. Graduate Program The Department offers the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Physics, the first in recognition of demonstrated knowledge of the basic facts and theories of physics, the second primar\u00ad ily in recognition of demonstrated capacity for independent research. In general, graduate study in physics is expected to be a full\u00ad time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate stu\u00ad dent is a member of an intellectual community and is expected to participate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high energy, and plasma physics. About 60 graduate students of physics were enrolled in 1982-83. Active programs of research are underway in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low temperature physics, plasma physics, mathematical physics, and astrophysics. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the booklet Physim/ Sciences from the Department. Elective Master of Science in Physics The requirements for the M.S. degree are: (1) at least three quarters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course material, which may be demonstrated either (a) by passing, with a grade of B or better, a minimum of nine quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 213A-B, 214A, and 21SA-B, and a written comprehensive examination; or (b) by passing the Ph.D. qualifying examina\u00ad tion. Under special circumstances, a research project and the\u00ad sis may be accepted in lieu of proficiency in some of the graduate course material. There is no foreign language requirement for the M.S. degree. In addition to the stated course requirements, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination must register continuously for Physics 264A-B-C (Seminar in Conceptual Physics). A typical program in preparation for the written examination for the M.S. degree would consist of 12 courses: 211 (Classical Mechanics) 212A-B (Mathematical Physics) 213A-B (Electromagnetic Theory) 214A-B (Statistical Physics) 21SA-B (Quantum Mechanics) Three electives chosen from Physics 212C 214C 215C, 216-219, or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. Doctor of Philosophy in Physics The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a min\u00ad imum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a dissertation reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete cer\u00ad tain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classi\u00ad cal Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. A minimum of 15 quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 212A-B, 213A-B, 214A\u00ad B, and 215A-B, must be passed with a grade of B or better. In addition, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualify\u00ad ing examination are required to register for Physics 264A-B\u00ad C. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will ordinarily take the core course in that subject (237 A-B-C 238A-B-C or 239A-B-C) early in their graduate career. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candi\u00ad dacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part covers a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels. The first part of the oral examination will be administered shortly after the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be faculty from the Physics Department. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approximately one year after successful completion of the written examination and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Physics Department. The second oral will cover principally material related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. The writ\u00ad ten portion of the qualifyin? :xdutination will be given once per year, generally in the fall. The examination may be taken by some students after one year of graduate study. A second attempt will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third attempt will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances. Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate careers. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of orig\u00ad inal research performed by the student under the supervision of a doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council will be required for the Ph.D. degree. The criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific journal. The disserta\u00ad tion must not have been submitted to any other institution prior to its submission to the Physics Department at UCI. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the disserta\u00ad tion, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. Suggested Course Sequence. Typical programs for the first two years designed to prepare the student for Ph.D. qualifi\u00ad cation and provide the foundation necessary for understand\u00ad ing and participating in modern research might include: First Year: 211 (Relativistic Quantum Mechanics). In the second year of graduate study, the student may begin to take courses that will provide a broad background for the dissertation area. The following sequences represent a typical second-year program: For the student with an interest in condensed matter physics: 221 (Elasticity); 222 (Hydrodynamics); (Group Theory); 218 (Condensed Matter Physics); 220 (Plasma Physics). For the student with an interest in elementary particle physics: 235A-B (Advanced Quantum Mechanics); 232B (Group (Astrophysics); 214A-B (Statistical Physics); 214C (Many Body Theory) or 218 (Condensed Matter Physics).

Wiener, Ph.D. Harvard University, /\\ssocinte Professor of History nnd Social Scimce John I. Yellott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Psychology Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modern social science. The classic subject matter areas of anthropol\u00ad ogy, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psy\u00ad chology, and sociology are included in the School's educa\u00ad tional programs, but these programs go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be characterized by the follow\u00ad ing three-way emphasis: First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behavior. Developments in computer science and in mathe\u00ad matics oriented toward the problems of the social sciences and the refinement of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sciences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modern social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional dis\u00ad ciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross orthodox boundaries are political sociology, pub\u00ad lic policy, cognitive anthropology, comparative culture, and psycholinguistics. Therefore, many courses and course modules are built around social science phenomena, rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School shares the academic philosophy that con\u00ad siders the design of hypotheses and of systems of interrelated ideas about the possible structure of the world to be an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educa\u00ad tional programs place substantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the development of the\u00ad ories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Opportunities for students in the School of Social Sciences to participate in the educational process extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members; they are invited to participate in the quarterly eval\u00ad uation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School committees. The School provides a variety of oppor\u00ad tunities for faculty-student interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Careers in Social Sciences Graduates of the School of Social Sciences find many and diverse career opportunities. Social Sciences graduates have been in demand for jobs in government, primary and secon\u00ad dary teaching, and human services, as well as for careers in business. Many Social Sciences graduates have gone on to further studies, some at the doctoral level in preparation for careers in research and university teaching, others in the pro\u00ad fessions of law and medicine, in education, and in business administration. Because all Social Sciences degrees involve an educational program that is interdisciplinary and that emphasizes quan\u00ad titative methods of data analysis, graduates of the School are well prepared for research and analysis positions in all levels of government and in private firms. Their firm grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them a fine background on the basis of which to pursue further training in graduate and professional programs. Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facili\u00ad ties for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sci\u00ad ences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experi\u00ad ment and control rooms situated around a central core where two PDP 11-44 computers are available for experimental research. The laboratory is used for faculty and student research. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in children and how they learn. Each quarter under\u00ad graduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. The Anthropology Laboratory provides research facilities which include computer terminals for statistical studies and for the analysis of texts and other verbal material. The labor\u00ad atory is also available for undergraduate and graduate instruction in field methodology and in analytical techniques through the use of video-cassettes, films, tapes, computer quizzes, and artificial intelligence programs that simulate interviewing situations. The School also maintains a Video Laboratory where social science students and faculty can produce and edit video-tapes for various purposes. The facility currently contains a tape library of use in the study of conversation and interaction. Degrees Anthropology ......................................

Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, the following conditions must be met: (1) Normally, neither major program may be the general social science program. (2) Major and School requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathematics, computer science, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer science courses need only be taken once. Only two introduc\u00ad tory social science classes are needed, provided this also meets the requirements of both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who would like to major in psychology and anthropology may take one of the mathematics se\u00ad quences, Information and Computer Science 1, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropol\u00ad ogy to meet the major and School requirements for both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper-division courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. Transfer Students Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Junior transfers electing to major in one of the School's degree programs and with good records at other ac\u00ad credited colleges and universities normally will be presumed to have satisfied School requirement B and the University re\u00ad quirements, with the exception of the upper-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category 1). Stu\u00ad dents anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year, how\u00ad ever, should plan their programs so as to anticipate the spe\u00ad cial mathematics requirements of the program (School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in background, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for jun\u00ad ior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four\u00ad year program, except that students who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan Social Sciences 187 their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply to the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Bus\u00ad iness Administration (M.B.A.), in Public Administration (M.P.A.), or Business and Public Administration (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of either the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor. Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines repre\u00ad sented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offerd by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate cur\u00ad riculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of the Concentration that participat\u00ad ing students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the contributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984188 Social Sciences Concentration in Women's Studies The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by the systematic study of women in culture and society. Two options of study are offered: (a) Humanities SOA-B-C, four upper-division women's studies courses (two in Humanities and two in Social Sciences or Social Ecology), which could include Social Sciences 183, and a senior paper or seminar; or (b) Social Sciences 183A-B, four upper-division women's studies courses (two in Human\u00ad ities and two in Social Sciences or Social Ecology), excluding Social Sciences 183, and a senior paper or seminar. For further information on the concentration, see page 146. Anthropology and Linguistics Historically there have been close ties between anthropology and linguistics. In the past, many linguists were originally trained as anthropologists, and many anthropologists have focused their research on aspects of linguistic structure. Lin\u00ad guists who work on unfamiliar languages benefit from train\u00ad ing in anthropological field methods and elicitation techniques. Recommended courses for those majors in Anthropology who have a special interest in language, and for majors in Linguistics with a special interest in anthropology are the fol\u00ad lowing: Social Sciences 2D, 3 (or Linguistics 50), 135D-E, 131N, 141A, 141F, 157B, Linguistics 110 and 133. For the lin\u00ad guistically oriented Anthropology major, the basic courses in linguistic structures (syntax, phonology, and semantics) are essential, while the Anthropology courses in collection and analysis of data are essential to the Linguistics major with an interest in field work. To complete a major in Anthropology or Linguistics, both School and major requirements must be completed. Planning a Program of Study Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with their assigned faculty advisors or visit the Undergraduate Advising Office (122 Social Science Tower) to design an appropriate program of study. Students who elect one of the Social Sciences majors in \u00b7their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics se\u00ad quences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Teaching Credentials Students planning to seek State of California teaching ere-dentials in social science should discuss their undergraduate curriculum plans with the School's academic counselors. Stu\u00ad dents completing any of the B.A. programs in the School qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Exami\u00ad nation in social science. For additional information about teaching credentials, see the Teacher Education section. Mathematics and Social Science The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of mathemat\u00ad ics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current literature in these fields, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of models in social sciences. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowl\u00ad edge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, however, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should consult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. Graduate Programs Graduate education within the School of Social Sciences is focused upon Cognitive Sciences; Comparative Culture; Eco\u00ad nomics; Politics and Society; and Social Relations (including anthropology). Doctoral students may be admitted to one of five established groups which offer graduate study: Cognitive Sciences, leading to the Ph.D. in Psychology; Comparative Culture, leading to the Ph.D. in Comparative Culture; Eco\u00ad nomics, currently leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Poli\u00ad tics and Society, leading to the Ph.D. in Political Science; and Social Relations, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. When the interests of the student lie outside of the areas encom\u00ad passed by the recognized groups, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, School of Social Sciences, may appoint a faculty committee of at least three members to guide an independent course of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science. In addition to the five established groups offering graduate study, there is a sixth group, the Mathematical Social Science group, actively involved in graduate education. At present, there is no formal graduate curriculum leading to a Ph.D. in this area; however, individual courses of study under the interdisciplinary committee system may be approved for selected graduate students, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. The Mathematical Social Science group is developing a graduate program in social networks. Graduate study is also offered leading to the Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degree in Comparative Culture. Although the School does not offer other programs leading to a Master of Arts degree, the M.A. degree in Comparative Culture or Social Science may be conferred upon doctoral students who satisfy the requirements of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Admissions Potential graduate students should apply to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research for admission to the graduate program of the School of Social Sciences, indicating the title of the degree which they intend to pursue (Ph.D. in Compar\u00ad ative Culture, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science), and the academic area in which they expect to concentrate. In addition to the Division admission requirements, each group may prescribe special requirements or expectations of appli\u00ad cants. All applicants are required to submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination General Test. Letters of recommendation are an important factor in the admission decision. The Program in Comparative Culture admits new graduate students only for the fall quarter of even-numbered years. Financial Aid Limited financial support in the form of teaching assistant\u00ad ships and fellowships is available to qualified students. There may be research assistantships available under grants to indi\u00ad vidual faculty. Students are expected to seek aid for which they are eligible from sources external to the University. General Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science The general requirements for the Ph.D. in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science (in addition to those which apply to all UCI graduate students) are summarized below. Each recognized group within the School of Social Sciences may describe additional requirements, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. Length of Study The faculty envisions a student's Ph.D. program to be of ap\u00ad proximately four to five years' duration. Residence Because the intellectual training the School proposes requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. Language A knowledge of one foreign language, appropriate to the stu\u00ad dent's research concerns, is required. Each student's group or candidacy committee will prescribe specific requirements. For those proposing to engage in field research, this may involve interviewing capabilities. Quantitative Methods Candidates for the Ph.D. degrees in Social Science, Political Science, or Psychology must satisfy a quantitative methods requirement. This may be met by (1) satisfaction of the quantitative methods requirement of the student's group, or (2) completion of two years of college-level mathematics, sta\u00ad tistics, logic, or applications of statistics to social science research problems, in courses approved by the student's group or committee. In the latter option, courses may include one computer science course; ordinarily at least one year of these quantitative methods courses will be taken during the student's graduate career. Examinations The scope and format of the qualifying examinations will be determined by the student's candidacy committee. These examinations may be written or oral, or both, and usually will be conducted after approximately two years of residence. Also, a student may be required to take additional examina\u00ad tions, submit research papers, or conduct experiments which the committee deems appropriate to the student's interests and goals. Upon satisfactory completion of the qualifying Social Sciences 189 examinations, and approval of the dissertation topic, the can\u00ad didacy committee will recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation Following advancement to candidacy, the dissertation is supervised by a doctoral committee ordinarily consisting of three members of the candidacy committee. The purpose of the dissertation is to demonstrate the student's ability to orig\u00ad inate interesting and significant research problems, to inves\u00ad tigate such problems both broadly and deeply, and to write scholarly material of publishable quality.

Watt: Cognitive Semiotics Kenneth Wexler: Theoretical Psycholinguistics john I. Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical Models and Visual Perception The Cognitive Sciences group is made up of certain faculty of the School of Social Sciences and of graduate .students who are pursuing the Ph.D. in Psychology, all of whom share common research interests in human cognition. The Cognitive Sciences group is concerned with how the human mind works. It conducts research and provides advanced graduate training in cognitive psychology and theo\u00ad retical linguistics. The group lays special stress on precise scientific approaches to issues in human cognition. It views the formation of formal models as instrumental in under\u00ad standing what the human mind is all about. The group takes as its intellectual domain the following: mathematical psychology, perception (visual and auditory), cognitive development, problem solving, learning, memory, psycholinguistics, semiotics, and theoretical linguistics. It does not emphasize traditional training in psychology or linguistics per se; rather, it stresses the integration of research in the areas mentioned above (and related areas) into a discipline whose central focus is the study of human knowledge and human information processing, regardless of the medium in which it is expressed. Admissions In addition to meeting the general requirements for admis\u00ad sion, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. Advanced courses in some of the following fields are con\u00ad sidered highly desirable: computer science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biology, logic, and linguistics. Each admission application will be considered on its own merits. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984190 Social Sciences Requirements Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences. The first is a three-quarter methods sequence covering the areas of probability and statistics, experimental design, and mathematical models of language. The other is a proseminar sequence covering areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguistics. Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the group. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will supplement the required courses. Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the second year, each student should complete a research project of a scope and nature that would be potentially publishable in a relevant journal. The student's advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to write a paper based on their research and to present a talk to the \"Cognitive Sciences Seminar\" or another appropriate forum by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. Reviews At the end of each academic year the faculty in the group will meet to discuss the progress of each of its students and to provide feedback on the progress and perceived deficien\u00ad cies for each student. The advancement-to-candidacy examination will consist of an oral examination and possibly a written examination as well. Normally this step will be completed by the end of the third or beginning of the fourth year of the program. The exami\u00ad nation will be based on the student's dissertation proposal. A student who fails the examination twice will be asked to withdraw. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the student will be expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium. Comparative Culture Dickson D.

White: Anthropology, Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Constraints, Decision-Making Networks and Social Processes Joseph L. White: Black Psychology, Community Mental Health, Child Development, and Psychotherapy The doctoral program in Comparative Culture emphasizes study centering on the cultures of the United States, includ\u00ad ing dominant and minority cultures and their antecedents. The program is designed to educate interdisciplinary intellec\u00ad tuals, teachers, and research scholars. The range of cultures found in America is studied on a comparative basis, with some students concentrating upon the expressive forms of culture (literature, religion, myth, and the arts) and others on culture from the perspective of social inquiry (history and the social sciences). However, all students will gain interdiscipli\u00ad nary training as comparative analysts in both broad areas. Finally, the program is intended to prepare graduate students for academic positions in interdisciplinary programs as well as in departments of humanities and social sciences. Admission Requirements and standards for admission into the program are in keeping with those of the University of California as a whole. Students with a B.A. degree will be considered for admission on the basis of past academic performance and present academic interests. In addition to the general applica\u00ad tion material, Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test scores are required. Applicants who are admitted to the pro\u00ad gram begin their study in the fall quarter of the academic year. The deadline for applications is February 1. The pro\u00ad gram admits new graduate students only for the fall quarter of even-numbered years. Residence Although the University residence requirement for the Ph.D. is a minimum of six quarters, doctoral students in Compara\u00ad tive Culture must complete three years of course work (108 units). Normally, three courses (12 units) will be completed per quarter. Required and Elective Courses The program requires 21 courses (84 units for the doctorate). Courses are selected in consultation with the academic ad\u00ad visor, to prepare the student for the comprehensive first-year examination, the qualifying examination, and the develop\u00ad ment of a dissertation topic. The Prosemirlllr in Expressive 7 3A-Bi are required of all first-year graduate students. In addition each student must enroll in five approved electives. Electives may be taken in Comparative Culture or other areas pertinent to the program. During the second year, a course sequence in Nondominant American Classes and Cultures (Social Science 274A-B) is required of all doctoral students. For students emphasizing Social Inquiry, Cross-Cultural Comparisons, a methodological sequence (Social Science 275A-B-C) is also required while Expressive Forms students must complete a methodologies sequence (Social Science 276A-B-C) or approved alternative courses. Each second-year student must enroll in four approved electives totaling 16 additional units. During the third year, all doctoral students must enroll in three approved electives (12 units). All graduate students, including Teaching Assistants and Associates, are expected to enroll for a minimum of 12 units of academic credit (ordinarily, three courses) each quarter. Any student who wishes to take more than four courses (16 units) must petition the Graduate Committee and gain the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Incomplete grades will not be assigned for year-long courses except in extenuating circumstances. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Credit for Previous Academic Work Students entering with an M.A. degree may request credit for a maximum of nine courses (36 units). These courses might be accepted in lieu of electives. A written petition requesting an acceptance of previous work in lieu of electives should be made to the Graduate Committee after consulta\u00ad tion with the academic advisor. Approval of the Assistant Dean of Graduate Studies and Research is required. Language Requirements One foreign language and one \"alternate skill\" are required. The language will be decided upon by the student in consul\u00ad tation with the advisor. The language requirement must be satisfied either through a standard ETS examination or by another method approved by the Graduate Committee. The \"alternate skill\" may be another language, or a sequence of two courses in statistics, linguistics, or computer science, or some acceptable skill from the arts which is necessary for research. Both the language and the alternate skill must be satisfied before the qualifying examination can be taken. Comprehensive First-Year Examination Prior to the commencement of class work for the fall quarter, second-year doctoral students are administered a comprehen\u00ad sive examination which covers the materials from the two proseminars offered during the first year, including reading lists provided in those seminars. An ad hoc examination committee appointed by the Chair reads the examinations. It is possible for students who fail this examination to take it a second time. A second failure results in academic disqualifica\u00ad tion and no degree will be awarded. A student who passes the first or second examination may be awarded the M.A. degree. On the basis of students' performance in courses and on the comprehensive examination, the program faculty will decide which students to invite to continue studies toward the Ph.D. degree. Master of Arts Degree Those doctoral students who pass the first-year comprehen\u00ad sive examination but do not continue beyond that point, or those who have passed the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination, may be awarded the Master of Arts degree by (a) completing 36 units (nine courses), 24 units (six courses) of which must be in Comparative Culture and 12 units (three courses) of which are approved electives in Comparative Culture or a related area; and (b) demonstrating proficiency in a second language or an alternate skill. The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination Doctoral students are administered two examinations, one written and one oral. The written examination is scheduled after the completion of course work and language require\u00ad ments. The student's committee, formed by the Chair of the Graduate Committee in consultation with the student, is responsible for formulating the examination questions. The examination will be based on program courses and electives taken by the student during the second and third years. The entire program faculty can be called upon to submit questions for the examination, and the entire faculty will read the examinations. If the student passes the examination, the stu\u00ad dent will then be advanced to the oral examination. The oral examination follows successful completion of the written examination by two weeks or less and is conducted by a can\u00ad didacy committee (normally the student's advisory commit\u00ad tee) appointed in the name of the Graduate Council. This committee normally consists of five members of the UCI Academic Senate or persons with equivalent qualifications, and will include at least one member who does not hold a Social Sciences 191 faculty appointment in Comparative Culture. The committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. if the candidate successfully completes the oral examination. Students who fail the written examination may, upolJ peti\u00ad tion, take it a second time. Two failures result in academic disqualification. The Dissertation The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is completion of a dissertation which is approved by the doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council. Master of Arts in Teaching in Comparative Culture This graduate degree program is designed primarily for those who want to pursue a career in education at the elementary, secondary, or community college level. M.A. T. students may work concurrently toward a California Teaching Credential, or may be experienced teachers who wish to upgrade their professional preparation. Based upon an interdisciplinary and comparative framework embracing the range of cultures found in the United States, the M.A.T. prepares its graduates to teach and facilitate the development of multicultural studies in several subject areas. Specifically, our M.A.T. pro\u00ad gram focuses on the study of Comparative Culture with a special concentration in literature, history, and social sciences relating to various ethnic groups of America. These em\u00ad phases will be framed by the students' interests and needs with respect to their career goals in the field of education. Since the M.A.T. and Ph.D. programs in Comparative Cul\u00ad ture have different goals, the students in the M.A.T. program are not automatically advanced to doctoral training. Students who wish to pursue the doctoral degree in Comparative Cul\u00ad ture must apply to the Graduate Committee of Comparative Culture. Admissions Applications for admission to the M.A.T. program are made through Comparative Culture. Residence The minimum residence requirement for the M.A.T. is three quarters. Required and Elective Courses In addition to the courses which may be required for the cre\u00ad dential, the M.A.T. program consists of at least nine courses (36 units), six of which must be at the graduate level. Required courses include Multicultural Foundations of Edu\u00ad cation, a three-quarter core course; Pluralism, Public Policy, and the Schools, a two-quarter review and analysis of public policy; Special Topics, a one-quarter seminar concerned with a specific theme of relevance to the multicultural dimension of public education; and Thesis Research and Analysis, a one\u00ad quarter seminar. The student will develop and carry out an appropriate project in the teaching of ethnic cultures and/or minority students, and submit a report of the project demon\u00ad strating an integration of theoretical knowledge and applied skills for the approval of the thesis committee. Language Requirement For those who must acquire proficiency in a second language or alternate skills pertinent to cultural education, additional courses may be required.

This specialization was chosen for two rea\u00ad sons: first, governments and nonprofit institutions now occupy a primary role in our society so that an understanding of their behavior has become critical to understanding the economy in general; second, public economics has become one of the most intellectually exciting frontiers in economic analysis. Special emphasis is on research in the following areas: public choice, political economy, public policy, and organizational behavior. Graduate courses taught by the faculty listed above focus on positive and normative analysis of the behavior of government in formulating and implementing public policy. Theory building is emphasized, as well as empirical studies in governmental behavior and substantive areas of public policy. The School of Social Sciences has strengths in formal social analysis which are valuable adjuncts to economic theorizing about the public sector. Faculty members are affiliated with two Organized Research Units, the Institute of Transporta\u00ad tion Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization. Public policy and economics are central issues of both organi\u00ad zations, which provide funding for graduate students who select public policy or transportation as a specialized field. The existing academic programs in medicine and social ecol\u00ad ogy also provide intellectual support. Presently, admission to graduate studies in Economics is offered through the School's committee system in which a faculty committee of at least three members guides the course of study leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. Uni\u00ad versity authorization of the Ph.D. in Economics is anticipated in 1983-84. Politics and Society Benjamin N.

Members are committed to studies involving the appli\u00ad cation of social science theory to the analysis of political and social behavior and structures and to the solution of social issues. The Ph.D. is granted in Political Science. The group places special emphasis on recruiting students who propose to pursue research in the following areas: (a) authority, power, and value allocations relating to public policy, to organization, to participation, and to relationships within and between social and political units; (b) change and structure of cultures and of social and political units; and (c) empirical theory, mathematical models, and quantitative analysis of political phenomena. Faculty are currently conducting research on authority rela\u00ad tions, organizational theory, and bureaucratic behavior; eco\u00ad nomic models of political behavior; mass media and society; democracy and participation; public policy; political thought; quantitative political science; foreign policy and international relations; and comparative politics with an emphasis on Europe and Latin America. Two organized research units are affiliated with the group: the Institute of Transportation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization. Both sponsor theoretical and applied research on social issues. The Focused Research Program in Authority Studies also offers research opportunities for graduate students in political science. Admissions Students are normally expected to have a grade point average above 3.0 and scores on the two parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test which total over 1, 100. Decisions on admission are strongly influenced by let\u00ad ters of recommendation and the statement of student inter\u00ad est. International students will be evaluated primarily on the basis of letters of recommendation and completed seminar or research papers, but GRE scores are required in all cases. Requirements The following is in addition to the general School and campus requirements. Each year a core program, focusing upon methodology and substantive problems of current interest, will be outlined for entering graduate students. Those who have not already taken college mathematics are required to take at least three quarters of approved mathematics or sta\u00ad tistics courses. At the completion of the first year, the per\u00ad formance of each student is reviewed and the faculty will indicate whether the student should continue. Attendance in a colloquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984 i L_ Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year a review of performance in the core program will be conducted for each student by the Politics and Society faculty. At that time, an advising committee of three faculty is identified to supervise the examinations leading to advancement to candi\u00ad dacy for the Ph.D. By June 1 of each year, the approval of the advisory committee must be obtained for the student to be eligible for financial support during the subsequent academic year. A set of written examinations, normally taken at the end of the second year of study, tests competency in a set of major domains of intellectual inquiry determined by the student and the advisory committee. Upon successful completion of these comprehensive examinations and demonstration of competence in mathematics and foreign language, a formal candidacy committee is appointed to oversee the final qualify\u00ad ing examination and formal advancement to candidacy. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of graduate study. After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral com\u00ad mittee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, supervises work toward completion of the dissertation.

It has a commitment to include the meaning and content of the actions, events, and phenomena it studies, from the micro-to the macro-level. The faculty also is concerned about similari\u00ad ties and differences among people living at different times and in different places. Unlike traditional anthropology, how\u00ad ever, the interests of the Social Relations faculty are not limited to small communities nor to traditional forms of data collection or analysis. In addition, the program leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science with emphasis in anthropology is dis\u00ad tinct from more traditional anthropology programs in that it includes no requirements in archaeology or physical anthropology. Admissions The faculty welcomes students from diverse educational and social backgrounds. Students who have research interests corresponding to those of specific faculty members are espe\u00ad cially encouraged to apply to this apprenticeship-type pro\u00ad gram. They should familiarize themselves with the publica\u00ad tions of the faculty before applying. Requirements Students are admitted by the entire Social Relations faculty. New students are assigned an advisor who serves until a three-person committee is formed, which occurs by the mid\u00ad dle of the second year of residence. The committee oversees the student's academic work and ordinarily is chaired by the faculty member with whom the student plans to work most closely. A core seminar which meets weekly throughout the year is required of first-year graduate students. Students are expected to attend the Social Relations Colloquium Series throughout their graduate careers. In addition, two quarters of statistics, mathematics, computer science, or other appro\u00ad priate analytical methods are required. Normally these will be completed during the first two years of study. Reviews During the first year each student will prepare an original paper under the committee's direction. The paper will be presented by the student at a meeting of the Colloquium Ser\u00ad ies, normally during the spring quarter of the first year. The student's committee members will provide the student with a detailed written critique of the paper as part of the first-year evaluation of the student's overall progress. The second review takes the form of an advancement-to\u00ad candidacy examination. This ordinarily is conducted by the student's committee and two additional faculty members from the campus. Students are expected to take this exami\u00ad nation no later than the spring quarter of their third year. Satisfactory completion of the dissertation is the final requirement in completing the Ph.D. Foreign Language A speaking or reading knowledge of one foreign language is required. Courses in Social Sciences Courses in the School do not always resemble conventional university courses either in content or in format. Students at any level are encouraged to suggest areas of individual study and may (with faculty approval) pursue any intellectually challenging area within the social sciences. Such courses may include special seminars, study projects, individual papers, or any other useful educational activity. The faculty encourages students to present evidence that they have done interesting and original work and to receive official credit for that work by enrolling in an individual study course. Such courses are numbered 198 and 199 (undergraduate) and 299 (graduate). Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk with faculty within the School. In addition to the introductory courses, many of the upper-division courses are open to students without previous work in social science. Since many of the courses touch on several areas of social science, a list of major areas of concentration is normally included in the description of a course. The classification terms used for this purpose are anthropology, comparative culture, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. Most upper-division courses are arranged in modules in order to provide continuity over individual courses, to facilitate long-range planning by students, and to encourage the pursuit of interdisciplinary programs of study. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the module concept to acquire experience in several integrated sets of courses. It is not necessary; however, for students to take all courses listed in 11 module; module courses may be taken individually, as long as course prerequisites have been mel. The specific courses offered in module form may vary from year to year, but the structure of the curriculum will remain stable. Ordinarily, a student can expect to find at least one module offered in each broad area each year. By observing the content area of courses and by making effective use of module sequences, a student can assemble an individual pro\u00ad gram of study in a particular discipline or in an interdiscipli\u00ad nary area. Listed below are course descriptions of some of the proposed courses to be offered during 1983-84. A final, complete listing of the courses offered will be available prior to the beginning of each quarter in 122 Social Science Tower. Students who are interested in obtaining this material may receive copies by visiting or writing to the School of Social Sciences. NOTE: Students who entered UCI before fall quarter, 1980, should refer to the 1979-80 UCI Genernl Catalogue nrui previous editions for information on the course numbering ami lettering sys\u00ad tem prior to fall 1980.

These prob\u00ad lems include predicting the orbit of a satellite, simulating the economy, keeping track of inventories, and sending mail elec\u00ad tronically. Such problems are solved by having the computer execute a procedure-a sequence of information processing operations including, but not limited to, arithmetic opera\u00ad tions, testing and comparing numbers and representations of alphabetic information, and changing the sequence of opera\u00ad tions within the computer. Information and computer science is concerned with the development of procedures which are effective and efficient, languages suitable for stating these procedures, systems for executing procedures, and with the study of the social setting in which procedures are used. The implications of research in the development of informa\u00ad tion processing procedures and of systems for preparing and executing these procedures extend beyond the direct applica\u00ad tions in using the modern digital computer to solve problems ranging from bookkeeping to the control of orbiting satel\u00ad lites. Many animate and inanimate systems can be usefully viewed as information processing systems and analyzed in terms of the way they represent, store, and process informa\u00ad tion. Thus information and computer science provides a point of view, an approach, for studying phenomena in many sciences. Computing resources available to students include interactive access to the systems in the campus Computing Facility: a DECsystem-10, a Xerox Sigma-7, a DEC PDP-11/45, 12 Ter\u00ad aks, and 12 ACI Micro-engines. The departmental computing laboratory equipment includes two DECsystem-2020s, a VAX-11/750, and a complement of peripheral devices. Fall 1983 transfer students are required to have th'e follow\u00ad ing: a minimum of 56 semester units/84 quarter units with a grade point average of 3.0 in courses accepted for transfer; two years of transferable college mathematics, including one year of calculus, with a grade point average of 3.0; comple\u00ad tion of one year of computer science courses, including the equivalent of ICS 1, with a grade point average of 3.0; suffi\u00ad cient transferable credits to satisfy the majority of breadth requirements, and satisfaction of the lower-division writing requirement (one year of college English composition). Alternately, fall 1983 lower-division eligible transfer students can come to the campus without declaring a major, take the courses necessary to meet the ICS change-of-major require\u00ad ments, and then apply for a change of major. On the basis of our experience over the past several years, we anticipate that the number of incoming freshmen and advanced-standing students who elect ICS as a major in the fall of 1984 will exceed the number of positions available. In the fall of 1983 less than half of the incoming applicants who elected ICS were admitted to the major. To ensure that their application is considered for the fall of 1984, students should be sure to file their application so it arrives on campus before November 30, 1983. The selection criteria will include grades, test scores, and affirmative action considerations. Students interested in using computers as an adjunct to their major field of study will be able to enroll in the introductory programming sequence (ICS 1B, 2L, and 3). UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Information and Computer Science 213 UC IRVINE - 1983-1984214 Information and Computer Science Degrees Information and Computer Science ....... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Honors at mngnn cum /nude, summn cum /nude, are awarded on the basis of grade point average and the student's performance on research. Approx\u00ad imately 12 percent of the graduating seniors are selected for honors. To be eligible for honors, a general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Careers for the ICS Major Students with undergraduate degrees in Information and Computer Science have been successful in finding career opportunities in recent years. Employment is available in computer programming, systems analysis, project control administration, and marketing. A Bachelor's degree in Information and Computer Science can be part of a preparatory program for graduate work in computer science, business administration, or social science. Undergraduate Program The undergraduate program in Information and Computer Science (JCS) is designed for students preparing for profes\u00ad sional careers and for students preparing for graduate study in information and computer science. It is designed to acquaint the student with the currently available methods of information and computer science which are useful in solving problems of science, industry, and government; to prepare the student for the additional formal and self-education required in this rapidly developing field; and to foster and extend the student's abilities to solve the kinds of problems encountered in information and computer science. The use of the computer as a problem-solving tool and the effects of its adoption on procedure and data representation a\u00b7re the under\u00ad lying themes of the program. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are inter\u00ad ested in digital computer programming will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving I (JCS 1B) and continue in the programming se\u00ad quence with Programming and Problem Solving II (JCS 2, 2L) and Programming and Problem Solving III (JCS 3) as far as their interests require and their programs permit. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numer\u00ad ical analysis. Students interested in courses in computer engineering and digital systems should consult the list of Engineering courses. Students can declare a double major in Engineering and ICS; early consultation on such a double major is advisable. Students are advised on academic matters by faculty and staff. Advising of undergraduate students is coordinated by the departmental counselors who also provide information on vocational and counseling services available on the campus. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. Departmental Requirements Information and Computer Science 18, 2, 2l, 3. Any six of the following nine Information and Computer Science courses, provided at least one course and not more than two courses are chosen from each group: 141, 142; ISlA, lSIB, 152; 161, 162; 171, 172.

Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Business Administration (M.B.A.), in Public Adminis\u00ad tration (M.P.A.), or Business and Public Administration (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachlor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of either the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the require\u00ad ments for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact the GSM counseling office. Graduate Program M.S. Degree Effective fall 1984, the Master's degree will be awarded to students in the Ph.D. program when they satisfactorily com\u00ad plete Phase I of the program and 36 quarter units in approved courses, at least 24 of which are in graduate courses. Ph.D. Program The program leading to the Ph.D. in Information and Com\u00ad puter Science is research-oriented and encourages students to work together with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer science. Current research activities include analysis of algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine architecture, programming environments, software engineering, and social impacts of computing. All of these studies have extramural funding. Students as well as faculty are active professionally; a number of student papers have recently been accepted for publication in the proceedings of national conferences. The Ph.D. program is designed for full-time study, and can be completed in four to five years, depending upon the focus of research. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Admission Approximately 15 students are admitted each year. Applica\u00ad tions are evaluated on the basis of the student's prior aca\u00ad demic record and potential for creative professional contribu\u00ad tions. Applicants are expected to have good skills in computer programming and skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained by students who complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra, and modern algebra or probability and statistics. Computer science undergraduate training is not required, but some familiarity with machine organization, data structures, software sys\u00ad tems, and formal models is helpful. Applicants should take both the GRE Aptitude Test and the GRE Advanced Test in Computer Science. Personal inter\u00ad views are desirable but not required. Additional information on application procedures can be obtained from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Further information on the Department and the graduate program can be obtained by writing to the Department. Financial Assistance Financial assistance is available to students in the form of teaching and research assistantships. Stipends vary, depend\u00ad ing on the duties involved, and range up to $7,299 for the academic year. Students who also teach or assist with faculty research during the summer may earn an additional $2,000 to $4,000 per year. More than half of the doctoral students in residence receive financial assistance. General Requirements for the Ph.D. The Ph.D. program has three phases. Phase I. Breadth: The purpose of the breadth phase is to develop the student's understanding of broad areas in computer science. Understanding is certified by satisfactory performance in courses or on a written examination in five areas: 1. Architecture and Operating Systems 2. Programming Languages and Data Structures 3. Formal Methods 4. Artificial Intelligence 5. Design, Analysis, and Impact of Systems The examination is designed to test both basic knowledge and problem-solving ability. It is given once a year. Students are required to pass Phase I by the end of their second year. Phase II. Directed Research: Research under faculty direction in this phase is intended to develop research skills and crea\u00ad tive problem solving. This research may be conducted indi\u00ad vidually or with other students. Phase II concludes with an oral qualifying examination conducted by a formal candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. In this examination the student must demonstrate the essential research skills. Phase III. Dissertation: This phase is devoted almost ex\u00ad clusively to the dissertation. When the student has passed the formal qualifying examination and advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee is appointed to supervise the dissertation and approve it on behalf of the Graduate Council. Colloquium: Each student shall present a colloquium to the Department in the student's area of interest prior to entering the dissertation phase. Teaching Requirement: All ICS doctoral students are re\u00ad quired to participate in teaching activities before being advanced to candidacy. Teaching activities in summer or night school, service at other universities, etc., may be accepted as fulfillment of the requirement.

Harvard University, Professor of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy and Vice Chancellor Student Affairs (moral development, educational environments, late adolescent to early adult development) The Program in Social Ecology applies interdisciplinary scien\u00ad tific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among the issues of longstand\u00ad ing interest to the Program are violence in society, social influences on normal and atypical human development over the life span, and aspects of the physical environment which have an impact on human health and behavior. The curriculum is organized around three major problem areas (Environ~ental Analysis, Criminal Justice, Social Behavior) rather than by traditional academic disciplines (e.g., regional planning, criminology, psychology). The Program in Social Ecology maintains a central interest in human adapta\u00ad tion and a special but not exclusive interest in the study of events in the natural settings in which they occur. Social ecologists also use laboratory, questionnaire, and interview methods to study human social and environmental problems. The faculty of Social Ecology is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists who have specialized in developmental, envir\u00ad onmental, community, and social environmental health scien\u00ad tists; and lawyers. While faculty members are firmly grounded in their parent disciplines and teach basic courses in them, they concentrate their efforts on teaching and research with a problem orientation. In these problem-oriented courses, they integrate concepts and perspectives of several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that the analysis of complex societal problems requires inter\u00ad disciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). Another feature of instruction in Social Ecology is the use of lecturers from the community, individuals whose academic qualifications are complemented by their experiences with practical applica\u00ad tions. For example, a judge, an architect, a counseling psy\u00ad chologist, and a former police officer are among those who teach courses in the Program. A number of social ecologists are involved in interventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and communities function; a number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment.

B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the School of Biological Sciences) .............. B.A. Honors Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Initial eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus. Final decisions concerning the awards of summa cum /nude, mngnn cum /nude, and cum /nude will reflect a number of other factors, including quarters of work completed at UCI, number of graded units of course work in Social Ecology, and the quality of papers written for field study and independent study. Decisions about the award of honors are the responsibility of a commit\u00ad tee chaired by the Associate Director for Undergraduate Studies. Undergraduate Program in Social Ecology The undergraduate program in Social Ecology is organized around four curricular components: a Principles and Methods cluster and three subareas each concerned broadly with prob\u00ad lems of Environmental Analysis, Criminal Justice, and Social Behavior, respectively. Students do not major in a particular subarea; rather, they are expected to develop a degree of competence in each. Field Study. An important characteristic of the undergradu\u00ad ate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is open only to Social Ecology majors. In faculty\u00ad supervised field study situations, students relate theories learned in the classroom to actual social-environmental prob\u00ad lems, use acquired skills to collect meaningful data, and test findings from controlled laboratory studies in the more com\u00ad plex settings in which significant behaviors and events actu\u00ad ally occur. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem-oriented institutions and agencies, e.g., Orange County Public Defender's Office, Orange County Social Services and Health Services Agency, city planning departments, and police departments. Other field study placements may be generated by faculty and students to fit their particular interests. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis. Further information on field study, including information about sign-up procedures, may be obtained from the Social Ecology Counseling Office. Career Opportunities. Graduates of the Program in Social Ecology bring a distinctive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The Program provides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in planning departments, men\u00ad tal health settings, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also use\u00ad ful for careers in management and personnel. The Program also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administration, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociology, criminology, and urban planning. Further informa\u00ad tion on career and graduate school preparation can be found in the Sample Programs section on page 221. Major Subareas Environmental Analysis The Environmental Analysis subarea is concerned with the impact of the physical environment on human health and behavior. Students begin with basic courses in human ecol-ogy, environmental quality, environmental psychology, urban sociology, and planning and public policy. Subsequent course work moves toward problem-oriented courses in these areas, enriched by ongoing faculty and student research on such topics as the effects of environmental stressors (e.g., crowd\u00ad ing, smog, noise); the biology and politics of water pollution; compliance with environmental regulations; the way in which economic changes in a community affect the health and well\u00ad being of its residents; the psychological determinants of the decision to have children; the effects of stress on health; and the social effects of urbanization. In addition to providing basic knowledge for students in other areas, courses are relevant to professional careers in the areas of administration, environmental quality and health, environmental impact assessment, and community environmental education. Graduate and professional oppor\u00ad tunities related to environmental analysis include urban and regional planning, architecture, environmental psychology, ecology, public health, and urban sociology. Special emphasis is placed upon the roles of individual citizens and community organizations, both governmental and private, in maintaining and enhancing the quality of the human environment. Field study is done in 10 California city planning departments, the offices of private architectural firms, environmental informa\u00ad tion centers, pollution control agencies, and health agencies. Criminal Justice The Criminal Justice subarea is concerned with the social control of criminality and violence and with the relationship between society and its legal institutions, including prisons and the courts. Basic courses cover forms of criminal behav\u00ad ior and introduce the student to the criminal justice system. Subsequent course work is complemented by ongoing faculty and student research on such topics as the determinants of police decisions to shoot; characteristics of persons and of situations which promote intervention by \"good Samaritans\" at the scene of crimes; violence against women; the control of delinquency through family counseling and crisis interven\u00ad tion; the analysis of court decisions; and the deterrence of criminal behavior, including white collar and corporate crime. The Criminal Justice subarea provides Social Ecology stu\u00ad dents with opportunities to examine critical issues in regard to criminal and delinquent behavior and society's reaction to crime. The course of study prepares students for careers in law enforcement and corrections, as well as for law school and other graduate programs, including criminology and sociology. Offerings examine social problems that involve crime and society's reactions to these problems, and assess the organization and operation of the criminal justice system as it now functions. Field study placements are available in police departments, public defenders' offices, probation and parole agencies, consumer affairs agencies, the state juvenile detention system, the UCI College Legal Clinic, and in pri\u00ad vate legal firms. Social Behavior The Social Behavior subarea is concerned with the relation\u00ad ship between the social environment and human behavior. The central objective is to study variations in social settings (e.g., the family, school, work place) that have implications for healthy and unhealthy development over the course of the life cycle. Students begin with basic course work in human development, social psychology, community psychol\u00ad ogy, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work, enriched by research, examines such topics as the treatment UC IRVINE - 1983-1984of childhood hyperactivity; social and economic factors asso\u00ad ciated with child abuse; influences on adolescents' psychologi\u00ad cal and social development; the role of social support (family and friendship networks) in moderating stressful life events; the social ties of the elderly; the evaluation of social pro\u00ad grams; and effects of stress on mental health. Students are given a foundation which will enable them to work after graduation from UCI in the private or public sec\u00ad tors or to do graduate work in psychology, human develop\u00ad ment, social work, counseling, or education. Approximately 50 agencies are available for field study in this subarea, including schools, child care facilities, community clinics, counseling centers, hospital settings, and social service agencies. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. Social Ecology Requirements Social Ecology 1 (Principles of Social Ecology) and 10 (Re\u00ad search Design); J4 (Introduction to Criminal Justice), E8 (Introduction to Environmental Analysis), and 59 (Introduc\u00ad tion to Human Behavior); required prerequisite courses for field study in a given subarea; Social Ecology 197 A (Applied Learning in Field Settings) followed by two quarters of field study (E197, 5197, or J197), to be elected during the junior and senior years; and 10 upper-division courses (those num\u00ad bered 100-196) from Program offerings. In order to remain in good standing and be eligible for grad\u00ad uation from the Program in Social Ecology, a student must attain the following: a grade point average of 2.0 in all re\u00ad quired lower-division Social Ecology courses (SE10, SE1, ]4, E8, 59), a grade point average of 2.0 in all required upper\u00ad division courses, 10 chosen from courses numbered 100-196, 197 A, and eight units of field study. Planning a Program of Study As noted earlier, students who major in Social Ecology do not limit themselves to a single subarea of interest. Rather, they are encouraged to develop an appreciation of a wide array of person-environment problems. The strongest program of study also will include basic course work in at least one of the social, biological, or physical sciences. Students who enter the major as freshmen should plan to complete the required lower-division courses by the end of the junior year. Transfer students and students who declare a major in Social Ecology after entering UCI should work with the Social Ecology Counseling Office to develop a plan for meeting the requirements of the major in an orderly fashion. The Social Ecology Counseling Office is prepared to help all students in planning a program of study. Contact with this Office is important so that students will develop a broad, yet coherent, series of courses. Students who expect to pursue graduate study should consult also with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation.

Students who plan to obtain a teaching credential or a higher degree in the field of education should consult with counselors in the Office of Teacher Education early in their college careers. Students completing a 6.A. in Social Ecology may qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Cre\u00ad dential Examination. Social Ecology courses that are relevant to a career in education include: teaching credentials, see page 232. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Students who are interested in a career in administration and who have completed all of the course requirementsfor the B.A. in Social Ecology and the UCI breadth requirement may apply to the Graduate School of Management for their 3-2 Program. Application should be made early in the junior year. During their senior year, Program participants will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 total units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the conclusion of four years of undergraduate study, a B.A. degree will be awarded by the Program in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. A Master's degree in Business Administration, Public Administration, or Business and Public Administration will be awarded after successful completion of all requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. Concentration in Women's Studies Two options of study are offered: (A) Humanities SOA-B-C, four upper-divison women's studies courses (two in Humani\u00ad ties and two in Social Sciences or Social Ecology), which could include Social Sciences 183, and a senior paper or seminar; or (B) Social Sciences 183A-B, four upper-division women's studies courses (two in Humanities and two in Social Sciences or Social Ecology), excluding Social Sciences 183, and a senior paper or seminar. Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology The Program in Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sciences offer a program of undergraduate instruction lead\u00ad ing to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology. The interdisciplinary curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate foundation for students interested in advanced study in environmental plan\u00ad ning and resource management. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science back\u00ad ground contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdiscipli\u00ad nary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for stu\u00ad dents to specialize in an area of their choice. Careers in Applied Ecology Careers in the fields of environmental and resource man\u00ad agement and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology background. Many graduates hold technical or admin\u00ad istrative positions in, for example, the United States Envi\u00ad ronmental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Depart\u00ad ment of Fish and Game, and Department of Health and Human Services; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, labora\u00ad tory analyses, and planning studies. Industrial health profes\u00ad sionals are in demand to help determine the safety or work\u00ad place environments for the labor force. The Applied Ecology major also provides a strong academic foundation for gradu\u00ad ate or professional study in areas such as conservation and natural resources, environmental health science, microbiol\u00ad ogy, public health, law, planning, and administration. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984The Applied Ecology major provides students with a compre\u00ad hensive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering offered by the School of Engineering. Also, students are encouraged to explore the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, offered by the School of Biological Sciences. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Applied Ecology University Requirements: See page 42; the Applied Ecology degree combines breadth and major requirements. Applied Ecology Requirements The University breadth requirements are incorporated within the Applied Ecology curriculum; no additional coursework is required to complete the breadth (general education) require\u00ad ments. All of the Applied Ecology requirements must be taken for a grade (except field study). Students must main\u00ad tain a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in Applied Ecology lower-and upper-division courses, as well as a grade point average of 2.0 in all courses taken at UCI. Each student must fulfill the following general, field study, and elective requirements: General: Mathematics 2A, 28, and 7; or Mathematics 2A, 28, and Social Ecology 10; Humanities 1A, 18, 1C (lectures and discussions), plus any course approved to meet the upper\u00ad division writing requirement.

Environmental and E2o, E89, Eno, E113, Program of Study It is important that students take the required science courses early, in order that the science background may be utilized in the Social Ecology courses. There are many required courses, and the student must plan carefully. For initial academic advising, students.should consult the Social Ecology Counseling Office (544 Engineering Building) or the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Faculty academic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological Sciences faculty members. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984224 Social Ecology Graduate Program in Social Ecology The Program in Social Ecology offers graduate education leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Students desiring a Ph.D. should apply directly for the Ph.D. program. Only individuals interested in the M.A. as their final degree in Social Ecology should apply for admis\u00ad sion at the Master's level. The emphasis in Social Ecology graduate study is primarily upon theory and research which have implications for policy and social action. Clinical training is not offered. All applicants for either the M.A. or Ph.D. should submit undergraduate transcripts, three letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test scores, and a formal application to the Division of Grad\u00ad uate Studies and Research before February 1. Interested per\u00ad sons may call the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor, Jan Martin (714) 856-5917, for further information. The Program in Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and physical envi\u00ad ronment. Problems are researched from the diversified view\u00ad points of a multidisciplinary faculty, including specialists in community, environmental, social, developmental, and health psychology; planning; urban sociology; law; criminology; and environmental health. Graduate education emphasizes this multidisciplinary orientation rather than the focused perspec\u00ad tive of a single discipline. Social Ecology is committed to an empirical approach. Pro\u00ad gram evaluation, legal research, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi\u00ad experimental techniques are emphasized as much as labora\u00ad tory experimentation. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes, but is not limited to, human stress, psychosocial aspects of physical and emotional health, program evaluation, economic change and behavioral disorders, atypical child development, effects of employment on adolescent social and cognitive development and adult well-being, police use of deadly force, legal sanctions and deterrence, white collar crime, effects of the physical environment upon social behav\u00ad ior and health, childbearing decisions, urban decentralization, social support systems among the elderly, water quality, air quality, the use of scientific information in public policy for\u00ad mation, and environmental regulatory processes. A predoc\u00ad toral and postdoctoral training program, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, emphasizing the rela\u00ad tions among environmental demands, human development, and health, commenced in fall 1981. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important component of graduate education in Social Ecology. Prospec\u00ad tive graduate students should contact the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor for more detailed information concern\u00ad ing the current research interests of Social Ecology faculty members. M.A. Program Each incoming Master's student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student discusses an individual program of graduate education. The program leading to the M.A. degree requires a thesis and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), and at least one addi\u00ad tional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's aca\u00ad demic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. The seven required courses must include at least five graduate courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or thesis courses (298, 299, or 295). One four-unit field study (297) course may be counted as one of the seven required courses. A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty committee. All M.A. students who have not advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each academic year. At that time the faculty may recommend that the student con\u00ad tinue toward the M.A. or cease study in the Program. Eval\u00ad uation of M.A. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's Master's thesis committee. One year of academic residence is required, but completion of all M.A. requirements, including a thesis approved by the student's committee, ordinarily takes about two years. The M.A. degree in Social Ecology may be useful in obtaining a variety of positions. Many recent M.A. graduates are now employed in federal, state, county, city, and private agencies in such areas as planning, mental health and welfare, and probation and parole. A number of students with the Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology have entered Ph.D. programs at other universities. Ph.D. Program The doctoral program offers advanced training that prepares students for research and teaching positions. Graduates also may be particularly qualified for positions with private or governmental agencies where they can bring advanced aca\u00ad demic training, insight, and expertise to bear in such areas as environmental quality, urban planning, criminal justice, and functional and dysfunctional social development. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree in four to five years. Each incoming Ph.D. student will be assigned a faculty advi\u00ad sor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to discuss an individualized program of graduate edu\u00ad cation. Required for all Ph.D. students are: Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), two approved quar\u00ad ters of graduate-level statistics, Program Evaluation (291) or Social Epidemiology (224), and Issues in Social Interventions (213). In addition to these six required core courses, doctoral stu\u00ad dents must also complete a minimum of six other approved graduate level courses before advancement to candidacy. These six additional required courses are exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or dissertation research courses (297, 298, 299, or 296). Students may take each of their electives within a different substantive area or may take clusters of courses within fewer subareas. Among the substantive areas in which multiple electives are offered are: Environmental Sociology (SE202, SE254). Several specialized courses on survey research, theory development, statistics, and teaching are offered (SE214, SE260, SE261, SE264A-B, SE290A-B). In UC IRVINE - 1983-1984addition, courses which may be applicable to a student's sub\u00ad area are offered by other academic units on the campus (e.g., Graduate School of Management, School of Social Sciences, School of Biological Sciences). All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D., complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the Program. Evaluation of Ph.D. students advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's doctoral dissertation commit\u00ad tee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D., each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. All Ph.D. students are required to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The method of research may include experiments, questionnaire and sur\u00ad vey studies, systematic field observation, computer simula\u00ad tion, etc. It is expected that students will begin this project during their first year in residence and that it will be com\u00ad pleted during the second year. The written report of the proj\u00ad ect may be equivalent to a Master's thesis and may be sub\u00ad mitted as such if the student has been advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree. Also, before being officially advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., doctoral students must demonstrate mastery of one or more research areas within Social Ecology. Accordingly, stu\u00ad dents are required to submit a written analysis of a social/en\u00ad vironmental problem relevant to one or more disciplines within Social Ecology. The prequalifying requirement can be completed through alternative written formats including a comprehensive examination or the submission of a manu\u00ad script (or series of papers) which intensively examines specific research issues. Preferably, the perspective taken should be interdisciplinary, but a unidisciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to the student's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a committee of three Social Ecology faculty members. Students are encouraged to assemble and meet with this committee as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so by no later than the third quarter of their second year. Once the student's plans have been approved and implemented, the examining com\u00ad mittee will meet with the individual to determine his or her success in meeting the breadth requirement, and to recom\u00ad mend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Dean on behalf of the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The disserta\u00ad tion plan will include a thorough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation; its current status; the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge; a detailed specification of the proposed method of approach to the problem; and a description of the planned methods for analyzing research findings. Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. will be made by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon recom\u00ad mendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alternatively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee will be appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, Social Ecology 225 ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doctoral dis\u00ad sertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy.

Tohoku University, japan, Visiting Lecturer of Electrirnl Engineerillg (solid state devices) The School of Engineering offers undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate programs of study for men and women who will engage in the professional practice of engineering as it relates to design, development, research, other engineering functions, and teaching in industry, government, or a university. Pro\u00ad grams at all levels emphasize the fundamentals underlying engineering, thus enabling the graduates to continue profes\u00ad sional development through formal or informal study. Thus, programs of study in the School of Engineering endeavor to provide UCI graduates with adequate intellectual tools for entrance into the profession and for continued renewal of their technical knowledge. At the undergraduate level a single program in Engineering is offered with options in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering, all of which are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (formerly the Engi\u00ad neers' Council for Professional Development). In addition, an undergraduate combined program of Environmental Engi\u00ad neering in conjunction with either the Civil Engineering or the Mechanical Engineering option is available. Courses in computer engineering and digital systems are offered in the Electrical Engineering option. Courses in com\u00ad puter science are offered by the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS). Students of high achievement can declare a double major in Engineering and ICS. Early consultation with the School on this and other double-major programs, such as the one with Biological Sciences or the 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management, is advisable. The Engineering program provides a firm background in the basic sciences through courses in physics, mathematics, and chemistry; a fundamental understanding of the engineering sciences through required basic engineering courses; and spe\u00ad cialization via technical electives. The breadth requirement must be taken in the areas of Humanistic Inquiry, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Writing. It is not uncommon for engineering students to need more than four years to obtain their B.S. degree, particularly if part\u00ad time employment or major extracurricular activities make heavy demands on their time. Occasionally students can catch up by enrolling in summer sessions at UCI or, with prior permission, at other institutions. At the graduate level, programs of study provide more choice. The M.S. program requires 36 units to be completed, but the exact selection of the courses will be formulated through consultation between the student and the faculty advisor. Thesis and nonthesis programs are available. At the Ph.D. level the program is still less structured but more spe\u00ad cialized than at the M.S. level. There is no set course requirement; rather; students must demonstrate various competencies as they progress toward the completion of their doctoral programs. Engineering students may join any of a number of student organizations. Most of these organizations are professionally oriented and have relationships to national engineering socie\u00ad ties. A primary function of these groups is to provide regular technical and social meetings for students with common interests. Most of them also participate in the annual Engi\u00ad neering Week activities, held each February, and in other School functions. There are student chapters of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Mechani\u00ad cal Engineers (ASME), the Institute of Electrical and Elec\u00ad tronic Engineers (IEEE), the Mexican-American Engineering Society (MAES), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and the honorary engineering societies Tau Beta Pi and Eta Kappa Nu. Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving per\u00ad sonnel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all students are encour\u00ad aged and expected to participate in the development of School policy. Student evaluation of the quality of instruction is made each quarter. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Degrees Engineering ............................ B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of Engi\u00ad neering are awarded on the basis of grade point average, and service to the School, service to the University, service to the community, or achievement in research projects. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Approximately 1 percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum /nude, 3 percent magna cum /nude, and 8 percent cum /nude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. Additional awards in other categories are made throughout the academic year. Undergraduate Program The undergraduate program leads to a B.S. degree in Engi\u00ad neering, with accredited options in Civil Engineering, Electri\u00ad cal Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering. A double option of Environmental Engineering in conjunction with either the Civil Engineering or Mechanical Engineering option may be obtained by satisfying the appropriate double option requirements. Admissions Students should plan to enter the Engineering program at UCI as freshmen or as juniors. The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year also make it imperative that students begin their studies in a fall quarter. Applicants wishing to be admitted for the fall quarter, 1984 must have submitted their completed application forms before December 1, 1983. High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering program are advised to have completed four years of English, four years of mathematics, and one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation is fundamental to success in the Engineering program and is vital to receiving first considera\u00ad tion for admittance to the Engineering major during periods of restricted enrollments, as are honors courses and advanced placement courses. Special attention will also be given to applicants who have submitted their SAT scores and three Achievement Test Scores by January 2, 1984. Applicants should designate Engineering as their intended mn}or. Along with their major they should also designate an option, such as civil, electrical or mechanical. Changing an option subsequent to admission is difficult (currently transfers into Civil and Mechanical Engineering less difficult than into Electrical Engineering). If enrollment limitations make it necessary, some freshman applications may be redirected to another UC campus which can still accommodate freshman Engineering applicants. As an option, freshman applicants subject to redirection can ask for admission to a special two-year program offered by the Physics Department at UC Riverside. Completing this pro\u00ad gram with at least a 2.80 grade point average guarantees transfer to the UCI School of Engineering as a junior into the option originally applied for. Trmzsfer sludf111s can be admitted to the School of Engineering upon completion of a lower-division program elsewhere at UCI or at another college, including community colleges. Students seeking admission to the School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission to advanced standing and must have completed appropriate prerequisites for the junior-level courses to be undertaken in the School. These Engineering 237 include courses equivalent to Writing 39A-B; Mathematics 2A-B-C and 3A-B-D; Engineering 10; and six science courses with laboratories selected from Physics SA-B-C-0-E, Chem\u00ad istry 61A-B (or Chemistry lA-B-C). (The typical equivalent at most colleges is a three-or four-semester physics sequence plus a two-semester chemistry sequence, each for majors in those fields. Students planning to study electrical engineering at UCI need a course in modern physics that is equivalent to UCI Physics SO. If the student's physics preparation did not include such a course, Physics SO can, subsequently, be taken at UCI.) Completion of these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission to the UCI Engineering program, because enrollment limitations in various categories of Engi\u00ad neering may dictate selection based on ranking by academic proficiency. For instance, transfer applicants planning to begin their junior year at UCI in the fall of 1983 were required to have grade point averages ranging from near 3.0 to 3.S, depending on whether they asked to be admitted into Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical Engineering, in order of increasing program impaction. Transfer students satisfying the Statewide Articulation Agreement on Lower-Division Engineering Requirements (California Community Colleges-California State Universi\u00ad ties-University of California) may complete the remaining requirements for the B.S. degree in six quarters at UCI, pro\u00ad vided one or two designated courses are taken in summer session prior fo entry. All transfer students should arrange for early consultation with the School's Undergraduate Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office so that a smooth transition can be planned. Recall the earlier note that it is not uncommon for engineering students-even those who have started as fresh\u00ad men at UCI-to spend more than four years to obtain the B.S. degree. Advising Academic advising is available from faculty advisors, aca\u00ad demic counselors, and peer advisors. Freshmen and sopho\u00ad mores will find that most of their questions can be answered by the counselors, who also approve their programs of study, and by the peer advisors in the School's Office of Under\u00ad graduate Student Affairs. Juniors and seniors should consult regularly with their faculty advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 42. School Requirements Credit for at least 180 quarter units composed of: Engineering Courses: Eighty-four units including: a) E10, 70, 80, and 101, for a total of 13 units. b) Engineering courses and technical electives-an option\u00ad dependent selection of 71 units, including at most 10 units at the lower-division level. Technical electives are courses in engineering (except E190) and, by petition, courses in com\u00ad puter science, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biological sciences, which are designed for majors in the respective fields. Courses taken in satisfaction of the breadth require\u00ad ments in humanistic inquiry, social and behavioral sciences, or writing (such as E190) may not be counted as technical electives. I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984238 Engineering Consult programs of study forCE, EE, and ME program requirements. If none of the accredited options is followed, the entire segment of 71 units must be approved by the Undergraduate Studies Committee. Such programs are not accredited by ABET. Mathematic of the fol\u00ad lowing courses (including laboratories): Physics SA-B-C-0-E, Chemistry 61A-B, and Biological Sciences 102. It is recom\u00ad mended that Engineering students take more than this min\u00ad imum and complete both the Physics 5 and Chemistry 61 sequences. Breadth Courses: Thirty-six units-approved three-course clusters in (a) Humanistic Inquiry, (b) Social and Behavioral Sciences, and (c) Writing. At least one Writing course, such as Engineering 190, must be taken at the upper-division level. See pages 40-41 for the list of other approved courses. Note that the remaining breadth requirements stated there are sat\u00ad isfied by the courses in Mathematics and Basic Sciences speci\u00ad fied above. Free Electives: Six units in any university-level academic courses. An exception is made with physical education and remedial courses which, while counting as part of a student's quarterly work load, are not applied to the 180 units required for the B.S. degree in Engineering. Duplication of Subject Material: Students who take courses which involve considerable duplication of subject material may not receive full graduation credit for all units thus completed. Residence Requirement: In addition to the University resi\u00ad dence requirement, at least 36 upper-division engineering units specified by each option must be completed successfully at the University of California. Variations: Variations from the degree requirements may be made subject to the approval of the faculty of the School. Students wishing to obtain variances should submit petitions to the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. Programs of Study A student who wishes to graduate from one of the accredited options-Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering-should select the engineering and basic science courses listed in the respective program of study. Additional information on opportunities within each option is available from faculty advisors and academic counselors, who will also advise stu\u00ad dents on selection of courses. Students must realize, how\u00ad ever, that they alone are responsible for the planning of their own programs and for satisfactory completion of the gradua\u00ad tion requirements. Students may substitute courses of their choosing for those required if they can substantiate the merits of the program of study and obtain the approval of the faculty of the School. Students are cautioned about the structure of prerequisites which underlies most engineering courses. The sample pro\u00ad grams shown here constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students are expected to complete Engineering 10 and two courses in English writing during the freshman year. There\u00ad after, proficiency in computing (using FORTRAN) and writ\u00ad ing is expected in all Engineering courses, whether explicitly stated so as a prerequisite or not. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in cer\u00ad tain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are the breadth courses, except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI Writing Requirement; any free electives; and any courses not submitted as fulfilling the graduation requirement (including technical electives beyond the number required). Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the ap\u00ad proval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves laboratory exercises, the student may be required to perform experiments as well as to take a written examination. The proficiency examination is not available for any course a student has taken before (or has audited) at UCI. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Engineering 239 Programs for Accredited Options Typical programs for the accredited options in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering are shown below. While the course sequence may be changed if there is sufficient reason, students should keep in mind that the programs are based on a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Students who are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes for other reasons, must have their programs approved by their advisors.

Consult CE, EE, and ME curriculum guides for further details and for information on available specializations, including double options and double majors. I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984240 Engineering Double Options for Environmental Engineering A significant feature of these double options is the provision for the broad interdisciplinary education necessary to deal with contemporary environmental engineering problems. The student may obtain the Environmental Engineering option from one of two possible paths-from either the Civil Engineering or Mechanical Engineering option-by satisfying additional course work from the Environmental Engineering core. By suitable choice of the courses taken as electives in either the Civil or Mechanical Engineering option, a student may complete most of the requirements for the second option in Environmental Engineering as part of the process of meeting the basic requirements for the B.S. degree in Engi\u00ad neering. Specifically, the double option requirement can be satisfied by either of the following: Civil and Environmental Engineering In addition to the requirements in the Civil Engineering option, the student must successfully complete six courses from the following Engineering group: E 166; CE 161, 162; ME 110, 115, 118, 119, 120, 124, 162, 164, 169. Mechanical and Environmental Engineering In addition to the requirements in the Mechanical Engineer\u00ad ing option, the student must successfully complete six courses from the following Engineering group: E 166; CE 120, 161, 162, 172, 173; ME 110, 118, 119, 124, 162, 164, 169. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding UCI undergraduate Engineering students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management whose admissions requirements include the Graduate Management Admission Test (see page 254). Stu\u00ad dents in this Program will complete their first three years in the School of Engineering. The fourth year will be taken jointly in the School of Engineering and the Graduate School of Management and will lead to a B.S. degree in Engineering. The final year will be spent entirely in the Graduate School of Management and will lead to a Master's degree in Business Administration, Public Administration, or a combination of Business and Public Administration. Students wishing to enter the 3-2 Program should consult with both the School of Engineering and the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the junior year. Please note that the 3-2 Program may take longer than five years if students deviate from the prescribed joint program of study. Undergraduate Acceleration toward the M.S. Degree in Engineering Exceptionally promising seniors may, with permission of the Undergraduate Study Committee, take graduate-level Engi\u00ad neering courses in addition to the undergraduate degree requirements. After attaining the B.S. degree and upon acceptance to the M.S. program in Engineering, the student may petition for application of up to eight units of excess credit toward the M.S. degree. If the petition is approved by the School and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, the student could complete the M.S. degree in three quarters of residence as a graduate student even while serving as a teaching or research assistant. Graduate Program Graduate study is offered leacling to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The graduate program has concen\u00ad trations in civil, electrical, mechanical, and environmental engineering. Civil engineering focuses upon structural mechanics; transportation, planning, and urban systems; and water resources. The concentration in electrical engineering includes electronics, electro-acoustics and electro-optics, digital systems, telecommunications, control systems, and electric energy systems. Mechanical engineering specialties include heat transfer, fluid dynamics, materials, combustion, solar energy, and atmospheric processes. Environmental engineering is an interdisciplinary concentration with a focus on water quality, air resources, environmental impact, and occupational health and safety. Studies in operations research can be carried out through interdisciplinary courses offered by several academic units. Admissions For information on requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, see page 65. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those pos\u00ad sessing a B.S. degree in Engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic level, they will be admitted to full graduate standing. Those ad\u00ad mitted from an allied field may be required to take supple\u00ad mentary upper-division courses in basic engineering subjects. The Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test is required of all applicants. Master of Science in Engineering The M.S. degree is normally attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis, or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. For the M.S. degree with thesis, a minimum of 36 approved units is required, of which at least 20 must be nonresearch grad\u00ad uate units (courses numbered 200-289). A maximum of eight M.S. thesis research units (296) may be submitted. The M.S. thesis must demonstrate the student's capability of undertak\u00ad ing an original study and carrying it through to a conclusion satisfactory to at least three members of the faculty. For the M.S. degree with comprehensive examination, a minimum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 24 must be nonresearch graduate units (numbered 200-289). In Electrical Engineering the comprehensive examination takes the form of a core course program (see Graduate Courses in Electrical Engineering). The detailed program of study for each M.S. student is formulated in consultation with an advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate and the specific requirements of the School. Stu\u00ad dents should acquaint themselves with core course require\u00ad ments in the various concentrations of the M.S. program. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. Full-time students should be able to complete the requirements for the M.S. degree in three to four quarters. Part-Time Study Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since University residence requirements necessitate the suc\u00ad cessful completion of a minimum number of units in gradu\u00ad ate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, the part-time student should seek the advice of the graduate student counselor in the School of Engineering and the approval of the chair of the appropriate program (CE, EE, or ME). M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students taking courses in University Extension should consult the section on Transfer of Courses below. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Transfer of Courses Upon petition a limited number of grndunte-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the University, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work undertaken in another Graduate Division of the University, transfer credit will not be applied to the minimum required units in 200-series courses. For further information, see page 68. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory committee which takes into consideration the objec\u00ad tives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty of the School; passage of the preliminary examination assess\u00ad ing the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral program; satisfaction of the teaching requirements required of all doctoral students; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy; completion of a significant research investigation; and preparation and defense of an acceptable dissertation. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Financial aid, such as research and teaching as\u00ad sistantships, is available.

(Master of Public Administration), M.B.P.A. (Master of Business and Public Administration), and to the Ph.D. degree in Administration. The undergraduate Concentration is designed for those who wish to gain some insight into issues of modern management, as well as those who anticipate future graduate work in Management. The Master's degrees are professional in nature; the Ph.D. in Administration is for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. The Master's programs are intended to provide future man\u00ad agers with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and in management tools and techniques. Each student in the Mas\u00ad ter's program focuses upon an institutional area and may develop expertise in one or more functional specializations. The Ph.D. program for the field of administration has aca\u00ad demic and research objectives. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Mas\u00ad ter's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of pre\u00ad vious academic work, statements of purpose, and letters of recommendation). The University admission standard of a 3.0 or better undergraduate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) is required. The minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a For\u00ad eign Language) score acceptable for study at GSM is 570. Requests for application material should be addressed to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. Master's Degrees GSM admits students for study leading to the Master's degrees in the fall quarter. The deadline for completion of all phases of the application procedure is June I. In addition to the general University rules governing admission to graduate study, GSM normally requires the following: I. Those applicants seeking to be admitted to the M.B.A. program are required to take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). Applicants interested in pursuing the M.P.A. or M.B.P.A. degrees are also encouraged to take the GMAT, but may substitute the Graduate Record Exami\u00ad nation (GRE) for GMAT. 2. College-level mathematics including calculus and a course in probability theory. Applicants without adequate mathemat\u00ad ical preparation may be admitted with the condition that they complete preliminary courses with a grade of B or better. These courses should be completed by fall quarter, but no later than the end of the second quarter in residence. Under\u00ad graduate courses in both the social sciences (e.g., economics, political science, psychology, sociology) and information and computer sciences are strongly recommended. The Ph.D. GSM admits students for the Ph.D. in the fall quarter; admission for a quarter other than fall will be considered under exceptional circumstances. Deadline for application is May I. The Ph.D. program requires a commitment to full\u00ad time study. In addition to the other requirements, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to submit a previously prepared paper (research report, Master's thesis, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilities. Educational Objectives Three basic premises underlie the School's philosophy of generic graduate education. First, there are significant phe\u00ad nomena and problems common to business, educational, and governmental organizations; second, a common set of disci\u00ad plines, concepts, techniques, and technologies exist which are appropriate to a wide range of organizational or scholarly roles; third, many administrators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is expected that all degree candidates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: General Knowledge. The broad context of organizations and management; the late twentieth century (significant trends, conditions, and problems); history of science, scientific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, political, and social analysis. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations. Basic concepts of management; the structure and functions of organizations, including comparative analysis and inter\u00ad organizational relations; levels and units of decision making; individual behavior and group norms; operating environ\u00ad ments of organizations. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administration. In-depth study of specific institutional environments for administrative practice, such as governmental and business organizations, and other types of organizations. Mathematics and Statistics. As tools of precise reasoning, as languages which will tend more and more to dominate pro\u00ad fessional and scholarly literature, and above all, as founda\u00ad tions for relevant quantitative methods. Technical Bases of Management. Decision processes; opera\u00ad tions research; systems and policy analysis; budgeting and accounting techniques; personnel policies; techniques for measuring and affecting attitudes and behavior; research design and strategies. Management Information Systems. Computer technology, information sciences, and basic computer applications. General Skills. Political skills, effective management of inter\u00ad personal relations, leadership strategies and tactics, and com\u00ad petence in oral, graphic, and written expression. Professional Orientations. Identification of factors, values, and policies which might bear on successful, responsible, and intellectually honest performance of organizational roles. Recognition of the administrator's potential contributions to society and of ethical and moral problems which arise from social research and the management of human enterprises. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Undergraduate Concentration in Management Studies The GSM faculty and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies in cooperation with the various schools, departments, and pro\u00ad grams on campus, offer an undergraduate Concentration in Management Studies. The Concentration consists of seven courses: three Core courses that are required of all students in the Concentration, and four electives, two chosen from among GSM upper-division courses and two selected from specified upper-division courses in other schools on campus. Admission to the Concentration is in fall quarter only. Stu\u00ad dents must be sophomores at the time of applying and must have a minimum 3.0 grade point average both overall and in prerequisite courses. All prerequisite courses must be com\u00ad pleted prior to fall 1984. Only 75 students will be admitted each year, and the selection will be based primarily on grade point average and a statement of purpose. Application dead\u00ad line is May 1; students may pick up applications, and further information, from the Graduate School of Management Office, 318 Social Science Tower. Prerequisite Courses The following courses are prerequisites for admission to the undergraduate Concentration, and must be completed prior to falll984: Social Sciences 12A and 12B (Basic Economic Theory) Lower-division writing requirement Information and Computer Science lA (Programming and Problem Solving) or Engineering 10 (Computational Methods in Engineering) A one-quarter course selected from Social Sciences 6A, 6B, or 6C (introduction to Political Science); 7 (Introduction toPsy\u00ad chology); 8 (introduction to Sociology); or Social Ecology 59 (Introduction to Human Behavior) Management lOA (introductory Calculus) (or equivalent) Management lOB (introductory Probability) (or equivalent) Transfer students should check with their college counselor for established equivalencies for these prerequisite courses. Concentration Core Courses The first year of the undergraduate Concentration in Man\u00ad agement Studies consists of the following three Core courses: Management 180 (Managing in Contemporary Organizations), Management 181 (Managing Organizational Behavior), and Management 183 (Managerial Decision Making). Concentration Elective Courses Four electives complete the Concentration curriculum; two must be selected from the following GSM upper-division courses, and the other two must be selected from the list of approved electives available in the GSM Office, 318 Social Science Tower. GSM Undergraduate Elective Courses (select two) Management 160 (introduction to Public Administration) Management 185 (Introduction to Managerial Accounting) Management 186 (introduction to M<!nagerial Finance) Management 187 (Introduction to Marketing) Only students admitted into the Concentration will be allowed to enroll in GSM upper-division courses. In establishing the GSM undergraduate Concentration in Management Studies, the faculty anticipated three types of students drawn to courses in administration: (1) students who wish to learn about the administration of organizations Management 253 as a way of gaining appreciation for a significant aspect of the culture, (2) students preparing for careers in other fields that require some knowledge of administration but not a high concentration in the field, and (3) students who expect to go on to graduate work in administration and who wish early guidance and undergraduate work appropriate to this career objective. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the two-year Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree from the Uni\u00ad versity of California or another institution, outstanding UCI undergraduate students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram with GSM and all other campus units. Acceptance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advance admission to the gradu\u00ad ate program. Such students complete their undergraduate major requirements by the end of the junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit require\u00ad ments, and at the same time apply toward their graduate degrees. Successful completion of the requirements in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the coop\u00ad erating discipline after the fourth year, and an M.B.A., M.B.P.A., or M.P.A. degree after the fifth year. The ability to complete both degrees in five years may vary by academic program. Students should consult with their academic coun\u00ad selor in their major School for further information about completing undergraduate requirements in three years. Stu\u00ad dents contemplating entering such a program should contact the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of the junior year, for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergradu\u00ad ates will be enrolled in GSM grnduate-level courses. Master's Degree Programs The Graduate School of Management offers three Master's degrees: the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration), the M.F.A. (Master of Public Administration), and the M.B.P.A. (Master of Business and Public Administration). All three require a minimum of 23 quarter courses (92 units) with a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 in the Core and overall. The Master's degree programs normally take two full aca\u00ad demic years or their equivalent in part-time registration. Students with substantial personal or professional commit\u00ad ments normally take two courses per quarter and are required to complete the Master's degree in no more than four years. To accommodate the needs of these students, GSM offers a number of courses each quarter during the late afternoon and evening hours (after 4:00p.m.). There is no thesis required. The courses in the Master's degree programs are divided into three groups, each group designed to achieve specific educational objectives. The courses are divided as fol\u00ad lows: Tier I, Common Core Courses, which are required of all Master's degree students; Tier II B courses, which are required for the M.B.A. degree; and Tier II P courses, which are required for the M.P.A. degree. For the M.B.P.A. degree, the student is required to take all of Tier II Band II P courses. The balance of the minimum required 23 courses will consist of electives. Master's students select electives to emphasize educational and career goals and interests. I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984254 Management Tier I Common Core Courses The first group consists of 10 Core courses (Tier I) taken by all Master's degree students. The Core has two fundamental aims: (1) to develop skills needed to select and use effectively the appropriate means, methods, and techniques for diagnos\u00ad ing and solving organizational problems; (2) to identify the significant concepts and phenomena associated with the study of complex organizations, and to bring to bear the rele\u00ad vant contributions of the core disciplines on the analysis of organizations and the administrative processes. Tier I Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Statistics for Management, Operations Research for Management, Organ\u00ad izational Analysis for Management, Accounting Information for Management, Microeconomics for Management, Macro\u00ad economics for Management, Political Analysis for Manage\u00ad ment, Computer and Information Systems for Management, Public/Private Interactions. Specialization in Business Management, Public Management, or Business and Public Management Students pursuing the M.B.A. are required to take all four Tier II B courses: Business Strategy, Marketing for Manage\u00ad ment, Corporate Finance, and Operations Management. Stu\u00ad dents pursuing the M.P.A. are required to take all four Tier II P courses: Public Policy Making, Public Policy Analysis, Public Financial Management, and Public Productivity Management. Students pursuing the M.B.P.A. are required to take all eight of the Tier II courses. Elective Courses The remaining coursework for the Master's degrees will con\u00ad sist of either nine additional electives for the M.B.A. or M.P.A. degrees, or five electives for the M.B.P.A. degree. The major emphasis in the elective courses will be to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of tech\u00ad nical tools and methods. The student will select the electives in light of the student's educational and career goals and interests. Management Internship Program To complement the academic curriculum of GSM, a Man\u00ad agement Internship Program provides practical application and work experience to selected GSM Master's students. Student interns are employed in administrative positions by local organizations. Course credit is available for participants in the Internship Program through the course \"Management Internship Seminar.\" GSM faculty and organizational repre\u00ad sentatives as well as student interns participate in this seminar which deals with specific topics and projects encoun\u00ad tered by the interns in their positions. Special Opportunities Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through two University-wide research units based on the Irvine campus. Through the Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) a student may participate in research on significant public policy issues. Current projects include a nationwide study of local government information systems. The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) conducts research in the areas of urban transportation policy and planning, transit management and labor relations, and trans\u00ad portation system evaluation. Students interested in these areas may have an opportunity to work on an ITS project. Doctor of Philosophy in Administration GSM offers the Ph.D. in Administration to students with backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. While a master's degree is preferred, students may be admitted to the doctoral program directly from the baccalaureate degree. There are many appropriate undergraduate majors, including (but not limited to) psychology, political science, business or public administration, mathematics, computer sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students with academic strengths in disciplines not usually considered as precursors for manage\u00ad ment (e.g., natural sciences, humanities, and the arts) are encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to pre\u00ad pare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organizational behavior, operations research, marketing, public policy, finance, business policy, or management information systems. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core disciplines as represented by the 14 core courses of the Master's degree program. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a dissertation demon\u00ad strating these skills. There are no foreign language require\u00ad ments in the GSM Ph.D. program. Although there is considerable variation in the length of time beyond a Master's degree needed to complete the Ph.D., a realistic range is three to five years. The Ph.D. program is divided into three phases: preliminary, qualification, and dissertation. The preliminary phase (which must be completed within six quarters) is designed to ensure that all Ph.D. students have a thorough knowledge of core materials, and knowledge of how to conduct research. In the qualification phase the student prepares for disserta\u00ad tion research in an area of specialization. This phase is com\u00ad pleted when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the candidacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research.

The primary activity of the Office is offering programs which lead to credentials required by those who teach, counsel, or administer in the public and private schools of California. A secondary activity of the Office is described later under Project Radius. Faculty associated with the Office of Teacher Education include distinguished scholars, researchers, and authors of national or international reputation. Most faculty have them\u00ad selves taught or served as administrators in public or private schools, and all have shown commitment to the continued improvement of education through the processes of profes\u00ad sional study, the development of new approaches to teaching, and the design or publication of innovative and scholarly courses of study. The Office of Teacher Education is organized around the credential programs it offers. Faculty members generally are associated with the credential program representing their areas of expertise and interest. The program provides oppor\u00ad tunities for interaction among students and faculty who share common interests. Credential Programs The Office of Teacher Education offers programs which lead to California teaching credentials as established by the Teacher Preparation and Licensing Law of 1970, known gen\u00ad erally as the Ryan Act. In addition, programs leading to two nonteaching credentials, the Pupil Personnel Services Cre\u00ad dential and the Administrative Services Credential, are offered. It is possible for a student concurrently to complete the requirements for a credential and to earn a graduate aca\u00ad demic degree. This requires admission to the Teacher Educa\u00ad tion program and the graduate program in which the degree will be sought. There are two basic teaching credentials in California: the Single Subject Credential and the Multiple Subject Creden\u00ad tial. They are called basic because all other teaching and most nonteaching credentials have one of these two credentials as prerequisites. Teaching credentials authorized by the 1970 credential law are not determined by grade level (i.e., elementary and secondary) but by the type of instructional situation (multiple or single subject). Each credential carries K-12 authorization. These credentials are awarded by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing upon recommendation of the UCI Office of Teacher Education and are required in order to teach or serve in a professional capacity in any public school in California. Single Subject Instruction Credential \"Single subject instruction\" means the practice of assignment of teachers to specified subject matter courses, as is com\u00ad monly practiced in California high schools and junior high schools. Teachers who are authorized for single subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach any subject in the authorized fields, at any grade level, but nor\u00ad mally in a departmentalized secondary school. UCJ is approved for this credential. Single Subject Instruction Cre\u00ad dentials are authorized by the State of California in art, busi\u00ad ness, English, history, home economics, industrial arts, for\u00ad eign languages, mathematics, music, physical education, social science, life science, physical science, agriculture, govern\u00ad ment, and health science. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984: Teacher Education 259 '~,\u00ad\u00a541' / UC IRVINE - 1983-1984260 Teacher Education Candidates who enroll in the Single Subject Credential pro\u00ad gram at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education 101; Education 102-the students enroll in the section of their major; Education 105B; Education 105LB; Education 162 (usually taken tion 173; Education 380. Sample Fifth-Year Program-Single Subject Credential Fall Ed 101 Winter Ed 320A, B Spring Ed 173 Ed 102 Ed 360 Ed 320C,D,E Ed 105B/LB Ed 380 Ed 174 Multiple Subject Instruction Credential \"Multiple subject instruction\" means the practice of assign\u00ad ment of teachers to multiple subject matter instruction, as is commonly practiced in California elementary schools. Teach\u00ad ers who are authorized for multiple subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach in any self-contained classroom: preschool, kindergarten, and grades 1-12 inclusive, but normally the assignment is in the elementary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Candidates who enroll in the Multiple Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education 105A; Education 105LA; Education llOA\u00ad B; Subject Credential Fall Ed 105A/LA Winter Ed 300A,B Spring Ed 173 Ed llOA/B Ed 360 Ed 300C,D,E Ed 174 Ed 380 Candidates desiring both Single and Multiple Subject Cre\u00ad dentials may apply the basic professional courses of Educa\u00ad tion 105A, 105LA, 173, 174, 360, and 380 toward both cre\u00ad dentials, but must complete Education 101, 102, llOA-B, do student teaching in both areas, and demonstrate competence by passing appropriate State-mandated subject field examina\u00ad tions where needed. Intern Teaching Credential Program Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the Multiple or Single Subject Credential. To hold an Intern Teaching Credential in a school district, the student must be enrolled as a postbaccalaureate student in the Office of Teacher Edu\u00ad cation. Teacher candidates are selected by participating schools and the University based on the background and experience of the teacher candidate, the needs of the particu\u00ad lar school, and the candidate's eligibility for the University's Teacher Education program. The stipend is paid by the school district. The number of internships varies from year to year. For further information see the intern secretary in the Office of Teacher Education. For the Special Education Intern Teach\u00ad ing Credential, see Specialist Credentials. Specialist Credentials The Specialist Credential authorizes teaching in the speciali\u00ad zation area at any grade level from preschool through grade 12. In order to qualify for this credential, the applicant must have a valid basic teaching credential (either the Single Sub\u00ad ject or Multiple Subject Credential) and complete a special\u00ad ized program of professional preparation in an approved pro-gram. In the State of California there are seven specialist credential categories: early childhood, bilingual/cross-cultural, mathematics, reading, agriculture, health science, and special education. UCI offers preparation for Specialist Credentials in early childhood education and in the special education areas of the learning handicapped, the physically handi\u00ad capped, and the severely handicapped. Students interested in the details about Specialist Credentials should make an appointment for program counseling with the academic ad\u00ad visor in the Office of Teacher Education. Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential. The Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential is a specialization beyond the basic Multiple Subject Instruction Credential. If the student can complete all the work, the student can obtain a preliminary teaching credential and an Early Childhood Specialist Credential with the B.A., but it is not likely. In nearly every instance it will be obtained as a result of the fifth-year program. Special Education Specialist Credentials. UCI is approved for three areas of the Special Education Specialist Credential: Learning Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, and Severely Handicapped. Special Education Intern Specialist Credential. UCI offers an intern teaching credential in each of its three approved areas in special education. The intern teacher becomes a teacher of record if the following requirements can be met: The student must be enrolled in the UCI credential program for an entire academic year, and must hold a basic teaching credential. The student must have completed the generic courses required for either the Learning Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, or Severely Handicapped Specialist Credential which includes Education 160, 161, 162, 163, and 184.8 (equivalency credit can be used for certain of these generic requirements). Finally, the student must have a contract offer from a public school district. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence requires pos\u00ad session of a valid Special Education Credential, and three or more years of teaching experience, including both regular and special education teaching experience. A clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence authorizes service only if a valid Special Education Credential, other than an emer\u00ad gency credential, is held concurrently. The UCI program lead\u00ad ing to the clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence is a 16 quarter-unit program divided into four courses, and followed by an exit assessment. Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis is a specialization in addition to a regular teaching credential. This means that a candidate must fulfill all the necessary requirements for a basic teaching credential whether this be with a Single Sub\u00ad ject orientation for high school or a Multiple Subject orienta\u00ad tion for elementary school. The Irvine program is limited to the development of a bilingual capacity in Spanish only as the second language. At UCI the Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a B.A. with a Bilingualism and English as a Second Language Emphasis. By acquiring this undergraduate major, the stu\u00ad dent will complete a significant part of the specific require\u00ad ments for a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. This is the best kind of preparation for going into the program leading to a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Services Credential The Ryan Act provides for five categories of nonteaching credentials which authorize their holders to provide specific nonclassroom services to public schools. Services Credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel services, adminis\u00ad trative services, health services, library services, and clinical\u00ad rehabilitative services. UCI offers programs which lead to the Administrative Services Credential, generally required by school administrators, and the Pupil Personnel Services Cre\u00ad dential, sought by school counselors. Both credentials are effective for grades K-12. At UCI the Pupil Personnel Ser\u00ad vices Credential requires a basic teaching credential or a Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology. The Administrative Services Credential requires the basic teaching credential, a Master's degree, and three years of acceptable full-time teaching experience. Planning a Program of Study One of the above patterns will prevail for all candidates. The primary option will be the status of the candidate (under\u00ad graduate or postbaccalaureate) at entry. Any program can be completed with one year of full-time postbaccalaureate study, but only a few can be pursued in an undergraduate program. Field experience, including student teaching, is offered in the regular four-year undergraduate program or during the fifth-year program. Field experience may be started in the freshman or sophomore year. The Office of Teacher Education program suggests two field experiences prior to entering into student teaching. One such experience might be a tutoring assignment during the fresh\u00ad man or sophomore year and another might be serving as a teacher's aide in the junior year. There are numerous options for this field experience. Each field experience program is a cooperative arrangement between the University and the public school districts to help provide UCI students with experience that will prepare them for their future work as teachers. The field experience can come from any one of sev\u00ad eral academic areas in which students work in public schools under supervision of an experienced teacher in the school and with a University supervisor. As a tutor, the college student usually works with the public school student on a one-to-one basis. As a teacher's aide, the student typically works for a block of time per week for one quarter with a teacher in the classroom. During this time students are given a variety of opportunities to help the experienced teacher enrich the course of study and to participate within the classroom. Ultimately it is in the classroom where the problems of teach\u00ad ing are either solved or ignored; hence here is where teacher preparation begins. This experience will assist the UCI stu\u00ad dent in making a more realistic vocational choice. It also involves the public school in the selection of future student teachers. An additional multicultural community field experience of one unit value is required of all students in Education 174. Admission to the Teacher Education Program All students are welcome to apply for admission to the Teacher Education program. Students are usually admitted twice a year, in the fall and spring quarters. Admission is based on a broad index: Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a grade point aver\u00ad age of 3.0 will support admission to the Teacher Education program at UCI. (Undergraduates who enroll in courses lead\u00ad ing to credentials still must be admitted to a fifth year of study-to be described later.) For information and an applica-Teacher Education 261 tion, contact the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, 145 Administration Building. Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a certificate of clearance from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing prior to beginning student teaching. This process is primarily a fingerprint check to determine that the student is clear of criminal conviction. See a coun\u00ad selor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice on how to handle this process. Interview. An Admissions Committee is available to meet with prospective students. All admitted to the program will have a personal interview with a member or members of the Committee. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation for admission are required. Such recommendations should indicate the student's ability to perform graduate-level work. CBEST. Applicants should arrange to take the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) prior to the quarter they expect to apply for admission. Students may pick up information booklets about CBEST in the Office of Teacher Education. Admission. Both the UCI academic department correspond\u00ad ing to the student's academic major and the Office of Teacher Education must recommend the admission of applicants for the Single Subject Instruction Credential. The applicant's record is reviewed first by the academic department and then by the Admissions Committee of the Office of Teacher Education. Minimum Requirements for the Teaching Credential The minimum requirements for the teaching credential in California are established by California state law. Require\u00ad ments include: 1. A baccalaureate or higher degree, in an area other than professional education, from an approved institution. 2. A 45-quarter unit approved program of professional prep\u00ad aration. This means a sequence of education courses, includ\u00ad ing an ali-day, full-time assignment of a semester's duration in student teaching. 3. Passage of a subject matter examination or its waiver via an approved academic program. UCI academic programs are approved for most examination waivers; but students should seek counsel from Teacher Education to ensure that they are enrolled in an approved waiver program. 4. Under certain conditions the passage of the College Level Examination Program is required. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice. 5. Demonstration of a knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading as validated by successful completion of a program of study. (Industrial arts, physical education, music, art, and home economics are exempt from this requirement.) 6. A course or an examination covering the U.S. Constitution. 7. A fifth year of study (45 quarter units) is still required, even though a student may elect to start or complete the approved program of professional preparation as an undergraduate. 8. Successful completion of the California Basic Educational Skills Test. Applicants should take this test prior to admission.

The UCI-recommended program, which includes the 45- quarter-unit minimum requirements and 20 quarter units of special preparation, can be completed in five quarters, or a sequence of summer, fall, winter, spring, and summer.

California requires all students to pass the National Teachers Examination (NTE) in the area of their teaching majors except where particular institutions have developed an approved major which waives the NTE. All UCI academic majors which are commonly taught in the public schools have been waived in lieu of the National Teachers Examination. However, in some majors there are certa\u00b7in requirements that a student must complete while ful\u00ad filling the major in order to receive this waiver. Students should consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for detailed information. Supplementary Authorization. Teaching minors by that name no longer exist, but it is possible to add further teach\u00ad ing authorizations beyond the single subject major. Students deciding to be credentialed in more than one subject area may qualify to do so in either of two ways: 1. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 units if they are upper-division) in collegiate-level course work to be used to develop a supplementary authorization to teach in areas differing from the single subject major. Consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for details. 2. Students may pass the National Teachers Examination in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the additional authorization in that subject. Multiple Subject Examinations. A general subject matter examination authorizing teaching multiple subjects includes an examination of the candidate's knowledge of the following areas: English, social science, fine arts, science, and mathe\u00ad matics. The UCI program for the Multiple Subject Teaching Credential is approved for waiver of the examination if the student completes the required diversified program. The examination can be taken as often as necessary but should not be taken prior to the junior year. Spring Summer (2) Ed 3000-E-F (12) Ed 104E (4) (4) Ed 380 (3) Ed 1040 (4) (1) Ed 162 (4) (8) Ed 360 (3) 15 15 15 Requirements in Academic Areas for Waiver of Examination in the Multiple Subject Examinations. Of the student's total undergraduate program, 128 quarter hours are required to be divided as follows: Nine courses (36 quarter units) in two of the following areas and seven courses (28 quarter units) in the other two: a. English (including grammar, literature, advanced com\u00ad position, and speech) b. Social science and history (must have courses in each) c. Mathematics and science (must have courses in each with a minimum of three approved courses in mathematics) d. Fine arts, foreign language, and philosophy Since the academic major on the UCI campus will normally fulfill one of the four areas above and the UCl breadth requirement applies to the others, meeting the four require\u00ad ments is possible if planned early in the student's career. Fifth-Year Requirement The UCI Teacher Education program defines the fifth year as 45 quarter units of upper-division work taken after the bachelor's degree is granted, or postbaccalaureate-level work. In each instance the fifth year will consist of a program, indi\u00ad vidually determined and based upon the assessed needs of the student, and where applicable (for example, in the Intern Program), by the hiring school district. Regardless of courses completed prior to the bachelor's degree, students must complete a fifth year to obtain a clear teaching credential. In addition to the approved program listed above for the Multiple or Single Subject Instruction Credentials, the fifth year must include the following: 1. Completion of 45 quarter units 2. Completion of the following courses: a. Education 162, Psychology and Education of the Excep\u00ad tional Child b. Education 360, Synthesis of the Professional Commitment c. Education 380, Health Education for Teachers UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Provision for a Student Teaching Experience Twenty quarter units of student teaching are defined as a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment, for 18 weeks in the appropriate classroom training environment. Evaluation will be based on performance, excellence in instruction, and pro\u00ad fessional maturity. These factors will be assessed by the resi\u00ad dent teacher, the University supervisor, and the candidate. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching program and all other requirements are met, the student qualifies for recommendation for credential certification by UCI. Multiple Subject Instruction candidates will be assigned in grades K-8. The assignment may be split to include two lev\u00ad els within this range. Single Subject Instruction candidates will be assigned in grades 7-12. The assignment may be split to include two lev\u00ad els within this range. The student teaching situation requires the student to be in the school the full day for a full semester, the same as the regular teacher, including faculty meetings, parent confer\u00ad ences, and sponsorship of events. It is a joint responsibility of UCI and the school districts to guarantee that each student will have student teaching expe\u00ad rience in a multicultural or cross-cultural situation. There is no concurrent course work required of student teachers during student teaching, but a weekly seminar is held as a part of the total student teaching program. Many students, however, do choose to take courses in addition to student teaching, if courses are offered late in the day. Clear\u00ad ances for student teaching are processed by the Office of Teacher Education and are contingent upon the certificate of clearance, a current health clearance, and academic prepara-Teacher Education 263 tion clearances. A student must apply for a student teaching assignment the quarter before student teaching. Students are to consult the Office of Teacher Education for appropriate information. Under the present program a student can be authorized to teach in California prior to the completion of the fifth year. A student can be granted a preliminary credential upon comple\u00ad tion of the baccalaureate, the professional education se\u00ad quence, a course in the teaching of reading, student teaching, a course or examination covering the U.S. Constitution, pass\u00ad ing the California Basic Educational Skills Test, and where necessary, by passing the National Teachers Examination as required by the Ryan Act. (Contact the Office of Teacher Education for information on the National Teachers Exami\u00ad nation.) However, the fifth year must be completed within five years after the preliminary credential is issued. Preliminary, Clear, and Life Credentials Multiple and Single Subject Credentials are of three types: The Preliminary Credential. The Preliminary Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of the approved pro\u00ad gram. This can be done in the undergraduate program and is contingent upon possession of the baccalaureate degree. Before the recommendation for the Preliminary Credential can be made, the student must have completed (or demon\u00ad strate equivalent credit for) the Multiple Subject Instruction Credential: Education 105A, 105LA, llOA-B, 173-174; for the Credential: Education 101, 102, 1058, 105LB, 173-174. The Clear Credential. The Clear Credential cannot be awarded by the State until the completion of (a) a baccalau\u00ad reate degree, (b) an approved program, and (c) a fifth year. I UC IRVINE - 1983-1984264 Teacher Education The Life Credential. The Life Credential can be awarded by the State upon completion of all requirements for the Clear Credential plus two years of full-time teaching experience in California public schools or approved private schools. Requirements for the Life Credential are currently undergo\u00ad ing revision. Project Radius UCI recognizes the need for cooperative activities linking faculty and administrators from both the campus and Orange County public and private schools. UCI's curricular outreach activities are coordinated by the Director of the Office of Teacher Education through Project Radius. Project Radius provides a variety of services to school districts interested in curriculum development projects and in the professional development of teachers. Among its activities, it sponsors the Education Forum, a series of meetings that bring school administrators and UCI personnel together to discuss mat\u00ad ters of mutual concern. In cooperation with public and private schools, the Project also sponsors curriculum devel\u00ad opment workshops, teaching training institutes, and grant proposals aimed at curricular innovation and teacher/admin\u00ad istrator development.

Currently, 92 students are admitted each year. The College of Medicine is dedicated to advancing the knowledge and practice of medicine for the benefit of society. This mission is being achieved through the accom\u00ad plishment of the following complementary and synergistic objectives: Scholarly research of the highest quality to further the understanding of human biology and the diagnosis, treat\u00ad ment, and prevention of disease. Education of physicians who meet the highest standards of professional competence and achievement. Development of scholars in the clinical and basic sciences who will assume leadership roles in medical practice, educa\u00ad tion, and research. Provision of high-quality medical care to patients through the UCI Clinical Services System that will serve as a model of excellence. Dissemination of the results of advances in medical research and practice. Medicine 275 UC IRVINE - 1983-1984276 Medicine Facilities The basic medical science instructional programs are located in modern, well-equipped buildings on the Irvine campus. These buildings also house the College of Medicine adminis\u00ad tration and many of the research laboratories and classrooms. In addition, facilities on the Irvine campus include two amphitheater-style lecture halls, the Biomedical Library, and a student lounge/activity center. The UCI Clinical Services System is comprised of the UCI Medical Center, two community clinics in areas of need within Orange County, and numerous affiliated hospitals and clinics in Orange County, in southern Los Angeles County, and in outlying areas. Its goal is to provide high quality medi\u00ad cal care to the community while maintaining an environment of quality medical education and research. The UCI Medical Center provides a full range of medical and mental health experiences to medical students and residents, while the community clinics concentrate on the primary care special\u00ad ties, and the affiliated institutions provide clinical training in specific specialities. Plans have been formulated for an on\u00ad campus ambulatory care clinic which will provide primary care services to the Irvine area and specialty services to a large geographic area. UCI Medical Center The University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC), located in the City of Orange, is a 493-bed, comprehensive medical care center. It is the principal clinical facility of the College of Medicine operated by the University. The medical faculty of the College of Medicine, together with the medical resident-physician staff, provide the professional care at the Medical Center. Services provided include: medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medi\u00ad cine, pathology, radiology, physical medicine and rehabilita\u00ad tion, ophthalmology, neurology, and anesthesiology. The Medical Center also has cardiac, pediatric, neonatal, respira\u00ad tory, burn, and general intensive care units, and more than 90 specialty outpatient clinics. The Medical Center is also the designated countywide Level I tertiary trauma referral center. A six-level patient care unit, the Medical Center Tower, opened in 1981. It is part of a major redevelopment program that includes the renovation of existing buildings and the construction of new facilities, including a medical library building. UCI Community Clinics Two University-operated clinics are located in Orange County. The Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC), located in the City of Santa Ana, is the home of the Depart\u00ad ment of Family Medicine residency program. The Clinic cur\u00ad rently provides comprehensive care for 25,000 outpatients annually. The North Orange County Community Clinic (NOCCC) currently serves 6,900 outpatients annually and is located in the City of Anaheim. The affiliated Clinica Sierra Vista, in Lamont, California, provides an educational expe\u00ad rience in rural medicine. Affiliated Hospitals and Clinics Additional major teaching and research programs of the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine are conducted at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach, and at Memori\u00ad al Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach. Other academic pro\u00ad grams are conducted in affiliation with Childrens Hospital of Orange County, Fairview State Hospital, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, Metropolitan State Hospital (a psychiatric hospital in Norwalk), St. Joseph Hospital, St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, the United States Naval Regional Medical Center in Long Beach, The City of Hope Medical Center, Rancho Los Amigos Hos\u00ad pital, Beverly Hospital (Montebello), San Bernardino Medical Center, Capistrano by the Sea Hospital, and Friendly Hills Medical Group (La Habra). The Clinica Sierra Vista in Lamont (Kern County) and CHnicas de Salud del Pueblo in Calexico (Imperial County) are also affiliated. Admission to the M.D. Program The UCI-California College of Medicine is a member of the American Medical Colleges Applications Service (AMCAS). All students who seek entrance to medical school must first apply to AMCAS. Requests for applications should be sub\u00ad mitted directly to: The American Medical College Application Service 1776 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Suite 301 Washington, D.C. 20036 Applications may be submitted between June 15 and Novem\u00ad ber 15 of the year preceding anticipated admission. Students who wish to apply to UCI-CCM should designate it on their AMCAS application form, and AMCAS will forward the application to the College. Each year, the College receives approximately 3,500 applica\u00ad tions from AMCAS. From these, 500 candidates are granted interviews, and 92 students are finally enrolled in the first\u00ad year class beginning each September. Applications received by the College are reviewed by a 40- member Admissions Committee composed of faculty, medical students, and members of the local community. Because the University of California is a State-assisted insti\u00ad tution, preference is given to California residents. The UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine participates in the student exchange program of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). Under this program, qualified legal residents of certain Western states without medical schools (Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming) are considered along with California residents. The states of origin reim\u00ad burse the State of California for the educational costs of stu\u00ad dents who are accepted. To be eligible for this program, students must apply to WICHE certifying officers in their own states. For addresses of certifying officers, write to the Western Interstate Com\u00ad mission for Higher Education, P.O. Drawer P, Boulder, Colo\u00ad rado 80302. After initial screening, selected applicants are requested to submit additional materials which include letters of recom\u00ad mendation, a personal information form, two photographs, and a nonrefundable application fee of $30. Additional infor\u00ad mation should not be submitted unless requested. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984In addition to scholastic achievement, attributes deemed desirable in prospective students include participation in extracurricular activities (e.g., medically related clubs, research experience, and involvement in community organi\u00ad zations) as well as indications of leadership ability. Through the personal information form and the letters of recommen\u00ad dation, the Admissions Committee looks for qualities consi\u00ad dered valuable in a physician. These qualities include the intellectual and emotional capacity to provide comprehensive and continuing medical care, the ability to cope with disease and guide patients through the complex array of medical ser\u00ad vices, the commitment to remain sensitive to individual needs, and the dedication to strive for the advancement of the art, science, and practice of medicine long after obtaining a medical degree. Applicants may expect to receive notification about their admission status from the College any time from October until the beginning of the following fall term. The Admis\u00ad sions Committee maintains a list of alternative candidates for possible acceptance should a vacancy occur before the end of the first week of classes. Accepted applicants must return a written statement of their acceptance of the College's offer within two weeks after receipt of the notice of acceptance. No advance deposit to hold a position in the class is required of applicants. Students who are accepted sign a Statement of Intent to Register, but (in keeping with the recommendations of the Association of American Medical Colleges) are free to withdraw prior to enrollment if their medical school or career choice changes. Requirements for Admission First-year students may enter only in September of each year. Candidates for admission to the UCI-California College of Medicine must meet the following requirements: 1.

If special needs are identified, the time may be extended to five years. The instructional year is divided into quintiles (fifths). The M.D. program is composed of 18 quintiles, 17 of which are instructional and one in the senior year is a vacation period. Each quintile lasts 9 to 11 weeks and includes 8 to 10 weeks of instruction with one week for final and/or midcourse examinations. The basic science quintiles (1-5) include anatomy, biochemis\u00ad try, microbiology, physiology, behavioral sciences, and com\u00ad munity and environmental medicine. The preclinical sciences (quintiles 6-8) involve pathology, pharmacology, examination of the patient, studies of the mechanisms of disease, and introductory courses in medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. The clinical science quintiles (9-17) are spent in clerkships in medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, surgery, anes\u00ad thesiology, ophthalmology, psychiatry and human behavior, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurosciences, primary care, and radiology. Students are also provided ample oppor\u00ad tunity to participate in clinical and research elective courses of their choosing. During their first two years, students have approximately 13 weeks of vacation interspersed between the quintiles. This period includes three weeks between quintiles eight and nine to study for Part I of the National Boards. In the fourth year, one quintile is devoted to vacation. To satisfy the requirements for the M.D. degree, each medi\u00ad cal student must complete the courses of instruction in the basic medical sciences, the preclinical sciences, and the clinical sciences as well as acceptable electives. After the second year, all students are required to pass Part I of the National Board Examination before continuing their clinical clerkships. Stu\u00ad dents must also pass Part II of the Boards prior to graduation. Curricular Policies The curricular policies of the UCI-California College of Med\u00ad icine are the responsibility of the faculty. A complete listing of these policies is contained in the Mediml Student Handbook, which is available from the Records Office and is distributed to all students upon matriculation. The grading system at the College utilizes letter grades A through F. The Quintiles Basic Sciences (Quintiles 1-5) During quintiles 1-5, no more than six hours of instruction are scheduled per day; of these six hours, no more than four are formal lectures. Gross Anatomy; Embryology; Histology; Neuroanatomy The language of medicine is taught in gross human anatomy, embryology, normal microscopic anatomy (histology), and human neuroanatomy. Gross anatomy is taught through a regional approach with heavy emphasis on laboratory dissec\u00ad tion augmented by lectures, demonstrations (radiographic films), and teaching aids. Embryology is a lecture course that brings forth human development from the union of sperm and ovum to parturition. Microscopic anatomy is designed to provide students with knowledge of cellular morphology and function in preparation for studies in pathology. Neuroanat\u00ad omy is functionally oriented and emphasizes both laboratory and lecture material. All courses in anatomy are given a clini\u00ad cal orientation. Biochemistry The fundamentals of classical and molecular biochemistry are covered, including the structure, function, and biosynthesis of macromolecules and metabolic interrelations. The molecu\u00ad lar at the transcrip\u00ad tional, translational, posttranslational, and enzymatic levels are emphasized. Behavioral Sciences I and II The ultimate goal of the curriculum is for the student to learn the behavioral aspects of medicine as they apply to gen\u00ad eral medicine and surgical practice. The areas covered are the basic science of neurobiology, somatopsychic issues, interper\u00ad sonal (doctor-patient) relationships, and psychopathology. Behavioral Sciences I covers normal human development, the basics of the doctor-patient relationship, basic interviewing techniques, and behavioral neuroanatomy and neurochemis\u00ad try. Behavioral Sciences II covers human sexuality, psy\u00ad chopathology, alcoholism, and drug abuse. It also covers psy\u00ad chosocial aspects of medical and surgical disease. The course consists of readings, lectures, and small group discussions. Students also have their first exposure to patients and learn the basics of the interview. In Behavioral Sciences I, the emphasis is on interviewing \"normal\" people; in Behavioral Sciences II the student learns how to assess pathology. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984Physiology The course consists of lecture, tutorial, and audiovisual pre\u00ad sentations of the classical concepts of vertebrate physiology, with emphasis on the function of normal tissues in man. Spe\u00ad cific topics related to neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, exercise, and temperature regulation are presented. Microbiology This course deals with the biochemical and genetic properties of infectious agents, activities of toxins, chemotherapy, and the biochemistry and genetics of antibiotic resistance. A con\u00ad siderable portion of the course deals with the humoral and cellular basis of immunity and the genetic control of the immune response. The course also includes an in-depth study of the biology of parasites and the structure and activity of viruses. Community and Environmental Medicine This course consists of six main segments: biostatistics, epidemiology, nutrition, preventive medicine, legal medicine, and environmental and occupational medicine. The main segment, epidemiology, is presented in formal lectures and laboratory sessions. Methods are given for evaluating the dis\u00ad tribution and possible causation of acute and chronic diseases, including infectious and noninfectious diseases, in human populations. Preclinical Sciences (Quintiles 6-8) During quintiles 6-8, no more than seven hours of instruc\u00ad tion will be scheduled each day, and of these no more than four are formal lectures. Pharmacology This course deals with drugs of various classifications which are used for specific or symptomatic therapies of disease states. Emphasis is on the mechanisms of action of drugs at the organ or system level and on their use in medical therapy. The course includes lectures that illustrate pharmacologic principles, supplemented by small group discussion sessions. Pathology Theoretical aspects of pathological processes are presented to provide an orientation to disease mechanisms which are correlated with practical laboratory work. Disease is pre\u00ad sented as a dynamic process that affects the organism at molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels. Clinical Pathology This course consists of lectures and laboratories covering the areas of hematology, blood bank, clinical chemistry, and microbiology. Examination of Patient Basic instruction and experience are offered in the elements of physical diagnosis and patient interviews. Mechanisms of Disease An organ system approach is utilized in presenting the basic mechanisms and manifestations of disease. Introduction to Medicine This course introduces students to comprehensive workups of their own patients, including history, complete physical examination of all organ systems, and differential diagnostic analysis and interpretation. Introduction to Surgery This lecture, laboratory, and study course provides a back\u00ad ground of knowledge of pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of surgical diseases, as well as basic technical skills. Medicine 279 Introduction to Obstetrics and Gynecology This course introduces students to the basic essentials of obstetrics and gynecology. Students will learn the reproduc\u00ad tive physiology in the nonpregnant and pregnant woman. They will be introduced to many of the pathological changes that occur in the female reproductive system. Following this course, the student will be prepared to commence practical work at the beginning of their clinical clerkship in obstetrics and gynecology. Clinical Sciences ( Quin tiles 9-17) The clinical experience is composed of (a) clerkship rotations, with a specific allotment of time in each emphasizing primary care and continuity of care, and (b) electives. Sequencing of clerkships is determined by the Records Office, Medical Stu\u00ad dents Affairs. Clerkships Anesthesiology During the anesthesiology clerkship, students receive instruction in the basic principles of general and regional anesthesia, including the pharmacology of anesthetic drugs, basic respiratory and cardiovascular physiology, airway man\u00ad agement, preoperative evaluation of patients, surgical anes\u00ad thesia, fluid balance, hazards of anesthesia, postanesthesia recovery care, resuscitation, and the management of respira\u00ad tory emergencies and comatose states. A two-week elective is offered in which students gain familiarity with the technical aspects of anesthesia by spending a portion of each day in the operating room and by participating in supervised \"hands-on\" patient care. Theoretical aspects of the specialty are covered in daily tutorial sessions with the faculty, and students attend departmental clinical conferences which are devoted to pre\u00ad sentation and discussions of interesting cases and complica\u00ad tions. Special rotations through the VAMCLB Surgical Care Unit are also offered but must be arranged through the department chair. The student must have at least one week on clinical anesthesia as a prerequisite for the elective. Dermatology The dermatology clerkship provides students the opportunity to learn the common dermatologic diseases. Development of disease recognition, diagnostic skills, and outpatient man\u00ad agement of skin problems are emphasized during this rota\u00ad tion. Students attend inpatient teaching rounds, grand rounds, and slide conferences, and visit private physician offices. Outpatient care under the supervision of the chief resident and faculty is assigned at UCI Medical Center and VAMCLB clinics. During the weekly basic science and journal club conferences, students learn about advances in scientific understanding of dermatologic diseases and their therapy. A research elective for two-to-four months is available in selected research areas by arrangement with faculty. Junior Medicine Students are taught the appropriate diagnostic and therapeu\u00ad tic approach to commonly encountered medical illnesses. The intent is that, in addition to scientific aspects of medical diag\u00ad nosis and therapy, students will develop an appreciation for the importance of psychosocial-economic factors in the care of the patient. Experience is provided with common medical procedures such as lumbar puncture, insertion of catheters, and thoracentesis. The student is expected to assume increas\u00ad ing responsibility for hospitalized patients and to develop an approach to patients' problems which includes references to the appropriate medical literature. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984280 Medicine Senior Medicine Students spend five weeks as subinterns during which time they carry the full ward responsibility of an intern on one\u00ad half the number of patients usually carried by an intern. A second five weeks is spent on medically related electives. Neurosciences The clinical neurosciences clerkship emphasizes the develop\u00ad ment of student skills in neurological examination as well as the medical and surgical management of patients with brain, nerve, and muscle disease. Obstetrics and Gynecology During this clerkship, students are taught the scientific basis of gynecology and obstetrics, including reproductive physiol\u00ad ogy, anatomy, fetal physiology, and pathology. Practical expe\u00ad rience is offered in the management of normal and abnormal pregnancy and delivery. Instruction is given in office and sur\u00ad gical gynecology. Students who have completed an introduc\u00ad tory clerkship may then apply for an advanced elective that allows a progression of clinical responsibility both in opera\u00ad tive obstetrics and office gynecology. This advanced period also may be devoted to an in-depth study of a subspecialty area such as gynecologic oncology, maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, or human sexuality. Ophthalmology The core clerkship provides instruction in the basis of oph\u00ad thalmoscopy, slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, visual func\u00ad tion testing, and management of emergency eye problems. Electives from one to four weeks may be taken in clinical suites, with exposure to ophthalmic surgery and emergency eye care. Pediatrics/Nursery Pediatrics includes instruction in the management and nutri\u00ad tion of normal and sick infants and children; relationships with parents and other family members; normal development of the infant into childhood and adolescence; diagnosis of developmental defects; general approaches to treatment and rehabilitation; common infections predominant in infancy and childhood; and peculiarities of the effects of medication in children. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation During the physical medicine and rehabilitation rotation, stu\u00ad dents are assigned patients who are in an active rehabilitation program. Emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of the total patient. The medical aspects of the patient's care are dis\u00ad cussed in detail. Instruction is provided in the various physi\u00ad cal techniques of rehabilitation and in the psychosocial factors which permanently affect this process. Primary Care Students attend an assigned primary care clinic one-half day per week for five consecutive quintiles in either family medi\u00ad cine, internal medicine, or pediatrics. Each student becomes the primary care provider for a number of patients in an ambulatory setting and continues as their primary care pro\u00ad vider throughout the clerkship. Under the supervision of pri\u00ad mary care faculty, students gain specific primary care skills. This experience in continuous care should provide a basis for a student's selection or rejection of a career in a primary care specialty. Psychiatry The eight-week clinical clerkship is the culmination of the process of learning human behavior as it relates to general medicine. The student elects two four-week clinical rotations as subinternships, participating fully in patient care, clinical teaching, and conferences. Choices include adult inpatient psychiatry, alcoholism, child psychiatry, consultation psychia\u00ad try, and emergency room psychiatry. A wide variety of clini\u00ad cal settings and patient populations is available. Radiology The role of radiological sciences (both diagnostic and thera\u00ad peutic) in relation to medicine and surgery is taught to stu\u00ad dents through exposure to clinical specialists in subspecialty areas such as nuclear medicine, ultrasound, computerized tomography, chest, bone, gastrointestinal, etc.; daily clinical film conferences with staff and residents; the American Col\u00ad lege of Radiology film learning laboratory; and daily seminars interrelating general medicine and radiology. Emphasis is given to the use of ionizing radiation for diagnosis and treatment, understanding the risk/benefit ratios involved, and the clinical indications for various radiological procedures. Surgery The surgical clerkship provides students with an opportunity to study surgical patients in outpatient and hospital settings as members of the surgical team. Emphasis is placed on the clinical evaluation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of surgical diseases. Electives One and one-half quintiles in the medical curriculum are undesignated. Depending on their particular interests, needs, and goals, students may take a variety of elective courses consisting of at least 30 contact hours per week beginning in quintile 9. In addition, one-half quintile is devoted to a medi\u00ad cally related elective which may include pediatrics or family medicine, and one-half quintile is devoted to a surgically related elective which may include anesthesiology or obstet\u00ad rics and gynecology. Electives must be approved by the student's advisor and certi\u00ad fied by the Records Office. By petition, some electives may be taken at institutions other than UCI. A listing of elective courses and descriptions can be found in the Electives Handbook, which is available from the Office of Records, Medical Student Affairs (on campus), and the Medi\u00ad cal Student Affairs Office at the UCI Medical Center.

More detailed information is available in a separate publica\u00ad tion, the 1983-84 UCI-CCM Announcement, available for $3 from the College's Office of Admissions. Graduate Academic Programs The College's basic medical science Departments of Anatomy, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology, and Physiology and Bio\u00ad physics participate jointly with the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences in offering graduate instruction leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Sciences. The Department of Radiological Sciences and the Department of Pharmacology offer M.S. and Ph.D. programs. In addition, the Department of Pediatrics offers an M.S. degree in Genetics Counseling. Application materials may be obtained by writing the Divi\u00ad sion of Graduate Studies and Research, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. Anatomy The Department of Anatomy in the College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, with specialized research training in the neu\u00ad rosciences. Research programs in the neurosciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, the central neural regulation of circadian rhythms, forebrain organization, and organization and development of sensory systems. Research programs also include growth inhibition, cartilage, and pul\u00ad monary edema. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the follow\u00ad analysis of neuroscientific data. Students are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous tech\u00ad niques in various species. Students in the Department of Anatomy have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to con\u00ad duct innovative and fundamentally sound research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable anatomists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of gross, cellular, and subcellular anatomy; physiology; and biochemistry. In the first year, stu\u00ad dents will be required to take neuroanatomy, microscopic anatomy, embryology, gross anatomy, biochemistry, and phys\u00ad iology. Over the usual four-year training period the student will be required to complete a practical course in statistics, four departmental seminar courses, four laboratory tutorials, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy or other departments on campus may also be taken; examples include pharmacol\u00ad ogy, psychobiology, cell biology, genetics, computer science, pathology, and physiology. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Only a minimum UC IRVINE - 1983-1984of the third year is spent taking courses. Each year following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the student and the Graduate Committee decide to which labora\u00ad tories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. An oral Qualifying Examination at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Commit\u00ad tee. The examination covers anatomy and focuses on the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee. The majority of the second, third, and fourth year is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written disserta\u00ad tion suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the stu\u00ad dent's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examination. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a pro\u00ad cess that normally will take four years to complete. Biological Chemistry The Department of Biological Chemistry in the College of Medicine and the Department of Molecular Biology and Bio\u00ad chemistry in the School of Biological Sciences jointly offer graduate study leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences under the administration of the School of Biological Sciences. The program makes extensive use of health sciences facilities, in addition to those of the School of Biological Sciences. The curriculum is designed to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in-depth comprehension of modern biochemistry and molecular biology and who are highly com\u00ad petent in a given subspecialty. The faculty's research interests include structure and synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, regulation of cell growth and metabolism, biochemical genet\u00ad ics and gene organization, and immunology. The first-year student is required to take a core of advanced courses (203 through 209), to become associated with the laboratories of at least three different investigators, and to attend the 201A\u00ad B-C seminar series. Upon successful completion of the first year, the student is given a comprehensive oral examination to test their general knowledge. Although further supple\u00ad mental work may be recommended, the student normally begins a specific research project with a faculty member in the second year. By passing an oral examination at the beginning of the third year on the proposed thesis work, the student may advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Stu\u00ad dents normally complete their degree programs after a total of four years of graduate study. Participation in the seminar series (201A-B-C) and completion of at least one satellite course per year (210-279) are expected of all continuing stu\u00ad dents. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of the training of graduate students at all levels. The graduate committee may waive some of the above requirements for candidates for the Master's degree. Applicants should have adequate undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Students who have not had an adequate physical chemistry course are expected to take Chemistry 130A-B-C during their first year. See page 92 for information on faculty research areas and course descriptions. Medicine 283 Genetics Counseling The Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, offers an M.S. degree in Genetics Counseling.

The Department admits about three highly qualified students each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and stu\u00ad dents are expected to become involved in the research of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, and cell biology. After the first year, training will follow the classical tutorial pattern in which a small number of students are tutored by the faculty in an informal setting. Students also will participate in a program of laboratory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiology. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some participation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each student must submit a written dissertation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. UC IRVINE - 1983-1984286 Medicine Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time as they choose a thesis advisor. The faculty conducts quarterly reviews of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satisfactory progress within their particular academic pro\u00ad gram. Students who have completed all necessary prerequi\u00ad sites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within four years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in June at the end of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the student's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think critically. Some time during the third year, the student will present a seminar on a topic approved by the formal can\u00ad didacy committee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the student's qualifications for the success\u00ad ful conduct of the doctoral dissertation. Advancement to can\u00ad didacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research upon the unanimous vote of the committee. For information on faculty research areas and course descrip\u00ad tions, see page 98. Some faculty from the Department are members of an inter\u00ad disciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group; see page 82 for a description of the program. Radiological Sciences The Department of Radiological Sciences offers graduate programs of advanced study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Both programs are oriented toward the education and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a creative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. A broad-based, interdisciplinary curriculum places heavy emphasis on research and is designed to provide the student with a comprehensive knowledge of the field in addition to an exceptionally high level of competence in one or more subspecialties. By utilizing the training received in medical imaging, medical physics, bioengineering, radiobiology, and radiological engineering, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon completion of this program. Prospec\u00ad tive students are cautioned that the program is extremely demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a vari\u00ad ety of the conventional disciplines. The Department of Radiological Sciences has well-equipped research laboratories in imaging physics, radiation biology, radiation physics, radio-pharmacy, and radiological engineer\u00ad ing located on campus and at the hospitals associated with the University of California, Irvine. The core program plus additional courses as may be required by the Graduate Committee normally will require two years to complete. To receive either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree, the student must successfully complete the core courses or their equivalents. Requirements for the M.S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiologi\u00ad cal Sciences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also pre\u00ad pares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis committee. Under Plan II, the student completes the core program plus a minimum of eight additional credits (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of specialization and satisfactorily passes a comprehensive written examination. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core program and take additional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with an average grade of B or above. Second, the student must pass a written and oral qual\u00ad ifying examination given at the end of the second full year of study. A student who fails the preliminary qualifying exami\u00ad nation can, with approval from the Graduate Committee, repeat the examination the following year. Third, within a year after passing the preliminary examination, the student must pass the final oral qualifying examination covering the proposed field of research and be advanced to candidacy. Finally, a dissertation representing original research in the student's principal field of study must be prepared and defended. The dissertation, conducted under the direction of the doctoral committee, represents the major element in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribution to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intel\u00ad lectual synthesis. and creativity. During the final quarter of graduate study the student is required to defend the disserta\u00ad tion in an oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research upon recommendation of the Department and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifications. Applicants should have a broad undergraduate background in both the physical and the bio\u00ad logical sciences as well as in mathematics. Since most stu\u00ad dents will need some additional work in one or more disci\u00ad plines, the graduate program allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as determined by departmental review. Although the program is rigorous, it is also sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Individual programs of study may be arranged within the three general areas of concentration: imaging physics, radiation biology, and radiation physics. Application deadline for the fall quarter is June 1 of each year. However, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February 1. Applications for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances. . Graduate Courses in Radiological Sciences 200A-B Principles of Radiation Physics (4-4) F, W.

A handbook is avail\u00ad able which sets forth standards of conduct expected of UCI stu\u00ad dents. This booklet, \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organ\u00ad izations, and Students,\" gives rules concerning conduct and related matters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the Presi\u00ad dent of the University. The booklet incorporates campus regulations also. Copies are available from the Ombudsman, who is located in 260 Administration Building, and from the Student Activities Office, located in University Center. Student Records The University of California campuses maintain various types of records pertaining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as hospital and employment records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students-include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large measure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by Uni\u00ad versity policy and procedures implementing these laws which pro\u00ad tect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the con\u00ad fidentiality of student records, and permit students access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: 1. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of per\u00ad sonally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There nre insfmnes in which informnfion mn be disclosed without prior wriffen consent of the student. UniPersify officinls mny require nccess to student records h1 the course of the performnnce of their nssigned duties. Further, (n) in connection with conditions of cer-Student Conduct and Discipline/Student Records 291 In in financinl nid nwnrds; (b) whm the mmpus is complying with judicinl order or subpomn; nnd (c) when nuthorized federnl or Stale officials nre conducfh1g an audit or evaluation of federnlly supported educafionnl progrnms, confidential information can be disclosed with\u00ad out prior written consent of the student. There nre nlso other sirunfions in which the University is required to disclose information. See Poli\u00ad cies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Studmts, Pnrf B, Section 10. 7 21 for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will relense the following as personally iden\u00ad tifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (campus, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercol\u00ad legiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate Univer\u00ad sity athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from dis\u00ad closure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the cam\u00ad pus cannot release for publication information on any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the stu\u00ad dent. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a stu\u00ad dent cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in con\u00ad nection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the Vice Chancel\u00ad lor Student Affairs or that person's designate, 260 Administration. A Personal Data Sheet is included in each quarter's registration packet which allows students to examine and update their personal data. Furthermore, during the eighth week of classes, every student is provided with a record of current term enrollment as part of his or her registration materials for the next quarter to ensure the accuracy of official enrollment. Students are urged to report offi\u00ad cially to the Registrar's Office all changes in personal data and en\u00ad rollment data. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the Univer\u00ad sity's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are published in the booklet \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students-Part B,\" copies of which are available in the Student Activities Office. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded stu\u00ad dents by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA), Department of Education, 4511 Switzer Building, Washington, D.C. 20202.
