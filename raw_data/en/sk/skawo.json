Please see your primary care doctor for more information. - After the initial recovery from COVID-19 there is still potential for long-term health impacts related to the virus. Long-term COVID treatment centers in Colorado: [http://survivorcorps.com/pccc-co](http://survivorcorps.com/pccc-co) - It is still unknown how long protection lasts following COVID-19 illness. In many cases immunity can last up to 90 days. Is immigration status recorded in the system? - No. The vaccine is available to all Gunnison County residents regardless of immigration status. Can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine? - No. The vaccines cannot give someone COVID-19. The vaccines are mRNA which do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19. How long will it take the vaccine to generate an effective immune response for an individual? - It takes at least two weeks following vaccination for adequate immunity to develop. I have heard you need three doses of the vaccine? I don't like shots, why do I need three? - The first dose primes the immune system. - The second dose boosts the immune system to provide better protection against COVID-19. - The boosters provide protection from waning immunity over time. What about side effects? - The most common side effects include (in order of frequency): - Localized pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site - Fatigue, headaches, muscle aches, chills, joint pain, or fever - These side effects were: - Mild-moderate in severity for a majority of people - More frequent after 2nd dose compared to the 1st dose - Less frequent for individuals over 55 years of age - Typically seen within 1-2 days of receiving the vaccine and lasted about 24 hours on average - Importantly, these side effects represent your body's immune system working appropriately to produce antibodies to the coronavirus and are shorter in duration and less severe than a significant COVID-19 infection. If I have already had COVID-19, do I still need the vaccine? - Natural immunity is the protection one receives from getting a disease again after being infected. Current evidence suggests that reinfection of COVID-19 is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection. - Following guidance from the CDC, vaccines are recommended to individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. They may consider waiting 90-days after infection to be vaccinated or receive a booster. Is my family at risk of getting COVID-19 from me, even after I have been vaccinated, but they have not? - Yes. A vaccinated person could still potentially spread the virus if they are infected. It is important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to help stop this pandemic, such as appropriate mask use, washing hands frequently, and utilizing physical distancing. Should I get the vaccine if I am pregnant? What about if I am breastfeeding? - Pregnant women with COVID-19 have been shown to have an increased risk of severe illness compared to non-pregnant women. - Based on current knowledge, experts believe that mRNA vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk for people who are pregnant. - When making a decision, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that pregnant women and their healthcare providers should \"consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the risks of COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the efficacy of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine and the lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy.\" - In regards to women who are breastfeeding, experts agree that mRNA vaccines are not thought to pose a risk to the breastfeeding infant. For now, it is a similar risk-benefit discussion between the individual and her healthcare provider. How do these mRNA vaccines work? - The outer surface of the coronavirus is covered in \"spike proteins\" which allow it to enter and infect a person's cells. - The mRNA vaccine uses a short copy of mRNA genetic material. This helps a vaccinated cell build replicas that protect against these \"spike proteins.\" - Your body's immune system creates antibodies to help recognize and block the \"spike proteins.\" This limits the ability of the coronavirus to infect your body in the future. Have these vaccines actually been shown to work? I've heard people are still getting COVID-19. - Yes! Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are protecting you from severe symptoms. This helps our healthcare system remain open and able to focus on at-risk individuals. Is the vaccine safe for my children? - Yes! Vaccines have been approved for children ages 6 months and older. Is there anyone who absolutely should not receive the Pfizer mRNA vaccine based on what we currently know? - Individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to other vaccines or injectable medications should have a risk-benefit discussion with their healthcare provider, but they are not excluded from receiving the Pfizer vaccine. - Individuals with a history of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to other exposures such as food, pets, insects, oral medications, environmental allergies, or other allergic reactions are NOT EXCLUDED from getting the vaccine and are not thought to be at increased risk based on available information.
