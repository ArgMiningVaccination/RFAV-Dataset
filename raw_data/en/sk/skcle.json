Th e inside lining of the airways swells inward. Th is narrows the space inside your airways. 2. Th e muscles around the airways tighten. Th is tightening is called bronchospasm and it also narrows your airways. 3. Your airways produce more mucus. Excess mucus clogs the airways, narrowing the space for air to pass through. Th e hallmark of asthma is some form of airway exposure which causes the immune cells in the airway to overreact producing increased amounts of mucus, swelling and narrowing of the airway. It can be like trying to breathe through a narrow straw\u2014you have to work extra hard to get air in and out. When you have other asthma symptoms, like coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness, you're having an asthma fl are-up or attack.Asthma is a serious, and sometimes life-threatening, disease of the lungs and airways. It's also a common disease. About 25 million Americans have asthma, and the number continues to grow every year. Fortunately, our ability to treat asthma is also growing. Today, you can expect that with a little knowledge and discipline, you can completely control your asthma, and do all the things you enjoy doing. ASTHMA 101 HOW TO TREAT AND PREVENT FL ARE-UPS summer 2017 | 9 8 | Intermountain Clinics IntermountainClinics.orgBelow are some common asthma symptoms, described as you might have them during a fl are-up or attack. Coughing Particularly at night or after exercise. Wheezing You may hear a high-pitched whistling sound as you breathe. Th is sound means that air is having trouble moving through your airways. Di culty breathing, chest tightness As your breathing becomes more diffi cult, you can feel pain or tightness in your chest. Shallow breathing You may fi nd it diffi cult to take a deep breath. Fast breathing As your breathing becomes more shallow, it also becomes faster as your body tries to get more oxygen into your lungs. Retractions As an asthma fl are-up worsens, the skin and muscles between the ribs and at the base of the throat may pull in or \"retract\" with each breath. Symptoms vary from person to person and from time to time. Some people with mild asthma may only have one or two symptoms, while others may have several. Asthma is considered a genetic disease. In the United States of America around 10% of people have asthma or reactive airway disease. Other risk factors include: obesity, exposure to WHO GETS ASTHMA? HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE ASTHMA? WHAT CAUSES MY ASTHMA TO GET WORSE?environmental toxins, cigarette smoke exposure and viral airway problems as a child. A trigger is anything\u2014a condition, a substance, an activity\u2014 that causes infl ammation in your sensitive airways. A trigger makes your asthma worse, or keeps it from getting better. Respiratory Infections Colds, infl uenza, sinus infections, etc. Exercise is one of the most common triggers of asthma symptoms. However, when your symptoms are controlled, exercise is good for your lungs. Irritants in the air such as smoke, pollution, odors, fumes and sprays. Allergens such as animal dander, pollen, mold or forms of dust. Work with your primary care provider in establishing a medication plan. Common medications for asthma treatment include albuterol inhaler and/or nebulizer which is used as a rescue inhaler for acute events. T reatment may include a combination of inhaled steroids and allergy pills or just inhaled steroids. Someone with asthma often makes a plan with their doctor on what to do if there are worsening symptoms before coming to the clinic or going to the ER. Suggestions often include increasing the dose or frequency of medication use. Indentify your triggers, and try to avoid them. Asthma is a fairly common medical problem which can be controlled under the proper circumstances. Working closely with your primary care provider is crucial for medical management and continued control of your asthma. WHAT CAN I DO TO TREAT ASTHMA?

From our love of Disney movies to our roly-poly collection, it felt like most of our possessions were mutual. As we grew older, we realized we did not share quite everything. I learned I share a thyroid problem with my father while my sister did not. As a genetic counselor, I understand the importance of knowing your family's health history. It is recognized that both common diseases, like heart disease, and rare ones, such as sickle cell anemia, run in families. Th is knowledge can help doctors anticipate issues and guide preventative treatment to keep you and your family healthy. Gathering a family health history can be a daunting task. Here are some tips to get you started. The Key to a Healthy FutureHaving healthy history discussions with your family members can bring huge bene ts. FAMILY HEALTH HISTORY HANNAH SCHUSTER Genetic Counselor MCKAY-DEE MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE CLINIC (801) 387-4647 Having healthy history discussions with your family members can bring huge benefi ts. We can learn about our own risks, talk to our doctors about preventative medicine, have discussion with our partners and providers before beginning a pregnancy, and pass on this information to the next generation. By taking time to gather this information, you can help yourselves, your families, and your children live the healthiest lives possible.1. Go into these conversations prepared and identify the good historians in your family. 2. List the relatives who you plan to ask about; the most important relatives to you are your parents, brothers and sisters, and children. Start there and then branch out. 3. Think in advance about the questions you want to ask: Does anyone in the family have a chronic illness? Have they had cancer? When were they rst diagnosed? What caused family members to pass away? Is there anyone with mental disabilities or a birth defect? Have you ever had any genetic testing done? 4. Find a good time and space to talk. 5. Keep an organized record of these conversations. You may need to ll in some gaps or add new information in years to come. summer 2017 | 11Prenatal care is the health care that you receive while you are pregnant. Getting prenatal care early and frequently throughout your pregnancy is important for having a healthy pregnancy and delivery. Most women receive traditional prenatal care during their pregnancies. T raditional prenatal care is the care that most of us are familiar with; this type of care usually consists of multiple 10 to 15 minute one-on-one visits with your doctor. Th e visits are focused on making sure mom and the unborn baby are healthy. Typically, women seek separate childbirth preparation classes in addition to their traditional prenatal care. Th ere is another type of prenatal care, called \"Centering Prenatal Care\" or \"Group Prenatal Care,\" which is a relatively new patient- centered way to receive care. In this model, a group of women receive prenatal care together and are active participants in their health care. Th is unique model of prenatal care has been shown to improve some pregnancy outcomes, reduce risk of preterm birth and improve initiation of breastfeeding after baby is born. Centering Prenatal Care works a little diff erently than traditional prenatal care. Typically, a group of 8-12 women who are pregnant and due around the same time are chosen to be a part of the group. Th ese groups can include the patients' partners as well. Typically, the fi rst prenatal visit would still be a one-on-one visit with your doctor and would include an initial history and physical exam done at that time, including obtaining your prenatal labs and pap smear if needed. After that visit, women who are low-risk to moderate-risk in their pregnancy, would be grouped together based on their gestational age. Starting at 12 to 16 weeks of pregnancy, patients would meet as a group to receive their prenatal care. A typical visit would start off with the patients getting their own weight and blood pressures and recording them in their chart. After this, each patient would have her one-on-one time with the doctor, have the fetal heart rate monitored and abdomen/fundal height measured. During this time, the other women in the group are asked to fi ll out a self assessment form and to socialize with one another. After each patient has been examined, the group of women and their doctor and usually another provider (such as a midwife or nurse), come together and spend 30 to 40 minutes discussing a topic related to pregnancy and prenatal care. For example, this topic could be about nutrition and pregnancy, breastfeeding, whether or not to be induced, etc. After discussing this structured topic, there would be time to discuss what questions the group has. Th e group session can include discussing your self-assessments, questions about pregnancy, discussing particular pregnancy symptoms you may be experiencing and any other questions or concerns you may have at that time. Most visits take about 90 to 120 minutes and are scheduled around the same time as traditional prenatal care visits (usually 10 visits total, plus an additional visit during the GROUP PRENATAL CARE >>A New Approach summer 2017 | 13 12 | OB/GYN (801) 387-8350 WasatchOBGYN.org postpartum period). In Group Prenatal Care, most women will be provided with approximately 15 to 20 hours of contact time with the same obstetrics provider, in comparison with 2 to 3 hours of total contact time during 10 traditional individual prenatal visits. Providing prenatal care in the group format allows women to take charge of their prenatal care. Th ey become active participants in the medical system and learn how to take care of themselves. Th eir questions and concerns drive the curriculum. In addition to more patient autonomy, women receive more time for education regarding pregnancy and birth, often making an additional childbirth class not needed. Th e group setting also allows women to gain a support system during pregnancy and the postpartum period. If this sounds like something you'd like to participate in, please contact our offi ce. Wasatch OB/GYN is working on a pilot program to implement Group Prenatal Care in our practice.The group setting allows women to gain a support system during pregnancy and the postpartum period. summer 2017 | 13What is Blood Pressure? Blood pressure is the driving force in our body that keeps blood fl owing to every organ. It is fi rst generated by the powerful heart muscle and then maintained and transmitted by our blood vessels. Blood pressure has become synonymous with high blood pressure. For decades now, high blood pressure has been a well- recognized risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, and early death. High blood pressure is frequently referred to as the \"silent killer\" as no one knows what their blood pressure is, high or low, until they actually measure it. A majority of people will develop high blood pressure during their lifetime. How do I know what my blood pressure is? Your blood pressure will be taken at any check-up or medical appointment you may have. Intermountain Healthcare also provides blood pressure screenings at community health fairs throughout the year. What should my blood pressure be? Over the years, goal blood pressure has been a moving target in terms of what your blood pressure should be, or more importantly what it should be under. Again every patient is diff erent but as a general starting point, your systolic blood pressure (that's the top number) should be less than 140 mmHg, and the diastolic blood pressure (that's the bottom number) should be less than 90 mmHg. What can I do about it? Th e fi rst step to managing your blood pressure is to change how you eat by greatly decreasing the amount of salt in your diet. In 2017, a vast majority of salt in a typical American diet comes from two places: 1) eating outside of the home. Whether it is a fast food meal or the fi nest 5-star restaurant, the food tastes good because it is loaded with salt and 2) you salt your food after it hits the plate before you eat it. By limiting eating outside of the home to two times a week or less and throwing away your salt shaker, you can help your blood pressure. Making dietary and lifestyle changes (exercise) you can, on average, lower your blood pressure by about 10 mmHg (i.e. 145 mmHg -> 135 mmHg). So what about medication? If your blood pressure is signifi cantly elevated (>150/100 mmHg) it is very unlikely that diet and lifestyle changes alone will be enough to bring your blood pressure in a range that will reduce your risk of heart attacks, strokes, or early death. You need medications. Th e great thing about meds to treat your blood pressure is there are a lot of options. Th is means you and your doctor should be able to fi nd a regimen that works best for you. What about cost? A vast majority of blood pressure medications are generic and very aff ordable. In fact, if you Blood Pressure basics summer 2017 | 15 14 | on an expensive brand medication for your blood pressure, ask your doctor about switching to a cheaper alternative that will be just as eff ective. You can also look at it in other ways, think of the cost to be admitted to the hospital with a heart attack with costly procedures or high-risk surgeries. Spending pennies a day on your blood pressure pills may, in the future, save you tens of thousands of dollars.Want to know your blood pressure? There are many opportunities to accurately measure your blood pressure. A Doctor Appointment Health Fair Home Blood Pressure Cuff When will I stop the medication? More than likely you won't. Very rarely does high blood pressure have a \"cure.\" A vast majority of people will need lifelong therapy for their blood pressure. Remember that heart disease is a disease of aging, so being vigilant about controlling our risk factors (like high blood pressure) is a lifelong task. summer 2017 | 151 try to lose a few pounds All of us can benefi t from weight loss if overweight or obese, but just a 5% weight loss can reduce the likelihood of getting type 2 diabetes by 50%.

On the fl ip side, watching TV two or more hours a day boosts your risk for diabetes by 14%. 3 take a look at your diet Avoid \"Fad\" diets, stick to healthier diets and choices. Th e Mediterranean diet also has shown to have some benefi ts in diabetes prevention. Th is is a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds. Th is diet also incorporates olive oil as an important source of good fats (monounsaturated) as well as low to moderate amounts of fi sh, poultry, and dairy products and very little red meat. 4 talk to your doctor about possible medications Many medications have been studied, but the one for which there is the most evidence for preventing diabetes is metformin. Metformin is a medication which is most commonly used to normalize blood sugars for diabetics. Metformin decreases the glucose produced by the liver, reduces the amount of glucose absorbed in the intestine, and increases the sensitivity of cells to insulin. Interestingly enough, prediabetics that take metformin can have ongoing benefi t from this medication that lasts even when not taking it. Of course, improved diet and exercise with metformin are better than metformin alone. 5 get help!

When someone has diabetes, the main sign is elevated blood sugar, caused by either a lack of insulin (type 1), or by increasing resistance to insulin in the body, (type 2). While there is no known way to prevent type 1, there are ways to prevent type 2. Diabetes prevention includes a few simple lifestyle changes such as: healthy eating, increasing your physical activity and losing a few extra pounds. Making these changes now can help you avoid serious health complications in the future. Th e best way to get started is to know your risks. How Do I Know If I Am at Risk for Diabetes? Since making lifestyle changes can be benefi cial to preventing diabetes, it's important to know what habits you should work on changing. Here are some factors that may put you at higher risk for diabetes: Being overweight (BMI 26-29.9) or obese (BMI 30 or higher) Having a parent, brother or sister with diabetes Being African American, American Indian, Asian American, Paci c Islander, or of Hispanic American/Latino heritage Having a prior history of gestational diabetes or birth of at least one baby weighing more than nine pounds. Having high blood pressure, measuring 140/90 or higher Having abnormal cholesterol with HDL (\"good\") cholesterol is 35 or lower, triglycerides level is 250 higher. Being physically inactive\u2014exercising fewer than three times a week Any person with prediabetes (blood sugars elevated above normal, but not diabetic yet) If you have any of these factors, you may benefi t even more from prevention of diabetes, and the sooner the better.1 try to lose a few pounds All of us can benefi t from weight loss if overweight or obese, but just a 5% weight loss can reduce the likelihood of getting type 2 diabetes by 50%.

JAMEEL YOUSSEF , MD Rheumatologist MCKAY DEE HOSPITAL (801) 387-7125 MckayDeeRheumatology.org Gout is an infl ammatory arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints. Gout can aff ect any joint, but it most commonly aff ects the big toe. Gout is rare in men before the age of 40 and is rare in women before menopause Elevated uric acid levels in the blood is the main cause of gout. However, only 15% of people with a high uric acid level will eventually develop gout. In people with high uric acid levels, an accumulation of uric acid crystals in a joint can occur, which can trigger a gout attack. Uric acid crystals can also accumulate in the kidneys and cause kidney stones. In severe cases, the uric acid crystals can deposit below the skin and form nodules which are called tophi. What are the risk factors for gout? Th e risk factors for gout include: chronic kidney disease, a diet rich in meat and seafood, excess alcohol consumption (especially beer and hard liquor) and consumption of high fructose drinks (such as some sodas and juices). All of the above risk factors can increase the level of uric acid in the blood, which can cause gout. However, not every person with elevated uric acid levels will develop gout, as genetic and other environmental factors also play a role. How is gout diagnosed? Th e best way to confi rm the diagnosis of gout is to take a sample of fl uid from a joint during a gout fl are to look for uric acid crystals under a microscope. Th e presence of uric acid crystals inside the cells will confi rm the gout diagnosis, especially if infl ammatory cells are also seen with increased numbers in the synovial fl uids.GOUT What is the typical presentation of a gout attack? In 50% of people with gout, the fi rst attack usually presents with a sudden onset of pain, redness, and swelling in the big toe. In the other 50% of people, the fi rst gout attack can aff ect any other joint (especially the ankles, wrists, and/or the knees). Th is fl are can recur again after weeks, months, or years in the same joint or in a diff erent joint.

JAMEEL YOUSSEF , MD Rheumatologist MCKAY DEE HOSPITAL (801) 387-7125 MckayDeeRheumatology.org Usually, when people think of exercising, they picture weight lifting, walking on a treadmill, using an elliptical or utilizing other types of exercise equipment. It's true that these are a few eff ective ways that exercise can be accomplished, but there are a number of additional ways physical fi tness can be achieved without the need of a gym membership, extra equipment or traveling long distances from your home. Current research shows that routine movement, such as walking, can provide measurable benefi t. Living in northern Utah, this is excellent news as opportunities to walk, run or hike are all around us!

Th e use of video games, TV, tablets and smartphones have caused activity levels in children to decrease. Research has shown that regular aerobic activity during childhood will increase the chances of regular exercise as an adult. Adults engaging in meaningful fi tness with their children will not only benefi t themselves, but will improve the likelihood of healthy living for their children and others who surround them. Start an Exercise Program Many people wonder whether they are ready to start an exercise program. Th is can be intimidating at fi rst, but a few guidelines for general exercise can help make this more manageable. Always start slow and build up endurance gradually. Avoid periods of maximal exertion. Warm up prior to moderate aerobic exercise with dynamic stretching. (Start your intended exercise slowly and ramp up intensity). Traditional static stretching is most bene cial after exercise to prevent injury. Exercising after your largest meal of the day may improve blood sugar levels in people who are diabetic. When weight lifting, remember to balance workouts between opposing muscle groups (for example triceps and biceps). Include proteins into your diet. Drink plenty of water and avoid excessive caffeine. Wear proper socks and footwear. Use exercise apps and tness trackers to set and keep regular goals. For most people starting an exercise routine will be safe, but if you have questions whether you are healthy enough to participate in exercise due to chronic medical conditions it would be best to seek further instruction from your healthcare provider. During that visit a plan can be developed to meet your individualized needs and maintain safety. To get these benefi ts, it is recommended to do an equivalent of moderate aerobic exercise (such as a brisk walk) for at least 150 minutes per week. It is best when this is broken down into individual days. For most people getting 30 minutes of exercise fi ve to six days per week will be suffi cient. Spring, summer and fall bring many opportunities for outdoor activities. Within a short distance from home most people have access to paved or dirt pathways at community parks, mountain biking trails, road cycling or even something as close as walking in the neighborhood. One of the best places to fi nd some of these resources is through your local city website. Other resources in northern Utah include trail maps provided by county governments or local non-profi t organizations. COUNTY MAPS WEBER (weberpathways.org) DAVIS (daviscountyutah.gov/trails) CACHE (trails.cachecounty.org) Winter can make it more diffi cult for many people to walk, run or move due to colder temperatures, but some trails are still accessible for those who are willing to bundle up in warm winter clothes. Other options include: snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, walking indoors or outdoors, swimming at an indoor community pool or using at-home exercise videos or apps.

ALLISON MENCER, MD OB/GYN WASATCH OB/GYN (801) Pregnancy Hydrate Remember to stay hydrated! Drinking 64 ounces of water a day is always recommended, this is about 8-10 cups a day. However, when our body is ghting illness, this becomes even more important. Try adding a slice of lemon or lime. Try hot tea or a cool electrolyte lled sport drink or even a Popsicle! Especially if your throat hurts, the temperature of the liquid will help soothe your throat and the electrolytes will help re ll your system. Rest Make sure you get plenty of sleep. It can be dif cult to sleep when you are pregnant and not sick! Eight hours of sleep is recommended, with more needed when you are feeling sick and under the weather. Hand Hygiene Always wash your hands. This is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of germs. Using warm or cold water, apply soap and scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Tip! 20 seconds is about the time it takes to sing happy birthday song twice. Look to wash your hands multiple times throughout the day, of course we know to wash after the bathroom. Don't forget to wash before food prep for the family, or if you nd yourself touching your face (blowing your nose), go ahead and wash again.Flu Shot Getting your fl u shot is very important. Pregnant women are more likely to get the fl u and more likely to get complications from the fl u like pneumonia than non-pregnant women. Your immune system is suppressed when you are pregnant. Don't put yourself or your baby at increased risk by avoiding your fl u shot. Also, your baby cannot get vaccinated for the fl u until they are six months old. You have the opportunity to provide this protection to them via your vaccination while you are still pregnant. Most side effects are rare and mild, including sore arm, runny nose, or mild temperature. This should not prevent you from protecting yourself and your baby. Getting the fl u shot does not give you the fl u! The vaccine contains inactivated (killed) virus that your body uses to build an immune response against. Sore Throat? Try cough drops, or one of the sore throat sprays. These contain ingredients such as phenol or benzocaine that help soothe the throat via mild topical anesthetics. If requiring prolonged use, discuss with your doctor. Sniffl es, Cough, Congestion? Try putting a warm washcloth over your face to help break up your congestion. You can add a humidi er to your bedroom to help add moisture back into the air.\"Honey in your tea will take away that cold\" is what my grandmother said to me growing up. Our friends and family have plenty of recommendations on how to help us feel better when we are feeling under the weather. But how do we know it is safe when we are pregnant?

ALLISON MENCER, MD OB/GYN WASATCH OB/GYN (801) 387-8350 in PregnancySkin Care Tips for Aging SkinAging is a natural process, but many people go to great lengths to maintain a youthful appearance. Our skin ages due to factors that are out of our control, like genetics. But there are some factors we can control, like preventing sunburns and exposure to artifi cial and natural sunlight, making healthy lifestyle choices and supplying basic skin care needs for the maturing skin. While we cannot change our genetic make up, we can protect our skin by using sunscreen when outside, exercising regularly, eating a healthy and balanced diet, and seeking dermatologic advice for medical skin conditions and specifi c aesthetic options. PREVENTION Dermatologists agree that graceful aging simply starts with practicing sun protective behaviors. In our 30's and 40's, common signs of skin damage and aging include age spots, fi ne and deep wrinkles, visible small blood vessels, and white and brown skin discolorations with underlying red tones. Just like tobacco use can accelerate the aging process, artifi cial light (e.g., use of tanning beds) and natural sunlight will age the skin sooner and increase the risk of developing skin cancers. Sun protection as should begin early in childhood because the amount of sun exposure is cumulative over time and contributes to the greatest risk for development of melanoma, one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer. Prevention = Sunscreen Protection = Moisturizer Treatment = Retinoids/Cosmetic OptionsMajor Tips summer 2017 | 27 26 | Intermountain IntermountainClinics.org summer 2017 | 27 LANA PHO, DERMATOLOGY AND PLASTIC SURGERY (801) 387-4750 McKayDeeDermatology.org General recommendations include applying sunscreens that contain broad spectrum coverage (i.e., blocks ultraviolet light A and B) and natural minerals like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Black cement surfaces, snow, and water can refl ect the sun's ultraviolet rays and damage the skin. It is easy to forget to protect skin areas like the lips, back of the neck, ears, skin exposed by receding hairline, parted hair, chest and top and bottom of feet and hands. PROTECTION In general, skin of all ages should moisturize using creams as opposed to gels or lotions. Some gels have a higher alcohol content that can dry out the skin. Lotions may contain fewer enriching emollients. For those individuals who have sensitive skin, seek cosmetic products with labels including hypoallergenic, alcohol-free, and fragrance-free. In your teens and 20's, the skin readily accomplishes the processes to maintain minimal signs of skin damage and aging. However, given the production of oily skin and scalp, individuals in this age group are prone to acne. Irritating products, manual manipulation and squeezing of pores/acne, and coarse scrubs/brushes can worsen this common skin condition. In this age group, it is especially important to use sunscreen since the skin starts to slowly lose its ability to fi ght sunlight damage. In your 30's and 40's, retinoids along with sun protection and moisturizer, are a great combination for anti-aging by keeping skin smooth, lightening brown spots and diminishing wrinkles. However, some individuals who have a medical skin condition like psoriasis, eczema, or lupus cannot tolerate retinoids on their skin. In your 50's and senior years, dry scalp and skin are common problems. Th e skin loses its ability to retain moisture and water, and cannot readily shed old skin fl akes. Appearances of the mature skin becomes more pronounced and the breakdown in skin barrier contributes to potential skin irritants like hair dye, cosmetic products, and every day external factors like cold weather, wind, and pollutants. TREATMENT For some people, cosmetic and laser procedures are benefi cial. Th e benefi ts of these elective procedures include reversing and/or eliminating some skin aging signs. But lack of sun protection and making poor, unhealthy lifestyle choices can result in an earlier return to signs of distressed skin. Neuromodulators like Botox\u00ae, Xeomin\u00ae, and Dysport\u00ae can relax overactive muscles that contribute to formation of deep and fi ne wrinkles. Fillers like Juvederm\u00ae, Restylane\u00ae, and Belotero\u00ae, contain hyaluronic acid which is a substance naturally found in skin. When properly performed by trained medical professionals, fi llers enhance and restore volume to facial features like the cheeks, laugh lines, lip lines, and can smooth chin and forehead skin creases. Lasers have emerged as an alternative to facial surgery because lasers require minimal down time, and can target skin specifi c age spots. Laser treatments may require more than one visit and the results are immediate and long lasting. Laser skin resurfacing is considered the \"mini-face lift\" and strips the outer layer of the skin. Laser resurfacing tightens skin, triggers new skin collagen growth, and minimizes wrinkles. Th ere are specifi c lasers and medical grade chemical peels that can target brown spots and smooth skin texture at the same time. Pulse dye laser treatment can treat small blood vessels growths on the face and legs, and treat vascular birthmarks. Before considering aesthetic elective procedures, it is generally recommended that a Dermatologist perform a skin exam to check for any suspicious skin spots for possible skin cancer. Sometimes a skin growth may be incorrectly interpreted as an age spot but is actually a skin cancer. Smartphone apps like Spotmole\u00ae, MoleMapper\u00ae, and Mole Detective\u00ae off er a 2-dimensional quick check of skin moles and help you to identify a skin spot that needs further evaluation by a Dermatologist. Some of these apps can track your moles and send you reminder to check your moles and seek skin exams regularly\u2014this, of course, should routinely be incorporated into your skin care regimen.1. You can greatly improve the quality of aging skin by making healthy life choices like using sunscreen, eating a healthy balanced diet, exercising, moisturizing, and avoiding unhealthy behaviors like smoking and tanning. 2.Sun exposure is cumulative and will quicken the aging process of your skin. Sun exposure will also increase your chance of a skin cancer. It is important to begin sun protection at an early age. 3.Cosmetic and laser procedures can be helpful in addressing skin aging problems. However, you must take care of your skin after these procedures or else the results will not last. Care1. What in my personal and family history should I be worried about? Medical histories can identify people with higher-than-normal risks for certain disorders including heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes. Find out what your risks are and the lifestyle changes you should make to help prevent them. 2. What do I have, and what do I need to do? Keep a list of the recent and ongoing physical, mental, and emotional factors in your life that are most worrying you (e.g., sleep issues, heartburn, shortness of breath, stomach pain, fertility, bladder problems, sexual issues, anxiety, depression). Find out what the problems are, and the actions you can take to address them. 3. What vaccinations do I need? Into adulthood, we still need vaccinations including the annual fl u shot\u2014older adults should also ask about the shingles and pneumonia vaccines. If you travel outside of the country, mention your future travel plans and ask how you should prepare. 4. What preventive screening tests do I truly need? Guidelines for screenings such as cancer, bone density, blood sugar, cholesterol, thyroid function, and STDs vary by gender, age, and risks. Ask what is crucial to your health during your annual wellness visit with your primary care provider. 5. Is this test truly worth having for my treatment plan? During your visit, you may be off ered diagnostic testing to help your doctor develop a treatment plan. Ask whether such tests are truly worth having. If your treatment plan wouldn't change much based on the test and its results, perhaps the test really isn't worth having. 6. Do I need this procedure, or are there other options? Ask your doctor what the side eff ects are and if there are safer, simpler, and less expensive procedures or treatment options than the one your doctor suggests. Get the care you need and not what you don't need. 7. Are the medicines I'm taking still appropriate? Our bodies change over time, and the medicines we've taken over months or years might not be relevant anymore. No one wants to waste money on medicines that are no longer useful or safe. Bring a list of the prescriptions and supplements you're taking to your visit and go over them with your doctor. 8. Can I tell you what I heard? If your doctor instructed you on what to do but you're still confused, don't be nervous about asking your doctor to explain the treatment plan again. In this case, teach- back can be helpful, meaning your doctor will encourage you to tell him or her in your own words what actions you should take so you're both on the same page. Your doctor wants you to have clear expectations of what you're supposed to do and why, so that you're more able and likely to do it to stay healthy and self-manage your condition, which leads to better outcomes.

In aquatic therapy we use our pools and equipment to help decrease joint loading, improve pain, improve gait mechanics, and improve mobility and strength of any joint following injury or surgery. We have two Hydroworx pools. One of our pools has a zero-drop fl oor with the capability to raise the fl oor to be level to the deck surface and lower down to six feet. Th is system provides ease to the patients getting in and out of the pool, instead of using a lift or stairs to get in and out of the pool. Th is also allows incremental adjustments for various depths, which gives us the ability to gradually increase a patient's weight bearing. Th is pool also has a treadmill and fi ve diff erent underwater camera angles. Our other pool has stairs to get in and out of the water, a shallow end of three feet and a deeper end of four feet, along with a treadmill with two camera angles. Both pools have jets that create turbulence and resistance to swim, walk and exercise against. Th e treadmills can get up to 8 mph and the jets allow us to increase resistance further to mimic land based activities. supplement your therapy with AQUATIC THERAPY Call 801.38.SPORT for more information SUPPLEMENT YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPY Aquatic therapy helps to relieve pressure on joints, improve pain, improve walking pattern, and increase the mobility and strength of any joint following injury or surgery.

Aquatic Therapy summer 2017 | 35 34 | Intermountain Clinics IntermountainClinics.orgSTRETCHING It is important to be fl exible enough to move freely and be able to maintain ideal form. Focus on stretches for your thighs, calves, and hips. Pay attention to your body and areas that are particularly tight. STRENGTH TRAINING Having adequate strength in your hips, thighs, and core is key to providing support to the knee and preventing ACL injuries. Activities such as squats, single leg squats, lunges, lunges with a twist, walking lunges and single leg deadlifts are good places to start. CORE STRENGTH Improving muscle strength around your back, chest, and abdomen can improve overall form and decrease unnatural movement to the knee. For core strength use exercises such as side planks, hip bridges, chops and lifts, and multidirectional shuffl e steps. BALANCE EXERCISES Many injuries occur when an athlete is off balance. Balance exercises include (ball juggling) a single leg ball pass and other single leg activities. AGILITY TRAINING Get comfortable with agility and change of direction. Move in patterns that take you from front to back, side to side and diagonal. Start slowly to focus on good form. Always remember to keep your hips over your knees and your knees over your ankles. PRACTICE GOOD FORM Practice good jumping technique. Jump and land with your knees and feet pointing straight ahead. Do not allow for your knees and feet to bow or turn. Let your knees bend softly each time you land. Ask someone to watch your form and provide feedback. Remember to keep your chest high and have good alignment. Incorporate catching a ball while maintaining good form. Progress to jumping laterally while focusing on straight knees and feet. Increase speed but maintain form. In all of these exercises it is always important to keep proper form. Quality is always valued over quantity. Finally, and equally important, allow your body to rest. Don't let your busy schedule allow fatigue to impact your technique. Rest is essential. Make time for sleep, rest days, and alternate with lighter workouts. One of the most devastating athletic injuries is an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sprain or tear. Athletes who participate in high-impact sports like soccer, football, and basketball, are more likely to injure their ACL, but it can happen to anyone. In the leg there are three bones that meet to form the knee. Th ese include your femur (thigh), tibia (shinbone), and patella (kneecap). Th ese three bones are connected in your knee by four primary ligaments. Th ese ligaments include two collateral ligaments and two cruciate ligaments. Th e medial collateral ligament (MCL) is on the inside and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) is on the outside of the knee. Th ese ligaments control the sideways motion of the knee and brace it against unnatural movement. Th e anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is located at the front of the knee and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is located at the back. Cruciate ligaments cross in front and back of the knee forming an X and control the back and forth motion of the knee. SPRAINS AND TEARS Ligaments that are injured are referred to as sprains and are graded on a scale of severity. GRADE 1 SPRAINS Mild damage. In a grade 1 the ligament has been slightly stretched but still provides the knee joint with stability. GRADE 2 SPRAINS Partial tear.Th is is where the ligament has been stretched to the point where the joint has become loose and lacking in stability. GRADE 3 SPRAINS Complete tear.Th ese types of sprains are most commonly referred to as a complete tear of the ligament. Th e ligament has been split in to two separate pieces. Th is makes the knee joint completely unstable. Most ACL injuries are complete or near complete tears falling in the Grades 2 or 3 category. Th ere are many causes for these types of tears. Th ey include: rapid change of direction, sudden stopping, slowing down while running, landing incorrectly from jumping or direct impact from a collision. WHO IS AT RISK? Th ere are several factors that put people at higher risk of ACL injuries. Risk factors that can be controlled include areas like high BMI, jumping and landing mechanics, hormones, and using an appropriate playing surface. Risk factors that are non-modifi able include areas such as genetics, age, gender, and anatomy of the knee. Th ose with a previous ACL tear are 15% more likely to re-injure the previously repaired ACL. One of the most notable diff erences that put an athlete at risk is gender. Females are four to six times more likely than males to sustain an ACL injury. In fact, females who play soccer or basketball year round have an ACL tear rate of approximately 1 in every 20 athletes. Many factors contribute to women being at higher risk for ACL injuries. Th ese include strength, genetics, performance patterns, and anatomy.Preventing ACL Injury Things you can do to prevent injury Many things can be done at home to help prevent ACL injuries.
