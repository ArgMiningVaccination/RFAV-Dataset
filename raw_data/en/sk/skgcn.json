See page 5ABOVE: Our patients are in good hands.3When you walk the /f_loors of The Miriam as often as we do, you get the privilege of bearing witness to what Delivering health with care looks like in action. You also gain perspective on what an enormous undertaking it is to keep our hospital functioning at the highest of levels, day in and day out. But what really stands out are the people: the ones receiving care and those delivering care. Each is unique, yet all are bound together by their shared humanity.In this Miriam Memo, we detail how we are leaning into that humanity to create a more integrated and holistic care experience for our patients and our sta. We also share a grateful family story, introduce you to our new chief medical ocer, and shine a spotlight on groundbreaking research underway as well as leading-edge technology we recently acquired.Of course, we can't talk about all the good things happening here without talking about the good people who help make them possible\u2014our supporters. Simply put, the extraordinary generosity of people like you sustains us. That's why we recognize and celebrate members of our donor family in every issue of Miriam Memo, and this one is no exception.We hope you enjoy reading this issue and we thank you for your commitment to The Miriam.With deepest appreciation,Maria Ducharme, DNP, RN President, The Miriam Hospital Susan H. KaplanChair, The Miriam Hospital Foundation Board of Trustees Susan H. Kaplan Lawrence A. Aubin, Sr.Chairman, Lifespan Board of Directors Chairman, The Miriam Hospital Board of TrusteesFor nearly a century, The Miriam has maintained a special relationship with the community it serves; one that is deeply rooted in the belief that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.As part of Lifespan, the state's largest academic health system, The Miriam embraces a similar \"team\" philosophy. Our collaborations with world-class clinicians, researchers, and educators enable us to touch more lives and realize better outcomes\u2014and it's your extraordinary support that makes so much of our work possible. And for that, I am forever grateful. Thank you. Maria Ducharme, DNP, RN 4A cut above! Staff holds impromptu ribbon-cutting to \"welcome\" its new advanced state-of-the-art equipment to the team.For over 50 years, The Champlin Foundation has been a proud supporter of The Miriam. Recently, the organization awarded $941,638 to the hospital for the purchase of advanced /f_luoroscopy and endoscopy equipment./uni00A0 \"The latest Champlin grant re/f_lects a long-held goal of the foundation to fund state-of-the-art medical equipment at our area hospitals,\" explains Nina Stack, Executive Director of The Champlin Foundation. \"We believe this support helps ensure that high-quality care is available to Rhode Islanders without the need to travel out of state.\" Speci/f_ically, the money was used to procure an Omega Arti/f_icial Intelligence Image-Guided E-View System (a state-of-the-art /f_luoroscopy machine); an Olympus light source and processor to capture and store endoscopic images; and a portable anesthesia machine for safer, deeper sedation.'The star of the show'The Olympus equipment is a supplement to what The Miriam already has and will help expand capacity, and the portable anesthesia machine will increase the department's /f_lexibility. Each of those devices plays a critical role, but Neil Greenspan, MD, Director of Endoscopy for the Miriam Hospital, says the Omega is \"the star of the show.\" Designed for use with endoscopic procedures, the Omega has features speci/f_ically developed for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ERCP, a procedure used to diagnose diseases of the gallbladder, biliary system, pancreas, and liver. \"Previously, endoscopy enabled us to see only into the lumen of the GI tract; the esophagus, stomach, and intestines,\" Dr. Greenspan explains. \"But with /f_luoroscopy, we now have the ability to see through walls into the bile duct, pancreas, and other body cavities and capture incredibly detailed X-ray images.\" While /f_luoroscopy is an invaluable tool, Dr. Greenspan adds it also carries with it the risks associated with any type of ionizing radiation. So, for the safety of the patient and sta it is important to limit the radiation to the smallest dose necessary\u2014and the Omega does that better than any other oering.\"Through the use of arti/f_icial intelligence and special /f_luoro shielding, the Omega has been shown to reduce radiation exposure up to 84 percent,\" Dr. Greenspan reports. \"This technology is far superior to anything else available in 2022.\"Part of a broader upgrade Upgrades have also been made to the existing four procedure rooms and their ancillary areas.\"It's a contiguous space now, and we are able to oer patients a fully integrated, seamless experience from admission through procedure, recovery, and discharge,\" Dr. Greenspan says, \"and it keeps the patient at the center of everything, which is where they belong.\"GRANT FUNDS CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY SUSTAINING THE FUTURE OF THE MIRIAM'S AWARD-WINNING NURSING CARE5Perhaps the biggest challenge facing hospitals across the country today is an unprecedented stang shortage, especially when it comes to nurses. And while The Miriam Hospital has not been immune to the eects of the current health care climate, the power of philanthropy is helping to ensure its rich tradition of nursing excellence continues into the future.Thanks to a transformational gift of $1 million from Carol and Fred Levinger, The Miriam has created The Carol and Fred Levinger Nursing Excellence Fund. The fund will support The Miriam nurses with student loan repayment and tuition assistance, and encourage continuing education. Maybe best of all is that the couple was inspired to give following the patient experience of a family member.\"I can't overstate the extraordinary care our loved one received, or the dierence that care made in their outcome,\" said Fred. \"It made us want to give, and recognizing the shortage of nurses nationally, we wanted to do something that made an impact here.\"A key element of the Levinger's gift is to further deepen The Miriam's recruitment and retention program for nurses. Building o its long, decorated history of nursing, the hospital will focus funds on supporting career development for the next generation of nurses and advance opportunities for ongoing nurse education.\"The Levinger's gift leaves me without words\u2014we are beyond grateful to Carol and Fred for their generosity and commitment to the vital role nurses play at The Miriam,\" said Maria Ducharme, DNP, RN, the hospital's president. \"Always, and particularly during these times, we want our nurses and clinical sta to feel valued and appreciated. It is tremendous that we are now able to invest even more in our most vital asset, which is our people.\" The Miriam has received the coveted Magnet designation for nursing excellence six consecutive times, placing the hospital among an elite group of hospitals internationally to achieve the distinction this number of times. Magnet recognition is awarded by the American Nurses Credentialing Center and is the highest honor available for professional nursing practice. \"It's one thing to hear or read stories about the dierence nurses make in the delivery of care; it is something else entirely when you experience it through a member of your family,\" added Carol. \"The Miriam is a special place when it comes to nursing, and we wanted to give back to help make sure it continues well into the future.\"SUSTAINING THE FUTURE OF THE MIRIAM'S AWARD-WINNING NURSING CARE \"I can't overstate the extra- ordinary care our loved one received, or the dierence that care made in their outcome. \" \u2014Fred Levinger 6THE MIRIAM RECEIVES $11.1M GRANT AND RESILIENCEIn September 2021, Mark Deitch, MD, MBA, was named The Miriam Hospital's new Senior Vice President of Medical Aairs and Chief Medical Ocer. Here, Dr. Deitch talks about joining The Miriam team, the scope of his new position, and the power of philanthropy.What motivated you to come to The Miriam?I had been working in hospital executive positions for a long time, primarily in orthopedics, which is my clinical background. But I wanted the opportunity to make a broader contribution to a health system. I was well aware of The Miriam's great reputation from my time in Providence; I graduated from Brown University, as did my wife and two kids. When I was contacted about the position, I quickly learned that every wonderful thing I had heard about The Miriam was true. More than that, the health care environment here is truly unique. You have this incredible, multi-decades-long history of nursing excellence coupled with the most engaged physician and support sta I have ever seen. The prospect of working alongside such patient- and community-centric, invested people\u2014in a world-class academic medical setting, no less\u2014was very exciting to me.Can you give us an overview of your role and responsibilities?In broad strokes, I'm part of a dyad leadership model, along with the chief nursing ocer, and responsible for the clinical output of the hospital and ambulatory oces that are under the oversight of The Miriam. Ensuring that all sta adhere to safety standards and provide the highest quality of medical care to our patients are central to my role, as is working on metric- and data-driven quality measures to further improve the services we provide.How does philanthropy support The Miriam's driving mission of Delivering health with care?Philanthropy is key to what we do, and the impact of donor funding touches many areas. It helps make our research possible; supports the creation of facilities as well as inpatient and outpatient services; and it provides the resources we need to bring the latest technologies\u2014for example, advanced robotics for urology and general surgery\u2014here to The Miriam. During the pandemic, donor funding also helped us bring wellness programs to our sta, who were often under immense stress and stretched thin. Being able to oer our people mindfulness techniques, massage, and other integrative care services enabled them to be better equipped to care for themselves and our patients. So, quite simply, we could not execute our mission to serve the community at the highest level without the generosity of our donors. It really is that critical.MEET DR. MARK DEITCHThe RECEIVES $11.1M GRANT TO RESEARCH STRESS, TRAUMA, AND RESILIENCEAdverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, are traumatic events that occur in children's lives before they reach the age of 18; neglect, violence, sexual abuse, and food insecurity are examples. Scienti/f_ic evidence suggests that ACEs are linked to chronic health problems later in life, including depression, substance abuse, mental illness, obesity, cardiovascular disorders, and a host of other conditions.In January of 2020, Laura R. Stroud, PhD, Director of The Miriam's Center for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine, along with Audrey R. Tyrka, MD, PhD, and a team of scientists submitted a proposal seeking federal funding to launch a bold and innovative initiative to study this disturbing connection and help ensure kids and families get the interventions they need during sensitive periods of their development.\"We are in historically challenging times,\" says Dr. Stroud. \"So, I don't think there's ever been a more important time to be studying stress, trauma, and resilience and how that aects young people\u2014particularly those in underserved communities.\" In October 2021, The Miriam Hospital received an $11.1 million grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences\u2014part of the National Institutes of Health\u2014to fund the creation of a Phase I Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) for Stress, Trauma, and Resilience (STAR) at The Miriam.Structurally, the center is comprised of an Administrative Core\u2014which includes an external advisory committee and a state-of-the-art mentoring program to allow early career researchers to compete for external funding\u2014and two Research Cores. The Technology, Assessment, Data, and Analysis Core supports methods harnessing cutting-edge technology, data management and statistics, and houses a cross-project data and measures repository. The Community Collaborative Core, supports a community advisory board, develops and sustains community partnerships, and assists in the recruitment and retention of disadvantaged and minoritized populations. The center hosts monthly seminars as well as an annual symposium focused on novel topics in stress, trauma, and resilience.Research underway at COBRE includes a project investigating the impact of childhood maltreatment on adolescent cognitive control, repetitive negative thinking, and mental health symptoms. There is also a clinical trial examining the impact of food insecurity and poverty-related stressors on diet, in/f_lammatory and metabolic biomarkers, and summer weight gain. The COBRE is also in the process of recruiting new early career faculty and developing novel research projects to mitigate the impact of toxic stress across the lifespan. But, Dr. Stroud says, this is only the beginning. \"Our goal is to make The Miriam a vibrant regional and national hub for transformative research in this /f_ield and help to develop the kinds of novel interventions that improve outcomes and changes lives.\" 8Every day, joy and heart-break wash across us with equally unpredictable force.\"That quote, from a 2014 Lifespan television ad, is perhaps truer today than when it /f_irst aired. Because during the past few years, patients and caregivers alike have faced once-in-a-century challenges brought about by COVID-19 and its residual fallout. In response, The Miriam has implemented measures aimed at improving the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of its sta\u2014who, in turn, are better able to provide patients with an enhanced level of service; one that emphasizes things like comfort, empathy, kindness, and understanding.\"Now more than ever, we are embracing and prioritizing the 'human experience' in health care,\" says Maria Ducharme, DNP, RN, President of The Miriam. \"Broadly speaking, this is an expansion of the patient experience model and looks beyond quality, safety, and clinical excellence to include and integrate the sum of all interactions on all sides of the care equation\u2014encounters with patients, families, and community partners, as well as doctors, nurses, and support sta. If we can improve those interactions, we can improve outcomes . . . for everyone.\"Caring for the caregiversOne way The Miriam is working to do this is through the recent launch of The Human Experience Center (HEC)\u2014a new training, education, and activity initiative that aims to re-energize hospital sta. Improving resiliency skills, setting up a best practice rounding program, and coaching sta on how to have critical conversations or deal with dicult people are just a few examples of HEC oerings. There are also fun events like cookouts, contests, and giveaways; elements intended to boost morale and lower stress.\"It's really about caring for the caregivers and fostering a culture that recognizes and rewards their work,\" explains Jeni Mowry, manager of volunteer and customer services at The Miriam, and a champion of the HEC. The kicko for the HEC took place April 27, during National Patient Experience Week, and was marked by the launch of \"All Hands On Deck,\" a playing cards-inspired program that oers sta brief, weekly micro trainings in four categories: Communication, Diversity, Engagement, and Teamwork.\"The symmetry for the promotion worked perfectly,\" Jeni explains. \"There are 52 cards and four suits, and there are 52 weeks in a year and four categories of education and activity.\" The goal, she adds, is to keep THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE: TAKING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO CARE EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE HUMANEXPERIENCEPATIENTEXPERIENCE \"9things simple and not add anything too taxing to a sta that already has a lot on their plates. \"I want it to be relevant and meaningful for them, but not hard.\" Early returns have been promising, as enthusiasm and participation are building quickly.It's important to note that the HEC is donor supported. The Miriam Hospital Foundation Board, through an annual allocation transfer from the unrestricted endowment, have made funds available to invest in equipment, program needs, research, training, or sta. Directors and managers at The Miriam were eligible to submit RFPs for grants of $10,000 to $250,000 for their targeted projects. Jeni was awarded $225,000, which will be used to underwrite all year-one training, technology, and infrastructure and hire two Human Experience Specialists and a Human Experience Analyst, who will help facilitate the program.Integrative therapiesIn addition to the HEC, The Miriam's Integrative Therapy Program, which launched in April of 2019 thanks to philanthropic support, also administers whole-person care with a focus on the human touch. Originally, a team of certi/f_ied holistic nurses began oering Reiki, guided imagery, hand and full massage, and other relaxation techniques as a nonpharmacological intervention for patients suering with pain, anxiety, nausea, and fatigue. Unfortunately, COVID-19 forced the suspension of the program for months during 2020. But when it returned, its reach was expanded to include supporting sta.\"We cannot provide excellent care to our patients unless we are caring for each other,\" says Diane Mahoney, program manager and one of the founding nurses of The Miriam's Integrative Therapy Program. Throughout her almost 30-year career at The Miriam, Diane has intuitively cared for her patients utilizing holistic therapies that nurture their body, mind, and spirit\u2014and the demand and need for those services, she says, are only growing. \"Our 2021 monthly data shows the number of sta using integrative therapies increased from 49 in January to 210 in December,\" she points out, \"and a similar increase for patients using integrative therapies, growing from 172 in January to 242 in December. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, too.\"Bottom line: when you increase compassion and capacity, the result is a better human experience.THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE: TAKING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO CARE Nurse receiving a relaxation massage Nurses practicing yoga Staff at the HEC kickoff party 10\"I'm grateful for the life I have and the life I've been able to build, and giving back to The Miriam is one way of showing that appreciation and paying it forward. \" \u2014Thomas MattThomas Matt's life has been a rich, colorful ride of interesting and meaningful experiences, which have informed, shaped, and brought the 69-year-old philanthropist to a singular, sel/f_less conclusion: Giving is living.\"I was brought up in a family where giving back was a way of life,\" he says, \"and at an early age, my late brother, Michael, and I knew that it was our parents' intention to give what they had to charity upon their passing. We were both OK with that because we understood the 'greater good' impact of their actions.\"Today, Tom /f_inds himself following in his parents' footsteps by generously committing a portion of his estate to The Miriam Hospital.\"My relationship with The Miriam began 12 years ago, when I learned I was HIV positive,\" he explains. \"I was so scared at the time, but the people at the hospital waylaid my fears and cared for me in a way that was compassionate and nonjudgmental. As I found out more about the history of the hospital, why it was established, and how everybody who comes through its doors is treated the same special way, I wanted to support their lifesaving work.\"Tom accumulated wealth as a corporate executive specializing in innovative product development and grew his fortune through real estate dealings and wise investments. But at 62, he switched gears, earning a master's degree in social work, and heading down a dierent path. In 2017, after his partner of 38 years, Carl Henry Knerem, passed away, Tom's resolve to give back to care organizations only strengthened.Now a member of The Miriam's/uni00A0Living Heritage Society, Tom has designated approximately 20 percent of the net value of his estate to go to the hospital upon his passing, with half supporting immunology services. \"More than 70 percent of the individuals in Rhode Island who are HIV+ are connected with primary medical care through the center at The Miriam,\" he shares, \"and I want to help increase access to those services.\" The remaining half of Tom's planned giving will go to the hospital's most critical needs. Additionally, Tom is committing to annual gifts. His most recent came in December 2021, when he donated $7,000 to the Immunology Center Patient Assistance Fund and $3,000 to provide seed money for a Complementary Medicine Services program.For more information about The Living Heritage Society please contact Chris Josephson at (401) 444-6412 or chris.josephson@lifespan.org, or visit lifespan.org/TMHLegacy.FOR DONOR THOMAS MATT, GIVING IS LIVING PHILANTHROPY HELPS TO CREATE PROGRAM FOR CARDIAC REHABILITATION PATIENTS11Thanks to the philanthropy of a mother and her children, The Miriam Hospital has a new program bene/f_itting its cardiac rehabilitation patients. Named The Rabbi Benjamin Marcus Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program, the support service began this past April and is oered to the 500+ patients enrolled annually in the hospital's Cardiopulmonary Maintenance Program.The program was made possible by an endowed gift from Bess Marcus, MD, along with additional funds that covered the program's start-up costs. The gifts were made in memory of Dr. Marcus' father, who was a past cardiac patient at The Miriam.\"It's been proven that stress reduction improves cardiovascular health, and having seen what my father went through in life related to his heart issues, this is a program he would have bene/f_ited from and that we wanted to help bring to others,\" says Dr. Marcus, who is a professor of Behavioral and Social Sciences at the Center for Health Promotion and Health Equity at Brown University's School of Public Health. \"The Miriam is home to world-class cardiac care and this furthers the continuum of what they oer.\"Mindfulness-based stress reduction is a meditation therapy originally designed for stress management, but also found eective in treating chronic pain, depression, hypertension, anxiety, and other conditions. At The Miriam, it is oered to patients recovering from cardiopulmonary events such as open heart surgery, a heart attack or stent implantation, heart or lung transplant, or pulmonary disease.\"Stress, anxiety and other mental health conditions aect many people and can arise from, or worsen, their concurrent cardiovascular disease,\" said Wen-Chih H Wu, MD, MPH, Director of the Lifespan Cardiovascular Institute Wellness and Prevention Center. \"Providing stress management is one of the core components of cardiovascular rehabilitation. Thanks to this generous gift, we now oer our patients a sustainable tool to combat stress and improve overall health.\"The eight-week program teaches patients to manage stress and reduce the negative health consequences it causes by developing their own mindfulness practice through meditation and mindful movement. At its core, the program empowers individuals to take better care of themselves and participate fully in improving their health and quality of life.\"Most patients are with us for 8 to 12 weeks, and during that time, there are a number of essentials they focus on, like nutrition, exercise and strength, and the importance of stress management,\" said Julianne DeAngelis, MS, FAACVPR, CCRP, program manager for The Miriam's Cardiac, Pulmonary, Vascular, and Risk Reduction Programs. \"The addition of this new mindfulness program takes that management to the next level for patients who need it\u2014what a tremendous example of the extras that philanthropy makes possible. We're so grateful to Bess and her family for their generosity and commitment to our hospital.\" PHILANTHROPY HELPS TO CREATE PROGRAM FOR CARDIAC REHABILITATION PATIENTS12 NEW HOME FOR INNOVATIVE CANCER RESEARCH TAKING SHAPE Exciting progress is being made on an important project that was the focus of last year's gala and auction fund-a-need eort: The Center for Innovative Cancer Research at The Miriam Hospital. Dollars raised through the 2021 event were targeted for the physical creation of/uni00A0the center, which is intended to establish The Miriam as a leading provider for advanced, highly novel cancer treatments not only in Rhode Island, but regionally and nationally. To date, $1,410,759 has been raised in support of the initiative, including a major gift commitment from Stephen and Diana Lewinstein, for whom the space will be named. Additionally, a generous $200,000 grant from the Warren Alpert Foundation was secured to support a new model of multi-trained research nurse that will bring patient-centered palliative care to the forefront, with a view toward easing patient stress and discomfort.Building momentumOnce /f_inished, the world-class facility\u2014housed in a reimagined space on Fain 3\u2014will feature a staed treatment area with four infusion bays, family space, an updated nursing station, and a conference room with the latest technology, among other amenities. The thoughtful design incorporates ample workspace and storage accommodations to optimize sta eciency and strikes a visual balance that supports both patient privacy and safety.

(BPI) and The Miriam Hospital together\u2014because the two have a symbiotic relationship based on their shared, overarching goals of improving public health and wellness and engaging with and investing in the communities they serve.\"For many of us, The Miriam reminds us of why we went into medicine in the /f_irst place: to have a direct, positive impact on our communities,\" explains Angela Caliendo, MD, PhD, President of Brown Physicians, Inc. and Executive Vice Chair, Department of Medicine. BPI is/uni00A0a community-based, not-for-pro/f_it, The/uni00A0Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown/uni00A0University.

Composed of six foundations\u2014Brown Dermatology, Brown Emergency Medicine, Brown Medicine, Brown Neurology, Brown Urology, and Brown Surgical Associates\u2014BPI employs nearly 500 physicians, many of whom practice at The Miriam and throughout the Lifespan system.In addition to teaming up on clinical and educational endeavors, BPI is also a loyal member of the hospital's donor family. The group is a perennial and generous sponsor of The Miriam Hospital Gala & Auction, most recently donating $25,000 in support of the 2022 event. \"We view The Miriam Hospital as a true partner in advancing health care in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts,\" Dr. Caliendo says, \"and we are incredibly proud to support them.\"Supporter Spotlight: BROWN PHYSICIANS, INC.Of primary importance is that the new facility helps patients feel welcomed, relaxed, and at the center of their care\u2014principles re/f_lective of The Miriam's commitment to humanistic medicine. The sun-/f_illed environment will oer calming, organic colors along with natural lighting intended to create a home-like setting for patients and their family members or companions, making hours spent at the center a little easier to bear. Giving hope, extending livesWhile The Miriam already oers state-of-the-art cancer clinical research trials that provide Rhode Islanders access to some of the latest cutting-edge cancer drugs, having a dedicated center on campus will allow the hospital to increase the number of clinical trials and lessen patient wait time to initiate new therapies. It will also ensure that local patients stay local and do not have to travel out of state\u2014or even leave their care team\u2014to access the most advanced treatments and clinical studies. Everything oered at large cancer centers will be available right here in Rhode Island at The Miriam. But perhaps most importantly, the center will oer renewed hope to patients whose cancers have become worse\u2014despite receiving all standard treatments\u2014and are searching for the most advanced and humanistic options to extend their lives.\"The dream is going to become a reality,\" reports Howard Safran, MD, Chief of Hematology/Oncology, Lifespan Cancer Institute at Rhode Island, The Miriam, and Newport hospitals. \"The frame of the space is beautiful, and the architectural plans and construction are living up to what was envisioned. More importantly, the completed environment will enable us to deliver an enhanced level of world-class care to patients and families.\" \"The dream is going to become a reality. \" \u2014Howard Safran, MD14From an early age, Reily Feliz knew he wanted to work in medicine. His sister was a nurse and he had always marveled at what she did. \"I decided to get my foot in the door by becoming a nursing assistant, but it was hard to /f_ind a course because the pandemic had just begun,\" recalls the 20-year-old. \"Then I found Lifespan's workforce development program.\"Built by Lifespan and integrated across its hospitals, including The Miriam, the workforce development program, called Workforce Solutions Training and Team (STAT), is unique in comparison to those of other health systems in the country. Here, the program provides opportunities for both entry positions and long-term careers. Lifespan also covers the costs of trainings, oers a comprehensive internship experience, and provides other resources including case management and /f_inancial supports. In late 2021, the Lifespan Foundation received a $10 million commitment from the Papitto Opportunity Connection to expand the program with a focus on hiring more than 1,000 BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) individuals over the next four years. The program also works closely with, and receives support from, the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, and the Governor's Workforce Investment Board. By April 2020, Reily was in full swing in his N.A. class, being held virtually by Lifespan at a time other programs in the state had shut down. An eager learner, it wasn't long before Reily was ready for his internship, which took him to The Miriam to work on 4 East. That August, he was oered a position on that very /f_loor.\"The experience was amazing\u2014I was hired before my internship was even /f_inished,\" he says with a smile. But Reily's pursuit of his dream didn't end there. Working full time, he enrolled in nursing school and, as of this past January, took a new position in The Miriam's Emergency Department. \"If not for the no-cost training and the resources I was given to build myself up professionally, I honestly would have struggled to get to where I am today,\" says Reily. \"I feel blessed to be at The Miriam.\"\"Sta really embraces this program on so many levels\u2014it's a great way to become familiar with how we do things and what we like to call 'The Miriam Way,'\" says Natasha Escudero, BSN, RN-BC, Assistant Clinical Manager on 4 East. \"It's all about training them how you'd want your coworker to work, because these are individuals who ultimately might work alongside you.\"Reily is working hard toward his degree and expects he'll be prepared to work as a full-time nurse by the end of 2022. And he wants to do so here. It is the \"huge\" dierence his time at The Miriam has made that Reily credits for where he knows his path can take him. \"No matter how much you read or study, you can't absorb it fully until you see it and that's exactly what The Miriam has given me. Knowing I could possibly work as a nurse in a hospital like this is all the motivation I need to /f_inish school.\"PROVIDING A PATHWAY TO PURSUING DREAMS \" ...
