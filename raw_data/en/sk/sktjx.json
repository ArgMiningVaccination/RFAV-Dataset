V ol. 01-8Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation ofall administrative rulemaking documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official text notice and full text of such actions. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of a rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral orwritten, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Legal Notice. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rulemaking activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 00-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2000, Bulletin 01-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2001, etc. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 1 refers to January; Volume No. 2 refers to February; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January of 2001 is citedas Volume 01-1, the December 1999 Bulletin is cited as Volume 99-12. The March 2000 Bulletin is cited as Volume 00-3. RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rulesthat have been adopted and approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are not printed in the Administrative Code and are published only in the Bulletin. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Index of Administrative Rulemaking , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process comprises five distinct activities; Proposed, Negotiated, Temporary, Pending, and Final rulemaking. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULE Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested parties and the agency seek a consensus on the content of the rule. Agencies are encouraged to proceed through this informal rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of the text in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should lead theIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 5 August 1, 2001 - V ol. 01-8rulemaking to the temporary and/or proposed rule stage. PROPOSED RULE A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency in which the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish anotice of proposed rulemaking in the Bulletin. The notice of proposed rulemaking must include: a) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule.As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does nothave an assigned effective date unless published in conjunction with a temporary rule docket. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULE Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requirements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular session of the legislature unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as that of the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a temporary/proposed rule. State law requires that the text of a proposed or temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may rescind a temporary rule that has been adpoted and is in effect if the rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or has been published concurrently with a proposed rulemaking that is being vacated.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 6 August 1, 2001 - V ol. 01-8PENDING RULE A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking process and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the Notice of Pending Rule. This includes: a) the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; and d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge.Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed ifthe subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonsably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, onlythe Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are republished. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the Notice of Pending Rule is published. FINAL RULE A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking process and is in effect. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that the agency has violated the legislative intent of the statuteunder which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution will be adopted rejecting, amending, or modifying the rule or any part thereof. A Notice of Final Rule must be published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule that has been reviewed by thelegislature and has not been rejected, amended, or modified will become final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule which is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided inthe rule.

HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are\"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.060.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"IDAPA 38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration. \"05.\" refers to Title 05 which is the Department of Administration's Division of Purchasing. \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\". \"060.\" refers to Major Section 060, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\". \"02.\" refers to Subsection 060. 02. \"c.\" refers 060.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subparagraph 060.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 8 August 1, 2001 - V ol. 01-8DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule do cketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER\". The \"Docket Number\" is a series of numbers separated by ahyphen \"-\", (38-0501-0101). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two-digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0101\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" (Chapter 01). \"0101\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket submitted and published during the year; in this case the first rulemaking action of the chapter published in calendar year 2001. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section\"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: \"(BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)\" INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows : \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" It may also be cited to include the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter number also, as TITLE number of the agency rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the agency rule. \"201\" references the main Section number of the rule that is being cited. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, 'Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.'\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 9 August 1, 2001 -

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The proposed changes to these rules are to eliminate the retroactive requirement for ticket printers for vehicle mounted metering systems, to delete obsolete language referencing National Bureau of Standards (NBS), to add datespecific editions of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbooks (HB) 44 and HB 133 as adopted by reference, to delete references to documents no longer in print and add a website address for reference documents.

IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 40 September 5, 2001 - V ol. 01-9IDAPA 10 - IDAHO BOARD OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS AND PROFESSIONAL LAND SURVEYORS 10.01.01 - RULES OF PROCEDURE DOCKET NO. 10-0101-0101 NOTICE OF TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED RULEMAKING EFFECTIVE DA TE: The effective date of the temporary rule is September 5, 2001. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed regular rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 54-1208, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2001. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The rule amendments would discontinue the practice of allowing candidates who fail to pass an examination the opportunity to review questions, if those questions will be repeated on subsequent administrations of the examination. They would more closely align the academic requirements for equivalency with an accredited engineering programfor those who do not possess an engineering degree. They would eliminate references to \"corporation\" where the more inclusive term \"business entity\" is more appropriate. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(b) and 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: In order to protect the public health, safety, or welfare, persons who fail a licensing exam should not be allowed to review problems that might appear on a subsequent exam. To do so might give them an unfair advantage over those first-time takers of the exam, resulting in a person who is not truly minimally competent being issued a license. Inorder to confer the benefit of the opportunity of taking a licensing exam or receiving a license by comity to those who do not possess an engineering degree, but have completed coursework normally associated with an engineering curriculum, the specific courses necessary to demonstrate equivalency should align with those commonly associatedwith an accredited program. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the rule changes are necessary to protect the public, are primarily administrative in nature, and comply withcurrent statutes.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The Department is piloting a utilization management program for developmental disabilities services. If approved by the 2002 Legislature, the changes will be implemented across the state. Temporary rules were adopted on July 23, 2001 and amended on August 17, 2001 in response to public comment. The changes made by the amended temporary rule appear in italics, and include both deletions and additional language. Since the text of the original temporary Utilization Management rules is new language, it appears underlined. Some of that new language is being struck in the amendment of the temporary rule, and so will also showas a strikeout. These rule changes for Developmental Disabilities Agencies (DDA), Targeted Services Coordination (TSC), and Developmental Disabilities waiver services incorporate Utilization Management rules in IDAPA 16.03.09, Sections 824 through 853. The development of Utilization Management Rules in IDAPA 163.03.09, Sections 824 through 853 allows the Department to implement a pilot program in Region II.DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0309-0103 Medical Assistance Program Temporary Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 108 September 5, 2001 - V ol. 01-9The amendments to the temporary rule delete \"update\" from Subsection 119.01.b.; clarify who can perform assessments in Section 826; clarify the assessment process for authorization of a consumer budget in Section 828;delete Section 835 regarding the range of available support; provide exceptions for certain services from the requirement for provider implementation plans in Section 839; correct language in Sections 119, 120.07, 142, 825, and 826; and expand the number of issues that may be referred to the Medicaid ombudsman in Section 853.

Power-Take-Off And Auxiliary Engine Allowances (Allowances) . Power take-off (PTO) allowances are available for special fuels powered vehicles. Auxiliary engine allowances are available for both specialfuels and gasoline powered vehicles. (4-5-00) a. Standard Allowances For Special Fuels. Nontaxable gallons of special fuels may be claimed when special fuels are used for purposes other than to operate or propel a motor vehicle and the fuel is drawn from the main supply tank of the motor vehicle. Examples of uses that qualify for allowances are turning a vehicle-mounted cement mixer or off-loading product. (4-5-00) b. Standard Allowances For Gasoline.

Fuels tax refunds based solely on an allowance may be calculated without regard to mileage and fuel consumption (MPG) information. (4-5-00) 08. IFTA Licensees Qualifying For Power Take-Off (PTO) And Auxiliary Engine Allowances (Allowances). Allowances listed in Subsection 292.05 or established as provided in Subsection 292.06 may begranted for IFTA licensees by recomputing the total gallons of fuel consumed in all jurisdictions. IFTA licensees claiming refunds of Idaho fuels tax resulting from the allowances established in Subsections 292.05 and 292.06, must file the claim on an Idaho Fuels Use Report Form 75 with the relevant supplemental worksheet. (4-5-00) a. The IFTA licensee must recompute the total taxable fuel for Idaho by deducting the gallons determined by the allowances in all jurisdictions from the total number of gallons of fleet fuel consumed that wasreported on the IFTA return. Using the new net gallons consumed, recompute the fleet miles per gallon. Apply the new fleet miles per gallon to the reported Idaho taxable miles to calculate the corrected Idaho taxable gallons. To calculate the Idaho nontaxable gallons available for refund, the licensee must subtract the recomputed taxable gallonsfor Idaho from the original taxable gallons reported for Idaho. This nontaxable gallon figure is then entered on the line labeled nontaxable gallons on the Form 75. (4-5-00) b. Additionally, a copy of the IFTA tax return for the period subject to the refund claim and a statement or worksheet showing how allowance was calculated must be included as an attachment to the Form 75. All refund claims are subject to review and audit, therefore, adequate documentation must be retained by the licensee. (4-5-00) c.

This action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107. The collection of fees is authorizedby Sections 39-115(3) and 39-119, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: October 9, 2001, 7 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Center1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208)373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Economic growth in Idaho has resulted in a corresponding rise in the air quality permitting needs of the regulated community. The purpose of the rulemaking is to better match the level of funding available to the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) air quality permitting program to the level of permit applications received. The fee will support, in part, the costs to DEQ of processing applications for permits toconstruct (PTCs) and Tier II operating permits, and registrations for permits by rule, allowing the agency to better meet the needs of the regulated community. Persons proposing or operating existing stationary sources of air pollutant emissions and required to obtain construction or operating permits may be affected by the rule. As proposed, the rule adopts a permit to construct application fee, as well as processing fee schedules for calculating permit to construct and Tier II operating permit processing fees. The rule also includes a registration fee for owners ofqualified facilities opting to register with DEQ under Sections 790 through 799 in lieu of obtaining an individual permit. The fee schedules are structured to provide an incentive for emission reduction as required by Section 39- 115(3), Idaho Code. This rulemaking also includes nonsubstantive corrections to rule section references within therule chapter. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in November 2001 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2002 session of the Idaho Legislature. FEE SUMMARY: This rulemaking will establish a permit to construct application fee, schedules for processing fees for permits to construct and Tier II operating permits, and a permit by rule registration fee for nonmetallic mineralprocessing plants. Collection of the fees is authorized by Sections 39-115(3) and 39-119, Idaho Code. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during a negotiation conducted pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code, and IDAPA 04.11.01.812 through 815. The negotiation was open to the public. Participants in the negotiation included government and industry representatives. The Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume01-6, June 6, 2001, page 93.

The action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency.Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 19, 2001.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: During the 2000 legislative session, the Legislature enacted Senate Bill 1426, creating the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). In addition to several technical corrections, Senate Bill 1426 deleted Section 39-105(3)(o), Idaho Code, which contained authority for the adoption of a state nutrient managementplan and promulgation of rules to implement the plan. The purpose of this rulemaking is to repeal IDAPA 58.01.16, \"Rules for Nutrient Management\" because the statutory authority no longer exists. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October or November 2001 for adoption of a pending rule.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule and amended a temporary rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Section(s) 59- 1314(1) and 72-1405 Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and amending the existing temporary rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. In HB 510, the 2000 Legislature authorized the Retirement Board to allocate extraordinary earnings in the PERSI defined benefit plan subject to certain restrictions and limitations. The allocation of extraordinary earnings is alsodescribed as gain sharing. Under the statutory structure, if extraordinary gains exist, the board has discretion to determine whether any or all of the gains will be allocated. If allocated, they are allocated to three groups identified in the statute - active members, retirees, and employers. These rules set forth definitions, how extraordinary gains willbe determined, how the allocations will be made between each group, and within each group. It includes both minimum and maximum limits for allocations. The temporary and proposed rules have been amended in response to public comment and pursuant to Section 67- 5227, Idaho Code. The changes to the temporary rules are identical to the changes to the proposed rules. Rule 308, which addresses gain sharing in the active member pool when there has been an intervening death of the member, hasbeen amended to incorporate the limits of Rules 404, rather than Rule 305. Rule 309, which explains how the gain sharing allocation is accounted for and maintained, has been amended to clarify that gain sharing is one source of funds in a member's Choice Account and that it is treated like other source funds in the Choice Plan except forpurposes of loans and hardship withdrawals. Only the sections that have been changed are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the temporary and proposed rule was published in the January 3, 2001 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume 01-1, pages 322 through 328.

Only those sections that have changed from the original proposed text are printed in this Bulletin following this notice. The text of the proposed rule was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume 01-1, January 3, 2001, pages 322 through 328 . This rule has been adopted as a pending rule by the Agency and is now pending review and adoption by the 2002 Idaho State Legislature as a final rule. THE FOLLOWING IS THE AMENDED TEXT OF DOCKET NO. 59-0108-0101 308. INTERVENING DEATH OF ACTIVE MEMBER (Rule 308). When a member would have been included in the active member allocation but dies prior to the transfer ofallocations, no allocation shall be made to the member, beneficiary or estate except that an optional death benefit recipient will receive the active member's allocation as limited by Rule 305 404. (12-1-00)T (12-1-00)T 309. TREATMENT OF GAIN SHARING ALLOCATIONS IN THE CHOICE ACCOUNT (Rule 309). Gain sharing allocations transferred to individual Choice Accounts have no effect on an individual's Base Plan benefit. Gain sharing allocations, and the earnings thereon, will be accounted for separately from other Choice Plancontributions but will be treated as one plan for purposes of reporting, investing, distributions, and fees to the extent they are applicable. Related provisions of the Plan adopted by the Board to facilitate voluntary and employer contributions are incorporated herein applicable to gain sharing allocations to the extent not inconsistent with these rules and Sections 59-1308 and 59-1309, Idaho Code. However, no loans or hardship withdrawals may be taken against gain sharing account balances.
