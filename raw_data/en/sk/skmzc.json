The physical health of those with enduring mental illness is an important, but neglected, aspect of health care responsible for considerable, prevent-able, morbidity. This popular, accessible book raises the profile of this Cinderella subject in the nursing curriculum. The chapter on medication and adverse drug reac- tions is particularly welcome.\" \u2014Sue Jordan, Reader, College of Human and Health Sciences, Swansea University People living with serious mental health problems often have significant physi-cal health problems that are estimated to shorten their life expectancy by up to 15 years. This is unacceptable, and avoidable and mental health nurses have a cru-cial role to play in addressing this situation. The second edition of this excellent text is timely. Underpinned by a sound evidence base and peppered with practical exam- ples throughout, this book contains essential knowledge and skills that will enable mental health nurses to help service users transform their health and wellbeing, and live longer, healthier and more satisfying lives. \u2014Patrick Callaghan, Professor of Mental Nursing Head of School of Health Sciences University of Nottingham Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

An introduction to physical health in mental illness 1Part 1 Introducing physical health and mental illness Introduction Physical well-being is important to everyone, regardless of whether they have a mental health problem or not. Indeed, the physical health needs and concerns of mental health service users (MHSUs) mirror those of the wider general population. The physical health of MHSUs has become a major concern in contemporary mental health policy and practice arenas. After years of neglect, it became apparent that the physical health of MHSUs under Chapter contents Overview of physical health in mental health Defining health Health beliefs and insight Factors affecting physical health of mental health service users (MHSUs) Health inequalities Stigma Learning outcomes By the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Define health and health beliefs and illus-trate why these are important to MHSUs Appreciate the impact of physical illness on MHSUs Identify factors that negatively impact on the physical health of MHSUs Be aware of barriers to physical care faced by MHSUs Box 1.1 Exercise Describe the physical health status of the MHSUs that you care for.

Nash (2005) suggests that this lack of focus on physical health compromises the notion of holistic care in mental health practice. Therefore, the physical health of MHSUs must be part of a holistic assessment that includes social, emotional, economic, and psychological needs. What do we know about physical health in people with severe mental illness? The focus of this book is the specific issues related to people with a primary mental health problem and a secondary physical problem, for example schizophrenia and diabetes. However, we should remain aware that there are issues relating to individuals with a primary physical condition and a secondary mental health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO 2003) suggests high prevalence of co-morbid depression in a range of physical illnesses, including depression in hypertension of up to 29 per cent, in cancer of up to 33 per cent, in HIV/AIDS of up to 44 per cent, and in tuberculosis (TB) of up to 46 per cent. This is something community practitioners should be aware of in respect to mental health promotion in primary care. Poor physical health affects our mental well-being. Poor mental health can increase the risk of developing a long-term physical health condition. However, a poorly managed physi-cal health condition can decrease quality of life, which may in turn impair the rate or extent of recovery. Research has consistently shown that the physical health of people with severe mental illness is frequently poor (Phelan et al. 2001). While this will be covered more fully in Chapter 2, it is important to note that: Male and female MHSUs have lower life expectancy: 8.0-14.6 life years less for men and 9.8-17.5 life years less for women (Chang et al. 2011). People with bipolar disorder and diabetes have a 50 per cent higher risk of dying than some-one with diabetes who does not have a mental illness (DRC 2006). People with schizophrenia may be at increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) because of the side-effects of medication, poorer health care, poor physical health, and less healthy lifestyles (Dixon et al. 2000). In the UK, 62 per cent of people with a psychotic disorder reported themselves as having a long-standing physical complaint compared with 42 per cent with no psychotic disorder (Singleton et al. 2000). The irony is that in many instances these statistics refer to current service users, in contact with either teams of health and social care professionals, or primary care services. We must therefore ask ourselves, how can such levels of poor physical health and poor health outcomes (a) exist and (b) go undetected? This is not just a question for specialist mental health services. It is also a question for primary care services where, in the UK, people with mental health prob-lems have 13-14 consultations with their general practitioner (GP) per year (NIMHE/Mentality 2004) yet severe and chronic physical conditions, which are routinely screened for and man-aged in primary care, go under-diagnosed. What is health? Box 1.2 Exercise How would you define (a) health and (b) illness? Which models might influence your definitions - for example, medical, social or psychological? It is over 50 years since the World Health Organization (WHO) was established and the most often cited definition of health was formulated. The WHO (1948) defines health as 'a state of Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. a n introduction to physical health in mental illness 3 complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infir- mity'. Saracci (1997) suggests that this is more a definition of happiness than health. He cites an anecdote from Sigmund Freud who, on having to stop smoking for health reasons, wrote, 'I am now better than I was, but not happier'. The WHO definition is certainly one to aspire to but it does not appear holistic. It is a twentieth- century definition in a twenty-first-century world and omits other factors that are now deemed important for positive health, such as emotional, environmental, and spiritual factors, although the 'social' aspect might encompass these. In developing the National Aboriginal Mental Health Policy and Plan, Swan and Raphael (1995) found that Aboriginal concepts of mental health are holistic, being defined as: 'health does not just mean the physical well-being of the individual but refers to the social, emotional and cultural well-being of the whole community'. Defining health is problematic, as individual experiences of health and illness will rarely be the same. Health and illness are inherently individualized concepts. For example, have you ever gone to work while sick? Why? Maybe you felt that you could struggle on, or maybe you did not want the hassle of reporting in sick. Nevertheless, through a process of rationalization we may underestimate our levels of illness by saying 'it's only a cold' in order to undertake our other social roles. Similarly, we may diminish our own ill health, or have our ill health dimin-ished by others through comparison with other people, for example 'at least it's not cancer'. Another way to explore what health is may be to look at what can make us unhealthy or ill. However, again this is controversial, as being labelled unhealthy or ill can be stigmatizing and disempowering. Despite being problematic, defining health is important for developing public health strategy, models of healthcare delivery, and diagnosing illness. Being complex to define, we might suggest that holistic definitions of health based on multidimensional models would be best for exploring both risk factors and protective factors for physical illness. Blaxter (1990) explored the concept of health by surveying 9000 individuals and asking the following questions: (1) Think of someone you know who is very healthy; who are you thinking of? How old are they and what makes you call them healthy? (2) At times people are healthier than at other times. What is it like when you are healthy? Ten categories of health and the characteristics that typified the responses are outlined in Table 1.1. Table 1.1 ten categories of health and the characteristics that typified the responses Health category Characteristic 1 Negative answers Health not rated highly as a virtue, a lack of concern for healthy behaviour 2 Health as not ill Being symptom free, never seeing a doctor 3 Health as absence of disease/health despite disease Did not have any really serious illness, 'I am healthy although I do have diabetes' 4 Health as a reserve t he ability to recover quickly 5 Health as behaviour, as the healthy life Health defined as 'virtuous' behaviour - being a non- smoker or non-drinker 6 Health as physical fitness Being athletic or sporty, and for women having a good outward appearance 7 Health as energy, vitality Having 'get up and go' 8 Health as a social relationship Health defined as having good relationships with others - especially for women 9 Health as a function Being able to do things with less stress 10 Health as psychosocial well-being Health as a state of mind Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The health beliefs of the general public will influence their help-seeking behaviour, while the health beliefs of professionals influence the types of interventions and services they provide. Indeed, health beliefs may vary between cultures, for example, the mind-body split that occurs in Western medicine. One aspect of mental health that can complicate our understanding of MHSUs' health beliefs is the concept of insight. Insight is a frequently used descriptor in mental health. There is no uniform definition of insight, as it is not a black-and-white issue; commonly 'has insight'. These measures are rather vague and do little to enhance our understanding or knowledge of insight. This may limit its therapeutic value. We may not know what insight is, but we know when it is not there. Although frequently used in relation to schizophrenia, insight is not a diagnostic category for schizophrenia in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) (WHO 2010). Having insight means that a person is aware that they are ill, that they need to get help and accept treatment. Gelder et al. (1996: 23) define insight as 'awareness of one's own medical condition'. When someone does not have insight, they do not recognize they are ill or that they need treatment. Amador (2001) approaches insight in neurological terms - anosognosia - meaning 'unawareness of illness', while David (1990) proposes that insight is composed of three distinct, overlapping dimensions, namely, the recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label, or attribute, unusual mental events (e.g. delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. Box 1.3 Case example Farlo has a 20-year history of schizophrenia. He presents with two main psychotic symp- toms - auditory hallucinations and delusions of grandeur. He refuses to accept treatment, maintaining he is not sick. t his is confirmed by t V news reports that say he is doing well. 'How can I the great, supreme and magical Farlo be unwell?', he asks the team at the ward round. Farlo currently lacks insight because (a) he is unaware that he is unwell, (b) he does not see the need for treatment, and (c) he does not attribute his psychotic symptoms to a mental illness. Health beliefs, on the other hand, are our individually held beliefs about our own health and illness status - what causes us to be healthy, what may cause us to be ill, what we must do to stay well, or what we must do to recover. While these are individual they have also been found to be social, as they can be influenced by social factors such as culture (Herzlich 1973). A recurring problem with health beliefs is that MHSUs may not share these with health pro-viders or, in the case of smoking, they share the view that smoking is dangerous but continue to smoke. This clash of beliefs can be very challenging to the development and maintenance of therapeutic relationships, especially in mental health care with the added complexity of insight. In a study of 364 outpatients with schizophrenia, Linden and Godemann (2005) assessed lack of insight and health beliefs and found these to be independent of each other. This meant that insight was related to their mental ill health and health beliefs were related to personal life experiences. Although both concepts are associated with non-compliance, Linden and Gode-mann state that they are 'separate clinical phenomena' and as such this distinction should be made. This means that practitioners should not attribute poor lifestyle choices to a lack of insight.

It is also important not to conflate health beliefs with insight, as health beliefs will influence responses to health and also the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship. Box 1.4 Case example ruari has a 10-year history of schizo-affective disorder. He is currently in hospital due to a relapse caused by non-compliance with antipsychotic medications. r uari also has a history of asthma and uses a bronchodilator. a t medication rounds he willingly accepts his asthma medication but staff need to continually prompt and encourage him to take his antipsychotic medication. When he is asked why he takes one medication and not the other r uari replies, 'I have asthma and need my puffer to help me breathe. I even cut down on my smoking. But everyone tells me I'm mentally ill and I need to take the other tablets, but I don't feel sick. Mentally I feel fine.' Ruari is unaware that he has a mental illness, as he appears to lack insight. Yet Ruari's health beliefs indicate that he is aware of the need to take asthma medication and that he has even reduced his smoking. His health beliefs seem to be in conflict with insight. However, we must not conflate these, as they are separate factors in health and illness. What practitioners need to do is use Ruari's health beliefs about his asthma as a metaphor for his mental illness - the need to take treatment and keep taking it. Ruari may then see that his recovery will be aided with medication, just as he requires his bronchodilator for his asthma. Physical illness is seldom caused by one factor, rather it will be an interaction of many risk factors. The challenge for practitioners is to have the knowledge of the risk factors and skills to assess - either for screening or further investigation - using appropriate clinical skills and techniques. However, a further challenge for us is being able to implement the same process across a range of physical conditions prevalent in MHSUs, such as obesity or diabetes. Factors that influence physical health in people with mental illness The UK Government highlights health inequality very clearly: 'the poorer you are, the more likely you are to be ill and to die younger' (Department of Health (DH) 1999a). This is truer for MHSUs with a range of physical conditions. However, the government still places some emphasis on individuals' responsibility for improving their own health through physical activ-ity, an improved diet, and quitting smoking (DH 1999a). Therefore, while health beliefs play an important role in our decision-making, there are many important factors influencing the physical health of MHSUs (see Table 1.2). The impact of lifestyle factors on the physical health of mental health service users The lifestyle choices we make can have a direct impact, both positive and negative, on our health. If someone smokes they will increase the risk of ill health, whereas if they exercise and eat healthily they will reduce the risk of ill health. Service users often have increased exposure to lifestyle risk factors, for example: Smoking prevalence is significantly higher among MHSUs than the general population; some studies show smoking rates as high as 80 per cent among people with schizophrenia (McNeill 2001). Obesity is one of the most common physical health problems in mental health (Citrome and Vreeland 2009). Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Lifestyle factors that cause obesity, such as low levels of exercise and poor diet, are preva-lent in people with mental illness (Brown et al. 1999). The outcomes of higher exposure to adverse lifestyle choices include an increased risk of developing severe and complex long-term physical conditions such as T2D, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and smoking-related respiratory disorders. However, people need to be fully informed about the risks of making unhealthy decisions and research shows that MHSUs seldom receive the same health promotion advice or interventions as the general population (Burns and Cohen 1998). The result is a dual diagnosis - a serious mental illness and a chronic physical problem - that can exacerbate MHSUs' exclusion because they may be too physically ill to avail themselves of employment or educational opportunities. Genetic factors Like the general population, MHSUs may be genetically predisposed to developing physical health conditions. For example, there may be a genetic, or familial, history of a physical condi-tion such as diabetes, CHD or stroke. This is why exploring the family history of these condi-tions is an important step in assessment and screening (Nash 2013). Adverse drug reactions While this will be covered in detail in Chapter 8, it is worth briefly mentioning this issue here. Iatrogenic illness - illness caused by adverse drug reactions (ADRs) - contributes to physical ill health in MHSUs. Adverse effects of antipsychotic medication can lead to obesity, increased risk of developing T2D, and cardiac problems. This is quite different from lifestyle or social factors, because psychotropic medication is a unique risk factor for MHSUs. Members of the general population will not be exposed to this risk factor. Influence of social factors on the physical health of mental health service users Having a diagnosis of mental illness negatively impacts on MHSUs' socio-economic circum- stances. A UK Government report, The Social and Economic Circumstances of Adults with Mental Disorders (Meltzer et al. 2002), reported the following: Compared with all other groups, those with a psychotic disorder were more likely to have left school, before the age of 16 years, without qualifications.Table 1.2 Some reasons for poor physical health in MHSUs (adapted from Nash 2013) Individual factors Social factors Lifestyle choices Genetic/family history a dverse drug reactionsHealth inequalities Social classPoverty Social exclusion Health organization factors Poor monitoring of physical conditions Undetected physical illnessInappropriate response to physical symptoms Uncoordinated physical carePractitioner factors Lack of practitioner training in physical health Low practitioner confidence in physical healthNegative attitudes leading to stigma and diagnostic overshadowing Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Those with a mental disorder were far more likely than those with no disorder to be living in rented accommodation (38 per cent vs. 24 per cent). Three of these six specified life events were twice as likely to have been experienced by those with a mental disorder compared with those with no mental disorder: separation or divorce (44 per cent vs. 23 per cent); serious injury, illness or assault (40 per cent vs. 22 per cent); and having a serious problem with a close friend or relative (27 per cent vs. 13 per cent). Box 1.5 ExerciseWhat factors do you consider important for determining an individual's health status? Determinants of health Wanless (2004) suggests that health and well-being are influenced by many factors, including past and present behaviour, healthcare provision, and 'wider determinants' including social, cultural, and environmental factors. Although it is accepted that lifestyle factors are important in determining physical health, practitioners should not overlook other important factors such as social class. People who are among the poorest in society will be more exposed to determinants of ill health, especially those living in inner-city areas where there is greater poverty, social depri- vation, and social exclusion. Typically, these neighbourhoods have poor housing, few leisure amenities, higher levels of unemployment and crime or the threat of crime, reduced access to education, and low educational attainment, including more school expulsions. It is this type of environment in which many MHSUs will reside. The UK Government recognizes that health inequality is widespread and the most disad- vantaged have suffered most from poor health (DH 1999a). This should prompt us to be more aware of the influence of social factors on MHSUs' physical health. Inequalities in health While lifestyle factors offer a biological explanation of health and illness, the social model can offer us alternative explanations. One important factor in the health of any population is 'inequalities of health'. Acheson (1998) contends that where inequalities of health exist, there are marked differences in health status between social classes when measured by occu - pation. This is illustrated by health gradients, where those in lower social classes tend to have poorer health (increased morbidity) and poorer health outcomes (increased mortal - ity). The UK Department of Health (2008a) states that health inequalities are the result of a complex and wide-ranging network of factors such as material disadvantage, poor housing, lower educational attainment, insecure employment, and homelessness. People exposed to inequalities of health will likely have poorer health outcomes and die earlier than the rest of the population. Service users are a socially disenfranchised group, often excluded from the fundamental aspects of society (Nash 2002). Thus, an alternative explanation for MHSUs' poor physical health is their position in the social hierarchy. Coming from the lowest social class they face greater morbidity and mortality than those from higher social classes. This offers us an alter-native explanation to lifestyle factors. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 illustrate the class gradient in respect to smoking (Figure 1.1) and deaths from CHD (Figure 1.2).

O'Brien et al. (2002) found that 70 per cent of people with psychotic disorders are economically inactive. The Public Health Agency of Canada (2002) nicely illustrates two theories for this: 'Social drift': this theory suggests that individuals who are predisposed to mental illness have lower than expected educational and occupational attainment and therefore 'drift' down the socio-economic ladder. 'Social causation': this theory suggests that social experiences of members of different socio-economic groups influence the likelihood of becoming mentally ill; for example, members of lower social classes are subjected to greater stress as a result of deprivation and are forced to cope with elevated stress levels with limited resources. Social class can affect the prevalence of mental health problems. Here we can see the part that poverty and deprivation have in influencing the physical and mental health of socially excluded groups. The challenge to practitioners is therefore clear. Most MHSUs will come from a backdrop of adverse social conditions with experiences of poverty and deprivation. We should thus be aware that there is a strong likelihood that MHSUs from this group will have a physical health condition that may be undiagnosed or may be at risk of developing such a condition. Poverty Mental illness seldom discriminates between class, gender or ethnicity, and the WHO (2003: 7) states that no group is immune to mental disorders, but the risk is higher among the poor, the homeless, the unemployed, and persons with low education. Poverty is an important factor in physical and mental ill health. In Ireland, a report by Walsh and Daly (2004) suggested that social class divisions indicate that poverty and disadvantage are contributory factors both to the incidence and prevalence of mental illness. In the UK, a survey by Focus on Mental Health (2001) found that MHSUs suffered significant poverty as a result of not being able to get work. It also asked MHSUs about their experiences of living on a low income and found the following: 66 per cent of respondents had difficulties making their income last for a week; 81 per cent of respondents thought that mental health problems increased the likelihood of being on a low income; 50 per cent of respondents said that their financial situation meant they were excluded from their community. Employment is seen as a way out of poverty but research shows that only around 20 per cent of people with mental health problems are in employment (DRC 2006). However, poor physical health can decrease MHSUs' prospects of returning to the labour force. These social factors tend to snowball and trap MHSUs in a vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation, further increasing their risk of social exclusion and poor health outcomes. Social inclusion and social exclusion The preceding parts of this chapter serve to build up a picture of how social factors can influ- ence the health of MHSUs and their inclusion or exclusion. Social inclusion is defined as 'a virtuous circle of improved rights of access to the social and economic world, new opportuni-ties, recovery of status and meaning and reduced impact of disability' (Sayce 2001: 122). To be included in society means to be accepted as 'one of us', enabling easier access to healthcare services or employment. However, all too often MHSUs are seen as 'one of them' - as outside of society - and face social exclusion. Sayce (2000: 122) defines social exclusion as 'the inter-locking and mutually compounding problems of impairment, discrimination, diminished social Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Social exclusion often results in decreased social networks, including healthcare networks, which can further exacerbate both mental and physical health problems. Box 1.6 Exercise revisit your answer to the exercise in Box 1.5. Which other factors can act as barriers to physical health care in your MHSU group? Barriers to physical health care for mental health service users One of the most problematic areas of mental health care is stigma. In the 2007 Attitudes to Men- tal Illness Survey for the UK Department of Health (TNS 2007), there was an overall decrease in positive attitudes towards people with mental illness since 1994. This may have been due to the frequency of reports into incidents involving people with mental illness in the community during this period and how these where reported in the media. However, having negative attitudes about people with mental illness is not confined to the general public. Research shows that health professionals, including those in mental health care, can harbour stereotypical or stigmatizing views towards MHSUs. For example, in a sur-vey of MHSUs by Mind (1996), one-third felt that their GP had treated them unfairly owing to their mental illness. With respect to mental health professionals, Lewis and Appleby (1988) found that psychiatrists had negative attitudes towards personality disorder, finding this MHSU group less deserving of care, manipulative, attention-seeking, and annoying. In a study of 65 qualified mental health nurses (MHNs) working in both inpatient and community serv-ices, Deans and Meocevic (2006) observed that most of them found people with borderline personality disorder manipulative, with some having negative attitudes towards this MHSU group. Stigma often prevents people from seeking help to the extent that, when they do, their con- dition may have significantly worsened. This view is supported by Ward (1997), who found that negative media reporting can negatively impact an individual's help-seeking behaviour. Yamey (1999) reports the case of a psychiatrist, who during the course of a ward round found that two-thirds (4/6) of patients had been struck off their GP's list since admission. Following a further audit of 50 patients, it was found that 30 per cent had been removed from their GP's list at some point. This prompted a suspicion that some behavioural and psychiatric disorders could be construed as a reason for being excluded from GP lists. Healthcare professionals' attitudes There are some myths and stereotypes surrounding the physical health of MHSUs that need to be dispelled for progress to be made. We can rightly speculate that having negative and stereotypical views of MHSUs will have an impact on the way that care is provided to, or for, them. This is especially true of physical health care, since at times practitioners may have a therapeutic fatalism: 'it's no good trying to get them to stop smoking, they have been doing it for years'. Research by Dean et al. (2001) and Meddings and Perkins (2002) shows a prevailing assumption among mental health practitioners that MHSUs are not interested in their physical health when, in fact, they are. This was typified with responses such as 'people have more to worry about (in relation to smoking cessation)'. Furthermore, McCabe and Leas (2008) found a considerable barrier to care was MHSUs not having their physical health concerns taken seriously by healthcare providers. Elsewhere it has been reported that some MHSUs experience 'inappropriate stereotyping, negative attitudes and detrimental assumptions about the quality of life of people with men-tal illness' (Nocon and Sayce 2006: 109), while the Disability Rights Commission (DRC 2006) found that individual experiences of primary care included reception staff with 'bad' attitudes, Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Diagnostic overshadowing As far back as 1979 Koranyi found that major medical illnesses among MHSUs went undiag- nosed, with the physical complaints of some being labelled 'psychosomatic'. This process is known as 'diagnostic overshadowing'. Diagnostic overshadowing is essentially a judgement bias, where physical complaints or symptoms are put down to an individual's mental illness rather than a genuine physical illness. In the UK, Rethink Mental Illness's '20 Years Too Soon' campaign (Rethink Mental Illness 2012) stems from diagnostic overshadowing being a current and common concern for MHSUs. Box 1.7 Case example Brian is a 38-year-old male with a 20-year history of paranoid schizophrenia. He has periods of non-compliance with medication and is currently on olanzapine 20 mg twice a day. He frequently drinks alcohol, smokes up to 40 cigarettes daily, but takes no illicit substances. He does not exercise and recognizes that his diet is very poor. Joseph tells his nurse that he has abdominal pains, saying: 'I feel something is growing inside my stomach'. His nurse puts this down to a nihilistic delusion and encourages Joseph to continue taking his anti - psychotic medications. This sounds entirely plausible and the nurse has acted on the presenting clinical picture. However, the likelihood of a physical complaint has been overlooked due to the history of mental illness (diagnostic overshadowing). Of course, people with schizophrenia can have delusions like this but recent evidence from the DRC (2006) shows that people with schizo- phrenia are 90 per cent more likely (i.e. nearly twice as likely) to get bowel cancer, which is the second most common cause of cancer death in Britain. Therefore, what is considered a delusion here may well be a severe physical complaint that requires investigation. We can-not second-guess that an investigation might reinforce the delusion without first ruling out a primary physical cause. Delays like this may place Brian at risk of more serious illness, which when finally diagnosed might require radical surgery. If it turns out to be a delusion, then we can begin interventions designed to reduce the impact of this. Mental health professionals' skills Another barrier to physical health for MHSUs is professionals' skills. In a training needs anal- ysis (TNA) of inpatient and community MHNs physical care skills, Nash (2005) found that many of them did not have up-to-date physical care skills or knowledge. Such a deficit may result in a lack of confidence in taking on physical care activities or a lack of knowledge of symptoms of physical illness, which could delay appropriate intervention. In addition, McIntyre and Romano (1977) found that many psychiatrists did not examine their patients routinely and did not feel competent performing a physical examination. Health organization factors In recognizing the poor state of MHSUs' physical health, we acknowledge that their physical health has not been a priority. Poor health outcomes (see Chapter 2) are another indicator of the effects of unrecognized and untreated physical health problems. Rethink Mental Illness (2012) and Nash (2013) outline some worrying examples of inappropriate responses to MHSUs' reports of physical problems. Thankfully, this picture is changing.

Service users have poor physical health and poor healthcare outcomes, yet receive less, or less effective, physical healthcare services. Lawrence and Kisely (2010) suggest poor physical health out-comes in MHSUs are linked to disparities in healthcare provision stemming from healthcare provider issues. The Royal College of Psychiatrists (2012) were concerned to find low rates of physical care interventions. For example, only 25 per cent of MHSUs with abnormal blood pressure (BP), only 20 per cent of those with abnormal lipid levels, and only 53 per cent of those with abnormal blood glucose or HbA1c received treatment. Therefore, even when conditions are noted, appropriate interventions may not follow. Meeting diverse and complex healthcare needs across many services (e.g. mental health, acute health, and primary care) is necessary to ensure good health outcomes. Chapter 10 outlines ways in which such inter-professional working can be achieved. Partisan implementation of health policy The UK National Service Framework (NSF) for Mental Health (DH 1999b) advocates the moni - toring of physical health of MHSUs in both mental health and primary care services. Advice on physical monitoring is also attached to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines on bipolar disorder (NICE 2006a) and schizophrenia (NICE 2009a). Other National Service Frameworks, including those for coronary heart disease (DH 2000) and diabe - tes (DH 2001b), contain population health targets. How well these have been used as resources and integrated into our mental health practice is highly questionable and under-researched. Box 1.8 Exercise SWO t a nalysis t hink about your service/clinical area. What are the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and t hreats regarding the physical health of MHSUs? For exam- ple, a strength might be a routine physical assessment schedule; a weakness might be the ad hoc implementation of the physical assessment schedule. Conclusion Being physically well is a goal for many people, as good physical health can have a posi- tive impact on psychological health. It is important that the physical health needs of MHSUs are identified and managed effectively. Irrespective of the compulsion in the duty of care to MHSUs, we should have a more vested interest in securing their good physical health. We can-not allow the glaring differences in morbidity and mortality between those with and without mental illness to continue. Like anyone else, MHSUs are concerned about their physical health, even though at times their lifestyle choices are at variance with this. This serves to illustrate the complex nature of beliefs and behaviours about physical health and illness. We should be hesitant in linking all lifestyle choices to the consequences of having a mental health problem and seek to address the physical health of MHSUs in a truly holistic way. This means adopting a less negative atti-tude about MHSUs' inability to change. If we really are in the business of holistic care, we should be ensuring that physical health issues are addressed as part of the whole-system approach to mental health care. This may entail innovative practice and using what we already know in different ways. We should be ensuring that physical health is integrated into local mental health documentation (e.g. the Care Programme Approach [CPA] in the UK) and advocating more loudly for MHSUs to have their physical health addressed in primary care settings.

For example, poor lifestyle can naturally increase the risk of ill health, but lifestyle choices may be restricted by social factors such as social class, inequalities in health, and social exclusion. Adverse drug reactions also increase the risk of physical illness for MHSUs, while family history may further complicate potential outcomes. Poorly organized or coordinated health care can further com- pound poor health outcomes. This chapter should help you critically examine the notion that poor health in MHSUs is solely related to lifestyle factors. All practitioners should continuously reflect on their atti-tudes, approaches to physical care for MHSUs, knowledge and skills, and ensure that they have fair and equitable access to physical healthcare services. Summary of key points MHSUs have poorer physical health and health outcomes than the general population due to inequalities of health and/or poor lifestyle choices. MHSUs are at greater risk of social exclusion, which can negatively impact on health status. Mental health nurses need to develop a better understanding of MHSUs' health beliefs. Negative attitudes and stigma from healthcare professionals towards the physical health of MHSUs may present as a barrier to care. MHSUs are concerned about their physical health status and practitioners should advocate for better physical healthcare services. Quick quiz 1 Define social exclusion.

We should be mindful of these fac - tors when profiling MHSUs' health needs because the WHO (2004a) suggests the clearest evidence is associated with indicators of poverty. This includes low levels of education and, in some studies, poor housing and poor income. Increasing and persisting socio-economic disadvantages for individuals and communities are recognized risks to mental health. This chapter explores the epidemiology of physical illness in MHSUs and will probably confirm what you already know from your clinical practice. However, it will strive to put this in the context of available evidence. We will explore the concept of risk, but in a different way from what is typical in mental health. We will consider risk factors for physical illness and how these can be examined and managed through the process of health needs assess - ment (HNA). Most of us will have considered the impact of MHSUs' physical illness on our work. For example, how often do you now provide physical care compared with, say, three years ago?

An introduction to key concepts in measuring health and illness 15 What is the prevalence of diabetes in your client group or the incidence of problems associ- ated with smoking? The exercise in Box 1.1 in Chapter 1 helped us to assess the influence of epidemiology on our work. Defining epidemiology Coggon et al. (2003: 1) define epidemiology as 'the study of how often diseases occur in differ- ent groups of people and why'. Thus, epidemiology can tell us: which groups are more at risk of ill health; what might cause certain groups to suffer more ill health than other groups; which groups we should target with public health initiatives to improve health outcomes. Epidemiology can also tell us about inequalities in health when we explore the health status of vulnerable groups such as MHSUs. It can also identify differences in health and health out- comes by social class or geographical location. This information may highlight areas of unmet needs, which can then become the focus of interventions. For example, we can identify MHSUs most at risk of developing diabetes by mapping known risk factors for diabetes. What epidemiology tells us in general is that physical health has become an increasing concern in mental health. The UK National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey showed high levels of physical ill health and higher death rates among individuals with mental health problems compared with the rest of the population (DH 1999b). Indeed, such are the consequences of physical ill health in MHSUs that Allebeck (1989) suggests that schizophrenia itself is a life-shortening disease. Epidemiology has a significant impact on our practice in the guise of public health. We should all know the prevalence of mental illness in society is 1:4 - one in four people has at least one mental, neurological or behavioural disorder but most of these disorders are neither diagnosed nor treated (WHO 2008a). Other statistics include the following: at any given time, the prevalence of depression in the population is estimated to be between 5 and 10 per cent (WHO 2001); the prevalence of schizophrenia in the population is between 0.5 and 1 per cent (Murray 2005); the prevalence of bipolar disorder in the population is approximately 1 per cent (NICE 2006a: 76). What is public health? Public health is the science and art of promoting health, preventing disease, and prolonging life through the organized efforts of society (WHO 1998: 3). The 'science' is represented by both epidemiology, which can track patterns of health and illness, and evidence-based practice, which is employed to promote health or reduce illness. The 'art' is mental health nursing - how our interventions can prevent mental illness and prolong life (e.g. preventing suicide and pro- moting positive mental health). A significant new challenge is incorporating physical health into our role in relation to screening, preventing, and managing physical conditions while pro-moting physical well-being. Box 2.2 Exercise Reflect back on Box 1.1 in Chapter 1. How would you define incidence and prevalence? Illustrate this with reference to your current MHSU group.

Whether it is inpatient acute care, long-term reha - bilitation or community mental health, a basic knowledge of these key concepts will enable you to focus on areas of greatest health need. This effective targeting of resources promotes evi - dence-based practice, enabling practitioners to effectively commission or advocate for physical healthcare services on behalf of MHSUs. It is also useful in enabling MHNs to determine their own training needs linked specifically to areas of greatest identified MHSU health need. Demographics Demographics is the study of human populations with regard to their current characteristics and short-term trends. In general, it is a particular aspect of the information we routinely col-lect from MHSUs during assessments, admission or follow-up. It usually includes: Personal details: name, next of kin/nearest relative, address, date of birth, hospital number. Biographical details: age, gender, ethnicity, employment status, religion, educational level. Social details: benefits status, housing status. Medical history: past medical history, current medical history, current medication, ADRs. Demographic information can enable us to look at patterns of illness across different age groups or between males and females. Box 2.3 Exercise Describe the demographic profile of your client group. Health statistics 'Illness' and 'health' statistics are collected in many ways. Each of these acts as a barometer to the health of MHSUs and gives an idea of which groups, or problems, will require attention. Normally the most pertinent ones for practitioners refer to mental health care, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia or the incidence of self-harm in young people. However, what is becoming more apparent is the incidence and prevalence of physical illness in MHSUs, and in particular the high death rates for physical illness discussed in Chapter 1. Health statistics are usually expressed as rates, that is, they indicate the frequency of something occurring. Rates can be expressed in a general way, referred to as crude rates, or they can be more specific, as they relate to specific groups within the population. For example, the rate of schizophrenia in the general population is 1:100. This means that for every 100 people, at least one will have schizophrenia. However, the rate does not tell us how severe the schizophrenia is; rates only indicate frequency, not severity. Nevertheless, rates are important as they can provide information about how our services should be developed, or the training that practitioners may need, or the possible impact on carers. This part of the chapter will explore some useful types of statistics and illustrate how they can be used in our practice. Figure 2.1 illustrates the prevalence of physical conditions in the general population and in people with SMI. It is clear that there are glaring differences in the frequency of condi - tions between the groups. The DRC (2006) also found that not only are people with SMI more likely to become ill, they are more likely to have poorer outcomes than those in the general population: People with learning disabilities or SMI die five to ten years younger than the general population.

An introduction to key concepts in measuring health and illness 17 Women with schizophrenia are 42 per cent more likely to get breast cancer. People with schizophrenia are nearly twice as likely to get bowel cancer (the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK). There is poor prognosis with physical illness: 22 per cent of people with CHD who have schizophrenia die, compared with 8 per cent of people who have no SMI. Two common rates are the incidence rate and the prevalence rate. Remember the exercise earlier? Compare your definitions of incidence and prevalence to those given below. Prevalence Prevalence is a measure of the number of all known cases of disease in a specific group. This can be calculated as a point prevalence, i.e. the number of known cases at a certain point of time; or as a period prevalence, i.e. the number of known cases in a certain period of time, say one year. In general terms, it is estimated that the prevalence of diabetes in people with schizophrenia can be 2-4 times higher than in the general population (Bushe and Holt 2004).Figure 2.1 The prevalence of physical health conditions in the general population and in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Source: Disability Rights Commission (2006).

In January 2008, Erin found that of the 30 people on her caseload, 6 had a diagnosis of T2D. The prevalence of T2D in Erin's caseload is calculated as follows: all known cases of T2D (n = 6) divided by the total population at risk ( n = 30) = 6/30 \u00d7 100 per cent = 20 per ent. The prevalence of T2D in Erin's caseload is 20 per cent. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Incidence describes the frequency with which new cases of a condition are diagnosed. Box 2.5 Case example When Erin's caseload is screened again six months later, the number of people with T2D is eight - an increase of two. Erin already knew of 6 confirmed cases of T2D, so only 24 others were at risk of developing the condition. Therefore, the incidence is 2/24 \u00d7 100 = 8 percent. The incidence of T2D in Erin's caseload is 8 per cent. Prevalence and incidence are important indicators of the health of populations. Mortality rate The mortality rate can tell us a lot about the health of the general population and of specific groups within it. In addition to the total number of deaths, the mortality rate tells us the number of deaths between groups (e.g. men and women, the social classes) as well as the different causes of death. The mortality rate most associated with mental illness is the suicide rate. How - ever, with the high prevalence of physical illnesses, we now know that deaths from physical conditions can be higher than those from suicide. Given the high death rates related to physical conditions, we need to ensure that we are tackling deaths from all causes and not just suicide. We can be more specific about the mortality rate by calculating the number of deaths in specific populations; for example, the risk of mortality from CHD is increased in people with SMI in the 18-75 years age group (Osborn et al. 2007). Concerns regarding poor physical health outcomes in mental health are not confined to the UK - it is an international problem. For example, in Western Australia Lawrence et al. (2001) found that MHSUs died between 1.3 and 5.4 times more than the general population, for all major natural causes of death, while in the USA Parks (2006) found that MHSUs die on average 25 years earlier than the general population. When looking at the mortality rate, it is worth considering problems associated with, for example, cause of death. If there is an error in recording cause of death or cause of death is misdiagnosed, then this will affect the quality of statistics through under-reporting. For a cause of death to be established, it is sometimes necessary to carry out a post-mortem; however, post-mortems are usually only performed if a death occurred in suspicious circumstances. Standardized mortality ratio The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is the ratio of the actual number of deaths in a pop - ulation to the number of deaths expected if the death rate was the same as the general population. The SMR uses 100 as a standard figure for the whole population. This signifies a national 'average' if all things were equal; it does not signify age. A figure over 100 is worse than the national average and a figure less than 100 is better than the national average. It is a good simple measure to compare areas of a country, groups within society or make inter - national comparisons at a point in time. Let's put the SMR into perspective for MHSUs. Research by Harris and Barraclough (1998) shows that people with serious mental illness have higher SMRs than the UK general popula-tion in a range of conditions: cardiovascular disease, SMR = 250; respiratory disease, SMR = 250; infectious disease, SMR = 500.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. An introduction to key concepts in measuring health and illness 19 This means that MHSUs will die 2.5 times more often from cardiovascular disease and respi- ratory disorders and five times more often from infections than the general population. Again, the irony is that in many cases, MHSUs may be in contact with healthcare services, yet their physical health needs may not be adequately addressed. In a systematic review, Saha et al. (2007) examined SMR data from 25 countries and reported that SMRs for schizophrenia have steadily increased from 1.84 (1970s) to 2.98 (1980s) and 3.20 (1990s). With such increasing and disparate death rates, practitioners should be prioritizing physical assessment and screening for early detection and prompt intervention. Life expectancy Life expectancy is the average number of years a person will live before they die. In the UK, the life expectancy of men and women has continued to rise. At birth, the life expectancy of females born in the UK is 82.1 years, and that of males 78.1 years (ONS 2011). However, Thor-nicroft (2011) suggests that life expectancy can be 20% shorter in MHSUs with schizophrenia than in the general population. A recent UK study highlighted that men and women living with schizophrenia have a reduced life expectancy of 20.5 years and 16.4 years respectively (Brown et al., 2010). Morbidity rate The morbidity rate is a measure of the frequency of an illness or condition in the population. Be careful not to confuse mortality and morbidity, as morbidity measures the rate of illness and not the rate of death. For example, there are high rates of medical co-morbidity in our cli-ent group, especially in schizophrenia. The DRC (2006) found that 31 per cent of people with schizophrenia and CHD are diagnosed under the age of 55, compared with 18 per cent of oth- ers with CHD. The late detection of conditions such as heart disease and diabetes means that MHSUs not only have worse mortality than the general population, but the severity of morbid-ity is probably greater due to later diagnosis. Risk In epidemiology, risk relates to two things: the risk of developing an illness, and the risk that a particular intervention will not work. As in mental health care, there are many risk factors for certain conditions. A risk factor is something that can positively contribute to the risk event. For example, smoking (risk factor) can lead to lung cancer (risk event); poor diet (risk factor) can lead to a heart attack (risk event); and lack of exercise (risk factor) can lead to diabetes (risk event). From these three crude examples, we can see the complex nature of relationships between risk factors and risk events. Will a lack of exercise alone lead to diabetes if the indi-vidual has a well-balanced diet? What part does genetics play in this? Risk factors can also be active (smoking) or passive (not exercising). Risk factors for physical illness Risk factors can be dynamic or static, that is, some are open to change whereas others are not. Lifestyle factors are dynamic, since with health education and promotion they can be modi-fied; for example, smoking cessation programmes can reduce/eliminate smoking. Other risk factors are static, since health education or promotion cannot modify them; for example, a genetic predisposition to an illness.Box 2.6 ExerciseList the risk factors for CHD in your client group?

The relationship between physical illness and mental illness may present us with an added level of complexity, but in general the risk factors are the same: sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking. A unique risk factor for MHSUs is psychotropic medication and the complications that this presents (see Chapter 8). What we must refrain from is misconstruing risk factors for physical illness as individual characteristics of MSHUs - for example, smoking is prevalent; it may be perceived as usual; this may diminish its significance as a risk factor. Exposure to risk factors Service users have higher rates of physical illness than the general population, which largely go undetected (Brown et al. 1999). While many individuals are in contact with mental health or primary care services, the focus of interventions and interactions is naturally the primary psychiatric illness. If there is significant concern regarding physical health, this will either be managed 'in house' or, depending on the severity or results of diagnostic testing, referred to primary care services or acute/community hospital services. When exploring illness, we need to examine risk factors that can increase the risk of devel - oping a physical condition. You will be aware of a range of risk factors that can lead to lung cancer, the most serious of which is smoking. However, some people who do not smoke develop lung cancer. How can this be explained? One way is to examine their exposure to the risk factor; non-smokers may be exposed to second-hand smoke. Therefore, while we might have an idea that people with mental illness smoke a lot, research indicates that the prevalence of smoking in people with SMI is significantly higher than that of the general population (McNeill 2001). If we explore this further we find that the rates of smoking are higher in individuals with psychotic disorders with some studies showing a prevalence of up to 80 per cent (McNeill 2001). Service users face increased exposure to a range of risk factors for physical illness. How- ever, exposure to risk factors cuts two ways. Although lifestyle factors account for some of the exposure to physical illness, the failure of health services to respond equally to MHSUs' physical complaints also exposes them to increased risk. Comparing the impact of different risk factors on the physical health of MHSUs we find that: Lifestyle factors: Smoking rates are higher in individuals with psychotic disorders (McNeill 2001). 33 per cent of people with schizophrenia are obese vs. 21 per cent of the general population. Health organization factors: People with schizophrenia and stroke are less likely than the general population to have a cholesterol test. 63 per cent of eligible women with schizophrenia have a cervical smear vs. 73 per cent of women in the general population (DRC 2006). While lifestyle factors may contribute to the cause of illness, failure to identify illness early by screening and responding or intervening promptly might explain why individuals go on to develop long-term morbidity or early mortality. Table 2.1 outlines risk factors for CHD. Social class has been categorized as non-modifiable for MHSUs, as social mobility for this group is severely restricted due to stigma and social exclusion. The challenge for us is to replicate these categories of risk factors for the different conditions presented by MHSUs. What does this mean for mental health service users? If these statistics are ignored, the current dire picture of death and illness from treatable physi - cal conditions will remain unchanged. Service users and their carers will face the added burden Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

An introduction to key concepts in measuring health and illness 21 of a co-morbid physical condition and a major mental health problem. However, if the nettle is grasped, these statistics challenge us to turn the tide of ill health in MHSUs. Now that we know the major areas of concern - obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular illness, respiratory illness, and infections - we should begin to integrate other NSFs such as that for CHD (DH 2000) and the various NICE guidelines into our work routine, at least at the level of screening and onward referral. Putting these statistics to use A common concern of practitioners is what we do with these statistics, how we put them to good use. Our first concern should be to ensure that the statistics are collected in the first instance. Without these there will be no way of knowing what the main health problems are or how to prioritize resources. Although we have a general idea of the areas of concern, to effectively prioritize resources or commission services we need to generate our own evidence regarding the prevalence of conditions. This is called HNA. Health needs assessment As physical health is a neglected area in mental health care, we might safely assume that we do not have a true picture of MHSUs' physical health needs, unless they have a current condition. Hooper and Longworth (2002: 9) define HNA as 'a systematic and explicit process which reviews the health issues affecting a population. The process aims to improve health, and reduce health inequalities, by identifying local priorities for change and then planning the actions needed to make these changes happen.' Assessing and identifying health needs is a systematic and structured process of auditing your clinical case notes. It is like a ripple effect; your caseload data, combined with your teams, combined with your locality, combined with your service can give a critical mass of epidemiological data that can be useful in the commis-sioning or organization of physical health care. Having a standardized physical assessment form will help facilitate a HNA; otherwise, col- lecting different types of data could be a lengthy auditing process. This is one benefit of using a standardized assessment - it enables structured and systematic audit in a relatively short time. Unavailable information may indicate areas for practice development or compliance with data collection (not adhering to the audit tool). For example, the absence of a blood cho-lesterol reading may be explained by it not being a routinely requested blood investigation. However, with the high prevalence of cardiovascular illness in MHSUs, this may be the type of investigation required to identify prevalence of high cholesterol as a risk factor.

It is disempowering for MHSUs to have their needs diminished by diagnostic overshadowing (see Chapter 1) or to have them remain as unmet because mental health practitioners or services are not up to the challenge of the physical health agenda. However, it should be recognized that needs might be identified but interven-tions not wanted; for example, MHSUs who smoke may refuse interventions such as a smoking cessation programme. Health needs are relative to the individual and we may have a system of bargaining our health, such as being a social smoker - we know smoking is bad for us so we minimize the circumstances in which we do it. Box 2.7 ExerciseWhat are the most prevalent physical health problems in your client group? Would your client group agree with you? Caseload profiling Twinn et al. (1996) define caseload profiling as the analysis of all individual records held by each community healthcare nurse. However, this is not to say that our ward-based records do not need profiling at regular intervals. Profiling caseloads is important because it helps us gain an accurate picture of the physical health status of MHSUs. It will not only help us to estimate the prevalence of physical illness but also identify unmet needs that need to be highlighted. Unmet needs are not confined to client health but also include areas that need strengthen-ing, commissioning of physical health care, equipment for assessing and maintaining physical health, and staff training needs. Table 2.2 is an example of a caseload profile. This should be performed against each of our client's case notes. There may be obvious categorical differences in relation to what is meas-ured. Local discussion and client/carer input will help to fine-tune any tool. Exposure to risk factors is an important part of caseload profiling, as mapping these will help to identify health needs. For example, lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, obesity or a sedentary lifestyle are important to map, as we can offer interventions such as smoking ces- sation, exercise advice or statins. Furthermore, mapping the prevalence of risk factors can help us to identify our own training needs (e.g. skills in motivational interviewing or cognitive-behavioural therapy for smoking cessation). Readers are encouraged to look at Tables 10.3 and 10.4 in Chapter 10, which are fictional illustrations of using information from a HNA and a caseload profile, identifying a range of health issues and needs in a community MHN's caseload. Screening for physical conditions in mental health service users Caseload profiling requires us to have various clinical skills and theoretical knowledge of, for example, therapeutic blood glucose levels and 'normal' ranges for baseline observations. These procedures contribute to the process of screening, which is defined as 'the application of a special test for everyone at risk of a particular disease to detect whether the disease is present at an early stage' (Ewles 2005: 283). Screening and assessment will be covered in more detail in the forthcoming chapters. Potential benefits of health needs assessment The benefits of HNA speak for themselves: improved profiling can lead to more accurate prev- alence statistics, which can lead to more effective targeting of resources and interventions. Better statistics can also lead to better commissioning to underpin and support the physical health agenda. Service users may feel that their physical health is incorporated into a holistic nursing assessment. Advantages and disadvantages of HNA are outlined in Table 2.3.

Improved practitioner knowledge, skills, and practice Practitioners may not see this as part of their role and may not be confident in extending their scope of practice The challenge for mental health nurses - meeting the physical health needs of mental health service users Box 2.8 Case example Staff nurse Ncube is increasingly concerned at the weight gain in her client group. She brings this up at one of the staff meetings and it is agreed that, to help weight reduction, saccharine sweeteners will now be used on the ward rather than sugar. As discussed previously, we need to have an idea of MHSUs' health beliefs. This will enable us to more effectively collaborate on determining health needs. While we know that factors such as increased calorie intake and lack of exercise can increase weight, we cannot afford to be evangelical about interventions, as this may put off MHSUs. Individuals may know what the message is but may not yet be at the stage where they want to change and we cannot enforce change on MHSUs. While staff nurse Ncube's intentions are honourable, they are somewhat paternalistic as she is taking a well-meaning decision on behalf of MHSUs. This diminishes their autonomy and ability to make decisions. This decision also limits the intervention to life-style and does not include either social factors that might impact on weight gain, or associated ADRs. Therefore, while the plan (i.e. to reduce weight gain) is positive, the intervention (i.e. banning sugar and using sweeteners) is ill-thought through.Table 2.2 Example of a caseload profile (Continued) Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

It also explored the real-life impact of these concepts on the physical health of MHSUs, thus laying down a challenge to practitioners to employ holistic assessments in their work. It introduced the concept of HNA and illustrated how it may be used in practice. However, practitioners must be cautious when using epidemiological data in the planning and delivery of health services or health interventions. While some may see this as effective targeting of resources, others may interpret it as rationing health services or interventions. This idea of the greater good - doing something that benefits many - is a core principle of public health, as policies are directed towards the biggest killers of the population (i.e. cancer, diabetes, and CHD). But what if a client's illness or condition is rare or difficult to measure epidemio - logically? Finding oneself outside of the policies or interventions can be a frightening experi - ence. Described as a postcode lottery - not being able to get treatment because your health authority/provider wants to focus on more substantial issues - means that we may need to undertake an advocacy role to ensure that MHSUs' physical health needs, and access to treat - ment, are not diminished. Summary of key points Long-term chronic and severe physical illnesses are more prevalent in MHSUs than in the general population. It is important that practitioners have an understanding of key terms in epidemiology so that they can assess MHSUs' health needs more effectively. Although a knowledge of key terms in epidemiology is important, the challenge is to do something effective with the statistics. A thorough HNA can lead to more effective commissioning of physical healthcare services for MHSUs. Practitioners need to develop skills in public health techniques such as screening, physical health education, and health promotion.

Indeed, a physical condition may go undetected for such a long time that it may only become manifest through a critical event, such as a hypoglycaemic coma, which leads to a diagnosis of diabetes. It is important, therefore, that MHNs have the fundamental skills, knowledge, and equipment to conduct a thorough physical assessment. Rushforth et al. (1998) suggest that, for most nurses, physical assessment is regarded as pri- marily the recording of vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. In mental health, physical assessment may be limited, as Rushforth suggests, to tak-ing and recording baseline observations on admission or discharge from hospital. Performing a physical assessment may be a new role requirement and as such it is necessary for practi-tioners to have appropriate support. Mental health services need to ensure that practitioners are educated and trained to undertake physical assessment with support from an experienced Chapter contents Practical aspects of physical health assessment Approaches to physical assessment Communication skills Consent and physical assessment Core skills in physical assessment Physical assessment and history-taking General survey Documentation and record-keeping Learning outcomes By the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Explore your role in physical assessment Describe the process of physical assessment Appreciate the different methods of physi- cal assessment Examine equipment essential for physical assessment Discuss the importance of privacy, dignity, and consent Box 3.1 Exercise How do you structure a physical assessment?

Clinical supervision should also be considered as part of the support process. This chapter examines skills that help facilitate a physical assessment. Mental health nurses will have some skills but these may be 'rusty'. For example, Nash (2005) found that although practitioners reported having physical care skills, these had been learned as part of their stu- dent nurse training and 42 per cent of the sample had been qualified for more than ten years. It is fair to assume that some knowledge and skills would have been out of date given advances in evidence-based practice. Therefore, training in physical assessment needs to be updated. Why physical assessment skills? Why not? We are now familiar with the extent of physical illness and poor health in our MHSU group. Assessment is the basis of good clinical decision-making. Physical assessment provides practitioners with information on the nature of any physical problem, its severity, its history, the best intervention, and best management plan. If no physical assessment is made, it leaves the door open for clinical error. You may need to expand your repertoire of physical assess- ment skills to improve the quality of care MHSUs receive. Price et al. (2000: 292) suggest that 'the role of the nurse undertaking physical assessment is not to make a nursing or a medical diagnosis. It is to facilitate and enhance the care of a patient by collecting information in a standard fashion and communicating it to other members of the clini - cal team.' This definition should be a benchmark for our practice. The aim of learning these skills is not to become mini-doctors or pseudo 'general' nurses, but to enhance the skills and scope of our professional practice. Physical assessment need not be too complex, yet it should not be cursory given the extent of hidden morbidity and the presence of highly visible risk factors. Box 3.2 Case example You are working on Elm Ward, which specializes in care of the older person. One of the resi- dents, who is quite frail, is recovering from a left hip fracture and is currently bed bound. You and a colleague notice that her sacral area has become very red and skin integrity is compromised with a very small pressure sore beginning to form. What do you do? Inter-professional working in physical assessment Sometimes physical assessment may be too complex for MHNs to undertake if they do not have specialist training. Therefore, we need to work jointly with more appropriately quali-fied practitioners in complex physical assessments. In our case study above, we would first inform the responsible doctor and then maybe consult with a specialist tissue viability nurse for advice on pressure sores (e.g. wound cleansing and the most appropriate types of dress- ings). We may also need to consult with an infection control nurse, as this type of highly vul-nerable client is at increased risk of contracting a hospital-acquired infection. We will need to ensure that the care plan and interventions we instigate promote healing of the sacral area and reduce the risk of infection. The case study illustrates that MHNs may not have the appropriate knowledge, skills or confidence to undertake all aspects of physical health care. This is true of most areas of practice, for example community MHNs may liaise with district nursing col-leagues or diabetes nurse specialists in the care of people with diabetic leg ulcers. At the very least, we must have the basic knowledge and skills, maybe even 'common sense', to recognize that some aspects of physical health are outside of our scope of practice and that we need to refer these on. This will mean enhancing our liaison and broadening our team-working skills (see also Chapter 10). Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Principles of physical health assessment in mental health care 29 Practical aspects of physical assessment Practitioners should remember important practical considerations before commencing an assessment. The principles of infection control should be followed according to local policy and procedure. This will include proper hand hygiene and use of disposable equipment (e.g. thermometers) where possible. You should always be prepared by having to hand all necessary equipment and paperwork, ensuring observations are recorded in real time as it is easy to for- get readings. Being prepared shows professionalism and competence, which will provide reas-surance. Professional guidelines for documentation and record-keeping should be followed (in the UK this will be Nursing and Midwifery Council [NMC] Code of Conduct 2008). Preserving MHSUs' dignity and respect is important at all times, but more so during a physi- cal assessment where disrobing may be required. The environment must thus be private and conducive to affording dignity and respect. The MHSU might like to be accompanied by a family member, and this should be accommodated if possible. You need to consider the use of chaperones when gender or cultural preferences are expressed; for example, Muslim men may request a male nurse to undertake the assessment. When gaining consent, you should explain the assessment clearly so as to reassure the MHSU of their well-being. This should include any clinical observations that may be required, including any physical specimens. Physical health is a highly individualized concept, so you should adopt a client-centred approach to assessment. It is important for the patient to feel that their concerns are being taken seriously, as they may previously have been subjected to diagnostic overshadowing on reporting physical symptoms. For the most part, you will be doing 'physicals' on MHSUs you either know or who are 'known' to services. Nevertheless, the practical considerations shown in Figure 3.1 should be extended to all. What does physical assessment tell us? Physical assessment can indicate a number of things about a MHSU's physical health. It will provide information on bodily functions and body systems so that you can: have a baseline measurement for future comparison; screen for previously undiagnosed conditions; monitor previously diagnosed physical illness;Figure 3.1 Practical considerations when undertaking a physical assessmentInfection control Physical AssessmentCultural preferences Gender preferences Consent RespectDignityPrivacyPreparedness Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical illness masking and mimicking mental illness Assessment may also indicate that the presenting mental health problem has an underlying physical cause. Therefore, physical assessment has an added importance for practitioners working as 'gatekeepers' to mental health services. For example, a nurse working in Accident and Emergency Liaison or Crisis Mental Health Services needs to be aware of physical condi-tions that may present as an acute psychiatric condition (see Table 3.1). Whatever the purpose of the physical assessment, it is important that practitioners have the appropriate competen-cies and skills to conduct one. Core skills in undertaking physical assessment Physical assessments will be based on the medical model of health, which focuses on obser- vations being within 'normal' ranges. However, social factors should not be forgotten in this process. Although there are different approaches to assessing physical health, the core skills required should be familiar to practitioners. While some of these are technical and manual, we should not underestimate the value of our core 'mental health' skills that can be employed in different contexts. Communication skills These are the most important mental health nursing skills. During a physical assessment, you will need to draw on your repertoire of communication and listening skills, especially when discussing intimate and personal aspects of physical health. Thus, verbal and non-verbal skills will be very important when taking a physical history. Service users may also need added psychological support if they are diagnosed as having a physical condition in addition to their mental health problem. The following are examples of important communication skills: Non-verbal communication skills Show interest by: having an open body posture, appearing relaxed and confident to dispel unease; maintaining eye contact; nodding periodically to show attentiveness and understanding; keeping an appropriate personal space; not frowning or appearing shocked if something intimate is divulged. Verbal communication skills We use verbal communication skills in everyday practice, and so there may be nothing new to learn per se . However, the use of these verbal skills in a different context may require acclimatization.Table 3.1 Physical conditions that may present as an acute psychiatric condition Physical disorder Symptoms Psychiatric disorder Delirium Confusion due to urea and electrolyte imbalance Dementia Hypothyroidism Lethargy, lack of energy, tiredness Depression Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Principles of physical health assessment in mental health care 31 Questioning: Open questions are used for global assessment and getting a general picture of the MHSU, e.g. 'How are you feeling today?' Closed questions, on the other hand, are used for more specific assessment, e.g. 'Do you drink alcohol?', 'How many units per week?' Clarification is used to ensure you have correct information regarding symptoms: Have you got the priority correct, e.g. long-standing issue or new and acute? Paraphrase any unclear statements and try to assign these to a sign or symptom. If the assessment is complex, summarize at intervals to ensure you have an accurate account. Listening and responding: You should use attending skills to explore discrepancies in responses. For example, is the MHSU's verbal and non-verbal communication congruent? Box 3.3 Case example Nurse: Are you in pain at present? Samuel: (Wincing and shifting posture) No. Samuel's response is incongruent. His verbal response is 'No', but his non-verbal commu- nication indicates he is in pain. He may be guarded as to the nature or cause of the pain. You can observe location of discomfort and inspect the area. Pain reports will need further investigation and appropriate pain management. This will need close follow-up to reduce physical discomfort. Appropriate and timely responses are important during physical assessment. This helps to verify information and provide greater clarity. Responding appropriately might also deter-mine action - for example, is tachypnoea hyperventilation due to anxiety or a sign of respira-tory distress? Reassuring: Try not to make the MHSU more anxious - they may be unaccustomed to seeing you in a physical health role. It is important to have basic knowledge and skills when it comes to physical assessment. Provide explanations of procedures, as this will increase the MHSU's confidence in your abilities. Interpreting verbal cues from the mental health service user In the course of an assessment, a past history is taken (see further in this chapter). This will involve asking questions about the patient's and their family's medical history. This may be stressful for them, especially if they or a close family member has had or currently has a medi-cal condition. You should be conscious of any verbal signs. For example: Tone: the tone of voice may convey anger or sadness if a serious condition is present. Intonation (pitch): this may convey low mood, e.g. if low and monotone, it may indicate problems coping with the challenge of having a physical condition. Clarity: the MHSU may offer vague or ambiguous answers regarding symptoms. This should be explored to determine if they are trivializing their illness, or they are articulating it based on their own meanings. Observation Box 3.4 Exercise By using observational skills only, what type of information about health and illness can you elicit from a service user?

The principle of observation in physical health is the same, albeit more technical, when recording and reporting baseline observations or signs and symptoms of physical illness. Observation is an important aspect of physical assessment, as it can provide important information without asking questions. We will cover this in more detail in the general survey below. It is important that we use our senses when we 'observe' and do not rely solely on direct question and answering. Observation skills are very important for practitioners if a MHSU does not consent to a physical exam. For example, our senses can alert us as follows: weight, mobility, personal hygiene, skin colour - sight body odour, tobacco or alcohol use - smell respiration - hearing However, it is important not to assume too much and that appropriate clinical measurements are taken to confirm our observations. Attitude A professional attitude is another key assessment skill. You may uncover risk-taking behav- iours that run counter to our health beliefs as health professionals, such as practising unsafe sex or injecting drug use. A professional attitude will enable you to be non-judgemental so that you can offer appropriate care, support, and advice. Clinical assessment of physical health There are a number of different tools and clinical measurements that the MHN can use in a physical assessment. These are listed below and each will be explained in more detail during the following chapters. Table 3.2 illustrates some of the clinical measurements taken during an assessment. Specific techniques Estes (2002) outlines four key techniques that nurses need to perform a physical assessment: Inspection: the process of systematic observation using sight and smell. Palpation: the use of touch to elicit information on texture, moisture, temperature, oedema, pulse, shape and size, motion, tenderness or pain. Percussion: tapping the body with short, sharp taps to elicit information such as location, size or density. Auscultation: using a stethoscope to listen to the sounds produced by the body - breathing, abdominal sounds and heart sounds. Mental health nurses may be unfamiliar with these from a practice perspective but they have most probably seen them employed by a doctor. However, there is no reason not to acquire these skills through training. Assessment aids There are a number of different assessment scales and tools that can aid MHNs in their physi- cal assessments. Examples include: The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) - useful in caring for underweight and malnourished individuals. The Glasgow Coma Scale, Pupils Equal, Round, and Reactive to Light (PEARRL) - useful when caring for someone with epilepsy, delirium or loss of consciousness.

Principles of physical health assessment in mental health care 33 The Waterlow pressure ulcer risk assessment - useful in the care of people with poor skin integrity (e.g. care of older people, extreme weight loss in anorexia). Waist tape measure, Ashwell\u00ae Shape Calculator - useful tools in assessing weight as a car- diovascular risk factor. Locally developed assessment tools - good practice in this area should be shared, so speak with colleagues to determine which tools are used locally. Mental health nurses may not take all of the measurements referred to in Table 3.2; for example, spirometry will be undertaken in primary care or acute health settings. Informed consent is important if bloods are to be taken. The MHN should provide reassurance and a clear explanation of the procedure to the service user. For example, if someone wants to know if they have a sexually transmitted disease (STD), a blood sample can be taken and sent to the lab. However, if a MHSU wants to know their HIV status, this normally requires pre- and post-test counselling and you should consult your local policy. Performing a physical assessment Conducting a physical assessment requires a structured and systematic approach to informa- tion gathering. To enable this, you should have access to a standardized physical assessment form. A standardized physical assessment promotes uniformity, structure, and equity, thus ensuring all MHSUs get a structured assessment from which more specific investigations can be arranged where indicated.Table 3.2 Measurements taken during the course of an assessment Measurement Rationale Blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG) Important for monitoring cardiovascular health, screening for CHD, monitoring medication side-effects and oxygen levels in the blood Body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, waist/girth measurementImportant for diagnosing obesity and monitoring weight, which are risk factors for CHD and stroke Temperature Important for monitoring infections and side-effects of medications, e.g. hypothermia Respirations, peak flow spirometry, chest X-ray cough, sputum Important for monitoring respiratory health, screening for chest infections, and measuring lung function Urinalysis Important for detecting and monitoring new/existing conditions, e.g. T2D or substance misuse Blood tests and pathology Important for detecting, monitoring or screening for new/existing conditions, e.g. T2D or lipid levels.

This occurs dur- ing our initial encounter with a MHSU and concerns aspects of physical health or illness that are noticeable by sight, sound or smell. The general survey will give you a broad idea of the person's state of health through observation and without invasive measurements. However, clinical measurements will come at a later stage to confirm or refute any impressions we have arising from the general survey. The general survey should dictate the nature of physical assessment. Obvious physical dis- tress, such as breathlessness, will indicate an emergency physical assessment using a prob-lem-centred approach (see below). Impressions gained during the general survey should also raise 'red flags' that you need to follow up when you select one of the approaches to physical assessment. For example, a simple greeting and handshake can relax the service user but also tell you that cold extremities may indicate poor circulation that will need further investigation. Characteristics that can be observed during a general survey include: General appearance - state of dress, unkemptness, appropriateness of clothing. Posture - gait, steadiness. Behaviour - orientation, consciousness, evidence of agitation, fatigue, wincing when in pain, breathing difficulty. Personal hygiene - body odour, hair infestation, oral health. Build - height and weight, over- or underweight, malnourished (although a general idea can be gleaned from observation, a body mass index [BMI] reading will determine these). Skin - general condition, colour, bruising, cyanosis, pallor, flushing; presence of disorders such as eczema or psoriasis, rashes, sores, ulcers, cuts. Breathing - audible sounds like wheezing, breathlessness, cough. Nails - broken, fungal infection, nicotine-stained. Lifestyle - smoking status: tobacco smell, nicotine-stained fingers or hair; alcohol use: smell of alcohol, possession of alcohol, withdrawal tremors; evidence of jaundice: skin yellowing, yellowing of eye sclera; possession of drugs or 'works', needle marks. The general survey can indicate performance on various activities of daily living that might be compromised due to an underlying physical condition. It will also provide some indication of the person's mental state, which may have a bearing on issues of consent when further inspection and clinical measurements (e.g. pulse, BP, taking bloods) are required following the general survey. The above techniques are employed by different approaches to physical assessment, out- lined next.Figure 3.2 The general survey in physical assessmentGeneral Sur vey Physical assessment outcomeBody systems approachHead-to-toe approachProblem-centred approach Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Principles of physical health assessment in mental health care 35 General approaches to physical assessment There are three approaches to physical assessment: head-to-toe approach; body systems approach; problem-centred approach. The approach to assessment will probably be influenced by a number of considerations (see Table 3.3). The head-to-toe approach and the body systems approach are most suited for physical assessment as part of admission or discharge. The problem-centred approach is more suited to when symptoms or problems are reported. However, approaches to assess - ment are just that - approaches. And it is quite usual for a mixture of these approaches to be used. Approaches are frameworks that serve to help practitioners by providing structure to assessment and a system within which to work. Whichever approach is used, it is important that it is structured. Most local policies allow a time-frame of 72 hours in which this assess - ment should be completed and it is important that it is followed up within the locally specified time-frames. Head-to-toe approach This is a familiar approach whereby the nurse starts at the person's head and works down through the body. The assessment focuses on the head, neck and chest, arms, abdomen, groin, and lower limbs. This assessment is illustrated in Figure 3.3. You should ask questions about: normal and usual functioning; changes in functioning; pain or discomfort. The MHN will rely on MHSUs' self-report of physical symptoms and corroboration of these with family or carers and medical records. Clinical skills of observation, inspection, palpation, and auscultation will be used during the physical assessment. Table 3.3 Factors influencing approaches to physical assessment Factor Rationale The presence of a physical health strategy, including the presence of physical assessment documentation To standardize practice, ensure equity of assessment, prevent ad hoc assessment, provide structure to practice Standards for physical assessment To benchmark best practice, provide data for evidence- based practice The role of the doctor in physical assessment To prevent role or task duplication with the mental health nurse The mental health status of the MHSU in relation to consent What should be done if consent is not forthcoming - see physical assessment of the non-consenting patient later in this chapter (p. 42) The presence of a pre-existing physical condition Get collateral information regarding diagnosis and treatment, ensure continuity of care The presence of a medical condition resulting from a critical incident, e.g. neck injury following attempted asphyxiation Physical assessment will include observation of all risk factors and safety of both mental and physical health Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Principles of physical health assessment in mental health care 37 example, the Nursing Times ran a series on 'systems of life', from which you could structure an assessment (see Table 3.4). However, many tests of function are invasive, for example blood will be required to assess the circulatory and endocrine systems. While not as invasive as tak - ing bloods, BP and temperature will require bodily contact with the MHSU. A body systems approach will include the elements shown in Table 3.4.Baseline observations Blood pressure Pulse Respirations Temperature BMI WaistGenito-urinary Women Menstruation problems, breast lumps Men Impotence, anorgasmia (failure to ejaculate),testicular lumps Both Sexual activity and use of contraception, visibledischarges, odours, presence/history of rashesindicative Lower limbsAnkle oedema (hands also), numbness, sensations,peripheral coldness, cyanosisMobility - use of a walking aid, steadinessAbdominal Alimentary problems, digestion, eliminationPain, nausea, vomiting, decreased or increase d appetite, gastric reflux, heartburn, abdomina l cramping.

Principles of physical health assessment in mental health care 39 Figure 3.4 A structured problem-centred assessment with key questions General survey Nature of the presenting complaint, location - where does it hurt? Where is the discomfort? Onset When did it first happen? Was onset sudden or slow? Are you currently getting treatment ? Assess severity How much does it hurt? How intense is the pain, e.g. on a scale of 1 ('no pain') to 10 ('lot of pain')? Does the problem prevent you from carrying out your daily routine? Explain how? Assess pattern Frequency - how often does it happen? Most recent occurrence? When is it most problematic? If pain, is it sharp and stabbing or dull and pulsating? Assess duration How long have you had it? How long does it last ? Assess exacerbating and relieving factors What makes it worse? What makes it better? How do you manage the discomfort yourself? Assess family or associated history Is this the first time it has happened? Is there a family history? Have you had prior treatment for this? What was it and did it work? Assess associated problems Have you noticed anything else unusual, any other signs or symptoms? Document your findings and communicate these as appropriateStep 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5 Step 6 Step 7 Step 8 Step 9 Problem-centred approach The third approach to physical assessment is the problem-centred approach. Here you will ask the MHSU about the presence of illness, pain or discomfort. You may even notice discomfort in your general survey and this will lead you naturally into a problem-centred assessment. If there is a presenting complaint, ask closed questions to keep focused and to gain succinct details (e.g. questions on timing, pattern, and severity). When something is identified, specific observations and investigations are then structured around the presenting complaint. Following this, you should take routine observations and a health history before documenting and communicating your findings appropriately (see Figure 3.4). Box 3.6 Case example Nurse: Hello John, you are due for a physical check, can I do it now? John: Yes, that's fine. Nurse: How have you been in general? John: OK, but I have a bad cough at times.

Therefore, the initial part of the assessment should be concise. Here practitioners need to decide if the complaints are of a medical emergency - for example, someone is cyanosed and clutching at their chest, or they are anxious and hyperventilating. Problems should therefore be listed in order of severity to prioritize needs safely and give further structure to the assessment. Physical assessment and history-taking History-taking is another core component of physical assessment that practitioners should become familiar with. History-taking is the systematic assessment of key physical health events or risk factors that the MHSU may have experienced. Exploring family history is an important aspect of this with respect to diabetes and coronary problems. When taking a health history, it is important you use both open and closed questions. The first few questions should be open-ended to get the MHSU talking about their general health and life - style, how they have been feeling, if they have any concerns or are currently feeling any physical discomfort. Y ou can then hone in on any concerns that they have by asking more closed questions. When taking a health history, you should be aware of: birth complications and normal developmental milestones, e.g. puberty; any pre-existing physical conditions; current or past treatment history (as appropriate); history of surgery or other significant hospital admissions for a physical problem; history of vaccinations and immunizations; history of screening, e.g. cervical smear results; allergies - in general (e.g. hay fever) and more specific ADRs and drug allergies; substance use - alcohol, tobacco, illicit substances. Taking a family history Family history is another aspect of physical assessment, as conditions such as diabetes and CHD run in families. Although the MHSU may not have a physical condition, if it is part of the family history, it is an important risk factor that needs documenting. You should document: current health status of close family - parents and siblings; current physical conditions and treatments; past physical conditions and treatments; tactfully, the cause of death if family members have died. Linking the structure and process during the physical assessment As stated previously, structure is integral to a successful physical assessment. Practitioners must blend the approach to assessment with a process of eliciting information. Figure 3.5 is a Nurse: Tell me about the cough; is it a productive cough? I mean do you cough up anything? John: Yes, sometimes I have some phlegm. Nurse: You say sometimes, how often is this on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is all the time and 10 almost never. John: I would give it a 7. Nurse: You say you cough up phlegm, does it have a colour? John: Yes it is usually greenish. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Principles of physical health assessment in mental health care 41 representation of this. There is no hard and fast rule to this and as you become more confident and skilled, you will undoubtedly find your own style. However, it remains that assessment must be holistic, all observations taken and recorded accurately and communicated to the team and the MHSU. These must be appropriate with timely follow-up and onward referral if something is detected. Essential equipment for a physical assessment Appropriate equipment is important to ensure accurate clinical observations are recorded. It is also important to ensure that any digital equipment used is regularly serviced under the manu-facturer's guidelines. Other equipment might be sterile and single-use, so check expiry dates. The following list illustrates equipment required for a physical assessment: physical assessment checklist; associated charts, e.g. temperature, pulse and respiration; pen and pocket torch; watch with a second hand; stethoscope; sphygmomanometer; thermometer; scales, height and waist tape measure; urinalysis equipment; infection control items (if required) - gloves, apron, mask, eye protection, hand sanitizer. Garden (2005) outlines equipment required for a medical assessment that includes some of the above together with an auroscope, alcometer, Snellen chart, tendon hammer, and tuning fork (256 Hz).Figure 3.5 Linking the structure and process of physical assessmentRecord and document outcomes, repor t to medical staff Take any appropriate action Confer and clarify symptoms with client Vital signs and other physical assessment or measurementPhysical assessment (select approach)History-taking, personal and familialGeneral sur vey Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

It is clear he does not want to be there and he does not consent to a physical assessment. From your observations you notice that John is sweaty and becoming more agitated. You also notice a sweet pear drop odour on his breath. He is not consenting to an assessment. What do you do? It is important that you gain the consent of the MHSU when undertaking an assessment. At times consent might be implied, such as when doing physical 'obs' you approach a MHSU with a sphygmomanometer and they begin to roll up their sleeve. It is not only courteous for you to begin by asking if you can perform the observation, it provides you with an opportunity to enquire about the MHSU's health in general. I have witnessed qualified and unqualified nurses presuming consent, strapping on a cuff, pumping it up, recording the reading, and leaving without any interaction whatsoever, or any regard for the MHSU's dignity or privacy. There is no need to overcomplicate the issue of consent. Normally MHSUs will consent to a physical assessment. However, you should be aware of socio-cultural factors that may impact on consent, such as culture or gender issues concerning male/female nurses and male/female service users. Service users have the right to ask that a nurse of their own gender conduct the physical assessment. For nurses, there may still be professional taboos around male nurses undertaking physical assessments on female MHSUs. Ironically, this may not be an issue for female nurses and male MHSUs. Box 3.8 Exercise What systems can be employed to ensure physical assessments are completed? Physical assessment of a non-consenting mental health service user At times, MHSUs may not consent to a physical assessment. This will probably be at an acute phase of their illness, such as following relapse. If someone has been brought into hospital involuntarily, they may be upset and angry and manifest this by refusal to engage with the admission process (see Box 3.7). In an agitated state, a MHSU may not consent to a physical exam, so invasive measurements such as BP and pulse may not be possible. Furthermore, agi- tation may prevent reliable readings. Observational skills can still be used to undertake a general survey, where a 'crude' or sim- ple assessment can be conducted and documented (see Table 3.5). A full physical can then be completed when consent is forthcoming. The purpose of doing a general survey is to note anything that may require urgent treatment, as not to do so may endanger the health and well-being of the MHSU. Table 3.5 illustrates the different observations you can undertake in these circumstances and shows which body system they relate to. Physical care protocols will usually have built-in 'clauses' for such situations, including that the assessment should happen within 48 or 72 hours of admission. This gives some time for the agitation to abate. However, it may be easy to miss the assessment altogether if no one goes back to check. Documentation and record-keeping Documenting and recording the physical assessment is very important. You should accurately and clearly document: Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Principles of physical health assessment in mental health care 43 what has occurred; when it occurred; what else needs to be done; by whom; by when. Standardized documentation will likely be in use, so compliance with its completion is impor- tant. All clinical measurements should be performed, even if they fall into 'normal' ranges or if no problems are noted. For example, it may be assumed that a blank entry means 'no problem noted', but it could also indicate that this part of the assessment has been omitted. Where con-sent has not been given, this should also be documented. Following the documentation process, the outcomes of the assessment will need to be com- municated appropriately to: the relevant person in charge of the shift (if in a hospital setting); the medical staff - including the consultant and any junior doctor; the GP - if in the community, residential care or hostel setting; the primary nurse or key worker - if they have not been involved; other members of the inter-professional team for care planning purposes, e.g. occupational therapist or dietitian; the MHSU and their family/carer as appropriate. Inter-professional communication is important for continuity of care, especially if further investigations are required. Written communication should be documented under any profes-sional codes of conduct and for nurses this would be the UK Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC 2008) Code of Standards of Conduct. Barriers to using physical assessment skills Brown et al. (1987) suggest that a lack of confidence among some nurses is a barrier to using skills. This highlights the need for robust educational programmes, skills rehearsal, and super- vised practice, as well as a sound evidence base to underpin practice developments. There is no general agreement as to what should be undertaken as part of a physical assess - ment or how frequently they should be performed, for example every 6 or 12 months. This means that there is no standardized physical assessment tool for use in mental health services, so each Table 3.5 A 'simple' physical assessment format for a non-consenting MHSU Assessment Clinical observation General survey General appearance, personal hygiene (body odour), smoking status (tobacco odour, nicotine stains on fingers), smell of alcohol on breath Sensory Wears glasses, has a hearing aid Cardiovascular system Pallor, cyanosis Respiratory system Number of respirations, wheezing, breathlessness, cough Integumentary system Visible signs of injury, bruising (old and recent), dryness, eczema, sweating, skin colour Nervous system Level of consciousness, irritability, arousal Endocrine system Fruity smell on breath Musculoskeletal Gait, presence of musculoskeletal disorders - arthritis Other Allergies, e.g. hay fever type symptoms - watery eyes, sneezing Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Without standardization there may be variations in practice regarding the quality of physical assessment, which might affect the quality of care the MHSU receives. However, useful guidelines for monitoring physical assessment are contained in the UK NICE clinical guideline for bipolar disorder (NICE 2006a: 6): People with bipolar disorder should have an annual physical health review, normally in primary care, to ensure that the following are assessed each year: lipid levels, including cholesterol in all patients over 40 even if there is no other indica-tion of risk plasma glucose levels weight smoking status and alcohol use blood pressure. There is a clear need for standardized assessment frameworks for initial and annual assess- ment. Readers are directed to Chapter 10, which covers the annual health check and provides an example of how a HNA might look (Table 10.4). Conclusion The key to good physical assessment is structure. This chapter has outlined three approaches that can be used as a framework to structure physical assessment. Within such a framework, a general survey, observation, and communication skills are key, together with safe and compe-tent clinical skills for clinical measurement. Furthermore, nurses should have basic knowledge of signs and symptoms indicative of physical illness. We have seen that observation is a key skill, as a lot of useful information can be collected this way (e.g. signs of jaundice or cyano-sis). Although nurses may have sound skills for undertaking the 'classic' observations - pulse, BP, and temperature - further examination skills should be learned to enhance both compe-tence and confidence in physical assessment. Finally, nurses need to be supported in this role and have appropriate supervision or mentoring. Summary of key points Physical assessment must be structured and physical assessment schedules fully completed. Practitioners must be aware of physical illnesses that might present as mental illness. Practitioners must have the necessary tools for conducting a physical assessment. A structured history is an important part of physical assessment. Practitioners must have appropriate physical examination skills, e.g. inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation.

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 4Part 2 Physical assessment skills for practice Introduction This chapter explores the clinical skills required for examining and monitoring MHSUs' physical health.

Testing samples can be done on the ward (e.g. urinalysis) or sent to a pathology lab (e.g. a sputum sample). The principles of infection control are important when undertaking clinical observations. All practitioners should follow local policies and procedures pertaining to the collection, han-dling, and safe disposal of clinical waste. This is important in protecting the health and safety of both MHSUs and staff. When performing clinical observations or taking clinical samples, hand hygiene is very important. Practitioners should wash their hands and/or use alcohol hand rub before and after contact with MHSUs. This will minimize the chance of cross-infection while increasing MHSU confidence and reassurance that infection control is taken seriously. Practitioners should also remember the practical aspects of physical assessment outlined in Chapter 3 when undertak-ing clinical observations. Clinical governance Clinical governance is defined as 'an umbrella term for everything that helps to maintain and improve high standards of patient care' (Currie et al. 2003: 7). As nurses, we are trained to per- form a range of observations used in physical assessment. However, there are risks involved in physical assessment and although small, they require management. Risks range from cross-infection when using equipment or disposing of clinical waste to forgetting to perform, or document, a clinical observation. Clinical governance is the process of achieving high-quality care through managing these risks. Examples of clinical governance initiatives that manage risk and promote MHSU safety include: Following established policies and procedures, e.g. infection control. Developing and implementing clinical standards, e.g. physical assessment protocols. Clinical audit, e.g. auditing the effectiveness of physical assessment protocols. Implementing evidence-based practice, e.g. diabetes screening. Staff education and training, e.g. clinical skills refresher courses for all practitioners. Accurate and consistent documentation and record-keeping. It is important that organizations have a structure in place to support a physical health and well-being strategy. This includes assessment protocols, equipment, resources, and edu - cation and training. There is also a need to promote better liaison and inter-professional working, especially in primary care, where facilitating physical health may be more complex than in a hospital setting. Practitioners working in the community could explore the differ - ent types of nurses that work there. It would be beneficial to determine what their roles are in order to make appropriate referrals and reduce duplication of work. Investment in train - ing and education is required, as Nash (2005) has shown that MHNs are highly motivated to undertake training in physical care skills. The training of nurses is covered more fully in Chapter 10. Box 4.2 Exercise Define homeostasis. This chapter will illustrate clinical observation skills within a mental health context. The framework for physical assessment is outlined in Figure 4.1. The first two steps, which have been covered in depth in previous chapters, are the first steps in assessing MHSUs' physi-cal health.

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 47 support our general survey findings; and the clinical observations will corroborate our find- ings and confirm whether further investigations are warranted. Of the wide range of clinical observations, the following will be covered here: Temperature. Pulse. Blood pressure. Electrocardiogram. Pulse oximetry. Respiration rate. Sputum collection. Peak flow. Urinalysis. Body mass index. Waist-to-hip ratio and waist measurement. Blood glucose. Pathology tests for blood. The rationale for selecting these is that they are the key observations associated with the prevalent physical illnesses outlined in this book. Other clinical skills are undertaken by more appropriately qualified nurses; for example, a tissue viability nurse or diabetes nurse spe - cialist will undertake a diabetic leg ulcer assessment, and a respiratory nurse specialist or practice nurse will perform spirometry. In these instances, you will need to effectively liaise with these colleagues. However, skills can be taught and it is important that our repertoire of skills in physical care continue to grow. This can be reflected in our post-registration educa - tion where we may opt for courses in physical health such as tissue viability or performing an ECG.Figure 4.1 t he process of physical assessment and observationInitial Meeting The General Survey The Physical Assessment Clinical Obser vationsFurther InvestigationsEvaluation & Diagnosis Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Rationale for taking baseline observations Baseline observations are an essential part of the physical assessment of an existing condi- tion, the monitoring of an established condition or basic screening. These observations pro-vide clinically important information: baseline measurements for future comparison; screening for previously undiagnosed conditions; monitoring previously diagnosed illnesses; determining the response to treatment of a current physical illness; monitoring the course of a current physical condition(s); promoting early intervention; selecting the best intervention or treatment. Remember, when undertaking clinical observations you should endeavour to protect the MHSU's privacy and dignity. Homeostasis Homeostasis is the regulation by an organism of the chemical composition of its body fluids and other aspects of its internal environment so that physiological processes can proceed optimally (Oxford Dictionary of Biology , 4th edition, 2000). In homeostasis, a system will make adjust - ments to restore balance when there is interruption from internal and external disturbances. Components of a homeostatic system A homeostatic system has four components (see Figure 4.2): The control centre sets the predetermined reference points for homeostasis, e.g. body tem- perature, pulse rate or insulin levels. A receptor detects changes that cause a homeostatic imbalance. It sends a message to the control centre outlining this. The control centre sends a message to an effector to act and restore homeostasis, e.g. a mes- sage goes to the pancreas to release more insulin. A feedback loop: the effector sends a message to the control centre confirming action and the control centre responds when homeostatic balance has been restored. Homeostasis controls a range of clinical observations, including pulse, BP, and glucose/ insulin release. We can illustrate homeostasis with reference to temperature as in Table 4.1. Homeostasis is a good concept for guiding the nursing process: Assessment - body temperature is out of balance. Diagnosis - MHSU is pyrexic. Plan - restore homeostasis. Implement - interventions to restore normal temperature. Evaluate - has homeostasis been restored? Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Factors that will influence assessment include the approach you use and the present-ing complaint. Therefore, it is important that you are aware of factors such as MHSUs' past medical history and any significant close family history of physical illness.Box 4.3 Exercise Outline the infection control issues that need to be considered when undertak- ing a physical assessment. Box 4.4 Case example Simon has been admitted to your ward following a crisis visit. He has a history of schizo-affective disorder. He is presenting in an agitated and anxious state. Staff are putting his physical presentation down to his not wanting to be admitted and his anxiety at leaving home. He is refusing any interaction with staff, preferring to have a cigarette alone. a little while later you notice Simon is more subdued but he has breathing difficulties and is clutch- ing his chest. From observation alone we can make a quick assessment. Assessment General appearance - Simon appears to be physically unwell, his skin an ashen colour; he is sweaty and lips are cyanosed, oedema evident in ankles, hands cold to touch. Lifestyle risk factors - smoking.Respiration - audible breathing distress, rapid and shallow breaths, experiences chest pain (MHSU clasps chest). Mobility - normally good but now immobile, when trying to move he expends a lot of effort. Baseline observations Blood pressure = 180/100, Pulse 140, r espirations 22 shallow and rapid, t emperature 38.2\u00b0C. Diagnosis Suspected myocardial infarction or heart failure. Plan activate medical emergency and transfer to acute care or accident and emergency services. Observation is an important skill, as at times it will indicate the nature of the presenting complaint as an emergency (as illustrated in Box 4.4) or as routine screening. Observation needs to be quick and effective. Even in the unlikely event that Simon turns out to have severe indigestion, you will not be faulted for suspecting something more sinister. Indeed, at times the reverse is true; the sinister complaint may be ignored due to diagnostic overshadowing. Observation is a valuable skill when MHSUs do not consent to a physical exam, as a crude assessment can be made from a distance (see Chapter 3). Nevertheless, we must have the pre-requisite knowledge and skills in physical health to make use of observation skills. We should always confirm our observations with a clinical assessment.

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 51 Clinical skills used routinely in mental health care Temperature Temperature is one of the core clinical observations. The thermoregulatory centre of the hypothalamus regulates body temperature. The temperature observation can either be too low or too high (Table 4.2). Taking a temperature reading The first task in taking a person's temperature is to determine the site at which to obtain a reading, such as orally, from the forehead or from the ear canal. These sites are less inva - sive and do not require disrobing. The axilla (underarm) site is also used but this is a little more invasive as disrobing may be required. In cases of hypothermia, a rectal temperature is required. When documenting the temperature reading, you should indicate the site at which it was taken. Equipment There are two types of thermometer, digital and non-digital. Both types are used to take read- ings from various sites. A tympanic thermometer uses an infrared light to detect heat rising from the tympanic membrane, providing a digital reading (Nicol et al. 2004b). A non-digital thermometer (e.g. Tempadot) can be used to take oral or axilla readings. It is important that the correct equipment is used when taking a temperature reading; for example, an oral ther- mometer should not be used for a rectal temperature. Infection control and equipment issues Whichever equipment is used, the principles of infection control should be followed to pre- vent risk of cross-infection. Single-use-only devices should be used and new tympanic covers employed each time a new temperature reading is required. Although more convenient to use, tympanic thermometers require careful handling and should be used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. They also need regular servicing to ensure they are fit for purpose. You should be aware of instructions for use as a variety of thermometers, from a range of manufacturers, may be in use. For example, some tympanic thermometers have a single-use facility where it will not function unless a new pro-tective cap is used. Some tympanic thermometers have memory functions, so it is important that what you record is the real-time reading and not one stored in the memory. Batteries will also require frequent checking to ensure they are well charged.Table 4.2 temperature ranges Temperature Range Potential cause Hypothermia Below 35\u00b0C a D r Normal temperature neutropenia Hyper-pyrexia a bove 40\u00b0C Source: a dapted from Mains et al.

Of course, if an oral reading cannot be taken (e.g. due to a mouth injury or uncon-sciousness), an alternative site will be required. If taking a temperature reading via axilla, irrespective of thermometer type, you should respect the MHSU's privacy and dignity.Table 4.3 taking an oral temperature reading with a non-digital thermometer Step Action Rationale 1 Prepare equipment Select thermometer, pen, chart for recording result t o ensure effective monitoring and prompt recording of reading 2 Decontaminate hands Wash hands or use alcohol rub t o promote infection control and minimize cross-infection 3 Explain procedure Outline your intended actions t o reassure the MHSU and gain consent 4 Ensure MHSU is rested and relaxed Ensure MHSU has not smoked or drunk tea/coffee beforehand t o minimize biased readings 5 Ask MHSU to open their mouth Insert the thermometer under the tongue t his will give a reading that is close to the core body temperature 6 Ask the MHSU to close their mouth a dvise the MHSU to envelop the thermometer when their mouth is closed. a dvise them not to bite or chew on the thermometer. r efrain from talking until the procedure is over Enveloping the thermometer will prevent air from impairing the reading.

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 53 Box 4.5 Case example Michael is 38 years old and has a history of psychotic disorder. He is currently receiving risperidone 3 mg twice daily. He smokes 30 cigarettes a day and takes little exercise. He reports not feeling well over the last few days. You take his observations and find that his temperature is 38.6\u00b0C. What do you do? Assessment Michael has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C. He feels unwell and has a cough that is producing greenish sputum. Diagnosis Michael has a chest infection as he has a fever and his temperature homeostasis is out of balance. r easons for this include: Michael is pyrexic, he has a productive cough, sputum is greenish in colour. Michael is a smoker and is thus vulnerable to chest infections. Michael has probably contracted influenza. Michael is also taking an antipsychotic medication that may cause blood irregularities. Plan return Michael's temperature to normal homeostatic balance. a n inter-professional approach will be required involving Michael's doctor. Baseline observations indicate fever, so more information regarding the nature of the suspect infection is required. Blood tests for pathology are required to determine the exact nature of the infection and antibiotic to prescribe - full blood count (FBC) including white cell count. Infection may be due to a low white cell count as a result of an a D r . Collect a sputum sample for pathology. Implementation Pathology tests indicate a chest infection. a n a D r has been excluded, as white cell count is normal. a fter a team discussion, it is decided that Michael requires a course of antibiotics. t ake Michael's baseline observations two hourly for the first 48 hours, then four hourly thereafter until homeostasis returns. r emember the principles of infection control to prevent cross-infection. Ensure Michael complies with antibiotic medications. Monitoring should be for desired and undesired effects of the treatment. Encourage Michael to reduce smoking to promote recuperation. Encourage Michael to bed rest as much as possible but also ensure mobility to maintain independence. a dvise Michael that he may feel generally weak and may be unsteady, so he should mobilize with care to prevent falling. Encourage Michael to dress appropriately to avoid becoming overly cold or hot. Encourage Michael to sit upright to aid respiration and ensure he can clear any sputum. Encourage Michael to use tissues and to cover his mouth when coughing and sneezing to minimize cross-infection. Give Michael alcohol rub to promote hand hygiene during his illness. Encourage adequate fluid balance to prevent dehydration. Ensure Michael has adequate pillows for proper positioning at night. Ensure night staff are aware of the care plan to promote continuity of care. r egularly monitor the care plan to determine progress.

The pulse can be felt wherever an artery is near the surface of the skin, passing over a bone. Taking a pulse The first task in taking a pulse is determining the site from which it will be measured. Figure 4.3 outlines the main pulse points. The pulse is usually taken at the radial site (Figure 4.4), as it is accessible and does not require disrobing. Super ficial Pulse pointsEvaluate Evaluate care plan at the end of each shift to determine progress. Monitor observations, fluid balance, medication compliance, and smoking behaviour. a sk Michael how he is feeling to allow a subjective evaluation of the care plan. a s tem- perature falls, baseline observations can revert from two to four hourly. Evaluation will continue daily until temperature homeostasis is restored. Michael should be advised that the course of antibiotics has to be completed even though temperature may be within normal limits. a s Michael is in a high-risk group, vaccinations for influenza and pneumococcal infection should be discussed with him to minimize potential future episodes.

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 55 Characteristics of a 'normal' pulse Pulse measurement assesses pulse quality, which provides an indication of heart function. The volume of blood pumped by the heart usually remains constant. Any variation in the amount of blood being pumped will result in a quicker or slower pulse. Pulse rate and BP differ with age. The 'normal' pulse rate for a healthy adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (Lynn 2004). Rate, rhythm, and amplitude are the three key components of pulse assessment (see Table 4.4). Pulse monitoring Pulse monitoring will be undertaken at various times, such as when MHSUs report being unwell. It will certainly be taken on admission for a baseline reading and depending on its quality, it may be done either routinely or periodically thereafter. Routine pulse monitoring may be conducted in response to a current physical condition that is being treated or to moni-tor adverse drug reactions. Usually readings will be recorded twice daily (BD) - once in the morning and evening - or, if it is a serious heart condition, up to four times daily (QID). Procedure for taking a pulse A description of the procedure for taking a pulse is provided in Table 4.5. Be careful not to apply too much pressure to the pulse point, as this will be uncomfortable and may make the pulse harder to detect. If the pulse point is difficult to locate, begin again. It is important to be relaxed to minimize unnecessary anxiety, which may increase the MHSU's heart rate and render a false pulse reading.Figure 4.4 t aking a radial pulse Table 4.4 Characteristics of the pulse Characteristic Definition Abnormal rate t he number of times the heart beats Under 60 or over 100 beats per minute r hythm a series of regular beats Irregular beats, missed beats a mplitude How long the pulse lasts for Weak and thready, or strong and bounding Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

In the example in Box 4.6, Joe's pulse is only slightly elevated. We might assume that Joe is anxious about his discharge, which may have increased his heart rate. We can suggest that Joe mentions this when he next goes to see his GP or his community MHN so that it can be reassessed. We would record the observation and document our actions. When clinical observations hover above or below the normal and abnormal ranges, there is always a clinical decision to be made. This causes anxiety. It is easier to make clinical deci- sions when there is a clear-cut abnormality. For example, what would your response be if Joe's pulse was 160? Obviously, very different from that above, as it is a more critical situation with greater risk.Table 4.5 Procedure for taking a pulse Step Action Rationale 1 Prepare equipment Watch with a second hand, pen, chart for recording result t o ensure effective monitoring and prompt recording of reading 2 Decontaminate hands Wash hands or use alcohol rub t o promote infection control and minimize cross-infection 3 Explain procedure Outline your intended actions t o gain consent 4 Ensure MHSU is rested and relaxed r ested for 5 minutes, has not smoked or drunk tea/coffee t o minimize biased readings 5 Place fingertips (as indicated in Figure 4.4) Firmly press on the radial pulse t oo little or too much pressure may make pulse recording difficult 6 Palpate pulse r ate, rhythm, and amplitude for 1 minute t o assess heart function.

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 57 Blood pressure Box 4.7 Exercise List the factors that can affect BP readings. Blood pressure is defined as the pressure of blood against the walls of the main arteries (Jevon 2007a). Blood pressure is the product of cardiac output \u00d7 peripheral resistance (based on Waugh and Grant 2006). The main function of maintaining BP is to ensure adequate perfusion of the organs (Jevon 2007a). Without an adequate blood supply, organs lose their function due to tissue and cell damage, resulting in long-term chronic conditions. Equipment A sphygmomanometer is used to measure BP. These are available in two varieties - manual and digital. Since any mercury spillage will incur great expense, non-mercury sphygmoma-nometers are becoming more popular. Digital sphygmomanometers are more convenient, some of which also measure pulse. How- ever, unless well serviced and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations, they can lose calibration. This can result in mis-readings, as can low batteries or mistakenly record-ing measurements from the machine's memory. Digital sphygmomanometers do not require you to listen for the Korotkoff sounds but it is always good practice to do so. If you rely on this type of sphygmomanometer for pulse readings, be aware that all you are getting is the rate. You are not getting the rhythm or amplitude, two important aspects of pulse assessment (see Table 4.4). 'Normal' blood pressure Blood pressure is an evaluation of how well the cardiovascular system is functioning. The standard 'normal' BP is given as 120/80 mmHg. The first number, 120 mmHg, is the systo-lic pressure. This is the pressure produced when the heart is active. The second number, 80 mmHg, is the diastolic pressure. When the heart is not pumping it is relaxing, allowing blood to flow in, in preparation for the next pump. This is called diastole. Diastolic pressure is lower than systolic pressure. These readings may not be exactly 120/80 mmHg; they may be slightly higher (125/85 mmHg) or lower (115/75 mmHg). Therefore, a range for 'normal' BP may be more appropriate. The British Heart Foundation (BHF 2013a) suggests the following: Normal BP range - a blood pressure below 140/85 mmHg. If you have diabetes - a target blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. What is clear is that an increase or decrease of 30 mmHg in diastolic or systolic blood pres- sure would be a cause of concern, more so if other risk factors for cardiovascular illness are present. Blood pressure monitoring Monitoring BP is similar to monitoring pulse, which is outlined above. Korotkoff sounds and blood pressure measurement When we take a manual BP reading, the sounds we hear are known as the Korotkoff sounds. There are five phases and for the BP reading we record Phase 1 (systolic) and Phase 5 (diasto-lic) (see Table 4.6).

Factors affecting blood pressure readings Sometimes BP readings will be high or low. Two sets of circumstances can account for this - physiological factors such as illness, or poor technique. If your technique is not up to date, the equipment not correct or proper procedures not followed, then errors in measurement will occur. Physiological factors and technique can affect blood pressure readings in the following ways: 1 Physiological factors stroke volume (the beating of the left ventricle); left ventricular failure; elasticity of the aorta and other large arteries to distend and take the pumped blood; physical conditions - aneurysm, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction; blood viscosity (thickness) of the blood; poor cardiac conduction; stimulants, e.g. alcohol/smoking; 2 Technique activity, e.g. talking/exercise immediately prior to BP reading; clothing obstructing cuff; inadequate cuff size, ill-fitting cuff; sphygmomanometer not calibrated or not functioning correctly; recent consumption of food; emotional state - anxiety, stress; white coat effect (anxiety arising out of request for a BP reading); posture, e.g. poor arm positioning; medication given shortly before reading is taken. Electrocardiogram The cardiac conduction system is monitored using an ECG. The ECG picks up the heart's elec- trical activity through pads placed on the skin in the thoracic area. A 12-lead ECG is most often used as it gives a more accurate interpretation of the rhythm than a single-lead cardiac monitor (Jevon 2007b). The ECG is an important diagnostic tool and it can be used to identify a range of cardiac conditions, including angina, myocardial infarction, and palpitations the Korotkoff sounds Korotkoff sounds Manifestation Phase 1 a sharp tapping Phase 2 a swishing or whooshing sound Phase 3 a thump softer than the tapping in phase 1 Phase 4 a soft blowing muffled sound that fades Phase 5 Silence Source: From Kozier et al.

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 59 In mental health care, an ECG is recommended when MHSUs initiate and receive cer - tain antipsychotic medications; for example, a baseline ECG is taken on commencement of clozapine and periodically thereafter. Specific ADRs can impair the cardiac conduction system (see Chapter 8), so ECG becomes a valuable test when monitoring a MHSU's cardiac function. Your role in ECG monitoring is likely to be determined by local policy and procedures or clinical governance standards, if they exist. However, taking an ECG will likely be deferred Table 4.7 Procedure for taking BP Step Action Rationale 1 Prepare equipment Sphygmomanometer with appropriate cuff size, pen, chart for recording result t o ensure effective monitoring and prompt recording of reading 2 Decontaminate hands Wash hands or use alcohol rub t o promote infection control and minimize cross-infection 3 Explain procedure Outline your intended actions and warn about cuff pressure t o gain consent and prepare the MHSU for slight discomfort 4 Ensure MHSU is rested and relaxed r ested for 5 minutes, has not smoked or drunk tea/coffee t o minimize biased readings 5 Position of patient and clothing Upper arm is at same level of heart, clothes are not restricting cuff placement Poor positioning and clothing obstruction may affect reading 6 Palpate pulse Palpate radial pulse and note the point at which it disappears t o prevent over-inflation of the cuff, which can be painful or uncomfortable 7 Inflate the cuff t o 30 mmHg above the point of radial pulse disappearing t o prepare to take full BP reading 8 Deflate the system Slowly and carefully, about 2-4 mmHg per second t o ensure you can hear the five phases of the Korotkoff sounds 9 Attend to first and last Korotkoff sounds r ecord Korotkoff sounds t his is the actual BP 10 Record and document your findings Complete appropriate chart For comparison with past or future readings 11 Communicate findings 1 Inform MHSU of the outcome and be prepared to answer any queries they may have t o reassure the MHSU 12 Communicate findings 2 r eport any abnormalities to the nurse in charge In case immediate intervention is required or for continuity of care 13 Communicate findings 3 r ecord findings in the MHSU's case notes So that other members of the team are aware of them 14 Decontaminate hands again Wash hands or use alcohol rub t o promote infection control and minimize cross-infection 15 Decontaminate equipmentClean equipment and store it safely t o ensure fit for purpose for next use Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

This is due to a lack of training in this procedure on the part of MHNs. However, ECG should be within our scope of practice given the regularity of its use in monitoring ADRs. It would be worthwhile exploring how you get local training in this proce-dure, as it would be a valuable addition to your repertoire of skills. Recording an electrocardiogram Using more leads means that the heart can be scrutinized from more angles; the more angles, the more comprehensive the ECG (Pope 2002): a 3-lead ECG views the heart from 3 angles. a 5-lead ECG views the heart from 7 angles. a 12-lead ECG views the heart from 12 angles. Equipment You will need a cardiac monitor, ECG leads, gauze/alcohol wipes for cleaning the skin, and excess hair may need to be removed by razor. You should ensure any equipment is stored and maintained according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The leads for ECG machines are colour-coded to help facilitate easy placement. For exam- ple, in a 3-lead ECG (Jevon 2007b): the red lead (right arm cable) goes to the right shoulder the yellow lead (left arm cable) goes to the left shoulder the green lead (leg lead) goes to the lower chest wall. Practical considerations The MHSU should be lying and as they need to disrobe it is important to preserve their privacy and dignity. Gender-specific staff choices should be respected if females do not want ECGs performed by male practitioners. If this is not an issue, chaperones should be considered. You should carefully explain the procedure and answer MHSU questions and concerns. If the ECG is an emergency the MHSU should be reassured and the procedure outlined to them. Continual reassurance will be important not only because the procedure may be a concern, but they may also be feeling palpitations anyway so they will be highly anxious. Procedure Depending on your level of practice (whether you are trained to perform an ECG), your role will be either primary (performing the ECG) or secondary (assisting the practitioner to per-form the ECG). Procedure for taking a 3-lead electrocardiogram Table 4.8 outlines the 16 steps in taking a 3-lead ECG, with the rationale for each. Results The ECG printout will show the PQRST complex (see Chapter 5). From this, we can see how the heart is functioning with respect to atrial and ventricular depolarization and repolarization. If there are big variations (e.g. due to ADRs), medication regimes may require changing to reduce the risk of serious physical harm.

The pulse oximeter measures the absorption of light waves as they pass through areas of the body that are highly perfused by arterial blood (Buchfa and Fries 2004). Pulse oximetry works on the assumption that deoxygenated blood and oxygenated blood are of a different colour and a sensor can measure this difference, calculating the percentage of oxygen in the blood (Dougherty and Lister 2008). The sensor may be placed on the patient's fingertip or earlobe. When using the ear, results will be inaccurate if the patient's earlobe is poorly perfused, such as from a low cardiac output (Buchfa and Fries 2004). You should not take a pulse oximetry reading from a site where a BP cuff is applied, as the inflation of the cuff will decrease blood supply and give a false reading. The clinical measurement for oxygen saturation levels is SaO 2. The normal SaO 2 lev- els for adults are between 95 per cent and 100 per cent (Potter and Perry 2005). Lower SaO 2 levels require further investigation. Possible reasons for low SaO 2 levels are shown in Table 4.9. Procedure for taking a pulse oximetry reading For a step-by-step guide to this procedure, complete with rationales, see Table 4.10. Pulse oxi-metry measures oxygenation so it will not give an indication of carbon dioxide levels, therefore arterial blood gases (ABGs) will be required. Haemoglobin may also be bound to something other than oxygen, e.g. in cases of attempted suicide by suffocation haemoglobin may bind to carbon monoxide. If equipment is not responding in the manner you expected, check the MHSU's vital signs. Do not automatically assume the machine is faulty. Most importantly, ensure you have had training and that you use equipment in line with the manufacturer's instructions. You should also know and understand your local policy and procedures on the use of pulse oximetry. The procedure is now used to monitor MHSUs who have been subject to physical restraint.Table 4.9 Factors affecting pulse oximetry readings Clinical factors Procedural factors Hypothermia Cold or calloused fingertip Low cardiac output Patient movement, e.g. tremor, shivering Hypovolaemia Not trained to use pulse oximetry Heavy smoker Machine malfunction Inadequate blood flow due to BP being taken at the same time Box 4.8 Exercise How can MHNs reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease in their MHSU group?

Procedure for taking a respiration rate For a step-by-step guide to this procedure, complete with rationales, see Table 4.12. A basic respiration rate can determine if further investigations are required (for in-depth details, see Chapter 6). However, we should be aware of the different types of respirations possible in groups that have an increased risk of developing respiratory conditions. Therefore, while the respiration rate is important, another key aspect of a respiratory assessment is the way in which the person is breathing. Table 4.13 outlines key terms in respiration that you should be aware of.Table 4.12 Procedure for taking a respiration rate Step Action Rationale 1 Prepare equipment Watch with second hand, pen and chart for recording result t o ensure effective monitoring and prompt recording of reading 2 Decontaminate hands Wash hands or use alcohol rub t o promote infection control and minimize cross-infection 3 Do not explain procedure You may ask the MHSU for their wrist as if to take their pulse If MHSU knows their respirations are going to be monitored, they may try to control their breathing 4 Ensure MHSU is rested and relaxed Ensure MHSU has not walked or ran for 5 minutes before procedure t o minimize biased readings 5 While timing count each respiration the MHSU makes a respiration is one inspiration and one expiration t o ensure the MHSU is breathing normally 6 Listen for any abnormal sounds Note if you hear any wheezing or crackling t his may indicate the presence of a respiratory condition 7 Observe lips and extremities r espiratory problems may indicate cyanosis If cyanosis is present, this may require further and urgent investigation 8 Record and document your findings Ensure you are familiar with the standard way to record t he appropriate chart should be completed accurately for comparison with past or future readings 9 Communicate findings 1 Inform MHSU of the outcome and be prepared to answer any queries they may have t o reassure the MHSU 10 Communicate findings 2 r eport any abnormalities to the nurse in charge In case immediate intervention is required or for continuity of care 11 Communicate findings 3 r ecord findings in the MHSU's case notes So that other members of the team are aware of them 12 Decontaminate hands again Wash hands or use alcohol rub t o promote infection control and minimize cross-infection Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 65 Collecting a sputum sample If a MHSU presents with cough, with or without fever, a sputum sample may be requested for pathol - ogy analysis. This will determine the presence of infection. Sputum analysis will inform clinical decision-making regarding appropriate antibiotic therapy, or if further investigation such as biopsy is required. Analysis may also detect any other foreign body present in the sample (e.g. blood). Sputum collection is usually a straightforward process of expectoration (the MHSU cough- ing up sputum), which is collected in a sterile container, clearly labelled with the MHSU's details, ward address, and a description of the test to be performed. This is normally written as 'culture and sensitivity'. Other information may be appropriate (e.g. if pyrexic or currently taking antibiotics). For infection control purposes, the lid of the container should be secured before being sent in a clearly labelled biohazard bag. It is possible the MHSU finds expectorating sputum difficult, as it may be painful, leading to breathlessness or increased anxiety. Chest massage may be required to loosen or 'shift' the sputum, making it easier to expel. A physiotherapist may be required to do this or they may teach staff how to perform this type of chest percussion. Following chest massage, the MHSU should be encouraged to expectorate so that a sample is obtained. Depending on its condition, a number of sputum samples may be required. It is important that a sputum sample is collected and not a sample of saliva. The MHSU may be embarrassed at coughing up sputum so reassure and support them. Samples should not be taken directly after meals in case the coughing leads to vomiting. Procedure for taking a sputum sample See Table 4.14 for a clear outline of the steps involved in taking a sputum sample, with ration- ales. Following the procedure the MHSU may be tired. They should be offered a warm drink to help relax and this will also help moisten the mouth and throat which may be dry following the coughing. If required they should be observed until they have settled.Table 4.13 Key terms in respiration Term Presentation Possible cause Dyspnoea Shortness of breath a sthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) t achypnoea Increased respiratory rate a nxiety, post-exercise Bradypnoea a bnormally slow respiratory rate Hypothermia of breathing Following exercise, anaemia, hypoxia Breathlessness when lying flat lternating periods of apnoea and hyperpnoea Observed in people at end stage of life Kussmaul breathing a lso referred to as 'air hunger', characterized by deep, rapid, hypovolaemia extreme breathlessness a nxiety disorders Haemoptysis Expectoration of blood from the respiratory tractChest trauma, tumour, exposure to occupational hazard, e.g. asbestos Hypoxia Decrease in oxygen supply to the tissues and cellsHypovolaemia, asphyxiation Source: a dapted from Jevon and Ewens (2001) Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 67 Peak flow Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is defined as 'the maximum flow rate, in litres per minute that can be expelled from the lungs during a forced exhalation' (Bennett 2003: 185). The main use of peak flow is the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma, as part of an asthma management plan, assessing severity of an asthma attack, and monitoring the response to asthma therapy (Booker 2007). If one of your MHSUs has asthma, PEFR may be recommended on a daily basis as this can monitor the course of the condition and how well it is responding to treatment. Here the MHSU will be given a chart where they can plot their PEFR readings. Marked variations in PEFR readings may be indicative of: the asthma being poorly managed; the MHSU not taking their inhaler medication as prescribed, e.g. they may only take it in response to an attack rather than to prevent an attack; poor inhaler technique whereby the MHSU receives the wrong dose of medication; poor technique in performing PEFR. Equipment For recording peak flow, you will need the following: a PEFR meter, a clean mouth piece, a blank sheet of paper, a pen, and the PEFR recording chart. Procedure for taking a peak expiratory flow rate reading See Table 4.15 for a step-by-step guide to this procedure, with rationales. In the USA, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (2007: 59) Expert Panel recommends long-term daily peak flow monitoring for patients who have moderate or severe persistent asthma. They suggest that this level of monitoring will detect early changes in disease states that require treatment, evaluate responses to changes in therapy, and afford a quantitative measure of impairment. Peak expiratory flow rate measurements are usually done four times per day, before and after the administration of bronchodilators (out of hospital this is usually twice a day) (Jevon 2007c). When MHSUs are undertaking PEFR, practitioners are presented with the opportu-nity to form a therapeutic alliance that can increase your health promotion role. Practitioners should also include family and carers in the educational process so that they can be empow-ered to support their loved one. Poor technique can lead to inaccurate PEFR readings. You will have to educate the MHSU in proper technique and this will probably entail you role-playing it. Problems with poor PEFR technique include: not enveloping the mouth piece correctly so that air escapes; a coughing or spluttering motion on expiration; not taking a deep enough breath; not holding the meter correctly so that fingers prevent the arrow moving appropriately. Another aspect of MHSU education is recording the readings on a chart. Charts are usually supplied with the PEFR meter, so you will have to demonstrate the process of recording to MHSUs and their carers. Urinalysis Mallett and Dougherty (2000: 424) define urinalysis as 'the testing of the physical characteristics and composition of freshly voided urine'. Urinalysis is a useful, non-invasive test and can be used to obtain a baseline assessment for future comparison, detect abnormalities in urine composition or to monitor the progress of an existing condition. In mental health, we also use urinalysis to monitor substance misuse. In my experience, this investigation is no longer routinely done on Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

It tends to be reserved for MHSUs presenting with a 'drug-induced' psychosis. How - ever, with the incidence of physical illness rising, it would be appropriate to reintroduce it as a routine observation. Urine testing can be performed in the clinical area using the standard reagent 'dip sticks', or a urine sample may be sent for more specific pathology testing (see Table 4.16). Urinalysis is a useful screening method for diabetes. Here you will find positive readings for glucose (glyco-suria) and ketones (ketonuria). As the body loses weight, fat is used as an energy source and this is excreted in urine as ketones. This also occurs in people with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. Citrome et al. (2003) found that those taking clozapine were more likely to have glucose screening than those taking other medications. This is a clear problem when trying to compare typical and atypical medications for prevalence of diabetes. It may also present as an inequal-ity in health care, as metabolic risks can occur with all types of antipsychotic medications.Table 4.15 Procedure for taking a PEF r reading Step Action Rationale 1 Prepare equipment Peak flow meter, clean single- use mouth piece, pen and chart for recording result t o ensure effective monitoring and prompt recording of reading 2 Decontaminate hands Wash hands or use alcohol rub t o promote infection control and minimize cross-infection 3 Explain and demonstrate procedure for the MHSU Ensure MHSU is paying attention and is clear about what they need to do t o ensure the MHSU knows how to do the procedure and gain consent 4 Ask MHSU to stand and blow into the meter Ensure MHSU has formed an effective seal around the mouthpiece t o minimize risk of air escaping leading to incorrect reading 5 Repeat this process for three consecutive readings r ecord the best of the three readings a lways observe for poor technique; advise the MHSU that if they feel dizzy they should wait for a few seconds more before next attempt 6 Replace and safely dispose of used equipment Dispose of single-use equipment t o prevent accidental re-use, cross- infection 7 Record and document your findings Ensure you are familiar with the standard way to record and document PEF r readings t he appropriate chart should be completed accurately for comparison with past or future readings 8 Communicate findings 1 Inform MHSU of the outcome and be prepared to answer any queries they may have t o reassure the MHSU 9 Communicate findings 2 r eport any abnormalities to the nurse in charge In case immediate intervention is required or for continuity of care 10 Communicate findings 3 r ecord findings in the MHSU's case notes So that other members of the team are aware of them 11 Decontaminate hands again Wash hands or use alcohol rub t o promote infection control and minimize cross-infection Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 69 Equipment For a routine urinalysis test, you will need the following: reagent strips; a secure sample of urine, either in a sample pot or other appropriate container; a watch with a second hand to time the reagent reaction; and gloves and an apron in case of splashing. Procedure for urinalysis This procedure will focus on a midstream sample of urine. First, ensure the privacy and dignity of the MHSU giving the sample. Then ensure that they minimize cross-infection by providing aids for getting the urine into the receptacle; this might be a clean single-use bed pan or urinal bottle. Also advise the MHSU to wash their hands following this. Once the sample has been obtained, take any supplementary measurements; for example, in the case of fluid balance accurately record the quantity of urine voided on the chart. Table 4.17 shows the stages in the procedure. Other aspects of urinalysis Through observation, you should be able to tell if there is a potential problem with a urine sample. The colour, smell, and presence of floating particles may indicate an infection. How-ever, we must always perform the urinalysis test to obtain an accurate assessment. You should remember that the colour of urine may have changed for innocent reasons, for example eating beetroot can cause discolouration (British National Formulary [BNF] 2013). Some antibiotics can also cause discoloration - rifampicin, for example, can give urine an orange tinge. Urine normally smells slightly aromatic but diabetes mellitus can give it a fruity smell due to the pres-ence of acetone (Dougherty and Lister 2008). Abnormalities detected by urinalysis It is important that you are aware of what each reagent pad on the strip is measuring. Table 4.18 illustrates how urinalysis should be seen within a mental health context and gives both the medical terms that we should be familiar with and possible causes.Table 4.16 Different types of urine samples Type of sample Use Specimen for 'dipstick' a routine urine sample for testing Catheter specimen of urine (CSU) a sample that is removed from a catheter. t his may require a syringe and needle, so be careful of needle stick injury or accidentally perforating the catheter bag Specimen for cytology a urine sample sent to a lab for testing, e.g. for a urinary tract infection Midstream specimen of urine (MSU) a 'sterile' sample of urine where the person begins to pass urine, stops momentarily, and then passes a sample into a receptacle Early morning specimen of urine (EMU) a sample taken first thing in the morning to ensure 'everything' is tested 24 hour collection Used to check kidney function or identify the presence of filtrate such as creatinine. t he urine sample should be refrigerated to reduce degradation r andom urine drug screen For MHSUs on a drug rehabilitation programme, they will be required to remain 'clean'. r andom urine screening seeks to detect drug use. t his is a normal sample taken at any time, day or night. t he MHSU needs to be observed to ensure the sample is their own and not one that is smuggled in Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

It is also referred to as relative density. Using the model of homeostasis, normal specific gravity ranges from 1.010 to 1.025. Specific gravity below 1.010 or above 1.025 may indicate a problem with renal function, as the kidneys are not filtering or retaining solutes as they should be. Urine pH An acidic or alkalinic urine specimen indicates that pH homeostasis is in a state of imbalance. This may suggest a problem with the kidney's ability to maintain a normal pH range.Table 4.17 Procedure for urinalysis Step Action Rationale 1 Prepare equipment Watch with second hand, reagent strips, gloves (possibly an apron also), pen and chart for recording result t o ensure effective monitoring and prompt recording of reading 2 Examine reagent strips Check that they are not out of date and that they have been stored appropriately If out of date or stored inadequately, the reagent strip may have reacted to moisture in the air.

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 71 Urine glucose and ketone tests Urinalysis can be a useful test in the monitoring of glucose and ketone levels, which are important in screening for T2D. However, the standard way of monitoring glucose is through blood glucose testing. The presence of ketones in urine may indicate that the person's own fat reserves are being used as an energy source. Ketones would be evident in cases of anorexia nervosa or diabetic ketoacidosis. Measuring body mass index To assess the extent of obesity in our MHSU group, we must first know what the standardized measurement of obesity is. Definitions of weight for health purposes are commonly measured on the BMI scale. The use of BMI is recognized worldwide:Table 4.18 abnormalities found in urinalysis Substance Medical term Possible causes Glucose Glycosuria Diabetes mellitus, total parenteral nutrition (intravenous [IV] fluids), sometimes in pregnancy Bilirubin Bilirubinuria Stale urine (if left untested, urine will still break down; if stale urine is tested, it may mistakenly read as bilirubinuria), liver disease Ketones Ketonuria Vomiting, severe dieting, cachexia (found in individuals with anorexia), diabetic ketoacidosis Low specific gravity High fluid intake (dipsomania), diabetes insipidus, chronic renal failure, hypokalaemia (low levels of potassium) High specific gravity Dehydration (e.g. excessive vomiting), chronic renal failure or cardiac problems Blood Haematuria Menstruation in women, infection, kidney stones, injury to urinary tract, e.g. during catheterization Low pH (acidic) High protein diet, diabetic ketoacidosis, starvation (anorexia), hypokalaemia, pyrexia, diarrhoea (laxative abuse) High pH (alkalinic) Stale urine, vegetarian diet, urinary tract infection, vomiting (bulimia), metabolic or respiratory acidosis Protein Proteinuria Urinary tract infection, severe hypertension, heart failure, renal failure, pre-eclampsia (practitioners working in mother and baby units should be aware of any history of pre-eclampsia and how this might affect blood pressure) Urobilinogen Urobilinogenuria Liver disease (alcohol misuse) Nitrite Infection Leucocytes Pyuria Urinary tract infection The BMI score is not gender biased, i.e. the same scale and calculation apply to both males and females. The BMI classification and score are illustrated in Table 4.19. You will note that this also contains measurements for underweight, which are important parameters for practitioners working in eating disorders and care of older people where weight loss may be a feature of the clinical presentation.

Waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio Body mass index is not the only measurement for weight problems. Central (abdominal) obes- ity is a risk factor for CHD. A simple waist measurement can be a useful risk indicator for obesity. Diabetes UK (2013) suggest that having a waist size of 31.5 inches or over for women, 35 inches or over for Asian men, and 37 inches or over for white and black men significantly increases the risk of developing T2D. Therefore, a target in reducing weight might also include reducing waist size. Canoy et al. (2007: 2941) found that measures of abdominal obesity were more predictive of CHD, stating that reducing waist circumference by 5 cm could lower risk by 11 per cent in men and 15 per cent in women. Yusuf et al. (2005) reported that the waist-to-hip ratio was more significant in assessing risk of myocardial infarction than BMI. The waist-to-hip ratio (see Table 4.21) is a way of determining obesity and may be used in conjunction with the BMI, and is calculated by dividing the circumference of the waist by the circumference of the hips. Blood glucose Testing blood for glucose imbalance is an important aspect of caring for a MHSU with dia- betes, or for screening for diabetes in your MHSU group. Exposure to blood, even in minute quantities, is a risk. Thus for health and safety it is important that infection control measures are followed regarding disposal of sharps and clinical waste. Testing blood glucose will provide an indication of the MHSU's blood glucose levels. This will enable practitioners to evaluate the success of any lifestyle changes or medication given Table 4.19 the International Classification of adult underweight, overweight, and obesity according to BMI Classification BMI cut-off Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Diabetes.co.uk (2013) suggest the range for a normal blood glucose level is 4.4-6.1 mmol/L (see Table 7.9, Chapter 7). Blood glucose testing should be done in line with the MHSU's care plan. Depending on the severity, this might be done typically before and after meals (e.g. in Type 1 diabetes), before and after breakfast, lunch and the evening meal. In T2D, blood glucose testing may not be required, may be required infrequently (e.g. weekly) or may be required daily. Again this depends on the presence of other risk factors such as having a co-morbid illness. Normally MHSUs will monitor their own blood glucose levels. When well, the role of the nurse will be to review the MHSU's blood glucose levels in the MHSU's own record. When MHSUs are unwell, this may need to be facilitated by the practitioner, as they may not have the concentration or dexterity to perform it. However, promoting MHSU independence will be a key therapeutic aim in the nursing care plan. Equipment Blood glucose is tested using a glucometer. It is important that both practitioner and MHSU are trained in how to use the glucometer correctly. Glucometers usually have a standard dispos-able lancet and testing strips. It is important that the equipment used is that recommended by the manufacturer. Procedure for a blood glucose reading Table 4.22 explains the procedure for taking a blood glucose reading using a glucometer. The MHSU should select the finger to be used. It is important that this is varied, as repeated pricks in the same finger can compromise the skin. Remember to vary the site of blood testing so that skin does not become calloused from overuse at one site. The index finger or thumb are generally not used for this procedure, as these get used daily and continuous use may impair pinching movement. All MHSUs should decontaminate hands with soap and water. They should not use alcohol rub, as this may con-taminate the testing strip. Box 4.9 Case example Carlos is a 38-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia. He is currently receiving olan- zapine 7.5 mg twice daily. He smokes 40 cigarettes daily, engages in no physical activity, and has a poor diet. He has t 2D and takes metformin 500 mg with meals three times a day. He requires blood glucose monitoring. What do you do? Assessment and diagnosis Carlos has t 2D, which requires monitoring during his respite stay in hospital. Plan to monitor Carlos's t 2D as per his current care plan, which involves: Diet and lifestyle factors. Metformin 500 mg three times a day. Daily blood glucose testing and recording. Implementation For continuity of care, Carlos's current care plan for his t 2D needs to be monitored during his respite stay: Carlos needs to monitor his blood glucose twice daily: (1) before breakfast and (2) before going to sleep.

Carlos should keep his glucometer and other equipment with him. However, testing should occur in the clinical room where used equipment can be safely disposed of. Staff should observe Carlos while he is doing the test and recording the reading. Carlos should keep a record of his blood glucose readings. Staff should physically check that he is doing this on a regular basis. Staff should keep a note of the blood glucose readings in Carlos's case notes. Carlos takes metformin 500 mg twice daily along with meals. Staff should dispense medication as per NMC (2008) guidelines and ensure that Carlos takes the medica - tion. Staff should observe Carlos for both positive and negative side-effects of medication. Staff should liaise with Carlos's diabetic nurse specialist and share information as appro-priate. Carlos has a reduced calorie diet that he needs to maintain. However, this has proved very challenging and he frequently has problems maintaining it. Staff should liaise with the dietitian regarding Carlos's diet and explore ways of maintain- ing it. Carlos should be referred to occupational therapy for advice on food preparation. Carlos should have his blood pressure, pulse, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio recorded and monitored. Staff should give Carlos health education and promotion advice. Staff should encourage Carlos to be physically active during the day. Carlos should be referred to a smoking cessation therapist for advice on how to reduce/stop his smoking. Staff should discuss the benefits of stopping smoking with Carlos and introduce him to the idea of nicotine replacement therapy (N rt ). Staff should observe Carlos for both positive and negative side-effects of poor diet. Night staff should be aware of the care plan to reduce Carlos snacking inappropriately at night and to promote continuity of care. Carlos's care plan should be regularly monitored to determine progress. Evaluate Daily evaluation will be conducted at the end of each shift. t his will include monitoring baseline observations, blood glucose levels, medication compliance, and dietary intake. t he care plan will be re-evaluated if Carlos experiences any serious complications, e.g. hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis. Blood tests Box 4.10 Exercise Go to your clinical room and list the different types of blood bottles that are there. Can you match the blood tests with the different bottles? Testing blood for analysis allows practitioners to: investigate and diagnose a range of physical conditions; monitor for the presence of infection; monitor ABGs; Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 77 monitor blood glucose levels; monitor electrolytes; monitor therapeutic ranges for medications. Various blood tests have corresponding 'blood bottles', vials with different coloured tops to indicate the test. These vials contain different substances, such as an anticoagulant to prevent the blood from clotting (if this is a test requirement), or vials without an anticoagulant or a serum separator when blood samples need to be put in a centrifuge and separated. You may not normally take blood unless you have undergone specific phlebotomy training and are deemed competent in undertaking this role. Blood samples are usually taken by a phlebotomist or a doctor. However, it is important for practitioners to have the background knowledge of what the blood is getting tested for and what this might mean for the MHSU's physical and mental health. There are many different blood tests but here we examine some of those that may be described as routine in mental health care. However, MHSUs may require different tests than those out-lined here depending on their individual presentation. This section will be split whereas in reality the tests will probably be components of the full blood count (FBC). It should also be remembered that normal ranges vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory. Full blood count The FBC is a general analysis of a sample of blood that includes red blood cells (RBCs), iron levels, white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, electrolytes, and hormones. This test can be very inclusive or specific aspects can be requested, depending on the presenting complaint. Biochemistry Biochemistry testing is used to examine electrolyte balance. Having stable electrolyte levels is important for physical health; for example, monitoring sodium levels is important for car-diovascular health. When blood is taken and sent to the laboratory, the tests requested may include those shown in Tables 4.23 and 4.24. Arterial blood gas Measurements of blood pH, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels can be obtained from an arterial blood sample. Arterial blood gases perform an important diagnostic and monitoring function for MHSUs with respiratory problems. Arterial blood gases assess lung function by illustrating how well the lungs supply oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. This helps in diagnosing a Table 4.23 Blood tests and normal values Blood test Normal levels Haemoglobin 14-17.4 g/day (males), 12.3-15.3 g/day are also called thrombocytes. t hrombocytopenia is a reduction in platelets, which is also a side-effect of antipsychotic medications such as clozapine.

Maintaining a stable body pH is also important. An ABG sample may indicate acidosis. If the blood plasma is acidic, respirations will increase in rate and depth to correct this imbalance (see Chapter 6 on respiration). Causes of abnormal respiratory values include (Allibone and Nation 2006): respiratory acidosis or alkalosis; inadequate alveolar ventilation; excess carbon dioxide production; lung disease, e.g. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia or asthma; central nervous system (CNS) depression due to medication or brain stem injury; impaired respiratory muscle function due to chest wall injury or deformity; airway obstruction; pulmonary oedema; cardiac arrest; hysteria or anxiety; hypoxia. As blood is taken directly from an artery, practitioners should have the appropriate compe-tence to undertake this procedure. Your role in this procedure may be as an assistant. Fol-lowing the procedure, the arm should be elevated and the puncture site compressed until the bleeding stops; this can take up to 3 minutes (Hastings 2009). Practitioners should support MHSUs, allowing them to express feelings and offer reassurance about the need for and impor-tance of the tests. Educating and preparing the MHSU if a series of ABGs is required may lessen their reluctance to undergo the tests. Cardiac enzymes When cell tissue becomes damaged, it releases enzymes into the blood stream. These act as markers, which can be identified in blood tests. In myocarditis, the damaged heart tissue releases its marker, in this case an enzyme called troponin, into the blood stream. This can be identified in a cardiac enzyme blood test. This is an important blood test in MHSUs taking clozapine (see Chapter 8 for ADRs of medication). Blood cultures Testing blood for cultures is a test to determine the presence of infection. This type of test will also indicate the type of antibiotic treatment that may be required to treat the infection. Hormone levels Blood tests can also be used to monitor the presence and levels of hormones in the cir - culation; for example, blood glucose levels may indicate problems with insulin tolerance. Other common hormone tests include the thyroid function test, which tests for levels of Table 4.24 Some ranges for biochemistry blood tests Electrolyte Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Clinical skills for physical assessment in mental health settings 79 thyroid stimulating hormone (thyrotropin) in the blood. This test serves to differentiate between a poorly functioning thyroid gland and depression (see Table 4.25). The normal level of thyroid stimulating hormone for adults is 0.4-4.2 mL/U/L (Malarkey and McMor - row 2005). Prolactin is another hormone that is usually tested for in response to ADRs (see Chapter 8). The normal values for prolactin are <25 \u00b5g/L for females and <20 \u00b5g/L for males. Breast enlargement and lactation are natural responses in pregnancy, and so pregnancy can elevate the levels of prolactin. In pregnant women, the normal range of prolactin is 20-400 \u00b5g/L. Fighting infection Monitoring WBC count is important in determining the presence and severity of infection. In mental health, it is also an important means of monitoring ADRs, such as neutropenia with antipsychotics (see Table 4.26). Monitoring levels of medication Some medications require monitoring to ensure that they are within a set therapeutic range. Lithium, which is used to treat bipolar disorder, is probably the most frequent drug test. How-ever, MHSUs with epilepsy also require medication levels checked to monitor therapeutic effi-cacy and compliance. Examples of medications and therapeutic ranges include the following (Taylor et al. signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and depression Hypothyroidism Depression Fatigue Fatigue Lack of energy Lack of energy Decreased libido Decreased libido Low mood Low mood Poor concentration Poor concentration Poor memory Poor memory Table 4.26 White blood cell tests and normal values Blood test Normal range WBC count 4.5-11 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 5 Introduction Cardiovascular disease encompasses CHD, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (Daniels 2002). Coronary heart disease is a major threat to public health, leading governments world - wide to set targets for reducing the mortality and morbidity rates due to CHD. The WHO states that CHD is now the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 48.6 per cent of deaths in 2000 (Aboderin et al. 2002). In the UK, more than 1.4 million people suffer from angina and around 300,000 have heart attacks every year (DH 2000). In 2010, almost 180,000 people died from cardiovascular disease, with around 80,000 of these deaths as a result of CHD and around 49,000 from strokes (BHF 2012). In the context of MHSUs, research statistics illustrate just how big a problem cardiovascular disease is: The Schizophrenia Commission (2012) state that people with serious mental illness are twice as likely to die from heart disease as the general population.Chapter contents Cardiovascular risk factors Anatomy and physiology of the cardio- vascular system Disorders of the cardiovascular system Care planning for coronary problems Medications used to treat coronary heart problems Learning outcomes By the end of this chapter, you will have: Explored the epidemiology of cardiovas- cular illness in MHSUs Examined risk factors for coronary heart disease in MHSUs Looked at the structure and function of the heart Examined the cardiac cycle and the elec- trical conduction system of the heart Explored the importance of cardiovascu- lar function in MHSUs Considered ways of reducing the risks of developing cardiovascular disease Box 5.1 ExerciseWhat are the risk factors for cardiovascular illness in your MHSU group?

Risk factors for cardiovascular disease Risk factors for cardiovascular disease include lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exer-cise, smoking, and alcohol consumption, which can contribute to obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes. Although present in the population at large, MHSUs are most exposed to these risk factors. Service users may also experience poor cardiovascular health due to ADRs (see Chapter 8). Service users are also socially excluded, have poor access to health services, and receive less screening and health promotion; for example, the Royal Col-lege of Psychiatrists (2012) found that only 29 per cent of people with schizophrenia received a comprehensive assessment of important cardio-metabolic risk factors. Signs and symptoms may be recognized but diagnostic overshadowing may interpret tachycardia and hypertension as 'normal' stress reactions to coping with mental illness rather than a 'credible' heart condi-tion. This means MHSUs may only present following a critical event, such as a heart attack. Thus, it is likely that a combination of these factors will be responsible for a cardiovascular disorder. Cardiovascular conditions are becoming a common feature of mental health nursing care. Practitioners require safe and competent clinical skills for the assessment, treatment, manage- ment, and evaluation of cardiovascular care (see Table 5.1). Does caffeine affect blood pressure? Caffeine is a stimulant found in coffee, tea, chocolate, cola, and energy drinks (National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre undated). Caffeine in amounts roughly equivalent to several cups of coffee can significantly elevate resting BP in people who do not usually drink it (Lane 1983). Frequent coffee drinkers may develop a tolerance to the increased BP that results from the caffeine intake, but Lane (1983) suggests that if the same range of BP elevation seen in people who do not drink coffee regularly registered in those with heart problems there could be complications. Caffeine intake in MHSUs may not be a problem. However, if caffeine intake is excessive - De Freitas and Schwartz (1979) found patients drinking 9-10 cups of coffee per day - and linked to other coronary risk factors for high BP, a cumulative effect may increase the risk of coronary problems. For example, a MHSU experiencing stress may have a coffee to Table 5.1 Factors affecting cardiac function Demographic factors Age (the natural ageing process is probably an inescapable risk factor in cardiovascular illness), gender, culture (higher prevalence in certain ethnic groups), social class Lifestyle factors Sedentary lifestyle (lack of physical activity), smoking, high-fat/high-salt/low- fibre diet, high alcohol intake, substance misuse Psychological factors Stress, anxiety, depression Physiological factors Atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes Medication Psychotropic medications - typical antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, poly-pharmacy, and rapid tranquillization Heart medications - these alter heart function Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

This might include two or three spoonfuls of sugar. They may also smoke with their cof- fee. Add to this risk factors such as a lack of exercise, obesity, and psychotropic medications. Now multiply this by a conservative four cups of coffee per day for one week and the potential risk should become clear. Ethnicity and hypertension People of African-Caribbean and South Asian origin living in the UK are much more likely to have high BP than the rest of the UK population (BHF 2013a). People from these groups are over-represented in compulsory psychiatric admissions (Mental Health Act Commission 1999) and are more likely to be treated with antipsychotic medications (Lloyd and Moodley 1992). Therefore, they should be treated as a high-risk group for cardiovascular screening. Anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular system The cardiovascular system consists of the blood, the heart, and a closed system of blood ves-sels (Meurier 2005). The cardiovascular system is responsible for: blood flow through the body; transporting oxygenated blood to tissues and organs; returning deoxygenated blood to the lungs; transporting nutrients to cells; transporting waste products for elimination; carrying messages to organs and cells via hormones; transporting medications to different sites in the body. Structure of the heart The heart has four different chambers - the left and right atria, which form the upper portion, and the left and right ventricles, which form the lower portion (see Figure 5.1). Each of these chambers is separated by four different valves, which act to prevent the backflow of blood.

The myocardium, the middle layer of the heart tissue, contains cardiac muscle fibres that allow the heart to contract during beating. The endocardium, the innermost layer of smooth membrane, permits the easy flow of blood through the heart. The heart requires its own blood supply and the myocardium receives this from the right and left coronary arteries. Most of the blood is supplied during diastole. Deoxygenated blood leaves the heart via the cardiac veins and returns to the right atrium where it is taken to the lungs. How the heart works The heart is a muscle that pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs where it is oxygenated, returned to the heart, and pumped around the body. Heart function is controlled and regulated by a series of electric impulses, which cause two types of contractions and relaxations - the systole and diastole. We use these for BP measurement. The systolic and diastolic pressures make up the cardiac cycle. Blood flow through the heart Venous (deoxygenated) blood returns from the body to the right atrium via the superior and inferior vena cava. It passes from the right atrium through the right atrio-ventricular valve into the right ventricle. This deoxygenated blood is then pumped into the pulmonary artery through the pulmonary valve, which closes to prevent backflow into the right ventricle. From here it goes to the lungs where gaseous exchange occurs - carbon dioxide out and oxygen in. The oxygenated blood is then sent to the left atrium. Here it passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The blood is then forced into the aorta through the aortic valve. The aortic valve closes and prevents backflow of blood into the left ventricle. The blood is then pumped around the body. The cardiac conduction system There is more to the heart than the pumping mechanism. The heart also requires a 'shock' to make it beat, so it has an electrical system referred to as the cardiac conduction system (see Figure 5.2). This allows the heart to expand and contract at a regular pace. This system con-sists of: the sinoatrial node (SA node); the atrioventricular node (AV node); the atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle or bundle of His), which divides into right and left bundles. Fibres in the SA node are located in the right atrium wall and act as the heart's pacemaker. During a heartbeat, an electrical signal is triggered in the SA node, which causes the atria to contract, pushing blood into the ventricles. The signal then travels to the AV node and through the AV bundle (or bundle of His) down the left and right bundle branches and disperses around the Purkinje fibres. This causes the ventricles to contract and push blood into the major blood vessels. Oxygenated blood flows into the aorta to be carried around the body, while deoxy-genated blood flows into the pulmonary artery from where it goes to the lungs. Here blood is re-oxygenated and returned to the heart and the cycle begins again. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 85 Cardiac repolarization Cardiac conduction relies on a process of depolarization and repolarization. When the heart is about to pump, the electrical activity increases causing the ventricles to depolarize and contract (systole), thus pumping blood out of the heart. The heart muscle then repolarizes and relaxes (diastole), allowing blood to enter for the next heartbeat. Cardiac electrical activity: PQRST waves The electrical activity of the heart is represented in an ECG reading (see Figure 5.3). The dif-ferent electrical phases of the ECG are (Webster and Thompson 2006): Atrioventricular (A V) Node Sinoatrial (SA) Node Bundle of His Right Bundle BranchLeft Posterior FascicleLeft AnteriorFascicle Figure 5.2 The electrical conduction system of the heart Figure 5.3 Normal ECG reading QRS Complex PR SegmentST Segment PR Inter val QT Inter valPR Q ST Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The QRS wave is associated with ventricular activation. ST is the relaxation of the ventricles. The T wave signifies the recovery of the ventricular muscle. The QT interval is a measure of the heart's electrical conduction. When these waves occur in harmony, we have a normal cardiac cycle. When these waves are disharmonious - either too quick (tachycardia) or too slow (bradycardia) - we have an abnormal cardiac cycle. This is referred to as cardiac arrhythmia. O'Brien and Oyebode (2003) report that normal QT values are not universally established, as factors such as gender (longer in females), time of day, diet, heart rate, and selection of ECG leads can cause differences. Table 5.2 provides QT interval measurement readings. Marder et al. (2004) state that a QT interval of 500 ms or longer is considered a risk factor for sudden death. The cardiac cycle The cardiac cycle is the product of the pumping mechanism and the cardiac conduction sys- tem. Each set of completed and coordinated cardiac activity is referred to a cardiac cycle. The cardiac cycle consists of: atrial systole - contraction of the atria; ventricular systole - contraction of the ventricles; complete cardiac diastole - relaxation of atria and ventricles. Each cardiac cycle has a cardiac output, which is the volume of blood ejected per minute from the left ventricle (Meurier 2005), while the stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out by a ventricle with each contraction (Dougherty and Lister 2008). Blood pressure and pulse are two ways of measuring cardiac output. Significance for mental health service users Service users have many risk factors for cardiovascular illness, which is often referred to as a silent killer. Although we cover basic anatomy and physiology during our student nurse train-ing, this knowledge may lie unused in our memory: 'Since we work in mental health, why do we need to know about anatomy and physiology?' However, knowledge of cardiovascular func-tion is important for monitoring MHSUs' physical health. Furthermore, qualified nurses will be mentoring students who will have this knowledge fresh in their minds and may ask questions that might leave us struggling for answers. This will not leave learners with a good impression.

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 87 Pathophysiology of coronary heart disease When a healthy heart is put under stress, the pumping mechanism and the conduction system will work in harmony, responding in a coordinated way to increase heart rate. When a problem occurs, heart function becomes uncoordinated: the pumping mechanism becomes too fast or too slow and the conduction system emits irregular electrical impulses. Unhealthy lifestyle factors increase the risk of CHD, which is a leading cause of cardiovas- cular problems. The main cause of CHD is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a common arte- rial disorder where plaques of cholesterol, lipids, and cell debris form in the inner arterial wall (Anderson and Anderson 1995). This fatty material is called atheroma. Because the atheroma is a foreign body, WBCs attack it. These white cells, called macrophages, envelop the foreign bodies and form foam cells (Samar 1999). As blood flow becomes impeded, the heart is still pumping the same volume of blood through a reduced arterial space (Figure 5.4). At rest this may not be a problem, but as heart rate increases, due to exertion or anxiety, this will cause discomfort or pain depending on the severity of the blockage. A small blockage may cause minor discomfort because blood can still flow through. However, a large blockage of 50 per cent or more causes a decrease in blood flow and the heart compensates for this by beating more quickly. This can lead to angina or, in the event of total blockage of the artery, myocardial infarction. Not all chest pain will indicate a coronary condition. Tough (2004) outlines various causes of chest pain: Cardiovascular: myocardial costochondritis (inflammation of the rib at point of attachment to the ster-num), trauma. Gastrointestinal: reflux, ulcers, gallstones, pancreatitis. Psychological: anxiety. Understanding these different diagnoses will enable you to focus your assessment ques- tions, provide appropriate care, and communicate any findings to the inter-professional team.Figure 5.4 Normal and abnormal arteriesFatty material is deposited in vessel wallNormalcross-sectionof ar tery Box 5.3 Case example Imagine you are a community MHN.

Atheroscle- rosis causes CHD, which leads to decreased perfusion of the myocardium due to blockage of the coronary arteries. When oxygen supply is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the affected area, myocardial ischaemia occurs (Hand 2001). Reduced blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle causes parts of it to die. Transient ischaemic attacks can occur with decreased blood supply leading to palpitations. This cell death weakens the heart, and the more severe this becomes the more heart function deteriorates. 2 Myocardial infarction: Infarction is the term given to tissue death because of interrupted blood supply (Waugh and Grant 2006). Acute myocardial infarction is the sudden occlu-sion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death and heart failure (Resuscitation Council UK 2004). However, other complications may occur. If the blockage breaks down, a blood clot may enter the circulatory system. This embolism can lodge in smaller arteries causing problems to the periphery or in serious cases, pulmonary embolism, a clot to the lungs, or stroke. 3 Aneurysm: When the arterial walls become damaged, they are repaired by fibrous cells, which are not as flexible as cardiac cells. This makes the artery vulnerable to tearing or protrusion. An aortic aneurysm is a protrusion of the wall of the aorta. In severe cases, hypertension can cause tearing of the artery and internal bleeding. Platelets then form clots at the site of tearing and these may break off and enter the circulation. Aortic aneurysms are treated with a mixture of health education and health promotion aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk factors and, in serious cases, surgery to repair the artery wall. Cardiac arrhythmias The cardiac conduction system keeps the heart beating at a steady pace. However, it is vulner- able to dysfunction, termed cardiac arrhythmia. Arrhythmias arise from irregular electrical activity, which disrupts the rhythm of heartbeat causing the heart to beat out of sequence. Cardiac arrhythmias can affect both atrial and ventricular function, causing them to work in an asymmetrical manner. Cardiac arrhythmias can be very serious, resulting in cardiac arrest and sudden death. This occurs during fibrillation. Fibrillation is the contraction of the cardiac muscle fibres in a disor- derly sequence where the chambers do not contract as a single unit, which causes disruption to the pumping mechanism (Waugh and Grant 2006). However, the outcome is unlikely to be serious if the person suffers from minor palpitations. The causes of cardiac arrhythmias include conduction disorders (see below), lack of blood volume, such as following a serious self-harm incident when a MHSU may have lost blood, an overactive thyroid gland, ADR or anxiety. Treatments include: (1) anti-arrhythmia medica-tions (oral/intravenous [IV]/patch/spray), (2) cardioversion, (3) of a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, and (4) catheter ablation - a procedure usually under local anaesthetic, during which a catheter is passed through a large vein (e.g. the groin) to the heart where radio-frequency energy can be used to destroy particular areas of heart tissue to prevent arrhythmias (BHF 2013b). Conduction disorders Atrial fibrillation Figure 5.2 illustrates electrical conduction in the heart. In atrial fibrillation, these electrical impulses fire erratically causing the heart to pump rapidly and irregularly.

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 89 is a type of arrhythmia and the British Heart Foundation (2013c) state that about 4 per cent of people aged over 65 are affected. However, MHNs need to be aware that psychotropic medication can provoke arrhythmias. Table 5.3 shows the causes and symptoms of atrial fibrillation. Treatment of atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is usually treated by electrical cardioversion, a procedure normally done under general anaesthetic. In cardioversion, a defibrillator is used to apply a controlled electri-cal current across the chest, which aims to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm (BHF 2013c). The current stops the heart momentarily and allows for normal cardiac conduction to be resumed. However, if the atrial fibrillation is caused by an overactive thyroid or by disease of the heart valves, these conditions may need to be corrected before cardioversion can be done (BHF 2013c). Service users who have had cardioversion will require close monitoring, as the small shock might dislodge a clot (if one is there). To reduce the risk of secondary problems from clots, a blood-thinning agent may be prescribed in the weeks leading up to the procedure and anti-arrhythmic drugs prescribed after the procedure to keep the heart in a normal rhythm (BHF 2013c). Close monitoring to ensure compliance is important. However, you should also educate and empower MHSUs to adhere to taking medication by explaining the significance of them taking it. You should use jargon-free language and encourage venting of any anxiety, while offering continued reassurance. Ventricular fibrillation Ventricular fibrillation is an extremely fast and chaotic electrical abnormality in the ventricles (Table 5.4). It causes the heart to 'fibrillate', or quiver, instead of pumping blood around your body; this is a cardiac arrest (BHF 2013b). Ventricular fibrillation greatly impairs the heart's ability to pump blood in a coordinated way and is designated as a medical emergency (Waugh and Grant 2006). Because there is no cardiac output during ventricular fibrillation, it is classi- fied as a medical emergency. The only effective treatment is defibrillation, which enables the heart to return to a normal cardiac rhythm.Table 5.3 Causes and symptoms of atrial fibrillation (BHF 2013c) Causes Symptoms CHD that leads to hypertension Age over 65 yearsObesity, especially with sleep apnoea Overactive thyroid gland Heart valve disease Acute lung infections such as pneumonia Heart failurePrevious heart or lung surgeryMyocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscleCardiomyopathy - disease of the heart muscle Substance or alcohol abuseADRs (for MHSUs)Palpitations (an awareness of your heartbeat) Feeling faint Breathlessness Being tired or less able to exercise Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The cardiovascular conditions outlined here will eventually lead to a cardiac arrest if lifestyle behaviours are not modified or CHD is not diagnosed and treated early. Cardiac arrest may occur in mental health settings due to the following factors: Hypovolaemia: a decrease in blood volume in circulation, e.g. following severe cutting or frequent cutting in short periods. Hypoxia: a lack of oxygen in the blood, which affects the heart and other organs, e.g. fol-lowing asphyxiation by hanging or during physical restraint. Acidosis: abnormal blood pH due to increased acidity of blood plasma, e.g. due to tricyclic antidepressant overdose, diabetic ketoacidosis, shock. Illicit drug use: cocaine and amphetamines are stimulants that can cause cardiac arrest. Other coronary problems There are many coronary problems but our focus here is on the most common ones. Your knowledge and skills will be dependent on the different types of cardiovascular problems that you encounter in practice. As you encounter further problems, your knowledge, skills, confi-dence, and practice should develop. Angina Coronary problems may cause the heart's own blood supply to become compromised. When the heart is working with a reduced blood supply, the person may experience pain or dis-comfort on exertion; this is called angina. Angina is an 'uncomfortable feeling, tightness or pain in the chest which may spread to your arms, neck, jaw, back or stomach; which people sometimes describe as a dull, persistent ache' (BHF 2013d: 6). Risk factors for angina smoking; hypertension; high little physical activity; diabetes; being overweight or obese; a family history. Treatment of angina Even though someone has angina, they can prevent attacks or deterioration of the condition through lifestyle changes - stopping smoking, reducing alcohol, dietary changes, and light Table 5.4 Causes and symptoms of ventricular fibrillation Causes Symptoms Underlying heart condition Fainting Genetic predisposition Breathlessness Brugada syndrome Cardiac arrest Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 91 physical activity. These will help to reduce risks such as high cholesterol, help to reduce obes- ity by lowering BMI, and help with glucose control and diabetes. These changes will also help to control high BP, which can contribute to angina. However, angina is generally treated by medication but in serious cases, surgery (e.g. coronary angioplasty or a surgical bypass) may be required. Medications can be used for different purposes (BHF 2013d): Reduce the chance of blood clots developing - aspirin is an anti-platelet medicine that reduces the 'stickiness' of platelets; Prasugrel is a platelet inhibitor that stops platelets clumping together and forming a blood clot. Increase the blood supply to your heart - glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) increases the blood sup-ply to the heart by dilating blood vessels and allowing more blood to circulate. Glyceryl trinitrate comes in a spray, table or patch form and is taken when symptoms occur or to prevent symptoms developing. Reduce the work your heart has to do - beta blockers reduce the heart rate and limits the amount of work the heart has to do. Help to control your blood cholesterol and BP levels - statins help to lower cholesterol lev-els, which can lead to atherosclerosis. Heart block The heart's pumping mechanism is controlled by the cardiac conduction system, the AV node acting as the natural pacemaker. Heart block develops when the electrical impulses from the AV node are blocked due to disruption. There are different degrees of heart block and treat-ment depends on severity. Treatment of heart block Heart block is usually treated by fitting a pacemaker, which takes over the electrical con-duction function (see BHF 2008). Service users undergoing a pacemaker procedure will need continuous support and reassurance to alleviate anxiety. Your goal is to emphasize the ben-efits of this treatment, provide education, and answer any questions in language the MHSU understands. Heart failure Heart failure occurs when one of the ventricles fails to function. When the right ventricle fails, deoxygenated blood cannot flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange to occur. This causes con-gestion where there is a 'back-up' of deoxygenated blood in the circulatory system. When the left ventricle fails, oxygenated blood accumulates causing less to be pumped around the body. The danger of pooling is that blood clots can form and break off, entering the blood stream as emboli. These can cause blockage in blood vessels leading to further complications such as stroke. Congestive cardiac failure Congestive cardiac failure occurs when there is both left and right ventricular failure with a corresponding combination of systemic and pulmonary symptoms (Webster and Thompson 2006). This is one of the most common causes of oedema, where the decreased blood flow reduces the quantity of tissue fluids that can be drained away. This excess fluid then accumu-lates around the ankles or wrists. Treatment of congestive cardiac failure Depending on the severity, treatment may entail immediate hospitalization in a specialist coro-nary care unit (CCU). Here, your role will most likely be liaising with the coronary care team Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The MHSU will naturally be anxious, as the CCU can be a stressful environment. The MHSU will need space to vent their anxieties so you should be there to provide support and reassurance. Having someone familiar with them will help. You will act as a conduit between the CCU team, the MHSU, and their fam-ily, and your own team, helping to explain procedures, reasons they are needed, and keeping your own team informed. Post-operative and continuing care may also be a feature of treatment. As the follow-up is of a specialist nature, your role will be to monitor physical observations and progress, includ-ing wound healing and preventing infection, if surgery has been performed. You may need to refresh skills of aseptic technique when changing dressings. You will also need to ensure that infection control mechanisms are in place to minimize the risk of hospital-acquired infections and ensure safe disposal of clinical waste. Communicating progress with the inter-professional team will also be an important role, as will supporting the MHSU and their family/carer through the post-operative and recuperation period. Box 5.4 Case example Guadalupe is a qualified nurse working on an acute ward. She is mentoring a first-year student and is teaching the student how to take baseline observations. Which aspects of cardiovascular health assessment would you expect Guadalupe to cover? Assessing cardiovascular health in mental health service users Assessing cardiovascular function is a common practice (see Chapter 4) and the usual assess-ments include: pulse; BP; blood tests; ECG; pulse oximetry. The key techniques used include observation, palpation, inspection, and pathology. Box 5.5 ExerciseList some causes of chest pain. Observation Assessing cardiovascular function is an important skill for practitioners given the prevalence of cardiac problems among MHSUs. Factors that influence assessment include the presenting problem and the approach you adopt. It is thus very important that you know your MHSU, their past medical history, and any significant close family history of coronary problems. From observation and a general survey, we can comment on the following: General appearance: does the person look healthy? Do they appear overweight? Which lifestyle risk factors can you determine, e.g. smoking? Skin: assess colour, pallor, cyanosis, oedema, sweatiness. Respiration: look for audible breathing distress, crackling, shallowness. Mobility: much effort required, use of walking aids, assistance required. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 93 Abnormal pulse The most common abnormalities of pulse occur when the heart beats too fast or too slow. A pulse that is too fast (i.e. over 100 beats per minute) is referred to as tachycardia, and a pulse that is too slow (i.e. under 60 beats per minute) is referred to as bradycardia (Trim 2004). See Table 5.5. Treatment of an abnormal pulse The management and treatment of an abnormal pulse will be considered along a continuum related to the cause and the severity of the problem. Treatment will include non-invasive inter-ventions and/or invasive procedures. Tachycardia Depending on the cause, tachycardia can be treated with lifestyle changes, including those listed in Table 5.6. In cases where clinical intervention is required, tachycardia can be treated with anti-arrhythmic and anti-hypertensive medications. These medications will help lower BP by aiding vasodilation and reducing sodium retention. In severe cases, cardioversion may be required. Bradycardia When the heart beats slowly, blood flow decreases. Blood may pool in the heart and a clot may form, which can lead to an embolism. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, stroke or Table 5.5 Abnormal pulse ranges Pulse type Range Characteristics Possible cause Tachycardia >100 beats per minute Bounding, fast, thready History or current coronary illness, anxiety or stress, haemorrhage, ADR Normal 60-80 beats per minute Regular and strong Bradycardia <60 beats per minute Weak, thready Heart block, drug use, thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance Table 5.6 Lifestyle changes to help treat tachycardia Lifestyle factor Action Rationale Diet Use a balanced diet - reduce fat and salt intake and increase fruit and fibre A diet high in fat and salt contributes to the development of CHD; reducing intake of these will help lower blood lipid levels Substance use Stop smoking, or at least restrict tobacco use Reduce alcohol use Smoking is a factor in the development of atherosclerosis and respiratory disorders Alcohol use is a factor in CHD Activity Increase physical activity Helps to reduce obesity through controlled weight loss, increases cardiovascular functioning and can also improve self-esteem Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Depend- ing on cause and severity, bradycardia can be treated by prescribing anticoagulation drugs to prevent clotting or treating any underlying electrolyte imbalance or thyroid problem. In some cases, a pacemaker may be needed to help the heart beat regularly. Pulse measurement is one of the basic physical observations. In a mental health context, an irregular pulse may be associated with anxiety, ADRs such as cardiac arrhythmias, infection, hypoglycaemia or hypovolaemia. You need to contextualize the importance of pulse measure-ment in your MHSU group, in particular those with diagnosed cardiac or respiratory condi-tions, those that have risk factors for cardiovascular conditions, and those taking medications that increase the QT interval. Hypertension Hypertension is a persistently high BP and is a common problem. It is diagnosed when the average of three different BP readings, taken at rest, on three different days over a period of, say, two to three weeks, are compared. To confirm the diagnosis, an ECG will be required. If BP is only slightly elevated, repeated measurements should be obtained over several months, because there is often a regression to normal levels (European Society of Hypertension 2003). Further diagnostic tests may be required, such as for cholesterol, blood glucose, and urinalysis to determine if there is blood, protein or glucose in the urine, which may be indicative of kid-ney damage due to hypertension (BHF 2013a: 24). There is no single cause of high BP (BHF 2013a: 11). However, in MHSUs we know that the factors that contribute to hypertension are related to lifestyle and ADRs. When assessing blood pressure, it is useful to have a recommended guideline that can increase the evidence base of clinical practice. Blood pressure ranges, as illustrated in Figure 5.5, give a good indication of healthy and unhealthy BP. It helps to decrease nurses' anxiety when confronted with a read - ing of 125/85, which is not very high but an indication that monitoring may be required if other risk factors (e.g. smoking, overweight, reduced physical activity) are present. Of course, a persistently high BP (e.g. 160/100) would require urgent assessment and management. 190 180 170160 150Systolic (top number) Diastolic (bot tom number)High blood blood pressure Ideal blood pressure Low140 130120110100 9080 70 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Figure 5.5 Blood pressure chart for adults Reproduced with permission of Blood Pressure UK (2008) \u00a9 Blood Pressure Association 2008 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 95 Other factors in cardiovascular assessment Taking physical observations is a direct way of estimating cardiovascular function. However, there are other ways in which we can perceive problems. A general survey may indicate the presence of risk factors that can contribute to development of CHD. Although a MHSU may have a stable pulse and BP, failure to modify the risk factors will inevitably lead to the risk of developing CHD. Other physiological signs Skin colour: flushed and red indicating vasodilation or cyanosed, and blue indicating lack of blood supply. Cyanosis will render the extremities cold to the touch, which you might notice when taking the pulse. Temperature: increased temperature will increase BP and indicate signs of infection. Tem-perature recording usually accompanies BP, pulse, and respiration as part of the 'baseline obs'. Respiration: laboured or distressed breathing may indicate a cardiovascular problem. In emergencies, this will be extremely noticeable and you will have to act quickly to prevent deterioration. Oedema requires further investigation, especially in MHSUs taking lithium, as it can indi-cate a cardiovascular or renal problem. A diuretic is normally prescribed for oedema to alle-viate fluid retention but this requires very close monitoring in service users taking lithium due to the increase of lithium toxicity. Dizziness: MHSUs reporting episodes of dizziness or light-headedness when rising may be experiencing orthostatic hypotension. You should ask by way of a general question if they have experienced such symptoms. Waist size: a useful risk indicator for CHD. A waist size above 31.5 inches (80 cm) in women and 37 inches (94 cm) in men is associated with increased risk of high BP, T2D, and cancer with the risk increasing with increasing waist size (NHS Choices 2012a). BMI: an important indicator, as BP increases with increasing BMI. Wild and Byrne (2006) report that a US study showed a high BP was the most common condition related to over-weight and obesity. Box 5.6 ExerciseHow can the risks of cardiovascular illness in your MHSU group be reduced? Using health promotion with mental health service users with coronary heart disease In terms of health promotion, there are three ways in which we can tackle the problem of car- diovascular illness. By far the best way of managing it is by preventing it. Here your role will be primary prevention - preventing the development of cardiovascular illness by screening for signs and symptoms of heart problems or other conditions such as obesity and diabetes. In a position statement entitled 'Lifestyle changes in managing hypertension', the European Society of Hypertension (2003) highlight the following primary prevention lifestyle factors: stop smoking; lose weight; reduce alcohol intake; undertake physical exercise; reduce salt intake; Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Secondary prevention involves the management of the early stages of conditions, reducing their impact on the MHSU's health and well-being. For cardiovascular illness, medications such as statins are prescribed to lower cholesterol in conjunction with primary prevention measures outlined above. Your role will be to prevent further deterioration in physical health by: encouraging compliance with medications and dietary regimes; supporting MHSUs in changing behaviours, e.g. beginning to exercise; providing smoking cessation interventions or referral to smoking cessation services, if trained to do so. Tertiary prevention is designed to increase the quality of life of people with long-term con- ditions that require active treatment. This stage is more advanced than primary or second- ary prevention and may consist of invasive interventions such as cardiac surgery, which will require intensive aftercare. Box 5.7 ExerciseOutline your own education and skills needs in physical health education and health promotion. How would you go about meeting these needs locally? Care planning The nursing process remains the main framework for care planning. Roper and colleagues' (1996) Activities of Daily Living is a familiar model that can be used to structure care plans. Our role in care planning will depend on the severity and complexity of the problem. However, we need to practise safely and within our competence. Complex conditions will require us to liaise with others and adopt a monitoring, evaluating, and reporting role. We may take on a shared care coordinator role for less complex problems where we plan and provide care in a multi-professional team. Whatever our role, care-planning activity will need to be safe, compe - tent, and evidence-based. Treating and managing coronary heart disease Daniels (2002) lists the clinical priorities for managing CHD as follows: normalizing blood pressure; correcting hyperlipidaemia; controlling diabetes; controlling clotting disorders if present; reducing weight if overweight/obese; lifestyle modification priorities involve smoking cessation, regular physical activity, and the consumption of a healthy diet. Table 5.7 lists the factors that you might consider when care planning for someone with a coronary problem using Roper and colleagues' (1996) model. This is a general outline, as so many factors will be unique to the individual. Our aim is to restore as normal constant heart function as possible, given cardiac muscle damage. Medications used to treat coronary heart problems Many types of medications are prescribed for the treatment and management of heart prob- lems. It is important that you are familiar with those prescribed to your MHSU group and Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 97 Table 5.7 Factors to consider when care planning for someone with a coronary problem Activity of daily living Example of care planning activity 1 Maintaining a safe environment This might relate to homeostasis of the internal body environment. We can achieve this by: monitoring baseline observations monitoring physical interventions such as medications evaluating the effectiveness of treatment revisiting the care plan if condition deteriorates Physical environment is also important, as limiting physical exertion when moving around is necessary. Adapting the home environment to minimize levels of exertion and promote independence and mobility, e.g. installation of stair lift, adapting showers and toilet seats, and installing hand rails 2 Breathing Monitoring respirations is a core observation, as breathlessness is a clinical feature of coronary problems. Breathlessness can be anxiety-provoking due to the associated discomfort and its role as a reinforcing agent of illness. Respirations should also be monitored during sleep. Observations and interventions include: respiration rate pulse oximetry oxygen therapy posture when sitting or lying collecting sputum samples for pathology and assessing any cough 3 Communicating Care planning and treatment for cardiovascular conditions can be very complex. Any instructions or explanations should be: jargon-free easy to understand the subject of regular feedback to ensure comprehension, and clarification that things have been understood You should also provide reassurance to alleviate anxiety. Encourage MHSUs to vent feelings and develop psychological coping strategies, or acceptance of the condition. This will decrease anxiety, as they find they can still have a social life as long as they are not over-exerting the heart 4 Mobilizing While encouraging fitness is important, this should not be too strenuous. Set small and safe targets, e.g. involving physiotherapy to develop an exercise plan walking short distances and gradually increasing this considering relaxation therapy to help the resting process and cope with stress encouraging the MHSU to rise slowly to prevent dizziness and light-headedness encouraging rest also (Also refer to maintaining a safe environment above) (continued) Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

If it does not, problems may be exacerbated. A dietitian can advise on nutrition: reduce calorie intake in obese MHSUs encourage fruit and fibre introduce a low-salt diet reduce salt intake, e.g. encourage no salt at the table but small quantities when cooking, consider low-salt alternatives reduce/abstain from alcohol reduce caffeine intake Occupational therapy can help develop cooking skills 6 Eliminating record fluid balance if required encourage adequate hydration monitor blood electrolyte levels prevent constipation to reduce risk of straining on elimination 7 Personal cleansing and dressing Promote independence here to illustrate that the MHSU can still function: ensure safety when bathing/showering, as this can be tiring use shower seat aids to minimize exertion observe skin integrity - reduced blood flow and oedema may compromise skin, so avoid rough towelling/drying following bathing use a moisturizer on dry, flaky skin to help recovery 8 Maintaining body temperature monitor body temperature for any infection encourage appropriate attire 9 Working and playing as for mobilizing above time off work may be required for those who are employed recreational activities may have to be less strenuous initially explore local self-help or support groups that might have social activities 10 Sleeping observe for sleep difficulties relating to respiration use of extra pillows to assist breathing discourage sleeping during the day consider medication if required 11 Expressing sexuality depending on the severity of the problem, sexual activity may decrease initially explain this to the MHSU as for working and playing above reassure that usual sexual activity will return 12 Dying MHSUs may be preoccupied with death or dying: allow MHSUs to express fears reassure that with treatment and lifestyle changes life can still be enjoyed discuss fears of the future openly and discourage catastrophic thinking encourage joining a support group to get peer support Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 99 both their desired and undesired effects. These medications can be taken in various forms and you should be aware of this to prevent maladministration. This is also an important factor for MHSU education - that they are aware of the route of administration when they are self-medicating. This section provides a quick guide to common medications. However, you will need to do some extra reading in this area yourself. Different drugs have different effects. For example: drugs that 'thin' the blood, reducing its viscosity, decreasing the risk of blood clots; drugs that reduce heart rate to lower BP; drugs that cause vasodilation, which increases blood supply to the heart; drugs that reduce the risk of coronary problems by lowering cholesterol. There are seven possible routes of administration for coronary medications: Orally: medication is swallowed via mouth. Sublingually: medication is dissolved under the tongue. Spray: medication is sprayed under the tongue. Patch: a patch is placed on the arm and the medication slowly released (similar principle to nicotine patches). Subcutaneously: medication injected under the skin (dermis and epidermis). Intramuscularly (IM): medication injected into a muscle. Intravenously: medication injected directly into a vein. Alpha blockers Alpha blockers are vasodilators that reduce vasoconstriction. Vasodilation helps to increase blood flow to the heart. Beta blockers Beta blockers are drugs that block the actions of the sympathetic nervous system by reducing the levels of the hormone adrenaline, which increases heart rate. They are used to help prevent attacks of angina, to lower BP, to help control abnormal heart rhythms and symptoms of heart failure, and to reduce the risk of a further heart attack in people who have already had one (BHF 2013e). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to treat hypertension by lowering BP. They have a vasodilator action and also reduce sodium retention. The most significant side-effect is a persistent, dry, irritating cough (BHF 2013e). Kidney function should also be monitored, as these drugs can affect the renal system, especially in MHSUs taking lithium. Calcium channel blockers Calcium causes the cells of the heart to contract or the blood vessels to narrow. This restricts blood flow and oxygen levels. Calcium channel blockers reduce calcium so that the heart and blood vessels can dilate. As a result, the heart receives a better blood supply and has to do less work to pump adequate blood around the body (BHF 2013e). Diuretics Diuretics help with the treatment of oedema by reducing sodium levels and increasing fluid loss. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Statins High cholesterol levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Statins work in two ways: they reduce the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver and they stimulate the removal of low-density lipoprotein from the circulation back to the liver (Evered 2007). Low-density lipo-protein (LDL) is termed 'bad' cholesterol, as it sticks to the artery wall leading to atheroma. Blood-thinning agents Drugs such as warfarin, heparin and aspirin help reduce the risk of blood clots forming. Box 5.8 List the medications for cardiovascular illness currently taken by your MHSUs. Orthostatic hypotension Orthostatic hypotension, also known as postural hypotension, is a sudden drop in BP when someone rises from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. It is a common condi - tion in individuals with cardiac problems and is an adverse reaction in some psychotropics. This is a key rationale for having skills in assessing and monitoring cardiovascular health. Assessment and monitoring of lying and standing BP is recommended in patients who are older, have diabetes or symptoms suggestive of postural hypotension (British Hypertension Society 2006). Mathias and Kimber (1999) give a comprehensive overview of causes of postural hypoten- sion and the factors that we should note in particular include: low blood volume; myocarditis; drug/alcohol use; renal failure; autonomic failure in Parkinson's disease. Other factors that relate to our MHSUs include ADRs following treatment with antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants or benzodiazepines, and bulimia where there is excessive vomiting. Symptoms of orthostatic hypotension The symptoms of orthostatic hypotension include: dizziness or being 'light-headed'; feeling faint; weakness in the legs. When someone gets up too quickly, they may feel dizzy, nauseous or faint, and may even lose consciousness. Loss of consciousness presents other potential risks such as head injury. Service users who take medication that risks orthostatic hypotension should have their BP and pulse regularly recorded.

Older MHSUs are especially vulnerable to orthostatic hypotension, as the natural ageing process can contribute to it. They should be monitored regularly. Treatment of orthostatic hypotension Mathias and Kimber (1999) suggest that treatment can be divided into three categories, which can be a useful guide for interventions when care planning: Things to be avoided, including sudden head-up postural change (especially on waking), high environmental temperature (including hot baths), and large meals (especially those containing refined carbohydrate). Things to be introduced, such as small, frequent meals, judicious exercise (including swim-ming). Things to be considered, including elastic stockings, pharmacological measures such as erythropoietin. Care planning for orthostatic hypotension The treatment of orthostatic hypotension will depend on the severity and a care plan will be required. As orthostatic hypotension is a common ADR, we should be able to write a competent and safe care plan. The uncertainty surrounding staff skills and responsibilities for physical care may mean that care plans such as this may be best drawn up in an inter-professional con-text utilizing the expertise of doctors and a specialist cardiac nurse practitioner.

Physical assessment: assessing cardiovascular health 103 Summary of key points Cardiac problems will affect three key areas: The pumping mechanism: atrial and ventricle weakness, heart valve weakness. The cardiac conduction system: cardiac arrhythmias, fibrillation. The vascular network: total or partial blood vessel blockage, thrombosis. The prevalence of cardiovascular problems is not well understood in MHSUs. However, we know that MHSUs face the same risk factors (apart from psychotropic medication) for coro- nary problems as the general population but are more likely to die from them. It is important that practitioners have an understanding of the cardiovascular system so that they can recognize signs and symptoms of illness and respond effectively. Practitioners must also recognize the value of liaising with the inter-professional team and specialist nurses for help and support and should suggest that their managers support them in this. Finally, practitioners should be aware of safety issues in planning care for people with coronary problems. This will include their knowledge of the desired and undesired effects of medications - those for treating the mental health problem and those for treating the coronary problem.

A: (Laugh) Yes, they cough all the time.Q: Why do they cough?A: Because they smoke. This is a regular exchange I have when teaching physical health issues. While it seems logi- cal that MHSUs cough because they smoke, this rationale may undervalue the cough as a clinical symptom due to its perceived 'usualness'. Practitioners may see smoking as a personal characteristic of MHSUs, rather than a risk factor for respiratory disorders. This may reduce the inclination to offer smoking cessation or health promotion because smoking is part of the person's life. Research on smoking points in the same direction: MHSUs smoke more (and in some cases very much more) than the general population. The prevalence of smoking among the UK adult population was 22 per cent in 2006 (Goddard 2006). Yet Brown et al. (1999) found between 62 Chapter contents Anatomy and physiology of the respira- tory system Smoking and its effects on the body Smoking cessation Assessing and managing respiratory conditions Care planning for respiratory care Learning outcomes By the end of this chapter, you will have: Outlined the structure and function of the respiratory system Defined key terms in respiration Explored respiratory conditions prevalent in MHSUs Explored the impact of smoking on respi-ratory health Explored the difference between routine and emergency respiratory assessment Examined treatment and management of respiratory conditions Examined aspects of care planning and management of breathlessness Box 6.1 Exercise List the factors that affect respiratory function.

Assessing respiratory health in mental health 105 and 81 per cent of people with a serious mental illness smoked tobacco, while McNeill (2001) found a smoking rate as high as 80 per cent among people with schizophrenia, and Wade et al. (2006) found a smoking rate of 76 per cent in people with first episode psychosis. This may be a contributing factor in the higher death rates from cardiovascular and respiratory disorders with a SMR of 250 (Harris and Barraclough 1998). The prevalence of respiratory conditions is largely unknown in MHSUs. In a UK observa- tional prevalence study, Filik et al. (2006) found people with SMI had lower lung function compared with the general population, with higher risk of respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness, phlegm production, and wheeze. In a US study, Himelhoch et al. (2004) sur- veyed a random sample of 200 MHSUs to estimate the prevalence of COPD. They found the following in relation to smoking and respiratory illness in their MHSU sample: Smoking prevalence: 60.5 per cent (22 per cent nationally). COPD prevalence: 22.6 per cent (5 per cent in the general population). Chronic bronchitis: 19.6 per cent. Emphysema: 7.5 per cent. Asthma: 18.5 per cent. Asthma and COPD: 33.3 per cent. Box 6.2 Case example Calculate the prevalence of smoking in your ward or clinical area. (Refer to Chapter 2 for how to calculate prevalence.) Risk factors affecting respiratory function Risk factors for respiratory disorders can be categorized as: demographic factors - social class, occupational factors; lifestyle factors - smoking, illicit drug use, alcohol abuse; psychological factors - anxiety disorders, panic attacks; physiological factors - genetic disorders, allergies, neck or chest trauma, diagnosed respi- ratory disorders; medications - some antipsychotics may cause cough and nasal congestion. Reasons for respiratory disorders in people with mental illness Smoking is the factor most responsible for the high prevalence of respiratory problems. It is the most significant public health concern in mental health, as it causes and contributes to high mortality and morbidity. Mental health nurses (MHNs) need to have competent skills in assess-ing respiratory health, identifying respiratory illnesses, and care planning for respiratory care. Liaison with primary care and specialist services will be a key role for MHNs who care for people with respiratory conditions. Harris and Barraclough (1998) also note higher mortality rates for infectious diseases in MHSUs. Adverse drug reactions can lead to a decrease in WBCs, which may compromise the immune system, leaving MHSUs more vulnerable to opportunistic chest infections (see Chap-ter 8). Service users on these medications should be offered appropriate immunizations as they are a high-risk group. Anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system The respiratory system has two distinct tracts, which is helpful when considering which part is affected during a respiratory assessment (see Figure 6.1). The upper respiratory tract Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. 106 Physical assessment skills for practice consists of the mouth, nose, pharynx, and larynx, while the lower respiratory tract comprises the trachea, lungs, bronchioles, alveoli, pulmonary capillary network, and pleural membranes (Kozier et al. 2008). As with the heart, the lungs have pleural membranes that keep them in place and this contains a lubricant that allows for painless breathing. The respiratory system is responsible for: warming and filtering inhaled air for foreign particles; control of breathing; ventilation; expulsion of carbon dioxide; maintaining blood gas homeostasis. In homeostasis, there is a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood. However, if an imbalance occurs, then chemoreceptors located in the aorta and carotid arter-ies detect this. They send a message to the medulla oblongata (control centre), which instructs the lungs to quicken respiration to increase oxygen intake. The respiratory system increases respiration rate until homeostasis is restored. The feedback loop then completes the cycle when balance is restored and breathing returns to normal. How the lungs work Respiration is an involuntary reflex involving ventilation. Ventilation involves inspiration (i.e. air flow into the lungs) and expiration (i.e. air flow out of the lungs) (Kozier et al. 2008). This is what we measure in baseline respirations. When air enters the mouth and nose, it is warmed and filtered by tiny hairs - the cilia, which remove any foreign particles. When we inspire, our lungs inflate. The diaphragm flattens and the inter-costal muscles allow our rib cage to expand and fill with oxygen. When we expire, our lungs deflate and we expel carbon dioxide. Diffusion is a process that governs respiration. Here particles from an area of high concentration move to an area of low concentration. During res - piration, oxygen diffuses into and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood stream (see Figure 6.2).Figure 6.1 The respiratory system Pharynx Epiglot tis Larynx Trachea Left main bronchus Hear t space Ribs Diaphragm [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Assessing respiratory health in mental health 107 There are two types of respiration. External respiration is the diffusion of oxygen and car- bon dioxide between the alveoli and the blood in the lungs. Internal respiration occurs at a cellular level with diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and cells. The alveoli contain WBCs (alveolar macrophages), which keep them free from bacteria. These attack and destroy foreign bodies that evade the cilia and enter the lungs. However, smoking inhibits the actions of the cilia and alveolar macrophages, reducing their effectiveness, which is a reason why smokers are vulnerable to frequent chest infections. Table 4.13 in Chapter 4 outlines the key terms in respiration that MHNs should be aware of when undertaking physical health assessment. The significance of respiration for mental health practitioners Service users smoke significantly more than the general population and are likely to die earlier from respiratory disorders. Knowledge of respiratory function is important in identifying res - piratory problems accurately, so that appropriate treatment can be given. Practitioners work - ing with socially excluded groups, such as homeless people, may face significant challenges around communicable diseases such as TB, which will be explored further in this chapter. With many countries now adopting no smoking policies in public places, there is a signifi - cant challenge for practitioners to meet this public health agenda. And MHSUs are also being Figure 6.2 Alveoli and the process of gaseous exchange Trachea Left main bronchus Red blood cell O2 CO2 Tiny vessel bronchioleRight lung Upper lobe Middle lobe Lower lobe The lungs contain millions of tiny alveoliOxygen (O2) from air breathed in goes into the red blood cells via alveoli.

Practitioners should enable MHSUs to stop smoking by engaging and supporting them in smoking cessation and using NRT. Smoking Smoking is a lifestyle factor and the second major cause of death in the world (around 5 million deaths annually; WHO 2008c). Tobacco is the single largest health risk in the European Union, accounting for nearly 700,000 premature deaths each year (European Commission 2014). In the UK in 2011, smoking was responsible for around 79,100 deaths (18 per cent of all deaths of adults aged 35 and over) (Health and Social Care Information Centre 2012b). The prevalence of smoking has decreased in some countries. Table 6.1 illustrates the public health concern regarding smoking with respect to the general population and, more specifi- cally, mental health. Table 6.1 has been updated but also includes the 2004 statistics in brack-ets. Taking this as a baseline, Table 6.2 shows the prevalence of smoking for the UK general population and selected mental health conditions.Table 6.1 Comparison of smoking rates of the general population and MHSUs Country Prevalence of smoking in the general population (%) Prevalence of smoking in MHSUs (%) USA 19.0# (23.6)* 52% outpatients, 88% schizophrenia, 80% schizophrenia (McNeill 2001) Australia 17.5# (19.5)* 39% of people with a mental illness, (Access Economics 2007) Source: *WHO (2004b), #Australia (Scollo and Winstanley 2012) Table 6.2 Prevalence of smoking in the UK general population and by selected mental disorder Group Prevalence General population 22% Common mental disorder 32% Depression 37% Phobias 37% Mixed anxiety and depression 29% Probable psychosis 40% Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders 44.6% Alcohol dependence 46% Illicit drug dependence 69% Bipolar affective disorder 36.7% Eating disorders 23.1% Specific personality disorders 27.2% Source: Adapted from McManus et al.

Assessing respiratory health in mental health 109 Smoking prevalence in mental health As we can see the prevalence of tobacco use is higher in MHSUs than the general population. Furthermore, smoking is not confined to SMI but is problematic across most mental disorders. Like the general population, MHSUs want to quit smoking; McNeill (2001) found 52 per cent of people with schizophrenia living in institutions wanted to give up smoking. Mental health nurses must empower and enable MHSUs to quit and strive not to let negative attitudes or assumptions of success impede public health initiatives and smoking cessation. Effects of smoking on the body Smoking-related disorders include cancers of the lung, mouth, and oesophagus. Smoking is a prime cause of COPD and it increases the risk of atherosclerosis, which leads to cardiovascu-lar conditions such as CHD and stroke. Cigarettes contain nicotine and Cancer Research UK (2012) reports the following: Nicotine is a stimulant that increases heart rate. Nicotine is addictive and causes withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, irritability, anxi- ety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and disturbed sleep. Cigarette smoke contains at least 69 cancer-causing chemicals as well as other poisons including hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. Why is smoking more prevalent in mental health? From a social perspective, smoking is more prevalent in lower socio-economic groups, of which MHSUs usually belong to. Smoking prevalence in the general population is decreasing. However, a clear social gradient exists with a disproportionate amount of smokers in lower socio-economic groups. In the UK, statistics show smoking prevalence of 27 per cent in manual households, 20 per cent in intermediate households, and 13 per cent in managerial and profes- sional households (Health and Social Care Information Centre 2012b). From a biological perspective, an addiction model explains smoking behaviour. Nicotine is addictive, so when nicotine levels fall below a certain level in the blood, smokers experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms that are relieved by smoking. This develops into a cycle of smoking to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Smoking may be used by MHSUs as a coping mechanism for stress and anxiety. However, this self-medication hypothesis has not been proven. Although people believe that smoking relieves their stress or anxiety, this might be conflated with the addiction model. The symp-toms of nicotine withdrawal cause anxiety and stress so smoking relieves withdrawal, hence it relieves anxiety and stress. Self-medication may be considered in relation to schizophrenia. Levin and Rezvani (2000) found evidence that nicotine has an effect in both reversing the adverse effects of antipsy-chotic drugs and the cognitive impairment of schizophrenia itself. Furthermore, Patkar et al. (2002) found a link between nicotine dependence and negative symptoms in people with schiz-ophrenia. This study also showed that duration of illness and alcohol use predicted smoking. The reality for many MHSUs is less scientifically glamorous with boredom at institutional life reported as a key factor in smoking (McNeill 2004). Smoking is often seen as a 'way of life' for MHSUs, a way to socialize or pass time by. In a survey of patients in a UK medium secure unit, 84 per cent reported that they smoked (Meiklejohn et al. 2003). I believe it is the culture of acceptance of smoking in mental health rather than a culture of smoking that is the simplest answer. Smoking is an activity that is highly tolerated by practi-tioners. Indeed, Gubbay's (1992) research showed that the prevalence of smoking was higher among MHNs than other nurses. We may even use smoking as a means of calming MHSUs or socializing with them. Trying to introduce change can be met with intolerance and fatalist attitudes - 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks'. Indeed, cigarettes are often used in ad hoc token economy systems in psychiatric units (Nash and Romanos 2010). Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

An increase in dopamine is a biological theory of psychosis. Smoking can increase the rate at which psycho-tropic medications are metabolized in the body. This means that drugs pass through the body more quickly. Therefore, higher doses of medications may be required for heavy smokers. Desai et al. (2001) found that smoking is associated with increased clearance of benzodi- azepines such as lorazepam and diazepam and antipsychotics such as haloperidol and olanza- pine. Furthermore, these authors state that cigarette smoking reduces plasma concentrations of chlorpromazine and clozapine. Dratcu et al. (2007) suggest that smoking and excessive caf- feine use is associated with poor therapeutic responses to clozapine and should be considered in pharmacological management. There have been reports that clozapine can reduce smoking (Combs and Advokat 2000), although the mechanism for this is unclear. It may be a genuine psychopharmacological action of reducing craving, or clozapine may stabilize mental state so that health promotion advice can be acted upon. It is also important to consider the effect that smoking cessation may have on ADRs. If smok- ers require higher doses of medication, if they stop smoking they may suffer from adverse effects. Subsequently, as MHSUs abstain from smoking, treatment regimes may need to be altered. Therefore, taking a smoking history is important for both respiratory assessment and prescribing practices. Smoking and illicit substances For some MHSUs, smoking might involve illicit substances. In anecdotal accounts, colleagues working in substance misuse report MHSUs using bronchodilators prior to smoking heroin, as this increases the 'hit', or MHSUs smoking benzodiazepine 'spliffs'. Respiratory complications due to substance use and smoking are illustrated in Table 6.3.

Assessing respiratory health in mental health 111 Disorders of the respiratory system Disorders of the respiratory system are due primarily to inflammation and infection. Smoking is a significant contributor to both of these, causing upper and lower respiratory tract damage and reducing the body's defences. Respiratory problems can be divided into two broad types: Restrictive problems occur when an individual cannot inhale a normal amount of air, e.g. due to a trauma or infection. Obstructive problems occur when something obstructs the flow of air into or out of the lungs, e.g. asthma, COPD, tumour. Lung cancer In 2011, there were 35,184 deaths from lung cancer in the UK (Cancer Research UK 2014). How- ever, many more are people suffer from debilitating smoking-related disorders. Smoking is a significant cause of lung cancer. The risk of developing lung cancer is affected by level of con-sumption and duration of smoking (Doll et al. 2005), which makes MHSUs a high-risk group. There are two types of lung cancer: Small cell carcinomas account for approximately 20-25 per cent of all lung cancers (Le P\u00e9choux et al. 2004). Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 80 per cent of all lung cancers (National Institute for Health Research 2007). Diagnosing lung cancer The signs and symptoms of lung cancer are very similar to those of other respiratory disor- ders, making lung cancer difficult to diagnose. Therefore, by the time diagnosis is confirmed, the cancer may have metastasized (spread to other sites). If this occurs, the outcome for the MHSU will be significantly worse. Diagnostic procedures for lung cancer include (Hunt 2008): (PET scan). However, the National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care (2005) recommends urgent referral for a chest X-ray when a patient presents with haemoptysis, or any of the following unexplained or persistent (i.e. lasting more than three weeks) symptoms or signs: cough; suggestive of metastasis from a lung cancer (for example, in brain, bone, liver or skin); cervical/supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Our role in the diagnostic process is one of screening. As nurses spend more time with MHSUs, we should be observing changes to respiratory function. When we notice something peculiar we should assess, document, and report it. If it comes to nothing, fine - it is still good practice. However, if it is something, prompt intervention can be the difference in improving outcome. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the main treatment methods. However, invasive surgery to remove part of or a whole lung may also be considered. Your role in this treatment will be supportive. You will act as liaison between the specialist practitioners and the mental health team. You will monitor the person's health and response to treatment through baseline observations and will also liaise with the cancer specialist nurse with respect to specific aspects of care, for example, the management of nausea following treatment. A cancer diagnosis can be a devastating life event. Psychological support and education for both MHSU and family members will be important considerations. You will monitor the MHSU's mental state for signs of depression and hopelessness while co-monitoring the physi-cal condition with the cancer specialist nurse. In the event that palliative care is required, you will reassure the MHSU and their family that physical suffering will be minimized through a MHSU-centred pain relief management plan. You would also arrange for spiritual support as per the MHSU's wishes. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition characterized by airflow obstruction that is usually progressive, not fully reversible, and does not change markedly over several months (NICE 2004a). An accelerated decline in lung function is a conse - quence of the condition. COPD is the internationally recognized term for chronic bronchi - tis, emphysema, chronic obstructive airways disease, chronic airflow limitation, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic airflow obstruction (Booker 2005). It is estimated that nearly 900,000 people in the UK have COPD but half as many again are thought to be living with it undiagnosed (National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions 2004). The UK Department of Health (2006a) estimates mortality from COPD at 30,000 deaths annually. Pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Airways obstruction is caused by excess build up of mucous, inflammation, irritation or infection. This causes the airways to narrow, restricting airflow. COPD is a progres - sive disorder where there is a loss of alveolar function. As function deteriorates, there is only partial diffusion, so not all air is expelled from the lungs. This creates dead space where reduced gaseous exchange occurs. Dead space decreases lung capacity, leaving less space for oxygen to occupy on respiration. This results in hypoxia, which leads to tissue death. Diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease There is no single diagnostic test for COPD. Pauwels et al . (2001: 1257) suggest that a diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has symptoms of cough, spu - tum production or dyspnea, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. COPD is usually diagnosed with a spirometry test, a specialist test that the MHN would not necessarily undertake. Spirometry testing is usually done by a respiratory nurse special - ist or doctor, or may be undertaken in a GP practice by a practice nurse trained in this technique. A diagnosis of COPD is made based on a combination of history, physical examination, and confirmation of the presence of airflow obstruction using spirometry (NICE 2004a). How - ever, a diagnosis of COPD should be considered in patients over the age of 35 who have a risk factor (generally smoking) and who present with one or more of the symptoms shown in Table 6.4.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Assessing respiratory health in mental health 113 Spirometry is used to test lung function and diagnose conditions such as COPD. Like PEFR (see p. 67), spirometry involves MHSUs blowing air into a machine, which produces a graph illustrating normal, restrictive or obstructive airflow. This test will be administered in either primary care or general medical settings, as spirometers are generally not available in mental health units. You will liaise with practice, district or respiratory nurse specialists who have expertise in spirometry, so understanding this investigation constitutes an obvious training need for practitioners. Differentiating between asthma and COPD is also important so that respiratory distress can be effectively managed. Guidance from NICE (2004a) lists factors for COPD as smoking, rare in peo - ple under age 35, and persistent and progressive breathlessness; in contrast, asthma symptoms are common under age 35, there is variable breathlessness, and smoking is a possible factor. Managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Our primary role will be screening for COPD, which will entail knowledge of signs and symp- toms, assessment, diagnosis, and management. This will be inter-professional and require liai-son with primary care and specialist medical services. Booker (2005) suggests that the aims of treatment for COPD are to: prevent or ameliorate further disease progression; relieve symptoms; improve exercise capacity; maintain the best possible quality of life; prevent exacerbations. Mental health nurses play a key role in health education and health promotion in pri- mary prevention (e.g. preventing MHSUs from starting smoking), secondary prevention (e.g. embarking on behaviour change to support MHSUs in stopping smoking), and tertiary prevention (e.g. improving the quality of life of MHSUs with COPD). Guidance from NICE (2004a) outline the key priorities for COPD as: stopping smoking; effective inhaled therapy; pulmonary rehabilitation for all who need it; the use of non-invasive ventilation; management of exacerbations; multi-disciplinary working. Care planning will involve inter-professional liaison with a respiratory nurse specialist, a physiotherapist to advise on exercise, and a doctor for advice on specific treatments.

However, as part of an inter-professional team, we will facilitate the day-to-day management of the treatment plan and report to lead practitioners, most probably a respiratory specialist nurse. Depending on the severity, a care plan will involve: medications - inhaler therapy (to include education on proper inhaler technique), oxygen; pulmonary rehabilitation; dietitian - for advice on diet and fluid intake; physiotherapist - to advise on exercise; social factors - mobility aids for the home, benefits advice for home help or meals on wheels; monitoring mental state; palliative care. Box 6.5 ExerciseWhich type of evidence-based practice guidelines are used as standards for respiratory care in your clinical practice area? Cough A cough can be irritating on a continuum of mild, moderate to severe. It is a major symptom of respiratory disorders such as cancer, chest infection, and TB. It also occurs in cardiovascular conditions, allergies or the presence of a foreign body obstructing the respiratory tract. Morice et al. (2006) define cough in two ways: Acute cough: lasting less than three weeks, commonly associated with viral upper respira- tory tract infection and, in the absence of significant co-morbidity, is normally benign and self-limiting. If acute cough presents with any of the following - haemoptysis, breathless-ness, fever, chest pain or weight loss, then a chest X-ray is recommended. Chronic cough: lasting more than eight weeks, most patients present with a dry or mini-mally productive cough, reduced quality of life, and the presence of significant sputum production usually indicates primary lung pathology. The most common cause of cough is irritation, with smoking the most likely provoking agent. However, cough can also be present in COPD and asthma. The longer someone smokes, the more persistent the cough will become. Smoking will also leave the person vulnerable to opportunistic lung infections as it decreases the body's defence mechanisms. Cough assessment As a baseline measurement, ask the MHSU to self-assess cough severity, on a scale of 1 ('slight cough') to 5 ('severe cough', breathlessness, and sputum production). Assessment of cough will involve palpation - sounding the chest and listening for abnormal sounds. Specific questions will address: Onset - when did it occur, was it sudden or gradual? Timing - is it worse at any particular time, e.g. in the morning? Duration - are coughing fits long? Provocation - what provokes the cough? Alleviation - what makes it better? Other aspects of assessment include: Does the cough cause chest pain? Inspect chest for signs of trauma or throat for signs of a foreign body. Is there a history of respiratory illness or cough? Have treatments been tried - what, how effective were they? Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Assessing respiratory health in mental health 115 Is there sputum production - is blood or odour present? Sputum and blood samples may be sent for pathology analysis. You should also be aware of any medical history and whether the person is taking any medica - tions that may cause cough (e.g. ACE inhibitors). Indeed, some atypical drugs can have adverse effects on the respiratory system, such as collapse, respiratory arrest, coughing, pneumonia/pneumonia-like symptoms, and wheezing with clozapine (Novartis 2013), fatigue, rhinitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and coughing with Risperdal (Janssen Pharmaceuticals 2013). Sputum assessment If sputum is produced, it is important to examine it for signs of blood or odour. This may seem unpleasant but if blood is present, it may represent a medical emergency. If a sputum sam-ple is sent to pathology, it should be secure, observing infection control and clinical hazard measures. Appropriate containers, packaging, and labelling should always be used. Table 6.5 illustrates possible observations from a sputum sample. Treating cough Preventing cough by stopping smoking is the first step, as this will improve respiratory function and the reduce risk of respiratory disorders. However, MHSUs may still be at risk of respira - tory disorders due to their smoking history but the severity may be reduced. If cough is caused by an infection, then treatment of the infection is the priority, ensuring all antibiotic therapies are completed, even when the cough and infection recede. It is important to determine whether the MHSU is self-medicating with over-the-counter cough remedies, as these can cause drowsi - ness. When taken in conjunction with psychotropic drugs, drowsiness may be exacerbated. The MHSU should be advised to rest as much as possible, using extra pillows when in bed and cushions for support when sitting. However, they should also be encouraged to be inde-pendent and do some light walking. Homeopathic remedies for cough may also be an option. Menthol vapours or burning incense may help to soothe the airways and clear blocked nasal passages. Folk remedies may also be used by MHSUs; for example, in Ireland a knob of butter on the bridge of the nose is used to ease congestion. Box 6.6 Case example Tom is a 53-year-old man with schizophrenia and a long history of self-neglect. Following discharge from a large asylum, he has been living and sleeping rough for the past 12 years. He periodically accesses health services at the homeless person's team, mostly in winter. He has been admitted to your ward via the homeless team. He is coughing a lot and you suspect he may have TB.

It is caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is characterized by the formation of nodular lesions in the tissue (McFerran 2008). Tuberculosis is a contagious disease spread through spores discharged by someone who has active TB when they cough or sneeze. In the UK in 2012, Public Health England (2013) reported 8751 cases of TB, an incidence rate of 13.9 per 100,000 population. London accounted for the largest proportion (39 per cent of UK cases) and the highest regional rate - 41.8 per 100,000. Public Health England (2013) report that 7.3 per cent of TB cases had at least one social risk factor (e.g. history of homelessness, imprisonment, drug or alcohol misuse), which is important for MHNs to consider as MHSUs may face increased exposure to these risks. Little is known about the prevalence of TB in MHSUs. However, two American studies report high prevalence rates in people with serious mental illnesses in New York; 17 per cent in a population of 71 MHSUs in a day programme (McQuistion et al. 1997) and 20 per cent in a sample of 655 individuals admitted to a state psychiatric hospital (Pirl et al. 2005). The risk of developing TB is higher in people with an impaired immune system, something that practitioners working with MHSUs with HIV/AIDS should be aware of. The symptoms of tuberculosis Individuals with active TB may present with (McFerran 2008): fever; night sweats; weight loss; cough; haemoptysis. Diagnosing active respiratory tuberculosis In the UK, NICE (2006b) suggests the following for diagnosing active TB: A posterior-anterior chest X-ray should be taken; chest X-rays suggestive of TB should lead to further diagnostic investigation. Multiple sputum samples (at least three, with one early morning sample) should be sent for TB microscopy and culture for suspected respiratory TB before starting treatment if pos- sible or, failing that, within seven days of starting. Spontaneously produced sputum should be obtained if possible; otherwise, induction of sputum or bronchoscopy and lavage should be used. If there are clinical signs and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of TB, treatment should be started without waiting for culture results. Management of active tuberculosis A medical model of management is the most appropriate for active TB. Guidance from NICE (2006b) recommends a six-month, four-drug initial regimen (six months of isoniazid and rifampicin supplemented in the first two months with pyrazinamide and ethambutol). Compliance is a significant problem with drug treatment for TB, and thus our primary role will be ensuring compliance and monitoring the course of illness. Tuberculosis presents a grave threat to public health and we cannot let assumptions about patient autonomy and choice cloud our work here. The UK has a strict public health law for communicable diseases. Coker et al. (2007) examined legal and compulsory measures for TB in Europe. While compulsory treatment for active TB is not practised in the UK, they found compulsory screening, compulsory Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Assessing respiratory health in mental health 117 examination, compulsory detention, and exclusion from certain activities for people who are TB active. While the risk is clear, it does not diminish the difficulty that ensuring com - pliance presents. It may not be easy, especially for practitioners working with socially excluded groups. The challenges of engagement, developing trust, and genuineness are clear. The continual surveillance of MHSUs to ensure compliance (e.g. counting pills or even urine drug screens) can be very threatening and lead to disengagement, the opposite of what is required. As skilled communicators, however, we can effectively convey the need for treatment. We should aim to involve MHSUs in treatment and empower them as much as possible through education, providing appropriate information and exploring the possibility of peer support. We need to explain the need for continual contact as a means of ensuring their physical well-being as well as health education and health promotion. Another important consideration is your own health and well-being. It is very important that you are up to date will all your immunizations and in this case it is the BCG vaccination. Asthma Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways associated with episodes of reversible over- reactivity of the airway smooth muscle (Waugh and Grant 2006). During an asthma attack, the airways become narrow, restricting oxygen intake. Asthma attacks can be mild or very severe, where breathlessness leads to hypoxia. This can be an extremely frightening experience for MHSU and MHN alike. Symptoms of asthma The British Thoracic Society (2012: 14) suggests that features suggestive of asthma in adults are as follows: More than one of the following symptoms: wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly if: symptoms worse at night and in the early morning, symptoms in response to exercise, allergen exposure, and cold air, symptoms after taking aspirin or beta blockers. History of atopic disorder. Family history of asthma/atopic disorder. Widespread wheeze on chest auscultation. Unexplained low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF). Unexplained peripheral blood eosinophilia. Treatment of asthma Non-pharmacological measures: The environment plays a role in provoking an asthma attack. Service users should avoid exposure to irritants, e.g. dusty and smoky environments. Pollution from traffic may also be a potential problem, so MHSUs who live near main roads should keep windows closed as a precaution. Exposure to other irritants needs to be reduced; for example, if the environment is being decorated, then paint fumes may trigger an attack. Good ventilation and avoidance will reduce the likelihood of an attack. Allergies such as hay fever might cause problems. An adjunct treatment may be required together with minimal exposure to pollen; MHSUs should be encouraged to find out what the pollen count is so that they can take precautions such as wearing sunglasses and headscarves or baseball caps to prevent pollen resting in their hair. Pharmacological measures: Compliance with prescribed treatments can prevent an asthma attack or reduce its severity. You should empower MHSUs to self-monitor using daily peak flow measurements to record lung function for treatment evaluation.

They include: Relievers: Relievers are taken immediately to relieve asthma symptoms by quickly relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways, allowing these to open, making it easier to breathe again (Asthma UK 2004). Examples of relievers include short-acting bronchodila-tors such as salbutamol and long-acting bronchodilators such as salmeterol, which keeps airways open for a few hours. Preventers: Preventers control the swelling and inflammation in the airways, stopping them from being sensitive and reducing the risk of severe attacks (Asthma UK 2004). People who require these will also have a reliever prescribed. Examples of preventers include corticos- teroid inhalers such as beclometasone. Corticosteroid tablets: Corticosteroids are effective in asthma management as they reduce airway inflammation, oedema, and secretion of mucus into the airway (BNF 2013). These drugs are used where inhaler therapies have been ineffective. Examples of steroid tablets include dexamethasone and prednisolone. Nebulizer: In cases of severe asthma attack, a nebulizer will be required to administer medi-cine. A nebulizer is a small plastic container filled with medicine that is attached to a com-pressor. The compressor blows air into the medicine turning it into a fine mist, which is then inhaled via a face mask or mouth-piece (Asthma UK 2004). Medications used in nebulizers are short-acting bronchodilators and ipratropium bromide. Box adverse reactions of salbutamol, prednisolone, and beclometasone. Management of asthma People with asthma and co-morbid psychiatric disorders are reported to have poorer asthma control and higher healthcare needs (Adams et al. 2004). Initially, we may have to administer medicines until there are improvements in mental state. However, our goal should be to empower MHSUs to be self-medicating by returning inhalers to them when in hospital. This will promote independence and give MHSUs a sense of control over the asthma. The British Thoracic Society (2012: 37) state that complete control of asthma is defined as: no daytime symptoms; no night-time awakening due to asthma; no need for rescue medication; no exacerbations; no limitations on activity including exercise; normal lung function (in practical terms FEV 1 and/or PEF >80 per cent predicted or best); minimal side-effects from medication. An important aspect of asthma management is inhaler technique. Although MHSUs may comply with inhaler therapy, if their technique is faulty they may not be getting optimal doses, which can contribute to poor asthma management. Giraud and Roche (2002) found that poor inhaler technique, mainly due to poor coordination, was associated with poor asthma control. They suggest that education of MHSUs in good inhaler technique is an important factor in effectively managing asthma. Another method of ensuring optimal dosing is using spacers, as these help to deliver asthma medicine to the lungs, making the inhaler easier to use (Asthma UK 2004). Those MHSUs that have movement disorders, and who use inhalers, may require closer monitoring of asthma and inhaler technique.

Assessing respiratory health in mental health 119 Pneumonia Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection and is defined as inflammation of the lung caused by bacteria, in which the alveoli become filled with inflammatory cells and the lung becomes solid (McFerran 2008). Watson (2008) suggests that pneumonia can be classified in two ways: by site of infection (e.g. bronchial pneumonia), or if it is caused by an organism as in bacterial pneumonia. Pathophysiology When the alveoli contain fluid this takes up space, reducing the amount of oxygen that can enter into the lungs, causing inadequate gaseous exchange. This reduces the levels of oxygen in the blood, which leads to breathlessness, discomfort, and tachypnoea. In someone who is frail or has other risk factors for respiratory ill health, it can be very severe and lead to hypoxia. Therefore, pneumonia can be a life-threatening condition in people who are physi- cally ill or frail (e.g. the elderly or people with anorexia nervosa). The risk factors for pneumo-nia are as follows (Watson 2008): pre-existing illness such as: renal impairment, diabetes, COPD, asthma; people who are immuno-compromised, e.g. HIV-positive, transplant patients, very young or intubated; a history of alcohol or substance misuse; poor nutritional health. Diagnosing pneumonia Hoare and Lim (2006) outline the signs and symptoms of pneumonia as: shortness of breath; pleuritic chest sweats; confusion; raised respiratory rate; fever of >38\u00b0C; focal chest signs: decreased chest expansion, dullness on percussion, decreased entry of air, bronchial breathing, and crackles (none, some, or all of these may be present). Other types of diagnostic tests will be needed to confirm pneumonia. Blood tests that exam- ine FBC, especially for WBCs, will identify any infection. Samples can be taken to investigate if cultures are present in sputum. These will identify organisms for which appropriate treatment can be given. Treatment for pneumonia The treatment plan is likely to be inter-professional and your role may be as a co-facilitator and liaison with the other practitioners involved. The first stage of treatment would aim to pro-mote oxygen intake into the blood stream to manage breathlessness and any hypoxia. Regular recording and documentation of physical observations is important. Medication may be required in two forms: pain relief for any chest pain during respiration and antibiotics to fight any infection. Antibiotics should be safely administered until the course Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physiotherapists may be required to provide advice on posture and the expectoration of sputum. They may have to provide chest massage, which will help the MHSU to cough up and expel sputum. Depending on severity, the MHSU may be on bed rest. This presents risks that require man- agement, including: Hydration: reduce the risk of dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid balance, as the MHSU may be dependent on staff to bring fluids. Appetite: liquid nutritional substitutes may be prescribed until the pneumonia recedes and appetite returns. Posture: encourage upright posture to prevent aspiration when eating and drinking. Skin: encourage the MHSU to refrain from lying and sitting continuously to reduce risk of pressure sores. Light mobility may be required. Respiratory assessment Box 6.8 ExerciseWhat factors do you consider important for a respiratory assessment? The primary purpose of respiratory assessment is to determine the adequacy of gaseous exchange (Moore 2007). Physical assessment skills required for respiratory assessment include observation, inspection, palpation, and auscultation. Ferns and Chojnacka (2006) suggest that clinical assessment and physical assessment skills are the dominant variables in respiratory assessment. Practical considerations for privacy, dignity, and respect also apply here, as dis-robing will be required. The first stage of respiratory assessment is observation. By looking and listening to some- one, we can get a crude assessment of their respiratory health. The process of ventilation should be smooth and noiseless. On hearing abnormal sounds, we should assume there is a problem (Table 4.13 lists types of respirations we might find). This is important, as observation will determine whether the assessment is of an emergency or routine nature. Obvious respira- tory distress should be treated as a medical emergency. Observation will also prompt us to ask closed questions if open questions lead to breathlessness. Breathlessness Breathlessness is a common complaint in respiratory conditions and requires consideration during assessment. The Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale offers a guide to assessing the severity of breathlessness. It has five levels of breathlessness, ranging from 1 ('not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise') to 5 ('too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing') (see NICE 2004a: 9). Visual observation Skin colour, peripheral cyanosis, nicotine stains on hair/fingers. Respiratory effort when answering questions (repeated stoppages for breaths, unable to complete a long sentence). Posture during breathing effort, bent over or very erect. Effort when breathing - are accessory muscles being used to help breathing? (observe clav- icles and neck for movement). Expressions of pain or discomfort. Is chest movement symmetrical? Does chest expand and contract in unison? Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Assessing respiratory health in mental health 121 Is there breathlessness on minor exertion? Finger clubbing is a symptom of respiratory illness. Here the tips of the fingers appear swol- len and on palpation are spongy. Auditory observation Listen for abnormal breathing sounds: cough; crackles (high-pitched, popping sounds heard during inspiration due to delay in airways reopening); wheezes (whistling sounds caused by narrow airways, e.g. obstruction caused by a foreign object or mucous secretions); rhonchi (an abnormal musical noise produced by air passing through narrowed bronchi; McFerran 2008); stridor (noise heard on inspiration due to trachea or larynx obstruction; McFerran 2008). Inspection Examination of the chest during ventilation: Equal and symmetrical lung expansion on inspiration. Chest shape, e.g. barrel chest due to COPD. Observe the skin for any scarring or trauma. Inspect the fingers for evidence of finger clubbing. Palpation Is the trachea in its usual position? Deviation of the trachea may occur following asphyxia- tion trauma. Can you feel lymph nodes on the neck? Gently trace over the rib cage for evidence of swelling or tenderness. Auscultation and percussion Auscultation involves using a stethoscope to assess breathing sounds, while percussion is tapping the thoracic area to identify foreign sounds. Percussion and auscultation are usually performed by a doctor. However, these are the types of skills that nurses should be acquiring in order to extend practice. Further questions that can be used to structure the assessment include: Is there any pain? Is there a family history of respiratory disorders? What is the MHSU's smoking history? Current and past history (calculate pack years1); history of attempts to quit; have there been any changes in smoking habit? What is the MHSU's occupational history? - to determine work-related exposure to irritants. What provokes or reduces breathlessness? Has there been recent weight loss? Is the MHSU waking from sleep at night due to breathlessness (possible orthopnoea)? Does breathlessness cause mobility problems? Has the MHSU had the flu or pneumococcal vaccinations? 1Prignot (1987) defines a pack year smoked as one packet of cigarettes or 20 g of tobacco smoked each day for a full year (one cigarette is equal to one gram).

Other observations include (see also Chapter 4): respiratory rate between 12 and 18, regular, effortless, no foreign sounds; pulse oximetry of 95 per cent or above; PEFR measurement; central cyanosis (look under MHSU's tongue for blueness); temperature (to determine fever); FBC (is related to or chest chest X-ray; sputum sample. Emergency respiratory assessment Emergency respiratory assessment will be required when we find someone in a state of col- lapse or with acute breathlessness. Key aspects of an emergency respiratory assessment include: is the MHSU too breathless to speak?; tachycardia, i.e. a pulse rate over 110 beats per minute in adults; bradycardia, i.e. a pulse rate under 50 beats per minute in adults; tachypnoea, i.e. a respiratory rate of 25 breaths or more per minute in adults; bradypnoea, i.e. a respiratory rate under 10 breaths per minute in adults; cyanosis: peripheral (fingers or lips) and central (under the tongue); oxygen saturation less than 90 per cent; central/left-sided chest pain with nausea (possible neck or jaw pain also); altered consciousness level - confusion or drowsiness; is it hyperventilation due to anxiety? Box 6.9 Case example Damien has been smoking for 25 years. He has tried to quit on a number of occasions with- out success. The longest he has gone without a cigarette was two months. This was about nine years ago. How would you support Damien in his decision to quit smoking? Smoking cessation Smoking is a modifiable risk factor and a key health promotion intervention is smoking ces-sation. This includes education about the negative effects of smoking and the positive benefits of giving up. With support and smoking cessation aids, smoking can be reduced or stopped. If MHSUs do not accept this advice that is unfortunate; we cannot give nicotine replacement compulsorily. However, we must continue to offer advice, encourage, empower, and support people in changing this risky behaviour. One approach to broaching the subject of smoking cessation is the 'five As' approach (Raw et al. 1998): Ask about smoking. Advise people to stop.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Assessing respiratory health in mental health 123 Assess motivation to stop and the need for pharmacotherapy. Assist with prescription or referral to behavioural support. Arrange follow-up. Indeed, NICE (2006c) recommends that brief smoking cessation interventions should include, among other things, advising MHSUs to stop smoking and referring them to smoking cessation services. Practitioners should be able to provide smoking cessation/stop smoking support con - tacts; in the UK, this would be telephone numbers for the NHS Stop Smoking Services. There are three main aspects of smoking cessation that are used separately or in conjunc- tion with each other: counselling support; prescription of medication, e.g. bupropion hydrochloride; NRT, e.g. patches. The first stage of the process should be an assessment of smoking: type of tobacco consumed - cigarettes, hand rolling tobacco, pipe; number/quantity of cigarettes, tobacco used per day; any particular rituals observed, e.g. a cigarette and a cup of tea; any factors that induce smoking, e.g. anxiety, stress; any factors that reduce the need to smoke, e.g. diversionary activities. The second stage is assessing MHSU's motivation to stop smoking, asking questions such as (West 2004): Do you want to stop smoking for good? Are you interested in making a serious attempt to stop in the near future? Are you interested in receiving help with your attempt to stop? These questions can be phrased so as to rate motivation using simple scales. For example, on a scale of 1 ('not at all') to 5 ('very much so'): how strong is your desire to stop smoking for good? how interested are you in making a serious attempt to stop in the near future? how interested are you in receiving help with your attempt to stop? A smoking cessation group might benefit MHSUs in offering peer support and encouragement. This approach will also be beneficial in effectively managing practitioners' time. However, individual support should also be offered, such as telephone support and follow-up. Group support may involve the following: Outline the reasons for smoking. Outline the reasons for stopping (emphasize these). Explore factors that make quitting difficult. Plan to reduce or eliminate these factors. Help with setting realistic goals. Develop coping skills without nicotine. Provide a physical health check. Provide general health education advice. Cutting down to quit Stopping smoking can be a daunting task. Nicotine replacement therapy - gum, patches, loz- enges or inhalers - can be used in the short term to support people with the nicotine with-drawal. In the recent past it was considered important for smoking to have stopped prior to starting NRT, as increased nicotine intake (from NRT and smoking) could lead to nausea. However, NHS Choices (2012b) suggest that nicotine-assisted reduction to stop can now be Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Here a GP may prescribe NRT to help quit. This would entail using NRT with longer gaps between cigarettes. Medication may also be considered for very heavy smokers. Bupropion hydrochloride, once used as an antidepressant, is often used in smoking cessation, although its mode of action is not clear (BNF 2013). If this is prescribed, we should be aware of any adverse reactions and contraindications. Finally, smoking cessation should not only be an issue for MHSUs; if you smoke, maybe you should attempt to stop also? How effective is smoking cessation? One problem with smoking cessation is the rate of relapse once support has been withdrawn. Some people have repeated relapses before stopping and some people cannot stop at all. Raw et al. (2005) summarize the evidence around smoking cessation as follows: Nicotine replacement helps smokers unwilling or unable to stop achieve a sustained reduc- tion in cigarette consumption. This reduction is accompanied by a reduction in smoke intake. Smoking reduction using NRT increases motivation to stop smoking. Smoking reduction using NRT increases subsequent cessation. Practitioners should encourage and support MHSUs to stop smoking. Reiterate the positive benefits of stopping and get MHSUs to focus on these rather than dwell on relapse. This is very important for MHSUs who have respiratory conditions and smoke. You should also offer practical solutions when cravings arise. These include: educating MHSUs that cravings will arise and can be unpleasant; preparing MHSUs for cravings, e.g. draw on past experience; educating MHSUs that cravings can be overcome without recourse to smoking (e.g. suggest MHSUs chew a piece of gum or do something that will divert their thoughts); emphasizing the positive aspects of stopping; should relapse occur, this should be acknowl-edged but the emphasis remains on accentuating the positive. Box 6.10 ExerciseWith reference to your local policy, how would you refer someone for smoking cessation? Smoking cessation: the challenges and rewards The addictive nature of nicotine and subsequent unpleasantness of withdrawal can be a barrier to quitting. The added anxiety and stress of trying to cope without smoking may be a further deterrent. However, MHSUs are often excluded from health promotion serv - ices, so they may not benefit from smoking cessation services. Frequent relapses may be de-motivating and engender feelings of powerlessness. When individuals become dispir - ited, this may decrease their motivation to quit. This may reinforce the fatalist attitudes of practitioners or weaken the resolve of staff who are motivated to implement smoking cessation. Wild and Byrne (2006) suggest that the relationship between smoking and obesity is com- plex: smoking is associated with lower BMI, whereas smoking cessation is linked with weight gain. Therefore, a holistic lifestyle approach is important and should include diet and physical activity advice in conjunction with smoking cessation. Mental health units have been described as 'un-therapeutic' (Samarasekera 2007), so provid- ing a structured and meaningful day can be difficult. This is where physical health takes on a whole-organization approach rather than an individual MHSU-nurse interaction. If MHSUs Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Assessing respiratory health in mental health 125 are motivated to stop smoking, services should respond creatively. Banning smoking from premises is an approach, but it is flawed as people can smoke outside. Providing a structured day with various diversionary activities, support groups, healthy lifestyles groups, and exer-cise groups (e.g. a walking group) are some ways that might help. But these are difficult to institute without creativity and resources - not only financial but also with respect to staff skills. The rewards for stopping smoking are evident. These can be split into health-related gains and financial gains. The health-related gains include a reduced risk of worse health, since some damage may have already been done by the previous smoking history. We can calculate very crude financial costs of smoking. The UK prevalence of schizophrenia is 1 in 100 people (Royal College of Psychiatrists 2011). The UK adult population aged 18-60 years is 46 million (ONS 2005). The number of people with schizophrenia in this group is 460,000 (46,000,000/100 = 460,000). Estimates suggest smoking rates of 80 per cent in this group (McNeill 2001) (80 per cent of 460,000 = 368,000 people). If each person smoked 20 cigarettes a day, at \u00a34 pounds per packet, this amounts to (368,000 \u00d7 \u00a34) = \u00a31,472,000 per day, \u00a310,304,000 per week or \u00a3537,280,000 per year. UK duty on a pack of 20 cigarettes is 22 per cent of the retail price (HM Revenue and Customs 2006). Therefore, MHSUs who smoke contribute around \u00a3118,201,600 in UK tax (22 per cent of \u00a3537,280,000). Care planning Using Roper and colleagues' (1996) model of activities of daily living, we can devise and struc- ture a care plan for someone with a respiratory condition. The care plan will aim to restore - as close as possible - normal functioning. However, with physical conditions and the complex interaction of a matrix of factors, it is prudent to have an emergency contingency care plan. This will be important in specialties such as care of older people where prolonged bed rest due to a chest infection may increase risk of pressure sores or otherwise compromise skin integrity. Again our role in care planning will depend on the severity of the presentation but we will be in a position to screen for respiratory disorders and collaborate in an inter-professional care plan. Here our role will involve facilitating clinical observations, recording, documenting, and communicating these to the team, and liaising with the medical or specialist respiratory nurse practitioner. As there is a co-morbid presence of anxiety and depression with respiratory dis-orders, our role here will be as primary carer, looking after the mental and emotional health of MHSUs. Treating and managing respiratory illness Clinical priorities include: normalizing respiration rate; ensuring adequate oxygenation of the blood and tissues; preventing hypoxia; correcting the cause of/reducing the impact of respiratory disorders; ensuring compliance with treatment; continuous monitoring; preventing secondary risks such as skin breakdown in older/frail people, or exposure in cases of TB; smoking cessation using NRT.

Our aim is to restore as normal respiration rate as possible, given any respiratory tract damage. We also want to prevent/reduce the risk of hypoxia. We can achieve this by: monitoring baseline observations monitoring physical interventions such as medications evaluating the effectiveness of treatment prescribing oxygen therapy offering appropriate immunizations as a primary prevention of respiratory infections revisiting care plan if condition deteriorates Adapting the physical home environment is an important consideration for limiting the amount of physical exertion required when moving around. Installing a stair lift, using mobility aids (e.g. handrails and other supports), adapting showers, etc., could help minimize levels of physical exertion 2 Breathing Monitoring respirations is a core observation. With respiratory problems breathlessness is a clinical feature. Breathlessness can be anxiety-provoking due to the associated discomfort and its role as a reinforcing agent of illness. Breathing should also be monitored when the MHSU is asleep. Observations and interventions include: respiration rate presence of cyanosis pulse oximetry oxygen therapy posture when sitting or lying ABGs review of antipsychotic medications physiotherapy advice on exercise or removing excess sputum collecting sputum samples for pathology and assessing any cough 3 Communicating Care planning and treatment for respiratory problems can be very complex. Any instructions or explanations should: be jargon-free be easy to understand seek regular feedback to ensure comprehension seek clarification that things have been understood You should also reassure the MHSU to alleviate any anxiety. Encourage them to express feelings and develop psychological coping strategies, or acceptance of a physical illness. This will decrease anxiety as they find they can still have a social life as long as they are not overexerting. You should also try to establish if there are any peer support groups that they or their carers/family can attend in the community Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Set small and safe targets, for example: involve physiotherapy to develop an exercise plan walking short distances gradually increasing this encourage rest also and explore the best postures for optimal ventilation consider relaxation therapy to help the resting process and cope with stress encourage the use of walking aids (this might feel disempowering for the MHSU but our aim is to promote independence; emphasize that if they use aids appropriately, they will become more independent) (Also refer to maintaining a safe environment above) 5 Eating and drinking Diet may need to change, as in respiratory conditions weight gain or weight loss may occur. The dietitian can advise on appropriate diets in whichever circumstances but as a general rule diets should be well balanced: encourage fruit and fibre control calories to prevent/increase weight explore healthy cooking options/meal choices depending on level of independence use of food supplements such as Complan promote a low-salt diet reduce/stop alcohol intake Occupational therapy can help with cooking skills 6 Eliminating Levels of physical activity may reduce, so it is important to prevent elimination problems such as constipation (this is also a side-effect of antipsychotic medication) encourage adequate hydration introduce dietary changes to promote bowel function take bloods to monitor electrolytes 7 Personal cleansing and dressing In some cases, assistance may be required but the goal should be to promote independence. This will illustrate to the MHSU that they can still function normally ensure safety when bathing/showering as this can be tiring use shower seat aids to minimize exertion observe skin integrity - reduced oxygenation of blood may compromise skin integrity show respect for privacy and dignity 8 Maintaining body temperature Temperature should be monitored regularly if the respiratory condition is caused by an infection. If medication is given (e.g. paracetamol), temperature should be monitored to evaluate the effectiveness of this treat any infection ensure adequate hydration use a fan or cool flannel to reduce temperature (continued) Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Respiratory assessment is an important part of our work and we should be able to conduct a safe and thorough examination. A medical approach will be one aspect of the assessment but nurses should follow this up with a psycho-social assessment. The British Thoracic Society (2006) state that 44 per cent of all deaths from respiratory dis- ease are associated with social class inequalities. This presents a clear public health challenge to us, as MHSUs tend to come from the lower social classes. Therefore, assessment should also explore smoking behaviour and attitudes to stopping, living conditions, and supportive environments. As health promoters we must also remember that one in eight of all lung cancer cases are people who have never smoked a cigarette (UK Lung Cancer Coalition 2005). In the debate about the rights of smokers to smoke, we should remember that non-smokers are put at risk of developing respiratory disorders due to passive smoking. We need to increase our knowledge of pharmacology as a necessary by-product of the preva - lence of physical illness in MHSUs. Greater awareness of ADRs associated with treating respi - ratory conditions is needed. Practitioners should have appropriate training and the necessary Table 6.6 Factors you might consider when writing a care plan for someone suffering from a respiratory problem (Continued) Activity of daily living Example of care planning activity 9 Working and playing Refer to mobilizing above time off work may be required for those who are employed ensuring appropriate benefits are in situ, e.g. if homes have to be renovated to help mobility recreational activities may have to be less strenuous initially explore local self-help or support groups that might have social activities 10 Sleeping Sleep may be affected by breathing problems. We should observe for sleep difficulties and consider commencing a sleep chart use of extra pillows to assist breathing discourage sleeping during the day consider medication if required 11 Expressing sexuality Depending on the severity of the problem: sexual activity may decrease initially due to respiratory condition explain this to the MHSU and partner to promote understanding reassure that sexual activity will return but this will take some time 12 Dying MHSUs may be preoccupied with death or dying allow MHSUs to express fears reassure that with treatment and lifestyle changes life can still be enjoyed discuss fears of the future openly and discourage catastrophic thinking encourage joining a support group to get peer support palliative care may need to be considered depending on the severity and associated outcomes. At this stage MHSUs should be empowered to plan their death so that they retain control of their life. Advanced directives may be required, so you may have to seek legal advice and advocate for the MHSU's rights with this Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

However, there are major concerns about the nutritional health of populations. Whether it's food scares or the 'globesity' epidemic (WHO 2013a), diet, nutrition, and physical inactivity are never off the health or general media agendas. Evidence suggests that excessive consumption of energy-rich foods (e.g. processed foods, drinks containing saturated and transfats, sugars, and salt) encourages weight gain (WHO/FAO 2003). Table 7.1 illustrates the prevalence of obesity measured using BMI. In relation to the UK, we know that most adults in England are overweight; obesity contributes to around 6.8 per cent of deaths in England (House of Commons Health Committee 2004: 128) and increases the risk of developing other conditions. The UK National Audit Office (2001) sug - gest the relative risk for obese people of developing T2D is 5.2 for men and 12.7 for women - that is, obese men are 5.2 times more likely to develop T2D than non-obese men, obese women 12.7 times more likely than non-obese women. Lack of physical activity is also an important risk factor for obesity. In 2008, 39 per cent of men and 29 per cent of women Chapter contents Obesity in mental health Diabetes and metabolic syndrome Lifestyle risk factors and their conse- quences Nutrition and malnutrition Physical activity Promoting healthy lifestyles Learning outcomes By the end of this chapter, you will have: Explored the importance of nutrition, diet, and physical activity Examined the prevalence of obesity and diabetes in MHSUs Explored physical activity in MHSUs Defined obesity and examined risk factors Examined metabolic syndrome and its management Examined screening for metabolic condi- tions Box 7.1 ExerciseWhat is the prevalence of overweight and obesity in your MHSU group?

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 131 met government recommendations for physical activity in adults (Craig et al . 2009). Physical activity has been embraced worldwide by government and policy-makers as an important contributing factor to good health (WHO 2007). However, research shows that 35 per cent of all people in the WHO European Region are not physically active enough (WHO 2013b). Citrome and Vreeland (2009) state that obesity is one of the most common physical health problems in people with SMI. The prevalence of obesity among individuals with schizophrenia and affective disorders is estimated at 1.5-2 times higher than the general population (Ameri-can Diabetes Association et al. 2004). Table 7.1 outlines obesity prevalence in MHSUs. Obesity in MHSUs warrants special attention. Research on diet, obesity, and physical activ- ity in mental health shows the following: Lifestyle factors that cause obesity, such as low levels of exercise and poor diet, are present in people with mental illness (Brown et al. 1999). Kendrick (1996) found that of 101 people with serious mental illness living in the community 26 were clinically obese. McCreadie et al. (1998) found that people with schizophrenia made poor dietary choices characterized by a high-fat, low-fibre diet. In a survey of outpatients at two psychiatric centres in the USA, Daumit et al. (2005) found they were less physically active than the general population and those who were more inac-tive had fewer social contacts. Glover et al . (2013) found side-effects of medication, symptoms of illness, and exist - ing physical co-morbidities as barriers to exercise among people with serious mental illness. Reasons for high prevalence of obesity in mental health care Weight gain is a complex phenomenon in patients with schizophrenia, with a high-calorie diet, lack of physical activity, and appetite stimu lation being associated with antipsychotic medications (Das et al . 2012). Various factors can explain the high prevalence of obesity in MHSUs. These include social, health organization, and lifestyle factors together with ADRs (see Table 7.2). The poor nutrition, poor diet, and lack of physical activity in MHSUs are reflected in the general population - in this regard, MHSUs are quite 'normal'. However, MHSUs tend to be from the lower social class, thus they are more exposed to lifestyle risk factors as inequali - ties in health affect them disproportionately (see Chapter 1). Service users tend to live in more deprived areas, face increased social exclusion and unemployment, and lack mate - rial wealth. They do not have the same access to health education, health promotion, and Table 7.1 Prevalence of obesity measured using BMI Population prevalence of obesity Prevalence of obesity in MHSUs UK 22.7% 35% (Filik et al. 2006) (Dickerson et al. 2006) Australia 16.4% 34.1% (McLeod 2009) Europe 10-30% Unavailable Sources: WHO (2013a, 2013b) Note: Table 7.1 is obesity prevalence only.

For example, weighing someone is a simple procedure that gives a clinically useful measurement, yet the Royal College of Psychiatrists (2012) found only 56 per cent of service users reported having have been weighed in the previous 12 months. The result of the factors listed in Table 7.2 is that MHSUs have an increased risk of higher mortality and morbidity from physical conditions and their complications. Why? The debate is essentially balanced between poor lifestyle choices and ADRs. This chapter explores the impact of poor lifestyle choices on MHSUs' physical health. It starts with a recap of basic nutrition before moving onto obesity, physical activity, and diet and nutri - tion. It examines nutritional assessment and fluid balance before exploring diabetes and metabolic syndrome. It ends by exploring care planning for diet, nutrition, and obesity.Table 7.2 Reasons for high prevalence of obesity in MHSUs Low socio-economic status Increased exposure to inequalities of health and social exclusion Increased exposure to lifestyle risk factors Decreased access to/opportunity for health promotion and education ADRs resulting in weight gain Movement disorders preventing physical activity Obesity not taken seriously as a public health issueNegative symptoms impair ability to engage in physical activity programmesStigma - negative staff attitudes regarding ability to change lifestyle Source: Adapted from Nash (2010) Box 7.2 ExerciseWhat is the recommended daily calorie intake for (a) men and (b) women? Nutrients and nutrition Micronutrients enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones, and other substances essen - tial for proper growth and development (WHO 2013c). Nutrients include carbohydrates, pro - teins, vitamins, fats, and minerals. An overabundance or an inadequate supply of these can cause physical illness. The following outlines the main nutrient groups involved in a balanced diet. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates can be split into two main groups: Simple carbohydrates - sugars. Complex carbohydrates - starch. Carbohydrates are essential as an energy source. Carbohydrates are found in bread, potatoes, pasta, rice, and cereals, as these are generally high in starch. Carbohydrates make us feel full and because they release energy slowly, they avoid sudden drops in blood glucose that result in hunger pangs.

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 133 Proteins Proteins are composed of amino acids and are crucial for muscle, tissue, and organ growth and development. There are two main groups of amino acids: Non-essential amino-acids - these can be manufactured by the body. Essential amino acids - these cannot be manufactured by the body, so need to be consumed in our diet. Proteins are found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, and pulses such as lentils and chickpeas. Fats There are various types of fats: Saturated fats - found in animal fat. Unsaturated fats - these come in two forms; mono-saturated fats found in olives, and poly- unsaturated fats found in nuts and seeds. Triglycerides - fats found in meat, dairy products, and cooking oils. Cholesterol is produced by the body and ingested in our diet. It is found in milk, eggs, and meat. Cholesterol is an important risk factor for the development of heart disease. There are two key types (Kozier et al. 2008): High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are made up of protein and a small amount of fat. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are made up of fat and a small amount of proteins. High-density lipoproteins contain less fat and are referred to as 'good' cholesterol, whereas LDLs, which contain more fat, are known as 'bad' cholesterol. The National Cholesterol Educa- tion Program (NCEP 2002) in the USA states that the causes of low HDL cholesterol include: elevated serum triglycerides; overweight and obesity; physical inactivity; cigarette smoking; very high carbohydrate intakes (>60 per cent of total energy intake); T2D; certain blockers, anabolic steroids, progestational agents); factors. Omega-3 fatty acids Our body cannot manufacture omega-3, so we absorb it in our diet or through nutritional sup- plements. Oily fish such as salmon and tuna contain omega-3, which is rich in docosahexae-noic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA); DHA and EPA are key components of our eyes and brain (Ruxton 2004). Omega-3 has been used to treat a number of physical and mental illnesses. For example, it has been be used to reduce triglyceride levels and may also be used in conjunction with a statin to manage hyperlipidaemia (BNF 2013). Peet (2002) reports on a series of studies that used essential fatty acids such as omega-3 in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. Healy (2005: 69) also reports the use of omega-3 as an adjunct in clozapine therapy and offer a summary of evidence of the use of fish oils in schizophrenia. Vitamins and vitamin deficiency Vitamins are essential components of a healthy diet. Insufficient vitamin intake is associated with a number of physical conditions and sustained vitamin deficiency has serious implica-tions for physical health.

Water-soluble vitamins that cannot be stored by the body and so a daily supply is required (Kozier et al. 2008); examples include vitamin C and the B-complex vitamins B 1, B 2, and B12. Fat-soluble vitamins Vitamin A is found in eggs, fish, milk, and dairy products. It helps strengthen the immune system and it helps with vision as deficiency causes night-blindness. Vitamin D is found in eggs, liver, and fish; it also synthesizes in the body naturally from sunlight. Vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets, a bone disorder. Vitamin E is found in oils such as olive oil. It is also found in cereals containing nuts and wholegrain wheat in bread. Vitamin E helps to protect cell membranes by acting as an anti-oxidant (Food Standards Agency undated). Vitamin E deficiency can lead to neuromuscu-lar, vascular, and reproductive systems problems (Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 2003). Vitamin K is found in green vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli. The body requires vitamin K for effective clotting of the blood and a deficiency results in excessive bleeding (Ingham and O'Reilly 2005). Water-soluble vitamins Vitamin B 1, or thiamin, is found in cereals, vegetables, wholegrain bread, and fruit. Thiamin deficiency can cause beriberi, which affects the nervous system. Symptoms include lethargy and fatigue. In chronic alcohol abuse, a lack of thiamin leads to Wernicke-Korsakoff Syn - drome, a form of brain damage (Alcohol Concern 2003). This is normally irreversible. Vitamin B 12 is found in meat products, fish, and dairy products. Deficiency can lead to anaemia and neurological damage (Ingham and O'Reilly 2005). High levels of alcohol con-sumption can also lead to vitamin B 12 deficiency. Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is found in citrus fruits and broccoli. Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy. Scurvy is characterized by swollen, bleeding gums and a rash of tiny bleed-ing spots around the hair follicles (McFerran 2008). Minerals These are nutrients that the body needs to develop and sustain many key functions. Minerals that we require in recommended daily amounts include sodium, potassium, iron, and calcium. Minerals play a key role in electrolyte balance, cardiovascular function, bone development, and metabolism. A healthy diet will entail having a good balance of the nutrients outlined above. However, food preparation is also important. While potatoes may be a good source of carbohydrates, chips will be high in fat content. Food preparation is an important behavioural factor and we should be encouraging a move away from eating predominantly fried foods to foods that are grilled or steamed. Box 7.3 Case example Mohammed is concerned about his nutrition. He has asked your advice on which vitamin supplements to take. How would you advise him?

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 135 It is not unusual for MHSUs to ask questions about nutritional or vitamin supplements. You will need to have some basic knowledge about the role of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in diet. However, vitamin, mineral, and nutritional supplements are a bit trickier and we should not immediately assume that supplements are required. For example, a mental health dieti-tian may advise increasing or introducing different foodstuffs that serve a similar function to supplements. Occupational therapists may offer advice on preparing foodstuffs so that maxi-mum nutritional value can be gained from them. Some supplements or vitamin preparations may need to be prescribed by a doctor (e.g. Pabrinex \u00ae) for service users experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal, or supplements for frail elderly and anorexic service users. Meeting the nutritional needs of all service users is one of many areas where the MHN will need to exercise their team-working and liaison skills. Obesity Obesity is an excess of body fat. Recent news media reports of an obesity epidemic have prompted fear and debate in wider society and government departments. Obesity and being overweight are serious public health concerns due to their association with increased physical illness and death. Preventing obesity is a key public health aim, as it reduces mortality and morbidity and the health services save financially. Diseases and conditions associated with obesity include (NICE 2006d): sleep apnoea; respiratory disease; breathlessness; musculoskeletal problems, e.g. bad back; oedema/cellulitis. There are three ways in which we can monitor weight gain and obesity in MHSUs: (1) BMI, (2) waist circumference, and (3) waist-to-hip ratio (see Chapter 4). The target BMI is 21-23 kg/m2 according to the World Cancer Research Fund (2007). Therefore, we could set the target BMI for our MHSUs at the higher end of this estimate (i.e. 23 kg/m2) due to the possibility of ADRs. While this represents a goal to aim for, our objective should also include integrating healthy eating, increasing physical activity, and reducing alcohol consumption and smoking as part of a wider healthier lifestyle strategy. Using the BMI score is not without controversy. An athlete may have a BMI of 35 kg/m 2 but they are unlikely to be obese, since they will exhibit lean muscle rather than body fat. Dough-erty and Lister (2008) also comment that an apparently normal weight may mask muscle wast-ing. When monitoring weight, you might also ask 'clothes fit questions'. For example: Nurse: You weight 15\u00bd stones, is that usual? Abdul: No, I've put on weight recently. Nurse: What is your normal weight? Abdul: Around 12\u00bd stones. Nurse: Are the clothes you are wearing now your normal size? Abdul: No, I've gone up two sizes. Nurse: What is your usual waist size? Abdul: 32 inches. Nurse: What is it now? Abdul: 36 inches. Nurse: When were you last your usual weight? Abdul: About four months ago. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

It may also highlight a social problem - does Abdul have enough money to spend on clothes that only fit for a short period of time? What can we do to help him in this respect? Box 7.4 ExerciseHow can we help MHSUs, such as Abdul, with similar social problems that impact physical health? Relevance of obesity to mental health Tackling obesity is an important priority because it is an important public health concern. Weight gain and obesity contribute to cardiorespiratory disorders and are risk factors associ-ated with CHD, hypertension, T2D, cancer, and high blood cholesterol. Obesity also increases mortality and morbidity in MHSUs. Adverse drug reactions are also an important consideration. Weight gain and obesity are linked to many psychotropic drugs (see Chapter 8). This factor makes tackling obesity more complicated where the clinical decision between the MHSU's mental health (psychosis) and physical health (obesity) is a fine balance. Healy (2005) suggests that the cosmetic side-effect of weight gain is treated as trivial by practitioners who believe that dopamine-related side-effects are more important. Mental health nurses need to consider whether it is ethical to permit medication that causes obesity and severe weight gain to be prescribed without robust proce - dures for managing obesity, including discontinuation of medication. Obesity is a serious risk factor and one that we cannot afford to take lightly if MHSUs are to have a good quality of life. Trying to establish the exact causal link between obesity in MHSUs may lead clinicians to delay interventions until the 'evidence' can be generated. However, our duty of care to MHSUs must include their physical health as well as their mental health. Tackling obesity can produce important mental health benefits such as increased self-esteem and compliance with medica-tion. It should be adopted as routine clinical practice. Mental health nurses should not allow the perceived inevitability of weight gain to become a barrier to dietary or physical activity interventions. Assessing and managing obesity In a review of effectiveness of weight management interventions, Lowe and Lubos (2008) paint a disheartening picture. Based on current evidence, the effectiveness of psycho-educational interventions and programmes including educational and exercise components is limited. It is not surprising there is limited evidence, given the neglected state of physical health in general and of exercise as an intervention in particular (Callaghan 2004). We require systems for identifying risk factors and screening MHSUs for physical condi- tions. These systems will prioritize primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions. A case example for obesity is illustrated below. Box 7.5 Case example Screening for obesity risk factors Rationale Obesity is prevalent in MHSUs because of lifestyle factors and ADRs. Reducing obesity is a key government health aim and NICE (2006d) has a clinical guideline on obesity that can guide best practice.

This should be realistic, taking into account the realities faced by the MHSU. It should focus on small, achievable, measurable goals. This provides the MHSU with evidence of achievement, which can increase motivation and self-esteem. Care plans should be designed to reduce weight or, in the case of ADRs, slow down the rate at which weight is gained. Interventions will depend on the severity of obesity or weight gain and any associated complications. The care plan should be clearly documented and reviewed according to local and professional standards. Aims To reduce weight safely and restore a healthy BMI. A maximum weekly weight loss of 0.5-1.0 kg with an end goal of losing 5-10 per cent of original weight is recommended (NICE 2006d). Increase physical activity. A structured, active day will minimize the likelihood of boredom, which might result in snacking and may even contribute to reducing smoking. Activity pro- grammes must be safe for MHSUs and include activities they enjoy.Process Identify MHSUs at risk: MHSUs with a may be overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) but have other risk factors, e.g. T2D, or dyslipidaemia; MHSUs with a being commenced on 'high-risk' atypical antipsychotics. Risk factors in obesity The following risk factors should be screened and recorded, together with their status (present, absent or not known): dyslipidaemia; diabetes; other physical conditions; family history of diabetes or cardiovascular illness; current medication; estimated current calorie intake; estimated salt intake; ethnicity; smoking habit; current alcohol intake; current exercise levels. Service users may have a combination of risk factors that could increase their risk of compli- cations of obesity, so interventions should be targeted to manage this. Service users' fam-ily history should also be recorded to determine if coronary or metabolic conditions could be present, as this adds further complexity to management. Mental health nurses should then engage MHSUs in lifestyle interventions, which are a primary intervention target for reducing the gap in physical health between MHSUs and the general population (Scott and Happell 2011).

Changes should be planned and staged rather than 'all or nothing', as non-achievement may reduce motivation. Implementation Health education and promotion around lifestyle, diet, and activity. Referral to a specialist mental health dietitian for a weight management plan and advice about a calorie-controlled diet. General dietary advice, including: controlling calorie intake - an average man needs around 2500 calories a day and an average woman around 2000 calories a day; these values can vary depending on age and level of physical activity, among other factors (NHS Choices 2012c); increase fruit and fibre intake; reduce salt intake; reduce saturated fat intake; reduce alcohol and tobacco intake. Referral to occupational therapy for advice on food preparation. Increasing physical activity Baseline observations should be monitored regularly. Introduce gradual and realistic activities, as overweight MHSUs may be limited in their phys - ical ability, e.g. introduce light exercise such as brisk walking building up to light jogging. Set measurable goals, e.g. begin with 15 minutes walking five times per week and build this up as stamina increases. Measurements such as these can be used to increase confidence and sense of achievement. Introduce to peer exercise groups for peer support and encouragement. Encourage MHSUs to be more active, e.g. taking stairs instead of lifts. Ensure MHSUs also rest adequately to avoid 'burnout'. Refer to the GP (for community MHSUs) for primary care management, e.g. prescription for exercise. There may also be a 'Well Men' or 'Well Women' group in primary care that service users can access. Psychological support Set realistic and measurable goals that increase confidence and self-esteem. Keep a food diary to adhere to set diet. Change attitudes towards food or drink preparation, e.g. to limit sugar intake, reduce con- sumption of fried foods. Develop problem-solving skills so that MHSUs have the resources required to sustain a healthy lifestyle. Develop links and contacts with self-help and peer support networks. Include family/carer who can also offer support and encouragement at home. Weight fluctuates, so if weight gain occurs explain this as natural and not a sign of failure. This should be expressed as another challenge, recognizing the MHSU's reality. Pharmacological treatment Pharmacological treatment should be evidence-based. For example, NICE (2006d) guidance recommends that Orlistat should be prescribed only as part of an overall plan for managing obesity in adults who meet one of the following criteria: BMI of 28.0 kg/m2 or more with associated risk factors, BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 or more.

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 139 Statin therapy is the 'gold standard' for reducing cholesterol levels, as it reduces the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver and stimulates the removal of LDL cholesterol from the circulation (Evered 2007). Statins should also be considered to lower cholesterol. These inter-ventions should also be considered for inpatients, who ought not to have to wait until dis-charge to get this from their GP. Mental health nurses should be aware of adverse reactions and contraindications of such drugs when prescribed alongside psychotropic medications. In extreme cases The guidance from NICE includes bariatric surgery as an intervention when everything else has failed to combat weight gain. Although Ahmed et al. (2011: 389) state that bariatric surgery is a uniquely effective intervention for achieving and sustaining significant weight loss and improving metabolic parameters, MHSUs have limited access to this intervention. Little litera-ture exists regarding its use in MHSUs with obesity. However, Lawlor and Rand (1986) found that schizophrenia in remission did not appear to be a contraindication for surgery. Evaluation Regular review will include: Measurable targets, used in a before-and-after comparison: BMI, or waist-to-hip ratio; BP; levels; MHSU subjective feelings of wellness, mood, self-esteem; Regular physical checks to screen for associated complications, e.g. BMI or blood tests for diabetes. Review of antipsychotic medication if this is directly implicated in weight gain. Regular review of the care plan, taking into account additional information from MHSU and carers. Regular evaluation will be undertaken as a matter of routine. However, a review is also conducted if medication regimes change or increase, if other physical complications occur, or if existing complications worsen. The role of community practitioners will include liaison and support with primary care teams. To monitor physical health, NICE (2009a) recommends joint care plans and the organization and development of practice case registers for MHSUs with schizophrenia. Community practitioners can liaise and help GPs, practice or district nurses in developing and auditing the effectiveness of such registers. Physical activity Box 7.6 ExerciseWhat are the barriers to physical activity faced by your MHSUs? Physical activity has the capacity not only to add years to life, but to bring life to years - through reduced risk of mental disorders, improved quality of life and psychological well-being (DH 2004). Together with diet and nutrition, it is an important aspect of a healthy lifestyle. However, the prevalence of physical inactivity is high in the UK general population as well as MHSUs. This constitutes a challenge to practitioners who may have to motivate, support, and encourage MHSUs who have severe negative symptoms to exercise.

In the UK, NICE (2007b) guidance on depression states that all patients with mild depression should be advised of the benefits of following a structured and supervised exercise programme. Department of Health (DH 2011) physical activity guidelines for adults in the UK recommend at least 150 minutes (2\u00bd hours) of moderate-intensity activity in bouts of 10 minutes or more over a week. This amounts to 30 minutes on at least five days a week (see Table 7.3). However, the BHF (2012) found low percentages of adults attaining this target: in Scotland, 45 per cent of men reported meeting this target, compared with 39 per cent in England, 37 per cent in Wales, and 33 per cent in Northern Ireland. Physical activity, therefore, is an important factor in mental well-being. Basic guidelines from NICE (2006d) provide when incorporating physical activity into a healthy living plan, including: undertaking enjoyable activities, such as walking, cycling, swimming, aerobics and garden- ing - part of everyday life. minimizing sedentary activities, such as sitting for long periods watching television, at a computer screen or playing video games. building activity into the working day - for example, use stairs instead of the lift, take a walk at lunchtime. It is important that physical activity is tailored to each MHSU's specific needs and capabilities. We must ensure that any exercise plan involves the MHSU and is targeted to meet their wishes and needs. This will involve ensuring their physical safety as well as physical health. This may involve input from a physiotherapist or qualified sports therapist in order that exercise plans take into account individual MHSU needs, for example, safe exercise for MHSUs with move-ment disorders. Assessing capability for physical activity Service users should undergo an assessment before commencing an exercise programme. This is a routine requirement of all gyms. If exercise machines or other sports equipment is to be used, MHSUs should have a thorough induction to prevent accidental injury. A pre-exercise assessment will highlight factors that need to be considered when tailoring an exercise pro-gramme, such as those listed in Table 7.4. Goals for physical activity must be realistic, achievable, and measurable; for example, 15 minutes of light exercise is realistic, achievable, and measurable. Setting achievable goals will increase self-confidence. If goals are unrealistic, not achieving them can be demotivating. A good way of socializing for MHSUs is going on group walks. Although initially daunting, the increased socializing can increase self-confidence and stamina with the added benefit of informal support from others. While exercise has been shown to improve lipid profiles, glucose tolerance, obesity, and hypertension (Connolly and Kelly 2005), Callaghan (2004) notes that exercise is a neglected intervention in mental health care. He further notes little or no mention of exer - cise as a treatment option in most standard mental health/illness texts or reports published by authoritative groups in mental health. Promoting exercise as a non-pharmacological intervention for both physical and mental health problems is a major challenge for practi - tioners.

Exercise referral programmes are used in the UK to promote physical activity. The most common model of exercise referral system is when the GP or practice nurse refers patients to local leisure centres for supervised exercise programmes (DH 2001a). Practi - tioners should act as advocates for MHSUs to ensure they also have access to such programmes.Table 7.4 Example tool for assessing capability for physical activity Factors Potential risk Age Cardiovascular Respiratory Current diabetes status Other physical conditions Current medication Smoking status Musculoskeletal function Current alcohol intake Current exercise levels Physical disability ADRs Box 7.7 ExerciseWhat are the challenges to implementing a healthy eating programme for your MHSU group? How might you overcome these? Diet and nutrition Positive action on diet and nutrition contributes to a reduction in preventable deaths from cancer, CHD, and stroke (DH 2002). The UK Government has embarked on health education and promotion initiatives designed to educate the general public about healthy eating. These include '5 a day' - eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day could reduce the risk of deaths from heart disease, stroke, and cancer by up to 20 per cent; and advocating a salt intake of no more than 6 g per day (DH 2013). Relevance to mental health Service users tend to have poor diets characterized by high fat and low fibre (McCreadie et al. 1998; Brown et al. 1999). McCreadie (2003) also found that people with serious mental illness consumed as few as 16 portions of fruit and vegetables per week; the recommendation of the Department of Health (DH 2003) is five a day (i.e. 35 a week). Social factors such as poor finances, lack of motivation, and poor knowledge of healthy eating choices are partly responsible, just as in the general population.

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 143 Aims of a healthy diet Service users and staff should be aware that the aims of a healthy diet are more than just aes- thetic. The choice of foods and changed eating habits are very important. However, MHSUs should be reassured that they can still enjoy a range of foods albeit their preparation may have to change, e.g. using low-salt and low-sugar alternatives. Examples of measurable goals include: to achieve and maintain glucose control (a normal blood glucose range); to achieve and maintain a healthy BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2); to achieve and maintain a normal cholesterol level, i.e. <5 mmol/L for total cholesterol and 3 mmol/L for LDL cholesterol (DH 2000); to have a normal BP and pulse range; the BHF (2012: 10) suggests a target BP below 140/90 mmHg, or if the MHSU has a condition such as diabetes or CHD, a target BP below 130/80 mmHg. General dietary advice Service users should be encouraged to eat regular meals. Carbohydrates should be a part of each meal, as these release energy slowly and keep blood glucose levels stable. This reduces feelings of hunger and the need to snack. High sugar intake should be avoided; for example, high-calorie drinks and snacks should be replaced with sugar-free alternatives and fruit. One teaspoon contains 5 g of sugar (Peet and Stokes 2005), so intake in tea/coffee should be lim- ited. Sugary snacks such as biscuits, sweets, and chocolate should be reduced. This may entail a behaviour change in that MHSUs may eat two or three biscuits with a cup of tea or coffee (containing two or three sugars). If they have five cups of coffee or tea a day, this equates to one packet of biscuits - on top of their other meals. Food preparation should include changing from lard to sunflower oil for frying. Foods should be grilled or steamed to reduce cooking with fats. Reducing fried food and take-away food is important, especially in MHSUs with cardiovascular problems or diabetes. Crisps and nuts may be high in both salt and fat content and should be avoided. Dairy products should be fat-free or reduced fat (e.g. skimmed or semi-skimmed milk). Reducing salt is an effective way of reducing the risk of hypertension. If salt is used in cook- ing, it should not be used again at the table (double dosing). Processed foods and ready meals should be discouraged, as they may have a high salt content: 6 g of salt equates to approxi-mately one teaspoon. Service users should be encouraged to eat more vegetables and fruit, aiming for a mixture of at least five portions a day. Food labels can indicate the portion value, but one portion is usually one apple, pear or banana. Fruit juices also count. However, labels should be checked, as although it might indicate a portion it may also be high in sugar or salt. Recommended strategies from NICE (2006d) include: Eating plenty of fibre-rich foods, such as oats, beans, peas, lentils, grains, seeds, fruit, and vegetables, as well as wholegrain bread, and brown rice and pasta. Eating a low-fat diet and avoiding increases in fat and/or calorie intake. Eating breakfast. Watching the portion size of meals and snacks, and how often you are eating. For adults, minimizing the calories from alcohol. Effects of adverse drug reactions on diet and nutrition Adverse drug reactions can have consequences for diet and nutrition. The BNF side-effect profiles for a range of psychotropic drugs state that weight gain is a potential consequence of those medications. However, adverse reactions can be very subtle and not as obvious as Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The complicating effects of antipsychotics on nutrition include (Muir-Cochrane 2006): Anticholinergic potency leading to dry mouth, increased thirst, and increased fluid intake. Hormone system effects leading to fluid retention, thyroid, renal, and liver function problems. Effects on swallowing that compromise nutrition include confusion, delirium, cough, oesophageal ulceration, changes in olfaction and taste, sedation, and inattention. Cultural and religious factors There are important social determinants in health that go beyond the stereotyped views of the Irish and potatoes or Italians and pasta. Culture and tradition can be powerful influences on nutrition, including food choices and food preparation. Values and beliefs can have an impact on nutritional state; for example, a vegan or vegetarian diet may increase body alkaline con-tent, which can be detected during urinalysis testing. During some religious festivals, observances such as fasting are required. There are certain days of fasting and abstinence in the Catholic faith where apart from water and medication only one full meal, not containing meat, may be consumed in a 24-hour period. In the Muslim faith, Ramadan is a holy month during which fasting is required from dawn to sunset. While people with physical illness can be pardoned from these observances, they may want to par-ticipate in them as a matter of faith. Al-Arouj et al. (2010) offer a comprehensive article on fasting during Ramadan and state that the risks associated with fasting in diabetes include hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, dehydration, and thrombosis. Service users with diabetes who want to fast as part of their religion observance will require a pre-fast medical and close observation during the fast. The role of the practitioner here is to support and advocate for the MHSU. Practitioners need to involve the dietitian and doctor who can advise on foodstuffs to maintain adequate blood glucose levels and modifications to insulin therapy. The inter-professional team will need to discuss the implications for MHSUs with dia-betes who want to fast and this should involve input from the MHSU's Imam or appropriate spiritual leader. General assessment of nutritional state Nutritional assessment aims to increase the client's awareness of a balanced diet, including fluid balance, and to educate them as to healthy eating. It will also highlight deficiencies for which dietary supplements are required. There may be a misleading perception that nutri-tional assessment is more pertinent in areas such as eating disorders or care of older people. Nutritional assessment is an important aspect of a healthy living programme that should be afforded to all clients, especially those who are at risk of becoming either malnourished or overweight/obese. Malnourishment Lean and Wiseman (2008) found that the number of malnourished people leaving NHS hospi- tals in England reached almost 140,000 in 2006-7, yet despite this prevalence malnutrition was undiagnosed in up to 70 per cent of patients. They suggest that screening tools are not used routinely and this lack of assessment is a contributing factor in the undiagnosis of malnour-ishment. Holmes (2004) suggests that complications associated with malnourishment cost the NHS around \u00a370 million per year. Malnourishment is an important part of nutritional screening. It is important that dietitians, especially those experienced in mental health, are involved, as they will already be aware of the specific key issues. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) is commonly used in practice to assess malnutrition.

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 145 Enteral Nutrition (BAPEN 2008), a risk score is calculated using the client's BMI, unintentional weight loss, and illness score. This leads to a low-, medium- or high-risk malnutrition score and advice is given on interventions and treatment. Skills for assessing nutritional state Core skills include: observation; inspection; palpation. Underweight/obesity may be identifiable by a person's appearance. However, BMI or other measurements should be calculated to confirm your observations. Inspection will be required when assessing oral health and palpation when assessing oedema. Client privacy and dignity should always be respected (see Table 7.5). Box 7.8 Case example Jane has been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. She is 16 years old. She has been trans- ferred to your ward from a medical ward in the local general hospital where she was admit-ted due to severe low weight (BMI of 15.5 kg/m 2). Which physical health factors will you give priority to in the physical assessment? Weight loss The prevalence of being overweight or obese in MHSUs may detract our attention away from individuals whose weight loss is part of their physical presentation, such as in diabetes or can-cer. In hypomania, increased physical activity may contribute to weight loss, since individuals may be 'too busy to eat'; in severe depression, appetite and fluid intake may be very restricted; and in the care of older people, weight loss may occur due to dysphagia (problems swallow- ing) following stroke. In these instances, individuals experience unintentional weight loss (i.e. not dieting or exercising to reduce weight, but weight loss still occurs). Physical causes of weight loss should be fully investigated so that primary physical causes can be treated. Certain mental health conditions have intentional weight loss as a clinical feature. In ano- rexia nervosa, a low weight is maintained as a result of a preoccupation with body weight (NICE 2004b). In anorexia, individuals make a conscious effort to keep weight low. This can result from severely restricted food intake, vomiting, laxative abuse or diuretic use, high levels of physical activity or a combination of these. Physical effects of poor nutrition in anorexia nervosa Reduced fluid intake and purging behaviour can lead to physical complications such as dehy- dration and electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalaemia (reduced potassium levels). As anorexia can cause heart muscle wasting, low potassium levels can lead to coronary compli-cations such as cardiac arrhythmias. Severe bouts of vomiting can produce small tears in the oesophagus, which can cause bleeding, while the regurgitation of food with stomach acid may lead to dental erosion and changes to the pH balance in the mouth. Table 7.6 outlines some effects of starvation in anorexia nervosa. The next section will examine the physical effects of weight loss in anorexia. However, com- bined with the general approach above, practitioners in non-eating disorder fields should get a sense of the types of physical assessment and treatment interventions required for very under-weight MHSUs (e.g. those working in the speciality of care of older people).

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 147 In anorexia, as with all weight loss, the initial physical assessment is important for a number of reasons: to determine the severity of weight loss; to determine if weight loss is due to a physical illness (e.g. Type 1 diabetes); to determine the presence of complications and their extent; to provide baseline evidence for future comparison. Clinical measurements that may be used in assessment are outlined in Table 7.7.Table 7.6 Effects of starvation in anorexia nervosa Amenorrhoea (women) Lack of sexual interest or potency (men)Infertility (both) Muscle loss - including cardiac muscle Decreased bone density Growth impairment Poor oral health Reduced brain volume Source: Adapted from NICE (2004b) Table 7.7 Clinical measurements in assessing and monitoring anorexia nervosa Measurements Comments Weight Being underweight is represented by a BMI below 18.50 kg/m2 (see Table 4.19). However, in anorexia a BMI of below 17.5 kg/m2 is a diagnostic criterion (NICE 2004b). Severe thinness (a BMI below 16 kg/m2) can be observed in anorexia, while the Royal College of Psychiatrists and Royal College of Physicians (2010) have a clinical guideline for patients with severe anorexia nervosa (BMI <15 kg/m2). Body mass index may be monitored monthly and weight may be measured more than once daily (to detect large intakes of water to mask true weight) Anthropometry Anthropometry is the estimate of body fat. There are more than 19 sites for measuring skinfold thickness. Wang et al. (2000) suggest that skinfold thickness is accepted as a body fatness predictor for two reasons: about 40-60 per cent of total body fat is in the subcutaneous region of the body, and skinfold thickness can be directly measured using a special caliper Baseline observationsCardiovascular - BP and pulse, ECG Respiration - for metabolic acidosisTemperature (hypothermia may be present in weight loss), examination of peripheral circulation (cold fingertips) Blood tests FBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urea and electrolytes (low sodium levels may indicate high water intake and low potassium levels may indicate purging), kidney function, creatinine (to assess muscle breakdown), iron (to assess anaemia), liver function, random blood glucose (to assess glucose control), calcium (to assess deficiency), thyroid function Urinalysis Monitor electrolytes, presence of ketones and protein, record fluid intake and output also Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Practitioners should liaise very closely with diabetes specialists in developing joint care plans in these circumstances. We should also be aware that individuals with anorexia may perform covert exercise to keep weight down. As anorexia impacts on muscle and bone growth and heart muscle, excessive exercise can lead to further complications. To prevent covert exercise, individuals may be placed on a level of observation that reduces their opportunity to engage in exercise. Management of weight loss Severe weight loss and malnutrition can cause conditions such as hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, and thiamine deficiency. In extreme cases, complications can be fatal, thus monitoring physical health in weight loss is very important. The first step for practitioners in physical management is increasing weight. However, this is not what individuals with anorexia will want. Physical man - agement should go hand in hand with psychological management to allow individuals to vent their feelings about weight gain so that these do not impede the physical management. The main priority is to return the MHSU to a BMI within the normal range as safely as possible. Guidance from NICE (2004b) is an average weekly weight gain of 0.5-1.0 kg in inpatient settings and 0.5 kg in outpatient settings - about 3500-7000 extra calories a week. Weight gain needs to be calibrated so that the person does not suffer complications such as re-feeding syndrome - potentially fatal shifts in fluids and electrolytes that may occur in malnourished patients receiving artificial re-feeding (Mehanna et al. 2008). Readers are directed to NICE (2004b) for more specialist information. The process of facilitating weight gain will be dependent on the severity of weight loss. For example, using the BMI scale, someone moderately underweight may still be able to drink (e.g. supplements), eat, and chew, so oral intake may not be compromised. However, someone extremely underweight may require more invasive measures to ensure weight gain and hydra-tion - IV supplements or a naso-gastric tube. Intravenous feeding In total parenteral nutrition, the individual receives nutrition intravenously (by a 'drip'). The IV line will contain a mixture of essential foodstuffs such as glucose, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. When IV fluids are used, practitioners should be conscious of infection control and safety issues (e.g. needle stick injury, pulling out of or intentional damage to the IV line). One should also observe for complications of IV lines, such as phlebitis - inflammation at the site of the IV cannula or 'tissuing', where the IV infusion leaks into the surrounding tissue, causing localized pain and swelling. Naso-gastric tube Another possible intervention may be the use of a naso-gastric feeding tube. Here a soft, hol- low, plastic tube is passed into the nasal cavity, down the back of the throat, and into the stomach. It is used to assist feeding in the early stages of recovery. It is important the tube has passed into the stomach and not the lungs. To check this, we aspirate about 5-10 mL of stom-ach content using a syringe and test it using a pH strip. This will indicate whether the tube is in the stomach and prescribed feeding can begin. An inter-professional team approach Malnutrition affects all body systems, so managing physical health in malnourished individu- als requires an inter-professional approach; for example, a cardiologist or diabetologist may Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 149 be required if physical complications occur due to weight loss. A specialist mental health dieti- tian should be consulted regarding malnutrition and any nutritional supplements that may be required. They will also be able to give the service user individually tailored information and an eating plan. Good links will also need to be made with the GP team providing primary care so that there is continuity of care following discharge. With so many different people involved, care becomes very complex, thus it is important for MHNs to liaise effectively across differ-ent boundaries to ensure that physical health checks and other investigations are being com-pleted. Mental health nurses need to effectively monitor the results of different clinical tests (e.g. blood tests) and report any abnormal values to the treating consultant. Social assessment Poverty is a significant cause of poor dietary choices. It may be that service users eat to feel full rather than being able to afford to eat well. Due to the effects of their illness (e.g. poor concentration, social isolation or lack of motivation), MHSUs may not have the appropriate social skills to cook for themselves. Therefore, they may choose convenience foods that are very high in fat, salt, and calorie content and low on fruit and vegetables. Service users may not be able to afford to make healthy food choices if they are not claim - ing the benefits which they are eligible for. This not only affects food choice but also food preparation, as MSHUs may not have the facilities or utensils to cook their own food. A ben - efits assessment might increase the MSHU's monthly income, and the practitioner could then educate and promote healthy food choices. Barriers to lifestyle change that NICE (2006d) suggest include: lack of knowledge about buying and cooking food, and how diet and exercise affect health; the cost and availability of healthy foods and opportunities for exercise; the views of family and community members; low levels of fitness, or disabilities; low self-esteem and lack of assertiveness. Fluid balance Fluid balance is an important homeostatic activity. Fluids are either extracellular (outside cells) or intracellular (inside cells). Fluid balance is maintained through adequate intake and output. The kidneys are the main organs regulating fluid balance and they must produce a minimum of 500-600 mL of urine in 24 hours, although normal urinary output is much higher than this (S.F. Smith et al. 2008). The UK Department of Health recommends an intake of 1.2 L of fluid (6-8 glasses) every day (NHS Choices 2013a). Factors that taking/abusing diuretics; ADRs. Fluid imbalance may occur due to decreased intake, or increased output. Electrolyte imbal- ance, where toxins that need to be expelled are retained in the body, is a complication. Electro- lyte imbalance can lead to delirium and confusion, which in some MHSU groups may be mistaken for symptoms of the mental illness (e.g. dementia). However, this can be a life-threatening event and in vulnerable MHSUs should be closely monitored. Urinalysis will help indicate potential fluid balance problems.

Symptoms of dehydration include: thirst; dry mouth; dried or chapped urine output; concentrated urine; tachycardia; confusion. Dehydrated MHSUs should be placed on a fluid balance chart to monitor input and output. All ingested fluids, either orally or by IV infusion, should be recorded against outputs. Out-puts should be safely collected using a bedpan, urinal bottle or catheter and measured. Local infection control and disposal of clinical waste policy should be followed. If a urinalysis test is done, it should be remembered that stale urine may give a false-positive reading for high pH or bilirubinuria. Remember to respect the MHSU's dignity during the process of collecting outputs. If a service user is catheterized, the catheter bag will have a measurement scale. It is very important that measurements are accurately recorded and documented. Diuretics may be prescribed for MHSUs with cardiovascular problems so that excess fluids can be expelled from the body. This should be considered if a MHSU complains of frequency of micturition. If they do not take diuretics and complain of frequency of micturation, this might be a sign of diabetes mellitus. Over-hydration may occur due to (Scales and Pilsworth 2008): polydipsia (in diabetes); heart failure; renal impairment; liver disease. Another cause of over-hydration is a phenomenon whereby an individual develops a compul-sion to drink water in excess. Singh et al. (1985) report a case of a service user with delusional beliefs who drank excessive amounts of water as a religious offering. Over-hydration can lead to water intoxication, which is different to polydipsia as described earlier, but more akin to dipsomania - a compulsion to drink alcohol to excess (see Ferrier 1985). Over-hydration can lead to hyponatraemia, a condition in which there are low levels of sodium in the blood due to dilution by excess water intake. However, severe vomiting or diarrhoea can also cause it. Treating over-hydration will depend on the primary cause. If it is secondary to a heart con- dition, then the heart condition should be effectively treated and managed. This may include the prescription of a diuretic to help with elimination of excess fluids. If the cause is related to diabetes mellitus, then this will also require treatment. Box 7.9 ExerciseIn relation to your MHSU group, what would you describe as the main challenges regarding nutrition and diet? Diabetes Homeostasis of glucose control Diabetes occurs due to an imbalance in the levels of glucose and insulin in the blood. The Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas have alpha and beta cells.

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 151 which functions to increase the blood level of glucose, and the beta cells secrete 'insulin', which functions to decrease blood levels of glucose and increase utilization of glucose. Blood glucose levels control secretion of glucagon and insulin. Having a balanced diet is important for maintaining effective diabetes control, as it will help to maintain blood glucose within a set target range and reduce the risk of complications such as hypoglycaemic coma. Good nutrition will also reduce the risk of complications of diabetes. What we know about diabetes Diabetes, especially T2D, has reached epidemic proportions in Western societies. It is a major public health concern, especially in people at younger ages. In 2000, the WHO (2000) estimated the global prevalence of diabetes in adults aged 25+ years in 2008 to be 10 per cent, around 347 million people (WHO 2013d). In a national context, the prevalence of diabetes in the UK is 4.45 per cent, around 2.9 million people and by 2025 it is estimated that 5 million people will have diabetes in the UK (Diabetes UK 2012a). However, T2D is largely a 'silent' illness and there may be up to a mil - lion people unaware that they have it. Holt (2005) suggests that the onset of diabetes pre-dates actual diagnosis by around a decade. Diabetes has great impacts on society. In terms of healthcare costs, Diabetes UK (2012a) estimates that that about \u00a310 billion is spent by the NHS on diabetes each year. There are also impacts on individual sufferers and their families/carers, including a reduced life expectancy of five to seven years, a greater risk of stroke and heart problems, and around 30 per cent of patients with T2D develop kidney disease (DH 2006b). What we know about diabetes in mental health service users While it is recognized that MHSUs have a greater risk of developing diabetes than the general population, the process of this is very complex. Research shows the following: Diabetes is 2-4 times more prevalent in people with schizophrenia than the general popula- tion (Bushe and Holt 2004). People with schizophrenia are a high-risk group for abnormal glucose homeostasis (Gough 2005). MHSUs with bipolar disorder have a high risk of developing T2D. A US study by Cassidy et al. (1999) estimated the prevalence at almost three times that for the general population. A survey by the DRC (2006) found that 41 per cent of those with schizophrenia and diabetes are diagnosed under the age of 55, compared with 30 per cent of others with diabetes; and 19 per cent of people with diabetes who have schizophrenia die, as do 4 per cent of people with bipolar disorder, compared with 9 per cent of people with no serious mental health problems. These statistics show that MHSUs not only develop diabetes at younger ages than the general population, but also their prognosis is often poorer. Diabetes is under-diagnosed in MHSUs and the first time it is encountered may be with respect to a clinical incident, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or a hypoglycaemic coma. This may be because signs and symptoms are mistaken for an ADR; for example, increased fluid intake may be mistaken as a response for dry mouth and not seen as polydipsia in diabetes. However, despite increased risk of diabetes, Taylor et al. (2004) found that less than half of their sample (41.3 per cent) of a clinical audit had been screened for diabetes. Causes of diabetes in mental health service users The causes of T2D in MHSUs are very complex. The risk of getting T2D, especially in schizo - phrenia, is higher than in the general population (Dixon et al. 2000). The causes of T2D in MHSUs are similar to those in the general population - sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and a lack of exercise, which contribute to obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. The complexity arises Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. 152 Physical assessment skills for practice when we include ADRs, especially new atypical drugs such as clozapine and olanzapine, which are most commonly associated with increased rates of obesity and diabetes (Healy 2005). How - ever, Kohen (2004) notes that in the late 1950s there were reports that chlorpromazine was linked to hyperglycaemia, glycosuria, and weight gain. Does atypical medication cause T2D? A review by Smith and colleagues (M. Smith et al. 2008) found newer atypical medications have a 30 per cent increased risk of diabetes com-pared with typical medications. However, they suggest that this result be treated with caution. Smith and colleagues' review shows that any evidence for such a link is poor but suggest that clinicians 'implement protocols for identifying physical illnesses, in particular diabetes, in peo-ple with schizophrenic illnesses' (M. Smith et al. 2008: 410). However, Healy (2005) suggests that olanzapine and clozapine raise blood lipid levels and blood glucose levels, which leads to diabetes. Insulin resistance is another metabolic disorder defined as a disease process whereby an individual becomes resistant to their inherent insulin production (Jeffery 2003). Risk factors for insulin resistance include (Jeffery 2003): obesity; high waist-to-hip ratio (apple-shaped rather than of T2D or cardiovascular disease; ethnicity; gestational diabetes; smoking. Screening for and identifying Type 2 diabetes Practitioners should be aware of the risk factors for T2D (see Table 7.8). Standard 2 of the NSF for Diabetes (DH 2001b) aims to identify people who do not yet know they have diabetes. Health education and promotion can then be employed to reduce the complications of diabetes from arising. Practitioners should be observant for the common symptoms of T2D, such as excessive thirst, frequent micturition, lethargy, visual problems or unplanned weight loss. If these are present, then a blood sample should be taken and sent for screening.

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 153 Prediabetes Prediabetes, sometimes referred to as impaired fasting glucose, is a term given to an increased blood glucose level that is not high enough to attract a diagnosis of diabetes. The WHO (2006b) states that impaired fasting glucose is 6.1-6.9 mmol/L (see Table 7.9). Having prediabetes places MHSUs at a higher risk of developing T2D. This is why regular blood glucose screening is required so that the rate of progression to actual diabetes can be slowed. Diagnosing diabetes Diabetes.co.uk (2013) suggests the range for a normal blood glucose level is 4.4-6.1 mmol/L. They also caution that blood glucose level may rise to 7.8 mmol/L following a meal. This is why blood glucose is usually tested before meals. Diabetes UK (2012b) gives the following values as indicators of diabetes: a random venous plasma glucose concentration 11.1 mmol/L; or a fasting plasma glucose concentration 7.0 mmol/L (whole blood 6.1 mmol/L); or plasma glucose concentration 11.1 mmol/L 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test. In a recent update to diagnostic testing, the WHO (2011) state that HbA1c can be used as a diagnostic test, albeit with some caveats (e.g. assays are standardized to criteria aligned to the international reference values). A HbA1c of 48 mmol/mol (6.5 per cent) is recommended as the cut-off point for diagnosing diabetes; however, a value of less than this does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests. For glucose control, Diabetes UK (2012b) recommends achieving blood glucose levels as near as possible to those of a person who does not have diabetes: 3.5-5.5 mmol/L before meals; <8 mmol/L 2 hours after meals. The risk factors for T2D are outlined in Table 7.10. In the context of MHSUs, we may prioritize screening to the following (but remember people may have combinations of these): those with current heart disease or who have suffered a stroke; those over 40 years; those with a family history of diabetes; those with a BMI of 30 kg/m2; those with a waist size >88 cm (females) or 102 cm (males); overweight children or young people in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. Managing Type 2 diabetes A key strategy is changing lifestyle factors, such as: increasing physical activity; regulating diet; stopping smoking; reducing alcohol intake; regular monitoring of blood glucose levels.

(2007) suggest that pharmacological interventions for the prevention of diabetes are recommended as a secondary intervention either following lifestyle interventions or in conjunction with them. If lifestyle factors are not enough to regain glycaemic control, then medication may be prescribed to achieve this. The most common medication is a hypogly-caemic agent such as metformin, which is widely accepted as the first-line drug (Heine et al. 2006). However, this drug may be contraindicated in MHSUs with renal damage, so should be considered with caution in those taking lithium. Medication should not be used as a substitute for changing lifestyle factors. Checklist prior to commencing an atypical antipsychotic Medications with the highest risk of weight gain are olanzapine and clozapine. Quetiapine and risperidone pose a moderate risk, and amisulpride a low risk (Taylor et al. 2012). Service users should be screened prior to commencing or changing antipsychotic medication. There is no hard and fast time scale but Table 7.11 provides an example. This allows for accurate assessment of weight gain and screening for potential health risks (e.g. cardiac problems or diabetes). Other variables can be added upon discussion with team members. Complications of Type 2 diabetes Delayed diagnosis leads to a prolonged exposure to untreated symptoms increasing the risk of complications. Type 2 diabetes is notable for the increased cardiovascular risk that it car-ries for coronary artery disease (leading to heart attacks, angina), peripheral artery disease (leg claudication, gangrene), and carotid artery disease (strokes, dementia) (NICE 2008a). Diabetes is one of the major causes of blindness, kidney failure, and amputation (Marks 2003).Table 7.10 Screening for T2D Screening variable Risk factor Medical history Coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke BP If you have diabetes, kidney disease or heart disease, a target BP is below 130/80 mmHg (BHF 2013a: 10) Presence of noticeable symptoms Polydipsia, Urinalysis Specific gravity, glycosuria Overweight BMI >24.9 or waist measurement >94 cm (>37 inches) for white and black men; >90 cm (>35 inches) for Asian men; and >80 cm (>31.5 inches) for white, black, and Asian women (Diabetes UK 2006) Sedentary lifestyle Low exercise or physical activity Social Family member with diabetes Metabolic syndrome markers High HDL cholesterol Hypertension Demographic factors - age and culture White and over 40 years or ethnic minority - African-Caribbean, Asian Diagnosis of schizophrenia Linked to increased risk of diabetes Taking 'high-risk' medications Olanzapine, clozapine Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 155 Watkins (2003) lists the factors increasing the risk of developing CHD in diabetic patients as smoking, hypertension, insulin resistance, Asian origin, micro-albuminuria, diabetic nephropa- thy, poor glycaemic control, and hyperlipidaemia. With respect to MHSUs, this provides an indication of who we should effectively target with appropriate interventions and treatment. Health education and health promotion We have a key role in prevention of T2D through health education and promotion in the areas of nutrition, diet, and physical activity. The process will be inter-professional and will involve team members such as a dietitian, occupational therapist, exercise therapist, and carer/family. The occupational therapist and dietitian might arrange educational shopping trips to supermarkets where they could educate MHSUs about healthy eating while they do their shopping. Food label - ling can be very confusing, so the dietitian would help in explaining food labels to MHSUs, high - lighting the healthy alternatives and cautioning on foods that have a high salt and sugar content. Prevention Primary prevention Primary prevention aims to prevent the condition arising in the first place. Following on from screening, the aim for MHSUs who do not test positive for a metabolic disorder is to prevent them from getting one. For example, in Child and Adolescent Services, the promotion of healthy diet and physical activity would reduce the risk of developing T2D later. This will include practical aspects of health education and promotion, advice on healthy diet, nutrition, and physical activity. A review of diabetes risk related to medication regime should also be considered. Secondary prevention Secondary prevention aims to identify conditions early so that interventions can be tailored as soon as possible. This will reduce the potential for complications developing and delay the progression of the condition. As a result of screening, MHSUs may be identified as having prediabetes or T2D. Here the practitioner will follow the process as laid out in primary prevention, but the MHSU may need Table 7.11 Metabolic screening for antipsychotic medication example Clinical variableOn commencing or changing medication Week 8 Week 16 Six monthly Yearly (or as required) BP Pulse BMI Waist measurement Blood tests - FBC, fasting glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, liver function Urinalysis ECG Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Service users that smoke should be offered a referral to smoking cessation services. Tertiary prevention Tertiary prevention is employed when the condition has already been diagnosed. Here the aim is to improve the quality of life and reduce the impact of the condition in daily life. Terti-ary prevention will be required for MHSUs who have developed diabetes and have suffered a physical illness as a result of this, such as a heart attack or stroke. Here the practitioner's role is to support the MHSU and enable them to adapt their lifestyle. The aim here is to increase the quality of the MHSU's life following a significant disabling event. Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of several risk factors for heart disease. There is no unique definition of metabolic syndrome and there are at least seven, subtly different, sets of diagnos-tic criteria. For example, the diagnostic criteria defined by the WHO (1999) are the presence of T2D, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, together with two or more of the fol-lowing: dyslipidaemia - low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides; hypertension - BP >140/90 mmHg; obesity with high BMI; micro-albuminuria. The diagnostic criteria of the European Group for Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR) (Balkau and Charles 1999) include elevated plasma insulin (>75th percentile) plus two other factors from among the following: abdominal obesity: waist circumference 94 cm in men and 80 cm in women; hypertension: 140/90 mmHg or on reduced HDL-C (<39 mg/dL) (both men and women); elevated plasma glucose: impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, but no diabetes. In the USA, the National Cholesterol Education Program (2001) Adult Treatment Panel III sug-gests a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome if an individual has three or more of the following: abdominal obesity: waist circumference 102 cm (40 inches) in men and 88 cm (35 inches) in women; hypertriglyceridaemia: 150 mg/dL (1.695 metabolic syndrome include hyperuricaemia and polycystic ovary syndrome. The following definitions are offered for each of the different diagnostic terms. Dyslipidae- mia is a disorder of lipid (fat) metabolism and is usually hyperlipidaemia - high cholesterol. The normal range of cholesterol in the blood would be <5 mmol/L for total cholesterol and 3 mmol/L for LDL cholesterol (DH 2000). High-density lipoproteins protect against CHD as they decrease risk factors such as atherosclerosis by 'cleaning' excess lipids from the arteries and carrying them to the liver where they are broken down. Hypertriglyceridaemia relates to Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 157 increased triglyceride levels and these are linked to atherosclerosis, which increases the risk of CHD and stroke. Micro-albuminuria is the presence of small amounts of albumin in the urine. If urinalysis proves positive for glucose, then a sample should be sent for analysis to determine if micro-albuminuria is present. Micro-albuminuria has been associated with an elevated risk of serious cardiovascular events including stroke (Ovbiagele 2008). Hyperuricaemia relates to increased levels of uric acid in the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome affects women and symptoms include enlarged ovaries with small cysts (McFerran 2008). This is associated with insulin resistance and obesity. Service users have many of these risk factors yet screening for metabolic syndrome in men- tal health is poor (Barnes et al. 2007, and see below). Screening for metabolic syndrome should be based on one of the above diagnostic criteria, but a practical problem may be, 'which cri-teria should we use?' This can be easily decided by liaising with local endocrine or diabetes services to determine which criteria they use and whether they would be applicable in a men-tal health context. A specialist mental health dietitian can also offer advice within the team context. What is clear is that there is no need to reinvent the wheel as far as screening for metabolic syndrome is concerned. The tools exist, so what MHNs require is the knowledge, skills, and confidence to begin screening for this condition in their caseloads. The quicker this is implemented, the better the health outcomes for service users will be. Box 7.10 Case example At a community meeting on your ward, service users voice their concern at a lack of healthy options in the vending machines in the unit. How would you address these concerns? Risk factors for metabolic syndrome Tonkin (2003) suggests a prevalence of up to 25 per cent in the UK population. Holt (2005) suggests that central obesity - fat deposited around the abdomen - places the individual at a greater risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is higher in certain groups: ethnic subgroups, e.g. Asian and African-Caribbean; women with polycystic ovary disease; patients with schizophrenia; people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Clinical implications of having metabolic syndrome include a threefold increase in risk for coronary heart disease and stroke compared with individuals with normal glucose tolerance (Nugent 2004). Treatment of metabolic syndrome Treatment should begin with primary prevention. At-risk MHSUs should be screened and if they are clear they should be given health education and promotion advice on healthy life-styles and exercise. However, Barnes et al. (2007) found screening for metabolic syndrome to be well below recommended levels in an audit of Assertive Outreach Teams. For MHSUs with metabolic syndrome, the emphasis should be on secondary prevention - that is, preventing complications and effective management. Treatment of main risk factors should be prioritized and will include pharmacological and non-pharmacological interven-tions. These should be explained as treatment interventions not lifestyle choices. Pharmacotherapy, e.g. statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) may be indicated for dyslipi- daemia, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL may also need medication.

Service users should be encouraged to increase fruit and vegetables in the diet and to exer-cise, especially exercise that involves increased heart and lung activity. What can the mental health nurse do to promote healthy eating and exercise? Health education and health promotion are good starting points. At every opportunity, practi-tioners should provide as much information as possible on positive health. This should be in a constructive and empowering way, as MHSUs may feel powerless or unable to change. In this sense, it is important that education is not just about eating healthily, but also about cognitive-behavioural strategies designed to inhibit negative perceptions MHSUs have about themselves or their ability to succeed. Changing behaviours will entail changing attitudes - those of practitioners as much as those of MHSUs. We should dispense with the 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks' idea. Nega-tive staff attitudes can be as much a barrier to change as our service users' demotivation. We should increase MHSUs' awareness of healthy eating and exercise, opportunities to engage in lifestyle changes, and peer support groups in the community. Information should be presented in a way that is accessible for MHSUs and carers. Box 7.11 ExerciseLook at the vending machines on or near your ward. How healthy are the food and drink choices available to MHSUs? Providing choice is a mantra in health policy. In inpatient areas, MHSUs should be given the choice of fruit and vegetables as often as possible. A simple audit of vending machines in mental health units will indicate that healthy food choices are limited. There will likely be a conciliatory type of fruit (probably a little withered) but the quantity of that fruit will not be the same in proportion to chocolate bars, crisps or sweets. And drink machines will most often have high-calorie, sugary drinks. Exercise is a non-pharmacological way of managing both physical and mental health prob- lems. Practitioners should encourage MHSUs to participate in exercise programmes, both in hospital and the community. We need to be creative in how we present these as interventions as well as lifestyle choices. If we are too evangelical, then MHSUs may not feel supported to engage. We should enable MHSUs to express their own ideas for exercise and lifestyle choices and empower them to follow these as goals. Mostly we should be there to support them and to monitor the effects of lifestyle on physical health. Conclusions Making moderate changes in lifestyle can result in considerable gains. For example, by reduc- ing saturated fat intake and increasing exercise, we can reduce the risk of heart disease. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of breast and colon cancer and possibly that of endometrial and prostate cancer (WHO/FAO 2003). The WHO/FAO (2003) also suggests advice on ways of changing daily nutritional intake and increasing energy expenditure by: reducing energy-rich foods high in saturated fat and sugar; cutting the amount of salt in the diet; Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Assessing nutrition, diet, and physical activity 159 increasing the amount of fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet; undertaking moderate-intensity physical activity for at least an hour a day. The dietary changes that MHSUs require should not be dramatic; they should be planned, SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely) changes. The main factor is adopting a 'healthy' diet but this may be difficult for MHSUs living in socially deprived areas. Thus, part of the overall assessment should be a social assessment to ensure that the MHSU and their carers are claiming the necessary benefits to support lifestyle change. A shift in attitudes is the biggest challenge. But this sword cuts both ways. Changing the atti- tudes of MHSUs towards healthy lifestyles through smoking cessation, dietary changes, and exercise is as important as changing staff attitudes that stigmatize MHSUs as being unable to change, or that physical health is not their remit. Summary of key points Practitioners should engage MHSUs in adopting a healthy lifestyle by using government public health initiatives as a means of modifying diet and physical activity. Service users should be routinely screened for metabolic conditions such as T2D. Assessment of diet, nutrition, and physical activity should include socio-economic factors that might inhibit lifestyle change as well as physical and psychological factors. Weight management and physical activity programmes should be offered to all MHSUs, but especially those on atypical antipsychotics that cause weight gain. Practitioners should involve MHSUs and carers in plans to develop healthy lifestyles and physical activity regimes.

Introduction Since the 1950s, medication has been a mainstay in the treatment of mental illness. The develop - ment of chlorpromazine is often credited with the advent of community care, as more people with mental illness could be treated at home instead of in hospital. However, what was apparent then, Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 161 as now, is that psychotropic drugs can have serious side-effects. In some cases, these constitute a high risk to MHSUs' physical health. For example, in 1949, Cade, an Australian psychiatrist, found that lithium was effective in treating mania; in the same year, however, lithium was banned by the US Food and Drug Administration after deaths in patients with cardiac disease (Keltner and Folks 2005). This chapter includes the blood as an integral part of the cardiac system, as some ADRs are blood dyscrasias (i.e. abnormalities in blood cell production), which can have serious implica- tions for MHSUs' immune system. What does the brain do? The brain is a complex organ forming an integral part of the CNS. It is responsible for: maintaining homeostasis; regulating basic needs, e.g. hunger and sleep; regulating drives and impulses; regulating and interpreting emotions; enabling us to think; controlling responses to a range of sensory stimuli; enabling us to process, store, and recall data; enabling us to initiate and respond in communication; giving us drive and motivation; storing and recalling memory (may be selective). The brain contains nerve cells called neurons, of which there are three types (Gross 2005): sensory - neurons that carry information from the sense organs to the CNS; motor - neurons that carry information from the CNS to the muscles and glands; interneurons - which connect neurons to other neurons. Neurotransmitters Neurons communicate with each other through a combination of electrical impulses and chem- ical messengers called neurotransmitters. Chemical neurotransmission involves the release of a neurotransmitter by one neuron and the binding of that neurotransmitter to a receptor on another neuron (Kaplan et al. 1994). Table 8.1 provides an outline of the neurotransmitters important in psychiatry. An excess or lack of these can contribute to mental and physical health problems. Why 'physical' adverse drug reactions? Surely ADRs are physical? The purpose here is not to examine 'traditional' ADRs such as move- ment disorders. With the noticeable rise of ADRs such as obesity, T2D, dyslipidaemia, and coronary problems, a less traditional focus is appropriate. Psychotropic medications are a unique risk factor for MHSUs, as they can contribute to metabolic and cardiovascular condi- tions and early death. Psychotropic medications can have adverse effects on major body systems and activities of daily living: Cardiac system - prolonged QT interval and cardiac dysrhythmias. Alimentary system - oral health problems affecting chewing and taste, weight gain, and constipation. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Activities of daily living - loss of appetite, loss of libido, loss of mobility, and insomnia. Although some ADRs are 'rare', it is important to be aware of them, so that you can react swiftly and confidently if you do encounter them.Table 8.1 Common neurotransmitters, their functions and effects Neurotransmitter Function Psychological effect Physical effect Dopamine Stimulates the heart Controls muscle and motor coordination Stimulates the hypothalamus to release hormones Increased levels may contribute to schizophrenia and mania Decreased levels may contribute to depression and Parkinson's disease Hyperprolactinaemia, hypertension, tachycardia a cetylcholine Plays a role in memory and learning r egulates mood, aggressive and sexual behaviour Stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system Increased levels may contribute to depression Decreased levels may contribute to a lzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, and Parkinson's disease Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and tachycardia, confusion, memory and concentration problems Noradrenaline r egulates mood, attention, and arousal Stimulates the 'fight or flight' response Increased levels may contribute to mania Decreased levels may contribute to depression Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, priapism Serotonin r egulates attention, behaviour, sleep, body temperature, hunger, aggression, and pain perception Increased levels may contribute to anxiety Decreased levels may contribute to depression Weight gain, hypo- tension, decreased appetite, headaches Histamine Inflammatory response, alertness, and gastric secretion \u2014 Some antipsychotics block histamine receptors and this causes increased sedation and weight gain Gamma-aminobutyric acid (G a B a ) r educes anxiety, excitation, and aggression a nticonvulsant and muscle-relaxing properties Increased levels may help to reduce anxiety Decreased levels may contribute to mania, anxiety, and schizophrenia Low seizure threshold Source: a dapted from Varcarolis and Halter (2008) Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 163 Why monitor adverse drug reactions? Quite simply, it is good practice, it contributes to improved physical health, and helps monitor treatment outcomes. Howard et al. (2007) estimate that poor medication monitoring is respon- sible for around 22 per cent of preventable hospital admissions. Adverse drug reactions in men- tal health range from mild to severe and can be fatal (Reilly et al. 2002); for example, sudden death can occur from QT prolongation leading to Torsade de pointes (see Figure 8.2). Unfortunately, evidence points to a lack of effective monitoring and communication of ADRs to MHSUs. Despite an increased risk of diabetes, Taylor et al. (2004) found low levels of diabetes screening, the Healthcare Commission (2007a) found that only 11 per cent of people had appropriate ADR screening documented, and the Healthcare Commission (2007b) found that 34 per cent of clients reported that they were not informed about ADRs. Lack of appropri- ate medication monitoring in the UK has led to a series of clinical negligence claims involving antipsychotics (11 cases) and lithium (5 cases), even though there are established guidelines for monitoring both types of medications (Nash 2011). While the efficacy of some psychotropic medications remains debatable, MHNs have an ethical duty to ensure that prescribed medications are routinely monitored. Monitoring is also compulsory for medicines such as clozapine, lithium, and anti-convulsive therapy where MHSU safety is at risk. Monitoring ADRs is an important role for MHNs, as there is a wide range of negative effects. You also need to be increasingly aware of contraindications, as Paton and Gill-Banham (2003) found instances where drug interactions could induce potential toxicity, such as diuretics prescribed alongside lithium or hypoglycaemia, where long-acting oral hypoglycaemics are prescribed at night. How do psychotropic medications work? Little is known about the action of drugs on neurotransmitter activity. What is known is that psychotropic drugs act on different receptor sites, including those that they are not designed to work on. A simplistic biological theory is neurotransmitter excess or deficiency. Too much - or not enough - neurotransmitter can lead to mental health problems (see Table 8.1). However, such is the nature of psychotropic medications that they may alleviate symptoms but also result in numerous ADRs. Most drugs used in psychiatry affect the process of neurotransmission (Kaplan et al. 1994). Psychotropic medications work by manipulating the action of neurotransmitters in the follow- ing ways: Typical antipsychotics block dopamine and acetylcholine receptors. antipsychotics dopamine and serotonin receptors. Antidepressants block re-uptake such as inhibit enzyme oxadase, destroys neurotransmitters such as serotonin and noradrenaline. Mood stabilizers such as lithium interfere with neurotransmitter activity both in synthesis and re-uptake. It may also promote electrical stability. Benzodiazepines facilitate the transmission of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), which helps inhibit (relax) brain activity by slowing responses to stimuli.

Their effectiveness in treating more problematic negative symptoms is questionable. Antipsychotics are usually divided into two types: traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine, referred to as typical antipsychotics; and the more recent antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and clozapine, referred to as atypical antipsychotics. Antipsychotics have a range of ADRs that can appear at any time after commencement of treatment and are usually dose-effect related. This means they become more severe with higher doses. The main difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics is their range of ADRs. Typical antipsychotics Typical antipsychotics have different potency: Low-potency antipsychotics normally require large doses and can cause sedation. High-potency antipsychotics usually require lower doses and tend to cause more movement disorders. The ADRs commonly associated with typical antipsychotics include: Tardive dyskinesia: involuntary muscle movements, e.g. tremor (tongue, hands), tongue protrusion, chewing movements. Acute dystonic reactions: muscle spasm in neck back, motor antipsychotics are the recognized front-line treatment for schizophrenia in the UK (NICE 2002). The ADRs associated with atypical antipsychotics include: metabolism and weight gain; cardiac system effects; blood dyscrasias; sexual dysfunction. These do not represent the only ADRs but they are important risk variables in provoking physi- cal conditions that lead to early death or non-compliance in MHSUs. Most ADRs usually recede with time and without the use of any adjunct medication. Interventions for managing adverse effects include: Non-pharmacological: lifestyle changes, healthy living programmes, dietary changes, and increasing fluid intake for constipation and dry mouth. Pharmacological: prescription of adjunct medications to counteract ADRs, altering the dose of medication, stopping or changing medications. Antipsychotic drugs can produce metabolic disorders that require treatment with 'physical' care medications; for example, metformin is a drug used in the management of T2D. In a sur- vey for Rethink, a UK mental health charity, Williams and Pinfold (2006) found the most com- mon disabling ADRs reported by MHSUs were: sedation and lethargy (22 per cent); weight gain (19 per cent); shaking and tremors (6 per cent); sexual dysfunction (3 per cent).

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 165 Worryingly, they also found that 54 per cent of the sample did not receive any written infor- mation about ADRs. For most MHSUs, disabling ADRs are usually associated with traditional drugs; however, new evidence suggests that metabolic abnormalities are a concern for MHSUs on atypical medications. Adverse drug reactions have also been reported with second-generation antipsychotics. For example, tardive dyskinesia has been reported with atypical antipsychotics cloza - pine (Novartis 2013) and risperidone (Janssen Pharmaceuticals 2013), and blood dyscra - sias (i.e. agranulocytosis) can occur with typical antipsychotics like chlorpromazine (BNF 2013). Antidepressants There are three medications: tricyclics, SSRIs, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). All antidepressant drugs increase serotonin function and may also increase noradrenaline function (Gelder et al. 1996). Tricyclic antidepressants These are referred to as the 'older' antidepressants. These can be fatal in overdose due to their cardiotoxic nature (Patton 2008). They tend to have more ADRs than the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors These are referred to as the 'newer' antidepressants. They act by blocking the reuptake of serotonin (hence their name). Increased levels of serotonin reduce feelings of depression. The ADRs include galactorrhoea; e.g. ecchymoses; withdrawal effects. Box 8.3 ExerciseLook up the definitions of the various a D r s mentioned in this chapter. It may take weeks before MHSUs notice any positive effects. This slow response may lead MHSUs to think that their medication is not working and to stop taking it. Perceived non-effect is an important factor in non-compliance.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. 166 Physical health and well-being in practice Monoamine oxidase inhibitors These inhibitors act by blocking the enzymes that destroy neurotransmitters such as noradren- aline and serotonin. Blocking these enzymes enables neurotransmitters to accumulate and remain active for longer, alleviating depressive symptoms. Service users taking MAOIs are required to make compulsory dietary changes. This is due to the potential interaction between MAOIs and tyramine, which can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine and noradrenaline. This interaction can provoke cardiac problems. Foods high in tyramine need to be avoided and include pickled herring, mature cheese, cured meats, drinks based on yeast extracts, overripe fruit, and red wine. Bananas may be taken in small quantities but if a severe headache or symptoms of hypertension occur, these should be imme- diately assessed. Mood stabilizers Lithium is a mainstay treatment for bipolar affective disorder and mania. However, the action of lithium is poorly understood. Varcarolis and Halter (2008) suggest that lithium, a positively charged ion, acts by stabilizing electrical activity in neurons. Lithium has a narrow thera - peutic range, making it more likely MHSUs suffer adverse effects. If these go undiagnosed, lithium toxicity may occur, which can have serious implications for physical health. Lithium toxicity is related to the concentration of lithium in blood plasma. The therapeutic range of lithium is 0.4-1.0 mmol/L (BNF 2013); the lower end of the range is recommended for elderly service users. In acute episodes of mania, a dose of 0.8-1.0 mmol/L is recommended (BNF 2013). Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines are referred to as anxiolytics and are used in conjunction with antipsychotics in rapid tranquillization. The ADRs include cardiac effects such as low BP, light-headedness, and muscle weakness. Another significant problem with benzodiazepines is addiction, which can lead to marked withdrawal effects. This is why a gradual withdrawal regime is required. The ability to perform motor tasks (e.g. driving) is also impaired, as reaction times are slowed down. Metabolic adverse drug reactions with medication Psychotropic medications are associated with metabolic reactions that can increase the risk of coronary events. Such is the extent of metabolic reactions that these are referred to as the 'new' tardive dyskinesia. Taylor et al. (2012) report that common reactions include: hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol); increased triglycerides; T2D; obesity or severe weight gain. Metabolic ADRs are features of most antipsychotic (typical and atypical) medications, as they may affect histamine and serotonin receptors, which can lead to sedation and weight gain (Taylor et al. 2012). The development of diabetes in MHSUs taking olanzapine and Clozaril seems to be an effect of treatment that is independent of weight gain (Healy 2005). However, there is an increasing recognition that SMI may represent an independent risk fac- tor for diabetes (Expert Consensus Group 2005). Routine metabolic monitoring is not usual with MHSUs, even though they have higher rates of diabetes and increased exposure to Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 167 metabolic risk factors. This is not helped by a lack of specific guidelines on metabolic screen- ing and monitoring and confusion around whose role this should be. Second-generation antipsychotics and metabolic abnormalities Most atypical antipsychotics produce weight gain and some are also implicated in diabetes and dyslipidaemia. For example (American Diabetes Association et al. 2004): Olanzapine and clozapine result in weight gain, risk of diabetes, and worsening lipid profile. Risperidone and quetiapine result in weight gain but there are discrepant results for diabe- tes and worsening lipid profile. Aripiprazole and ziprasidone produce minimal weight gain and have no effect on diabetes or lipid profile. Box 8.4 ExerciseList the medications used in your area and examine their potential cardiac- related adverse reactions. Obesity and weight gain The causes of obesity and weight gain are complex and involve interactions between life- style factors and ADRs. The cause of the weight gain will have to be determined on a balance of probabilities, as there is no known single mechanism that adequately explains the weight change seen with antipsychotic medications (Expert Consensus Group 2005). Obesity and weight gain have long been associated with antipsychotic medications. In a sur- vey of 226 patients attending depot neuroleptic clinics in inner London, Silverstone et al. (1988) found the prevalence of clinically relevant obesity was four times that in the general popula- tion, suggesting that this has major implications for compliance. Excess weight and obesity are independent risk factors for a range of chronic physical conditions (see Chapter 7). We can see the effect of this in the increased prevalence of physical conditions such as diabetes and CHD and higher mortality rates. Factors that contribute to weight gain We know that psychotropic medication leads to weight gain, but we don't exactly know how. The increased or decreased action of neurotransmitters listed in Table 8.1 can lead to problems with appetite stimulation or an inability to suppress appetite (e.g. histamine). Adverse drug reactions Sedation: MHSUs may be too sedated to engage in exercise programmes. Metabolic disturbances: glucose intolerance and dyslipidaemia increase the risk of obesity.Box 8.5 Case example Mary has a five-year history of bipolar disorder. She has been maintained relatively well with lithium, although she does have periods of non-compliance that result in rapid deterioration of mental state and admission to hospital. During a one-to-one session with Mary, she dis-closes that her main motivation for non-compliance is the weight gain associated with her medication. How would you advise Mary on her requirement for treatment and balance this with her desire not to put on weight? Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Excessive thirst: MHSUs may consume high-calorie drinks that increase weight. Problems with balance and gait: these may prevent participation in exercise. Movement disorders: for example, tremor or rigidity may inhibit potential for exercise. Increased appetite: weight gain is difficult to reverse - this might decrease MHSU motiva- tion to exercise or diet. Illness-related factors Decreased motivation, a general population factor, may account for a sedentary lifestyle. Negative symptoms, which differ from decreased motivation, are not a lifestyle choice but a symptom of mental illness. Social withdrawal due to depression or paranoid ideas. Reduced self-esteem: MHSUs may have a poor self/body image and thus are embarrassed to exercise. Other factors Negative staff attitudes about MHSUs succeeding. Therapeutic fatalism - obesity may be perceived as a chemical consequence of medication and thus it cannot be treated effectively. Social exclusion: MHSUs may not have the resources or support to join gyms and the stigma of mental illness is another barrier. Lack of availability of treatment options such as appetite suppressant medication or gastric surgery. Many of the risk factors for obesity and weight gain are modifiable. Lifestyle advice, healthy eating plans, and exercise have all been shown to be valuable in combating obesity and dia- betes. Psychotropic medication regimes are also a modifiable risk factor, as these can be changed in the face of deteriorating physical health and you may need to advocate for MHSUs' rights to have independent reviews of medication in exceptional cases. Predictors of weight gain Weight gain is a serious ADR, as it is a risk factor for physical complications. However, it appears to be grossly underestimated in practice. Predictors for weight gain include (Expert Consensus Group 2005): first-episode treatment; low baseline BMI; better clinical response; increased appetite; high rate of initial weight gain. When MHSUs commence taking atypical antipsychotics, they should be closely monitored to determine the extent of weight gain. Rettenbacher et al. (2006) found that metabolic side- effects occur earlier during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, especially olanzapine and clozapine. They found that patients treated with amisulpride or ziprasidone had decreased BMI. It would therefore be prudent to commence a weight management programme imme- diately MHSUs are commenced on atypical medications, as this may slow the rate at which weight is gained. Complications of weight gain Complications of weight gain and obesity are not limited to physical health (see Chapter 7 for associated reading), they can negatively affect mental health treatment. Obese MHSUs Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 169 are 13 times more likely to request discontinuation of their medication and three times more likely to be non-compliant compared with non-obese MHSUs (Kurzthaler and Fleischhacker 2001; Weiden et al. 2004). However, treatment-related weight gain may be a marker for clini- cal improvement in MHSUs (Expert Consensus Group 2005). This irony illustrates that the main factor in selecting medication regimes is effectiveness of treating psychosis. Monitoring weight gain needs to be targeted to be effective. Prioritizing MHSUs will be important and fac- tors to taking olanzapine taking psychotropic other metabolic and lifestyle risk fac- tors; MHSUs taking more than one psychotropic medication; MHSUs with a family history of obesity, diabetes, stroke or CHD; MHSUs taking antipsychotic medication for the first time; MHSUs changing from typical to atypical antipsychotics. Managing weight gain as an adverse drug reaction Weiden et al. (2004) showed that obese MHSUs are at high risk for stopping medication. Weight gain is not an aesthetic side-effect; it is a very serious issue. The health risks related to it are significant and include hypertension, T2D, obesity, CHD, and stroke. Managing weight gain will require focus, as MHSUs may be at different treatment stages: newly diagnosed and treatment na\u00efve; taking psychotropic medication and without weight gain; taking psychotropic medication with weight gain; switching from typical to atypical medications. The aim of weight management for some will be to reduce weight gain through health pro- motion advice, lifestyle changes, and maybe a change in medication. The type and severity of metabolic ADRs will also influence their management. Clinicians should focus on preventing initial weight gain, as subsequent weight loss is difficult to achieve and this may lead to demo- tivation and feelings of failure. Interventions may include: closer weight monitoring; engagement in a weight management programme; use of an adjunctive treatment to reduce weight or manage a co-morbid physical illness; switching the medication to one with less weight gain liability (NICE 2002); MHSUs who suffer from hyper-obesity should be considered for radical treatment, such as appetite suppressants and/or surgery. An inter-professional approach to managing weight gain is required, including a dietitian, mental health pharmacist, and an exercise therapist or activities nurse who will be able to help plan activities and exercises for the MHSU. The primary care team should be involved where MHSUs are in the community. Factors that should be considered for monitoring metabolic ADRs include: BMI; waist-to-hip ratio/waist circumference; cardiovascular assessment lipids for high cholesterol; diabetes/metabolic syndrome markers; urinalysis. You will need to prioritize time scales for measuring these indicators. For example, a weekly waist circumference or monthly blood lipid reading is not necessary. However, short-interval Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. 170 Physical health and well-being in practice BMI (e.g. every three weeks) may initially be required to monitor rapid weight gain. Frequency will depend on individual circumstances. Intervals should be: baseline; monthly; quarterly/6-monthly; and yearly. While monitoring should be targeted, it should not be biased. Citrome et al. (2003) found that those taking atypical medications were more likely to have glucose screening than those taking typical medications. This presents a clear problem when trying to compare the two sets of medications for prevalence of diabetes and may indicate an inequality in health for MHSUs. Cardiac system adverse effects Service users are at risk of cardiovascular illness due to lifestyle factors, ADRs or a combi- nation of the two. Medications such as antipsychotics (e.g. thioridazine, sertindole, ziprasi- done) and tricyclic antidepressants can cause arrhythmias. Severe cardiac reactions, such as arrhythmias and sudden death, have led to the withdrawal of sertindole (Appleby et al. 2000). Most classes of drug used in psychiatry affect the cardiac system. It is important that practi- tioners have the necessary skills to assess cardiovascular health and knowledge of MHSUs' medication regimes (see Chapter 5). Cardiac side-effects are common in psychotropic medication and these can be minor or severe. Although fatal events have been reported, these are not common experiences. Cardiac reactions include: blood dyscrasias. Brown et al. (2010) suggest that the introduction of drugs such as risperidone (1993), olanza- pine (1996), and quetiapine (1997) coincided with the steepest rise in cardiovascular mortality in their study on mortality and schizophrenia. Box 8.6 Exercise Specifically, outline the composition of the blood. Disorders of cardiac conduction Psychotropic medication is associated with changes to the electrical activity of the heart that can lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. These changes will be picked up on ECG readings, which is why an ECG should be undertaken under the following circumstances: on the commencement of high-risk medications; when changing regimes; when giving high-risk medications to MHSUs with metabolic risk factors; when giving high-risk medications to MHSUs with diagnosed heart conditions; poly-pharmacy; following rapid tranquillization.

Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 171 Electrical activity of the heart In a normal ECG there are three waves, symbolizing a heartbeat: the P wave represents atrial depolarization; the QRS wave represents rapid cates ventricular repolarization (Tortora and Derrickson 2006) (see Figure 5.3). When these waves occur in harmony, we have a normal cardiac cycle. When these waves are disharmoni - ous - either too quick (tachycardia) or too slow (bradycardia) - we have an abnormal cardiac cycle. This is referred to as cardiac arrhythmia. Psychotropic medications such as thioridazine (although not commonly ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, tricy - clic antidepressants give rise to cardiac arrhythmias, which cause the heart to beat abnormally. Abdelmawla and Mitchell (2006) suggest that cardiovascular ADRs can be classified as follows: common - orthostatic (postural) hypotension, syncope; rare - reduced heart rate variability, prolongation of the QT/QTc intervals, widened QRS complex; and very rare - ventricular tachycardia, Torsades de pointes, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death. QT prolongation Psychotropic medication can alter the different waves in the ECG, especially the QT interval. The QT interval represents the time required for completion of both ventricular depolarization and repolarization (Pallavi Lanjewar et al. 2004). Figure 8.1 provides an illustration of QT pro- longation. Note the longer QT curve. QT prolongation is a risk factor for ventricular arrhyth- mia. This may be minor where clients experience palpitations, or it can be serious where a condition called 'Torsade de pointes' develops. This is a malignant ventricular arrhythmia that is associated with syncope and sudden death (Glassman and Bigger 2001) (see Figure 8.2).

A QT interval of 500 ms or longer is con- sidered a risk factor of sudden death. The risk of sudden death may be linked to pre-existing cardiac conditions (both diagnosed and undiagnosed). Although QT prolongation is a rare ADR, it is important to be aware of it and of potential risk factors: medications most associated with it; the cardiac health/history of MHSUs taking these medications; and the presence of other cardiac risk factors. Psychiatric medications that provoke QT prolongation include antipsychotics (both typical and atypical) and tricyclic antidepressants. If a MHSU faints as the result of a cardiac event, there is also the danger of a head injury. Practitioners should be extra vigilant with MHSUs taking medications that can cause syncope or orthostatic hypotension. You should encourage MHSUs to report any feelings of dizziness, light-headedness or changes in consciousness so that they can be investigated. QRS prolongation The QRS wave is associated with ventricular depolarization. As the heart tissue of the ventri- cles is thick (to aid pumping), the passage of the QRS impulse is naturally slightly longer. How- ever, QRS prolongation occurs when the electrical impulse between the atria and the ventricles is impaired. This can lead to heart block where there are dropped heart beats. On an ECG this is represented by the P wave not being followed by the QRS wave. Changes in duration, structure, and amplitude of the ECG waves are diagnostic indicators of cardiac problems that require further investigation. An ECG should be performed at least twice yearly - one to provide a baseline reading and another to monitor progress. Service users with cardiac problems taking psychotropic medications may require more frequent ECGs. Poly-pharmacy Poly-pharmacy, prescribing a combination of drugs (e.g. mood stabilizers and anti- psychotics), is a controversial practice in mental health. Waddington et al. (1998) found that receiving two or more antipsychotics concurrently was associated with reduced survival in people with schizophrenia. Poly-pharmacy may occur in complex psychiatric disorders, such as psychotic depression, schizo affective disorder or paranoid schizophrenia. It can occur in acute phases such as relapse or in long-term maintenance treatment. It is often used in critical events such as rapid tranquillization. However, Abdelmawla and Mitchell (2006) list both psychotropic and non-psychotropic medications associated with QT prolongation and potentially serious cardiac arrhythmias, including antibiotics such as erythromycin. QT interactions are something MHNs should be aware of if MHSUs are having antibiotic treatments. Myocarditis Myocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium that usually occurs as a complication of a viral infection, rheumatic fever or exposure to certain chemicals or medications (Tortora and Derrickson 2006). Research by Killian et al. (1999) indicates a risk of fatal myocarditis in patients who take clozapine. Marder et al. (2004) found 80 per cent of cases of myocarditis occurred within six weeks of treatment commencing and the mortality rate was 40 per cent. Among 24,108 patients in the UK, Marder et al. (2004) reported 30 cases with eight fatalities. Indeed, Novartis (2013) suggests that clozapine is associated with an increased risk of fatal myocarditis, especially during, but not limited to, the first month of therapy.

Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 173 Recognition and management Myocarditis is a rare event that may go unrecognized by clinicians. Therefore, when MHSUs taking clozapine present with the above symptoms, myocarditis should be considered as a primary cause. This should then be confirmed by emergency pathology blood tests, for exam- ple, for increased WBC count (eosinophils) and for the cardiac enzyme troponin (see pathol- ogy in Table 8.2). If myocarditis is suspected in anyone taking clozapine, treatment should be promptly discontinued (Novartis 2013) and the MHSU referred to a cardiology specialist for further assessment and treatment. Pulmonary embolism When a blood clot forms, there is a risk of some of it breaking off and entering the blood stream. If it reaches the heart, it may cause a pulmonary embolism. This means the pulmonary artery becomes obstructed, preventing blood reaching the heart. This can lead to heart failure, as the heart loses its ability to pump correctly. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have been reported as ADRs of clozapine (Novartis 2013). Kozier et al. (2008) outline the signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism as follows: sudden chest pain; shortness of breath; cyanosis; shock; tachycardia; low BP. The blood Blood makes up about 7 per cent of body weight (Waugh and Grant 2006), with the average human having around 8 pints (5.6 litres). The major functions of the blood include: regulation and maintenance of body temperature; communication within the body through carrying hormones; transporting oxygen and nutrients to cells and tissues; transporting waste material for removal from the body; transporting WBCs to fight infection;Table 8.2 Symptoms and pathology of myocarditis Symptoms of myocarditis Pathology of myocarditis Unexplained fatigue Increased WBC count (increase in t achypnoea Increased sedimentation rate Fever Increased troponin levels (a cardiac enzyme)* Chest pain ECG changes - S t abnormalities and t wave inversion Palpitations Source: Marder et al.

Blood composition The blood is composed of plasma, different types of cells, and other elements. Blood plasma contains salts, plasma proteins, hormones, and nutrients. Serum plasma is tested when moni- toring the levels of certain psychotropic medications in the blood. The blood also contains WBCs and RBCs and thrombocytes (also known as platelets). Haemopoiesis Haemopoiesis is the production of blood cells and platelets and is confined to bone marrow (McFerran 2008). Some lymphocytes are produced in lymphoid tissue (Waugh and Grant 2006). Erythropoiesis is the production of RBCs. Blood cell production is a lifelong process. Each type of blood cell has a life span. When cells age, they are replaced by new ones; new cells are also produced in response to a crisis, for example an infection. Red blood cells Red blood cells transport oxygen from the lungs to cells and tissues and then return carbon dioxide to the lungs. They are produced in bone marrow. Red blood cells contain haemo - globin, which oxygen binds to, producing oxyhaemoglobin. This binding produces high levels of oxygen in the blood, which is measured by pulse oximetry and ABG assay. White blood cells White blood cells fight infection and are produced in bone marrow and the lymphatic sys- tem. There are two main types - granulocytes and agranulocytes. White blood cells are motile (they move around) and phagocytic (they ingest germs). There are five different types: Neutrophils - prevent and remove bacteria and fungi from entering the body. Eosinophils - target parasites and promote inflammation in allergic reactions. Basophils - involved in allergic reactions. Monocytes - ingest and digest foreign bodies, also involved in antibody production. Lymphocytes - make antibodies and also destroy foreign bodies. Thrombocytes (platelets) Platelets are produced in bone marrow and contain a variety of substances that promote blood clotting and stop bleeding (Waugh and Grant 2006). This complex process is called haemosta- sis. Overproduction of platelets can lead to blood clotting (thrombosis), which is a risk factor for stroke. Underproduction can lead to excessive bleeding where difficulties in forming blood clots occur. Relevance for mental health nurses Some psychotropic medications cause blood dyscrasias. Dyscrasia is defined as an abnormal state of the body due to abnormal development or metabolism (McFerran 2008). Blood dyscra- sias include abnormal production and reduction of all blood cells. This can affect the MHSU's immune system and their ability to fight infection or their ability to heal (e.g. following a self- inflicted injury).

Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 175 Blood dyscrasias as adverse drug reactions Table 8.3 shows blood dyscrasias linked to certain medications used in psychiatry. Agranulo- cytosis is a severe and acute deficiency of neutrophils (WBCs; McFerran 2008). Neutrophils are a primary defence against infection. Agranulocytosis is potentially very severe, which is why clozapine is so strictly monitored. Service users prescribed clozapine must have regular mandatory blood tests to measure their WBC count to ensure the immune system is not com- promised. Clozapine monitoring Theisen et al. (2001) note that despite its considerable advantages in treating psychosis, cloza- pine's value is limited by the potentially life-threatening agranulocytosis. Novartis (2013) cau- tion that MHSUs should be prompted to report symptoms of agranulocytosis, which include lethargy, weakness, fever, and sore throat. Service users receiving clozapine need to have regular blood monitoring for dyscrasias. White blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count are usually taken before initiation of treatment, then weekly for six months, two-weekly for a further six months, and finally every four weeks if results are stable (see Novartis 2013). Other potential reactions Clozapine reduces seizure threshold, so epileptic seizures are a risk in MHSUs taking larger does (see Chapter 9). Service users with epilepsy or a history of seizures should be monitored closely. Anaemia In anaemia, there is not enough haemoglobin available to carry sufficient oxygen from the lungs to supply the needs of tissues (Waugh and Grant 2006: 68). This decreases the amount of oxygenated blood, which contributes to the following: Fatigue - chronic tiredness due to lack of oxygen supply to muscles. Breathlessness/abnormal respirations - increased respiration as a means of compensation for low oxygen supply.Table 8.3 Blood dyscrasias as a D r s Olanzapine X X X Zotepine X X X Quetiapine X X a mitriptyline X X X Carbamazepine X X X X2 Phenytoin X X X3 Source: 2aplastic anaemia, 3megaloblastic anaemia Downloaded [ University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Less perfusion of tissues, which can lead to tissue death as seen in myocardial infarction. Low mood - depression may occur as a reaction to reduced social functioning and an inabil- ity to perform usual tasks. Haemoglobin may be reduced due to a lack of production of RBCs, the presence of immature RBCs that don't have haemoglobin, blood loss or RBCs being destroyed. There are some par- ticular types of anaemia that we should be aware of. Aplastic anaemia Aplastic anaemia is a serious condition whereby the body cannot produce RBCs. In cases such as this, a bone marrow transplant is required. Causes of aplastic anaemia are genetic or may occur due to reactions to some medications (see Table 8.3). Megaloblastic anaemia Megaloblastic anaemia is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid. This causes RBCs to be immature and deformed. Types of megaloblastic anaemia include: Iron deficiency anaemia Iron deficiency anaemia is diagnosed when an individual's blood tests are below 9 g/dL (Waugh and Grant 2006). Poor diet, which is a risk factor for MHSUs, is a cause of this deficiency. Pernicious anaemia Pernicious anaemia is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. This is an autoimmune disorder that occurs as a result of prolonged alcohol use. Symptoms of pernicious anaemia are physical and neurological. They include fine or coarse tremor, lateral nystagmus, alcohol-related dementia, and peripheral neuropathy. Management is usually through the reintroduction of vitamin B12 either by oral or IM injection. The IM injection is an oily substance that can be quite painful. You should exercise great care when giving it so that it disperses well and does not go on to form an abscess. Anaemia due to low blood volume Following an incident of severe cutting or repeated incidents in a short period, the MHSU may have lost enough blood to render them temporarily anaemic. A FBC should be considered in such circumstances, as symptoms of anaemia may be confused with symptoms of depression following the self-harm incident. Furthermore, depending on the type of implement used, there may be a risk of the MHSU developing an infection. Sickle cell anaemia Sickle cell anaemia is a haemolytic anaemia and occurs when RBCs are destroyed prematurely (thalassaemia is another type). This is an inherited blood disorder where abnormal haemoglobin molecules become misshapen when deoxygenated, making them sickle-shaped (Waugh and Grant 2006). This disorder primarily affects individuals from an African-Caribbean background. Assessment of anaemia Anaemia is usually diagnosed by a series of blood tests that include: FBC; iron (haemoglobin) levels; liver function test; bone marrow biopsy (in very severe cases).

Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 177 Treatment of anaemia In severe cases, a bone marrow transplant is required. In other cases, drugs that stimulate RBC production will be prescribed. In the majority of cases, iron supplements will be prescribed and changes to the diet that introduce more iron will be made. Treatment of anaemia will depend on the cause and on how far below the normal range the haemoglobin level falls. For example, a slight fall might be reversed with dietary changes, a moderate fall with dietary changes and iron supplements, and marked falls (e.g. following severe self-harm) with more invasive inter- ventions such as transfusion. Other blood-related effects Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can cause bleeding disorders such as ecchymosis and purpura. Ecchymosis is a bluish-black mark, resembling a bruise, on the skin. This results from the release of blood into the tissue either through injury or spontaneous leaking of blood from the vessels (McFerran 2008). Purpura is a condition where red or purple blotches form under the skin as a result of bleeding from small capillaries. This may be caused by thrombocyto - penia. These blotches resemble those found as a symptom of meningitis - they do not disappear on blanching. This should be remembered when conducting a physical exam. If you notice these, you will need to document it and report it to the doctor for further investigation. Box 8.7 Case example Stuart has a ten-year history of depression. He has been tried on a number of antidepres- sants over the years, which have had variable levels of effectiveness. He has lived most of this time at home and his wife says that, while he is sometimes still depressed, he can cope using some cognitive behavioural therapy exercises. Stuart has been on a trial of an SS r I antidepressant, which has really improved his mental state. However, Stuart has developed impotence and wants to change his medication for something else. Stuart's wife is very sup-portive of him and the treating team. What advice can you offer them both? Sexual dysfunction and adverse drug reactions Sexual dysfunction is an ADR that occurs across medication groups. While varying statistics on prevalence exist, these may not be a true reflection of the problem, as nurses do not rou- tinely undertake sexual assessment and affected individuals may not report any dysfunction because they are embarrassed. In a Spanish study, Montejo et al. (2001) reported a 59.1 per cent overall incidence of sexual dysfunction with antidepressant therapy. The sexual problems reported in studies are extensive, including decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excite- ment, diminished or delayed orgasm, delayed ejaculation, and difficulty getting or maintaining an erection (Higgins et al. 2010). The normal sex cycle consists of four phases: desire, arousal, orgasm, and resolution (Out- hoff 2009). Sexual assessment should cover all phases, as iatrogenic sexual dysfunction can impair any or all phases. However, a thorough assessment of sexual dysfunction is required to determine if it is indeed an ADR (e.g. decreased desire or lack of interest in sex may be symp- toms of depression). Sexual assessments should be carried out with extreme care to enable the MHSU to open up and disclose any relevant issues. Higgins et al. (2010) suggest a thorough assessment will focus on: Eliminating confounding factors for sexual dysfunction, such as age or alcohol/substance use. Excluding a co-morbid physical complaint (e.g. diabetes) or side-effects of diabetes or hypertension medications. Excluding ongoing, or residual, symptoms of mental illness (e.g. depression).

The result may be poor men- tal health and few/no ADRs, or good mental health and few/severe ADRs. Prescribers must be empathetic and responsive to MHSUs' concerns about ADRs, especially those that intrude into activities of daily living such as sexual function. Hyperprolactinaemia Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. Its function is to stimulate progester- one and lactation (McFerran 2008). The normal values for prolactin are less than 25 \u00b5g/L in females and less than 20 \u00b5g/L in males. Breast enlargement and lactation are natural responses in pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy can elevate the levels of prolactin in preparation for child- birth. In pregnant women, the normal range of prolactin is 20-400 \u00b5g/L. Dopamine inhibits prolactin release, so blocking dopamine receptors will increase the risk of developing sexual dysfunction due to increased levels of prolactin. Hyperprolactinaemia is an excess of the hormone, in the absence of pregnancy, and this is an adverse reaction of psycho - tropic medication. This can lead to extremely unpleasant side-effects in both men and women: Men: difficulty reaching orgasm, reduced libido (desire for sex), and ejaculation problems such as impotence or premature ejaculation. Gynaecomastia (development of breasts) may also occur. Women: symptoms that mimic pregnancy such as amenorrhoea - the absence of the period - or disruption of the menstrual cycle, reduced libido, reduced bone density, and osteoporosis. In men and women: galactorrhoea, which is abnormal breast milk production. Most types of psychotropic medications act on dopamine receptors and therefore cause prob- lems with sexual function. Antipsychotic medications, particularly risperidone, can cause hyperprolactinaemia (Jones and Jones 2008). Typical and atypical antipsychotics, SSRIs, and lithium can elevate prolactin levels. Physical investigations, antipsychotic medications, and adverse drug reactions Box 8.8 Exercise Which a D r would you rather experience - tardive dyskinesia or obesity? Why? Practitioners should focus on developing good practice in monitoring ADRs due to the increased risk of higher morbidity and mortality in MHSUs. Furthermore, atypical antipsychotics are the recognized first-line treatment for schizophrenia in the UK (NICE 2002), so physical ADRs are likely to be an enduring feature of MHSUs' physical health. However, what tools are avail- able or what guidance can we consult? These are common questions, with no clear answers. There is a general lack of consensus as to what to monitor and when and even who should do the monitoring - primary or secondary care services, doctors or nurses. Adverse drug reactions are normally measured using checklists such as the Abnormal Invol - untary Movement Scale (AIMS; Guy 1976), the Side-Effect Scale/Checklist for Antipsychotic Medication (SESCAM; Bennett et al. 1995), or the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side-effect Rating Scale (LUNSERS; Day et al. 1995). These scales are generally in the tradition of abnor - mal movements, sedation, and Parkinsonian type symptoms. Jordan et al. (2004) compared different rating scales for the parameters of ADRs assessed and found little focus on 'phys - ical' side-effects. For example, orthostatic hypotension is a known effect of psychotropic Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 179 medication, yet only one of the six rating scales examined had both a sitting and standing BP assessment. The LUNSERS (Day et al. 1995) includes ten questions referred to as 'red herrings' - imagi- nary reactions such as mouth ulcers or runny nose to screen over-reporters. However, Jordan et al. (2004) suggest that far from being imaginary, mouth ulcers could arise from xerostomia and runny nose from alpha blockade induced by antipsychotics. It may be a symptom of the lack of regard for physical health that there is a lack of rating scales, or that rating scales tend to exclude physical ADRs. At worst, they may inadvertently promote diagnostic over- shadowing through minimizing a MHSU's experiences and not interpreting them as credible symptoms. Jordan et al. (2004) developed the West Wales Adverse Drug Reaction Profile, which focuses a lot on physical ADRs and also has a useful health promotion section that prompts questions regarding diet and fluid intake and dental health. There are some baseline indicators that can help to inform good practice and these should be MHSU-centred. Figure 8.3 indicates factors that need to be considered for physical health monitoring in: MHSUs who will be taking medication for the first time where baseline measurements will allow for comparison with future screening. MHSUs who have been established on medication and who may not have had their physical health monitored, so there is no credible baseline for comparison. MHSUs taking more than one psychotropic medication. The main difference between these three groups will be the interventions for physical health. In new MHSUs, assessment may be for primary prevention of, for example, weight gain, whereas in established MHSUs it may be secondary or tertiary interventions to reduce weight gain. Nevertheless, some type of protocol will need to be established at a local level. Time-scales How often should these investigations be conducted? Again there is no real consensus. If money were no object, then routinely. However, to utilize resources effectively, investigations need to be targeted. The inter-professional team should decide on time-scales based on the guidance of pharmaceutical companies, best practice guidelines (e.g. NICE), the observations of practitioners, and self-reporting of MHSUs/carers.Clients taking medication for the first time Clients taking more than one psychotropic drug Clients with/without lifestyle risk factors Clients cardiac risk factorsClients established on medications Physical health monitoring Figure 8.3 Factors to consider when monitoring the physical effects of medication Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

This will provide results for com- parison. In between these times, other investigations may be carried out more routinely than others (e.g. at every contact baseline observations can be made). The results of these may prompt further investigation, for example, unstable BP for three consecutive readings may lead to an ECG. Prioritizing may begin with those who have a physical illness or increased risk that requires greater monitoring. Some time-frames are set by the nature of the treatment regime, such as monitoring WBCs and lithium levels for clozapine and lithium respectively. With regard to lithium, NICE (2006a) recommends an annual physical health review, normally in primary care, to assess for MHSUs with bipolar disorder: lipid levels, including cholesterol in all patients over 40 even if there is no other indication of risk; plasma glucose levels; weight; smoking status and alcohol use; BP. This latter approach monitors physical health from a specific illness perspective. The follow- ing approach for MHSUs taking antipsychotics is recommended by NICE (2006a): A weight check every three months for the first year, and more often if they gain weight rapidly. Plasma glucose and lipids (preferably fasting levels) should be measured three months after the start of treatment (and within one month if taking olanzapine), and more often if there is evidence of elevated levels. In patients taking risperidone, prolactin levels should be measured if symptoms of raised prolactin develop; these include low libido, sexual dysfunction, menstrual abnormalities, gynaecomastia, and galactorrhoea. Box 8.9 Case example Edward has a 20-year history of schizophrenia. He has been tried on a number of antipsy- chotics over the years with variable levels of effectiveness. He is now living in a supported house. His medication consists of one atypical antipsychotic medication administered as a depot injection and a pro re nata (P r N) benzodiazepine for agitation. Edward agrees that his diet is not healthy and that he could do more physical activity; his BMI is 32 kg/m2. He smokes 40 cigarettes per day. Edward would like to change his lifestyle but finds it hard to motivate himself. How would you encourage and empower Edward to change his lifestyle? How can you be sure the lack of motivation stems from a general disinterest in physical health (shared by many in the general population) and is not a manifestation of negative symptoms of schizophrenia? While it is impossible to cover all eventualities in monitoring ADRs, some areas that practi- tioners should consider for physical monitoring for psychotropic medications are outlined in Table 8.4.

Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 181 Psychotropic medications have always been associated with variable compliance, even when clinical improvements have been evident. Adverse drug reactions contribute to non-adherence. Service users are the only people to experience ADRs and practitioners must cope with the consequences from this. Non-adherence and partial adherence with medication in people with schizophrenia are estimated at 33 per cent each (Oehl et al. 2000). This means that only one- third of MHSUs comply with their medication.Table 8.4 areas practitioners should consider for physical monitoring for psychotropic medications Aspect Clinical investigation/measurement Rationale MHSU physical history Cardiovascular illness r espiratory disease Diabetes a ny other medical or surgical history t o get a baseline of current physical health issues so that medication regimes can reflect any risk issues Lifestyle risk factors Current diet (estimated calories) Smoking Substance misuse Physical activity Smoking, alcohol use, illicit substance use, and caffeine use are risk factors in cardiovascular illness Low levels of physical activity and poor diet lead to obesity MHSU family history Cardiovascular illness and stroke Obesity Diabetes Family history might show a genetic predisposition for physical illness Clinical observations BP Pulse ECG BMI Waist measurement Waist-to-hip ratio Urinalysis t o determine cardiac function and to assess weight gain, which is a risk factor in cardiovascular illness ECG is important, as Q t readings >450 ms will need careful cardiac assessment, >500 ms may require prescribing another medication Urinalysis will screen for metabolic and other problems Blood tests Sodium and potassium levels Cholesterol levels Fasting blood sugar (FBS) Cardiac enzymes WBCs Liver function test r enal function t hyroid function test Prolactin levels Psychotropic medications can affect potassium concentration, which can lead to Q t prolongation High cholesterol is a risk factor for atherosclerosis FBS to screen for t 2D With clozapine, troponin test for suspected risk of myocarditis WBC count should be done to exclude neutropenia r enal and thyroid function is recommended for MHSUs on long-term lithium therapy Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

(2004) found that higher BMI and subjective distress from weight gain were predictors of non-compliance. Obese individuals were more than twice as likely as those with a normal BMI to report missing their medication. Tschoner et al. (2007: 1356) report that the psychosocial consequences of weight gain, such as a sense of demoralization, physical discomfort, and being the target of sustained social stigma, are so intolerable that MHSUs may discontinue treatment even if it is effective. Kurzthaler and Fleischhacker (2001) found that weight gain was a risk factor for non-compliance, reduced quality of life, and social retreat (i.e. MHSUs not wanting to socialize). It is evident that weight gain influences compliance. However, in a small study exploring MHSUs' and clinicians' concerns about side-effects, Huffman et al. (2004) found that MHSUs considered cognitive slowing to be more detrimental, while MHNs rated weight gain as more detrimental than MHSUs or psychiatrists. A reason for this is that MHSUs may not have received health promotion interventions regarding the importance of lifestyle factors or weight gain as a severe reaction. The following indicates an example of the process that practitioners should use when they are discussing medications with MHSUs: 1 Discuss the potential benefits. 2 Discuss the potential adverse reactions. 3 Perform a physical health check and note any ADRs for baseline readings. 4 Record weight and BMI. 5 Record smoking behaviour. 6 Assess alcohol intake. 7 Advise not to stop medication without first discussing it. 8 Encourage disclosure if stopping medication. As we have seen previously, medication monitoring is not a standard practice for MHNs and many MHSUs are not informed of possible adverse reactions. Ethical issues Practitioners need to think very carefully about the implications of caring for MHSUs taking medications that are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. M\u00f6ller (2000) suggests that atypical antipsychotics will be better accepted by MHSUs because their fewer side-effects will lead to increased compliance providing a better quality of life. This is a standard defence in the use of atypical medications - fewer means better. However, fewer ADRs does not nec- essarily mean less severe. The only true judge of the severity of reactions is the MHSU, who will probably continue to experience them for as long as they take medication. Mental health nurses need to realize that for some service users, ADRs may be very severe and even fatal. Practitioners, especially nurse prescribers, must fully appreciate the ethical aspects of MHSUs taking medications that have the potential to leave them with a chronic physical condition, or worse. While it is good practice to highlight the positive aspects of medication on mental health, practitioners must step up to the challenge of physical ADRs. One cannot shrug off 10 kg of weight gain with an observation that 'at least your voices are gone'. Weight gain can affect self-esteem, lead to increased social exclusion, and compromise physical health. Medication monitoring and carers/family members Reinhard et al. (2008: 349) explore the various ways in which carers/family provide care to ill family members, suggesting that this care can range from providing direct care to perform- ing complex monitoring tasks (e.g. monitoring blood sugar and titrating narcotic dosages for Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Medication, adverse drug reactions, and physical health 183 pain). Carers/family members undertake a huge caring role for which mental health services should be extremely grateful. Service users rely on this help, probably much more than they do state supports, as this help is constant and in the home environment. It is also the type of support that underpins the notion of recovery. Mental health services have been developing different support programmes and educational supports to help carers/family cope in their caring role. There is very little research evidence about the role of carers/family in medication monitoring, but they take on a major caring role in the absence of MHNs and medication moni- toring will be part of that role. Figure 8.4 highlights the different aspects of the carer/family role in medication monitoring. These simply mirror the healthcare practitioner role, but carers/ family members will lack professional and propositional knowledge in psychopharmacology. If carers/family get involved in medication monitoring, they will need education to improve their knowledge and skills - from administration to recognizing side-effects. There may be a reluctance to allow this to happen. However, carers/family may be forced to undertake this role because mental health professionals do not tend to perform well in this area (see Nash 2011). Carer/family medication monitoring risks and dilemmas In a qualitative research study, Marquez and Ram\u00edrez Garc\u00eda (2011) found that while caregiv- ers were aware of the positive effects medications had on stabilizing their relatives' symptoms, they also expressed concern over the side-effects of medication, long-term use, and recognized limitations of the medications. There are risks associated with carers/family monitoring medi- cation. As in health services in general, drug administration errors can occur in the home (e.g. providing too much medication, giving medication in error, or forgetting to give medication if the carer/family member is working or has household chores to do). Furthermore, literacy and numeracy deficits may make drug calculations and instructions difficult to follow.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. 184 Physical health and well-being in practice Carers/family are not formally trained to administer medication, so this could increase risk of errors and undertaking this role will increase the burden of care. It may also be ethically questionable, as well as emotionally distressing, for carers/family to observe and monitor loved ones experiencing ADRs. This may provoke feelings of guilt, so supportive counselling to deal with this may be required. We know that carers/family members monitor medication and we need to support them practically, emotionally, and educationally so that they can do this confidently and safely. Conclusion Although rare, ADRs can be fatal. We need to have the prerequisite knowledge and skills to assess and screen for physical ADRs in order to reduce any risks to the MHSU. This is one rea- son why we need to have good knowledge of physical care. We must also be diligent with our physical assessment, as Reilly et al. (2002) found that information on smoking, drinking, and taking illicit drugs was usually missing from the patient case notes. The use of psychotropic medications is, at times, ethically very challenging for practition- ers. We are faced with difficult choices between managing risk associated with mental illness or specific symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, and the physical health risks we see developing in MHSUs (e.g. obesity and diabetes). One small step we can take, which will make a huge difference to the physical health of MHSUs, is to regularly monitor and screen for ADRs. Summary of key points Practitioners are required to have the skills and knowledge to recognize ADRs. Practitioners should consult guidelines for physical screening of MHSUs taking various psychotropic medications. Practitioners should implement the recommendations of expert groups (e.g. NICE) regard- ing monitoring physical health in MHSUs taking medications. Practitioners should keep up to date with ADRs when MHSUs commence new types of medi- cations or change medication regimes.

Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 9 Introduction In 2007, NICE (2007a) published clinical guidelines for acutely ill patients in hospital. Although emphasizing emergency care in acute hospital settings, there are some very good pointers that can be utilized in mental health settings. These guidelines emphasize that the sooner we recognize physical deterioration and intervene, the better the outcome will be for patients. Early detection is based on 'track and trigger' systems. Physiological track and trigger sys- tems rely on periodic observation of selected basic physiological signs ('tracking') with prede- termined calling or response criteria ('trigger') for requesting the attendance of staff who have specific competencies in the management of acute illness and/or critical care (NICE 2007a). For example, baseline observations and blood serum levels may be track and trigger criteria for lithium toxicity. Professional responsibilities regarding clinical observations must be clear. For students this will be competence in taking, recording, and passing on information regarding any Chapter contents Medical emergencies in mental health- care Emergency medical equipment Basic principles of first aid and basic life support Diabetic emergencies, stroke and sei-zures Risk to physical health during restraint Psychotropic medications and medical emergencies Learning outcomes By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: Identify specific medical emergencies in mental health settings Recognize risk factors that can contribute to medical emergencies Understand the role of the mental health nurse in various medical emergencies Identify how the nurse can provide care to MHSUs in a state of collapse Describe the nursing care priorities during medical emergencies Box 9.1 Exercise What are the basic principles of life support?

Guidelines from NICE (2007a) recommend that staff caring for patients in acute hospital settings should have competencies in monitoring, measurement, interpretation, and prompt response to the acutely ill patient appropriate to the level of care they are providing. The National Patient Safety Agency (2008) revealed wide variations in standards of resus- citation in mental health and learning disability settings. Of 599 reports of at least moderate harm related to choking or cardiac/respiratory arrest, they found 26 incidents of significant lack of staff knowledge or skills, including identifying cardiac arrest and availability of equip-ment (e.g. basic mask-to-mouth devices). Needless to say, we all have a professional duty to be up to date with our first aid or basic life support training. Practitioners should thus consider revising these clinical skills, maybe a yearly clinical skills training day. Emergency medical equipment Each clinical area will have an emergency medical trolley, sometimes referred to as a 'crash' trolley. While there is no universal list of what such a trolley should contain, it will have a range of essential equipment required to intervene in the event of a medical emergency. A suction device, defibrillator, intubation tube, and air bag will be integral pieces of equipment (see also MERT bag below). A range of emergency medication will also be on board, including IV drugs such as benzodiazepines for status epilepsy or adrenaline for anaphylactic shock. Whatever is included on the emergency trolley, we should ensure that: Equipment is up to date and electrical equipment checked and calibrated regularly. Single-use items are sterile, securely packaged, and within their 'use by' date. Medications are within their 'use by' date. (These medications should not be used as replace- ments if ward stock runs out.) Metherall et al. (2006) set up 24-hour medical emergency response teams (MERTs) to ensure effective responses to medical and psychiatric emergencies. Each MERT has an emergency bag that contains the following equipment, with other equipment brought from wards as required: pulse oximeter; thermometer; manual sphygmomanometer and stethoscope; blood machine; pocket face mask; selection of guedel airways; variety of first aid equipment including gloves and gauze; tuff cut shears; ligature cutters; pen torch; paperwork - pen, dry wipe pen, log book, pre-arrest call criteria, record of cardiac arrest form, and physical observations chart. What do we mean by medical emergencies in mental health? A medical emergency is any event that poses a serious risk to the physical health of a MHSU. This risk is normally immediate, such as a myocardial infarction. However, it can also be grad-ual, unless immediate care is given to reduce the risk (e.g. minor lithium toxicity if left undetec-ted and untreated will develop into an immediate emergency).

Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 187 allow practitioners to determine if the event they are assessing is of a routine or emergency nature. The following medical emergencies will be explored in this chapter: cardiac arrest; respiratory arrest; electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to physical health during restraint; rapid tranquillization. A quick response to a medical emergency is crucial for the MHSU's immediate and long-term health. If medical or nursing care is not given immediately, or interventions not sustained, the outcome could be death or disability. Responses to emergencies need to be swift and coordi-nated. You should know the medical emergency policy and the emergency telephone number of your workplace. Students should be mindful that the emergency number will change with different placements, so ensure you are aware of it. The primary aim of intervention in a medical emergency is to prevent further deterioration in physical health, including respiration and circulation. This may be achieved by: basic first aid; basic and/or advanced life support; medical interventions, including defibrillation, intubation, and giving emergency medica- tions, e.g. adrenaline; immediate transfer to an intensive care facility. The outcome of any intervention is not guaranteed but all possible interventions should be tried and maintained until such time as the MHSU has recovered, transferred to an appropriate medical facility or is pronounced dead by a doctor. Basic principles of first aid and basic life support As nurses we do not receive certification as first aiders as part of our training, even though our training covers principles of first aid. We may be offered the opportunity to become designated first aiders as part of our in-house training, but this seems a ridiculous irony. Whatever the local policy regarding first aid is, we should all have attended a course on basic life support. Basic life support is regarded as a mandatory training requirement for all staff, as are refreshers/ updates. If you have not completed such a course, you should do so as a matter of urgency. Basic life support may be required when we find a MHSU in a state of collapse and is a com- bination of rescue breathing (mouth to mouth) and chest compressions performed to preserve life. This combination sustains some form of cardiorespiratory activity, which can keep a per-son alive until emergency services arrive. Most mental health units will have a defibrillation machine, which should be used as part of life support. These are relatively straightforward to use and instruction in how to use one will be a feature of the aforementioned training. Acute physical deterioration can impair the function of key body systems, including the res- piratory (breathlessness), cardiovascular (heart attack), and neurological (unconsciousness) systems. The most worrying medical emergency is probably collapse with unconsciousness Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

In a medical emergency, a rapid and structured assessment is required for prompt and appropriate emergency treatment to be given. The Resuscitation Council UK (2011) recommends using the A, B, C, D, E approach to emergencies, as it will enable nurses to prioritize interventions: A - Airway: opening the airway. B - Breathing: checking for breathing. C - Circulation: observing any major bleeding. D - Disability: observe neurological state. E - Exposure: to secondary injury as a result of collapse or other physical complication. On discovering someone unconscious, a primary survey is conducted which consists of check- ing the casualty using the ABCDE system. A secondary survey is conducted if the MHSU is alert. This includes checking each part of the body from head to toe (see Chapter 3) to assess the extent of any injury or illness before treatment is given (Kindleysides 2007). What might cause collapse? There are many avenues to collapse and the better we know our MHSUs, their medical back- grounds and current treatments, then the better informed we will be regarding causes of any collapse. Depending on the severity, the medical emergencies listed on p. 187 may have col-lapse as a feature. Cardiac arrest Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops. This prevents the flow of oxygenated blood to the vital organs. It is a medical emergency requiring prompt intervention. Following the primary survey, you need to begin chest compressions and rescue breathing. In the UK, the recommended ratio is 30 chest compressions for two rescue breaths (Resuscitation Council UK 2005). The algorithm shown in Figure 9.1 is usually used in UK hospitals. For community practitioners who find a MHSU collapsed at home, a 999 call should be made and neighbours can also be called to help. Basic life support should be given until paramedics arrive. Box 9.2 Exercise What are the signs and symptoms of cardiac arrest? Box 9.3 Case example Kwame is a 50-year-old male with a history of psychotic disorder and hypertension. His current medication is chlorpromazine 100 mg QID and procyclidine 5 mg BD. He smokes 40 cigarettes a day, takes little exercise, and eats an irregular and unhealthy diet. Janet finds Kwame in a state of collapse in the bathroom. What does Janet do? 1 Janet tries to rouse Kwame by calling his name and gently shaking him: Kwame remains unresponsive. 2 Janet monitors A, B, C, D, E. 3 Janet shouts for help and pulls the emergency alarm cord in the bathroom area. Kwame does not have a pulse; he is cold and clammy to touch and is not breathing. 4 Janet begins to give basic life support - 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths (the first two rescue breaths are not necessary; Resuscitation Council UK 2005).

Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 189 Respiratory arrest Respiratory failure is defined as inadequate gas exchange - hypoxaemia - where there is reduced oxygenation of arterial blood (Brashers and Huether 2004). Signs of respiratory failure include:Collapsed sick patient Shout HELP and assess patient NOSigns of life?YES Call Resuscitation Team CPR 30:2 with oxygen and airway adjuncts Advanced Life Support when Resuscitation Team arriveApply pads/monitor Attempt defibrillation if TeamCall Resuscitation Team if appropriateAssess ABCDE Recognize and treat Oxygen, monitoring, IV access Figure 9.1 Algorithm for resuscitation in hospital.

Janet instructs one nurse to get the pulse oximeter and defibrillator and the other to call in a medical emer-gency. The defibrillator arrives and Janet proceeds to administer advanced life support. She then attaches the pulse oximeter. 6 The duty doctor and crash team arrive, Janet quickly hands over and leaves Kwame in their care. Janet's diagnosis is cardiac arrest. This is based on her knowledge of: physical health; Kwame's history and condition; her basic life support training. Her actions are swift and coordinated and in line with established practice. This is the level of practice required for effective interventions in a medical emergency situation. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

In respiratory arrest, MHSUs may stop breathing due to: airway obstruction, e.g. asphyxiation; drug overdose; injury or trauma; prelude to cardiac arrest. In mental health settings, respiratory arrest may be caused by asphyxiation (e.g. hanging or suffocation with car fumes). It is important that action is prompt and direct. The MHSU may still have a pulse, so the priority will be to recommence breathing either by rescue breath-ing or mechanically. The principles of the primary survey and the resuscitation algorithm in Figure 9.1 will be used. If you discover someone hanging, you should: call for help; cut the person down, but be careful that they do not fall and sustain a head injury; remove the ligature; initiate basic life support; transfer to a medical setting. You should try to stabilize the MHSU's head during basic life support, as you do not want to induce further trauma to the neck area. You should also observe the MHSU in case they vomit, carefully placing them in the recovery position to prevent choking. Suction, oxygen, and pulse oximetry equipment should be available. Basic life support will be employed and respirations monitored until the emergency team arrives and the MHSU's care is transferred to them. Electroconvulsive therapy and post-general anaesthetic recovery Electroconvulsive therapy is a controversial treatment in mental health. In ECT, service users receive a general anaesthetic, so it is important that 'ECT nurses' are trained in post-operative recovery techniques, respiratory assessment, and advanced life support, even though a quali-fied anaesthetist and doctor will be part of the ECT team. Cullen (2004) suggests that the ECT nurse should have knowledge of: the actions required in the event of a medical emergency (e.g. suxamethonium apnoea, malignant hyperpyrexia, laryngospasm); the drugs used for ECT, their appropriate doses, potential side-effects, and the appropriate treatment of these; dosing policy; the local protocol for termination of prolonged seizures. Nursing care prior to electroconvulsive therapy Electroconvulsive therapy involves administration of a general anaesthetic, so the MHSU should be fasted for 8-10 hours prior to the procedure (check your local policy, as fasting times may vary). Medication is generally not given prior to ECT; however, if a MHSU has an existing condition, they may be permitted it. The MHSU should be encouraged to go to the toi-let prior to treatment to prevent soiling of clothes. Once in the ECT area, the nurse will ask the MHSU to remove any objects that may cause harm during the seizure; this includes dentures, prostheses, jewellery, and nail varnish (Patton 2008). Nursing care following ECT should be as follows (adapted from Finch 2005): The recovery area must contain suction, monitoring, and emergency equipment. Oxygen should be administered routinely to the patient. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 191 Maintain the MHSU's airway and regularly monitor/record vital signs. The MHSU should be observed by a staff member until they wake up. When ready, the MHSU should be escorted to a final stage area for refreshments and rest until the recovery staff deem them fit to return to the ward. The recovery nurse should pass on information to the ward nurse/escort about the MHSU's condition, medication administered, behaviour, untoward procedures or treatment response. The MHSU should be encouraged to rest. If the MHSU complains of a headache or muscle soreness, analgesia such as paracetamol may be prescribed and administered. Nausea may be treated with a prescribed anti-emetic. Ward staff should continue to provide support to the MHSU. Box 9.4 ExerciseWhat are the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia? Diabetic emergencies Homeostasis of glucose control In a state of homeostasis, there is a balance between blood glucose and insulin levels. An imbal - ance can lead to too much glucose in our system (hyperglycaemia) or too little glucose (hypogly - caemia). When glucose levels increase, beta cells in the pancreas are stimulated to release insulin, which acts to lower blood glucose levels. When glucose levels fall, glucagon is released prompt - ing the liver to break down stores of glycogen, which raises blood glucose levels. Hyperglycae - mia and hypoglycaemia are two emergencies that we can encounter in mental health settings. Hyperglycaemia In Chapter 8, we explored metabolic ADRs and examined how atypical antipsychotics seem to have a greater propensity for these. Hyperglycaemia can result in new-onset T2D, meta-bolic Urrutia 2006). Hyperglycaemia can occur when: the body does not produce enough insulin; the MHSU has not taken their insulin; the MHSU has under-dosed, e.g. due to poor injection technique; the insulin therapy regime is not adequate; the MHSU has eaten too much sugary or starchy food; the MHSU has a physical illness such as an infection. If left untreated, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a potentially life- threatening condition where blood glucose levels are markedly raised. Provan (2007) suggests that diabetic ketoacidosis should be considered as a diagnosis in unconscious or hyperventilat- ing MHSUs. Symptoms may include: nausea/vomiting; drop' breath; Downloaded by [ University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. 192 Physical health and well-being in practice Kussmaul breathing (see Table 4.13); confusion or clouding of consciousness; abdominal cramps. If left untreated, the MHSU can fall into a diabetic coma and die. Clinical investigations that can be used to diagnose diabetic ketoacidosis include: Blood tests - a blood glucose level >12 mmol/L (Palmer 2004). Metabolic acidosis - pH ABGs). Pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation. Urinalysis indicating high readings for ketones and glucose. Tachycardia. Abnormal respiration (see above). Nursing intervention in diabetic ketoacidosis If a MHSU has diabetes mellitus, you should be aware of the potential complications of hyper- glycaemia. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a complication that requires prompt intervention. You should ask your MHSU routine questions as a means of eliciting information about their condi-tion, for example: 'Have you lost consciousness?', 'Have you experienced changes in your level of consciousness, such as confusion or unusual sleepiness?' Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency and immediate medical help is required if you notice any signs or symptoms. If you are not sure of the dosage of insulin or whether the MHSU has taken insulin, do not attempt to administer insulin. Wait for emergency help. Palmer (2004) suggests that we use the first seven letters of the alphabet as a guide to intervention in diabetic ketoacidosis: A - Airway support: depending on level of consciousness. B - Breathing: administer oxygen and monitor respiratory rate and rhythm. C - Circulation: monitor BP and pulse. D - Drug therapy: insulin will be required as part of the emergency treatment. E - Electrolyte replacement: an IV infusion may be required to replace sodium and potas- sium lost during polyuria and/or vomiting. F - Fluid resuscitation: to correct dehydration. G - Gases: monitor ABGs for metabolic acidosis. It is important that you have some training in the area of diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis. Assessing training needs is explored in the next chapter. Hypoglycaemia When there is insufficient glucose in the circulation, hypoglycaemia can occur. This can result from: insulin overdose (purposive or accidental); inadequate dietary intake; missed meals; excessive exercise; alcohol use. University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 193 palpitations; tachycardia; restlessness; tremors; headache. Without treatment, convulsions, coma, and death may follow. In the early stages of hypoglycaemia, MHSUs will experience sweating, hand tremor, hunger, and palpitations. These should be viewed as early warning signs when we educate MHSUs in maintain - ing their health. At this stage, a sweet drink or a high sugar snack should restore glucose balance. If MHSUs experience changes in consciousness, refer them to the ward doctor or GP. If you find a MHSU in a state of collapse due to hypoglycaemia, summon emergency help and give basic life support as required (e.g. place the MHSU in the recovery position). All wards should have an emergency injection of glucagon at the ready to be used in unconscious MHSUs, as giving oral agents might lead to choking. Y ou should not attempt to administer insulin. Once glucagon has been administered, the MHSU should regain consciousness. Y ou should talk to them, providing reassurance. They should be examined by the doctor and kept under regular observations. Haemorrhage Table 9.1 Effects of blood or fluid loss Approximate fluid lost Effects on the body Half a litre (about 1 pint) Very little or no effect. This is normally the amount taken in a blood donor session Up to 2 litres (3.5 pints) Hormones such as adrenaline are released, causing the pulse to increase and inducing sweating. Small blood vessels in non-vital areas, such as the skin, shut down to divert blood and oxygen to the vital organs. Signs of shock become evident Two litres (3.5 pints) or more (about one-third of the usual volume in the average adult) As blood or fluid loss approaches this level, the radial pulse becomes difficult to find. The casualty will lose consciousness. Breathing may cease and the casualty may go into cardiac arrest Source: Kindleysides (2007)Box 9.5 Case example Sally is 19 and has been diagnosed as having a borderline personality disorder. She has been transferred to your acute inpatient ward from casualty following a self-poisoning event in which she ingested 20 paracetamol. Her blood levels are fine. In between her 15-minute observa-tions, Sally has managed to self-harm by cutting her arm very deeply. She is bleeding heavily. How do you respond to this emergency? In mental health settings, MHSUs who self-harm by cutting are at risk of losing blood. A severe cut can lead to significant blood loss, which can cause hypovolaemia - decreased blood vol-ume in the circulation (see Table 9.1). Hypovolaemia increases the risk of shock and cardiac arrest due to the decreased supply of blood and the increased strain placed on the heart to Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Prompt action to stem bleeding and trans- fer to an emergency setting is a priority. Discovering someone who has cut themselves severely can be a frightening and distressing experience, for both MHSU and staff. Nurses should be calm and professional when they are dealing with such incidents and should not be judgemental. Our first priority is the MHSU's physical well-being. If the MHSU is unconscious and bleeding, this is a medical emergency. An ambulance should be called for and the MHSU supported with basic life support. They should be placed in the recovery position and pressure applied to the wound to stem the bleeding. Be careful to ensure that the implement used in the incident is not embedded in the wound, as applying pressure to this can result in further injury. You should also remember the principles of infection control and use appropriate barrier methods when providing care (e.g. gloves and an apron). Implements used in the incident should be disposed of in a sharps box. Following the incident, it is important that the area is sanitized and all hazardous waste appropriately disposed of. If the MHSU is conscious, wound location should be assessed. For example, if the site of cutting is the neck area you may have to maintain an open airway, as blood may cause an obstruction. For arm or leg wounds, you will have to stem the flow of bleeding. Gauze should be applied directly over the wound and firm pressure placed on this. Limbs should be raised above heart level to reduce blood loss; for leg wounds, for example, MHSUs should be prone and their leg elevated. Service users should not eat or drink anything at this stage and you should continuously monitor their breathing and level of consciousness. Reassurance should be given while waiting for transfer to an acute hospital setting. Overdose Overdose can be a curious event in mental health. Sometimes the MHSU may come and tell you they have taken something or they may say nothing and be found in a state of collapse. If the mental health practitioner is at hand, they will in a key position to assess using ABCDE, imple - ment basic life support, and hand over to emergency staff. A useful telephone number to have as part of the emergency medical response is the national poisoning unit of your jurisdiction. In England and Wales, it is 0845 4647 or 111 (NHS Direct); in Scotland, it is 08454 24 24 24 (NHS 24). Service users who tell you they have overdosed If a MHSU reports taking an overdose, you should implement the emergency medical proce- dure - you cannot risk second-guessing that the MHSU is lying just to gain attention. If they are, this will only be discovered following thorough examination and treatment. It is always better to be safe than sorry. Assessment of overdose Ask the MHSU: what type of substance(s) they have taken; how much of the substance(s) they have taken; when they took the substance(s); whether they have noticed any effects such as palpitations, sweating, dizziness; where the substance(s) were taken; whether anything else was taken. Service users should be placed on one-to-one observation, not only to ensure they do not take anything else, but to prevent any injury that might occur if they suddenly become unwell and faint. Baseline observations should be taken and documented at 15-minute intervals while Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 195 awaiting transfer to the general hospital setting. Service users should not be allowed to eat or drink anything prior to a medical assessment. Service users who have not told you they have overdosed and are found collapsed Trying to discover why someone has collapsed is secondary to the task of ensuring their imme- diate physical health and well-being. At times we might have an idea, while at others we just have to provide emergency life support until the MHSU is transferred to an acute care setting. A MHSU collapsed due to overdose will not be able to provide any information, so you must do the following: remember ABCDE; ensure basic first aid is provided; place MHSU into recovery position to prevent asphyxiation; get medical/emergency help; arrange for immediate transfer; check for evidence of anything that may have been ingested (blister packs or empty medi- cine bottles). Following such an incident, continuous observation and monitoring is important. This may include blood tests to check blood plasma levels of any medications (e.g. paracetamol) that may have been taken. Service users will also need to be informed of the long-term risks of the substances that they have overdosed on. For example, liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of paracetamol (MHRA 2014). Box 9.6 ExerciseWhat is your local clinical care guideline for intoxication? Substance use and intoxication Although a general problem in society, substance use has a greater impact on more vulnerable population sub-groups. If a MHSU has substance (mis) use as well as a mental illness, this is referred to as a 'dual diagnosis'. Substance use is a problem in mental health care for a number of reasons: 1 It is dangerous to mix alcohol and street drugs with psychotropic medication. This can result in death, accidental overdose or increased rates of accidents (e.g. falls and head injuries). 2 It can delay recovery, such as when psychosis may have receded but the person requires treatment for a substance misuse problem. 3 Alcohol reduces one's ability to control impulsive behaviour, so someone with a history of self-harm who drinks alcohol may have reduced tolerance to emotional distress, which in turn may result in self-harming behaviour. 4 Substance use may increase risk-taking behaviour (e.g. sharing needles), as one's ability to make safe judgements is impaired. 5 In the UK, the Department of Health (DH 2006c: 9) suggests that MHSUs may use sub-stances to help them cope with the symptoms of their mental illness (e.g. it blocks out voices or reduces feelings of anxiety); it is part of their lifestyle; it relieves boredom. 6 Substance use can exacerbate existing mental health problems, thus delaying recovery. 7 Substance use can result in physical conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver, blood disor-ders such as HIV and hepatitis, acute withdrawal states, increased risk of seizures, pancrea-titis, gastrointestinal problems, and diabetes.

It is therefore important for mental health nurses to regularly assess the use of substances in their caseload (see caseload profiling in Chapter 2) because we know from experience that MHSUs get intoxicated at times, either at home or in hospital. Our immediate concern should be the MHSU's physical safety rather than their reasons for drinking. Intoxication may not be linked to high alcohol intake, as it can arise when drinking safely but in combination with pre-scribed medications. Most medication labels come with a warning advising abstinence from alcohol during treatment. Intoxication may also arise from the use of illicit substances such as cannabis, heroin, and cocaine. It is therefore important to ascertain what has been taken, as sometime multiple substances are ingested. If a MHSU returns to the ward intoxicated, you should: assess the severity of intoxication, e.g. take a breathalyser reading; elicit the type of substance used, e.g. alcohol or drugs (perform a urine/saliva drug test); inform the ward or duty doctor; place intoxicated individuals on bed rest and continuous observation; remember ABCDE: A - Airway: may not be obstructed but the person should be placed in the recovery position to prevent asphyxiation and reduce risk of aspiration into the lungs if they vomit. B - Breathing: closely monitor respiration rate. Alcohol is a substance with power - ful sedative effects that can depress the CNS. Psychotropic drugs also depress the CNS. Therefore, a combination of the two can be potentially life-threatening, as this can have adverse effects on cardiac, respiratory, and neurological function. Extreme intoxication may require pulse oximetry and very close observation. C - Circulation: baseline observations should be recorded routinely. This should be dis-cussed with the doctor; because it may be impractical to take BP readings every 15 minutes, the doctor may recommend hourly or 2-hourly readings. D - Disability: monitor level of consciousness, secure. E - Exposure: Prevent accidental injury by using side rails when in bed, and place on continuous observation. The doctor should advise about medication, which may be with-held in the intervening period. Ensure that this is clearly documented in case notes and medication chart. For MHSUs in the community, it is not as easy to implement a plan of care such as this. Community practitioners require policy and organizational support regarding how to respond effectively to MHSUs intoxicated at home. It would be unfair to place the onus on practitioners to develop plans, as this may conflict with clinical governance standards of risk management. Organizational responses should be underpinned by the experience of practitioners. This would make for good policy and safe clinical decision-making. A basic approach may be a referral to the local dual diagnosis team for some additional support. If a home 'detox' is required, the local substance misuse team should be contacted for an opinion and assessment. The service user's GP should also be advised about any alcohol treatment plan. The community mental health nurse could advise on local Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and any other peer support that could be provided.

Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 197 Seizures Seizures are also referred to as fits or convulsions. A seizure typically describes an extreme body stiffness accompanied with severe shaking. Seizures occur for a number of reasons and may not be linked to epilepsy. The UK Epilepsy Society (2012) differentiates between epileptic seizures (caused by a disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain) and non-epileptic seizures (NES) (not caused by electrical disturbances). Non-epileptic seizures can be observed in diabetes (caused by hypo- and hyperglycaemia), brain injury or tumour, delirium, and alcohol or drug withdrawal. Dissociative seizures may occur in relation to extreme stress or emotional distress (Epilepsy Society 2012). Seizures are included here because some psy - chotropic medications (e.g. clozapine) lower the seizure threshold, which increases the risk of seizures. Seizure activity Generalized seizures usually follow a staged pattern. The individual may experience an 'aura', a feeling, or an early warning sign, that a seizure is about to commence. This is followed by the tonic phase - muscles contract and the individual's body stiffens. This phase has a risk of physical injury, such as hitting one's head when falling to the ground or biting the tongue. Respiration is also affected in this phase and cyanosis can occur. This is followed by the clonic phase, in which the limbs jerk as the muscles tighten and relax. Incontinence may occur and no attempts should be made to control limb movements, as this could cause injury. The post-ictal state follows a seizure and the individual may feel confused, tired, and have memory loss. This state can last for minutes or days (Epilepsy Action 2013). Status epilepticus Status epilepticus is a continuous, generalized, convulsive seizure lasting more than 20 min- utes, or a series of seizures from which the person does not regain consciousness (Downing 2009: 228). However, Arif and Hirsch (2008) suggest that a seizure that persists for more than 5 minutes should be considered status epilepticus, as very few single seizures last this long. Guidelines from NICE (2012) suggest that emergency care be given for prolonged seizures (lasting 5 minutes or more) or repeated seizures (three or more in an hour). Status epilepticus is prolonged seizure activity and is an emergency, as it is unlikely to stop without treatment and hypoxia and brain damage are a real risk. Nursing care in status epilepticus Status epilepticus can be a distressing event for those that witness one. The ABCDE approach should be applied here. In serious cases, transfer to a general hospital setting, even inten-sive care, may be warranted. You must remain calm, professional, and focused on the MHSU throughout this type of emergency, which can be prolonged. A - Airway: in the tonic seizure phase respiration is compromised, so clear airway main- tenance is vital. Observe that the tongue has not been injured or is blocking the airway. Intubation may be required in severe cases. B - Breathing: Page and McKinney (2012) recommend recording and monitoring respira-tion rate, pulse oximetry, and ABGs (the latter most probably in an emergency medical setting). Oxygen should be administered, as hypoxia is a risk. C - Circulation: monitor BP, pulse, observe for cyanosis and cold extremities. D - Disability: monitor level of consciousness on Glasgow Coma Scale, monitor pupil reflex and document findings. E - Exposure: assess and manage secondary physical injury arising from seizure (e.g. falls, tongue injury), observe cannuale sites for phlebitis (inflammation of needle site).

These have a respiratory depressive effect, so observation is critically impor- tant. Appropriate precautions in handling and disposing of sharps should be followed to pre-vent accidental injury. It is important that emergency medical procedures are followed to ensure fast and appropriate care in this critical event. Care following status epilepticus Seizure threshold can be maintained by optimizing seizure control (NICE 2012) and this may need a neurological opinion, as epilepsy is not a psychiatric condition. You may need to advo-cate for MHSUs to get access to such specialist services. Epilepsy is a complex yet manageable condition and people with epilepsy lead fulfilling lives. Service users who experience seizure activity should be offered reassurance that their condition can be effectively managed. As with all ADRs (see Chapter 8), the delicate balance between positive mental health and side-effects needs to be carefully negotiated. It may be that in severe cases medications that lower seizure threshold are discontinued. Box 9.8 Case example Rita is a very active 80-year-old woman who has been admitted to your ward for two weeks respite care. You admit Rita and complete a brief physical assessment that shows all base-line observations are appropriate for her age. She is not confused and she is oriented to time, place, and person. You introduce Rita to some of the other residents and leave them to chat. A little while later you return to speak with Rita and find her asleep on a chair. You try to arouse her but she is very slow, confused, having difficulty moving her arm, and her face has dropped on the left-hand side. What do you think has happened and how would you respond? Stroke Stroke is often referred to as a cardiovascular accident. It is an acute medical emergency because severe impairment or death might result without swift intervention. The WHO define stroke as 'a clinical syndrome of rapidly developing clinical signs of focal and global dis-turbance of cerebral function, lasting more than 24 hrs or leading to death' (Hatano, 1976). Approximately 110,000 people a year will have a stroke or a recurring stroke in England (NICE 2008b). Stroke can lead to mental health problems, and thus is a general population health issue. However, there are few statistics on the prevalence of stroke in MHSUs. It may be stere-otypical to assume that stroke is confined to care of older people services. The risk factors for stroke are very prevalent in MHSUs, which means this group might be at an increased risk of stroke. There are two types of stroke (Cross 2008): ischaemic stroke is caused by a thrombosis - blockage of the blood supply, which drasti-cally reduces oxygen supply to the brain; haemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and blood flows into surrounding tissue. Symptoms of stroke Symptoms will depend on which parts of the brain have been compromised. However, there will be a sudden and dramatic deterioration in health characterized by numbness, weakness or paralysis, slurred speech, blurred vision, confusion, and severe headache (NICE 2008b).

Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 199 symptoms may include altered sensation, loss of balance, and visual disturbance (Downing 2009). Governments support and invest in public health campaigns aimed at increasing knowledge of stroke and symptoms. The FAST campaign in the UK characterizes a stroke event, outlining what we should look for and what we should do. FAST is an acronym for Face, Arm, Speech, Time: Face: Has their face fallen on one side? Can they smile? Arms: Can they raise both arms and keep them there? Speech: Is their speech slurred? Time to call 999 if you see any single one of these signs. NHS UK (2010) Stroke FAST poster Once you suspect someone has had a stroke, use the ABCDE approach until the person has been transferred to a medical facility: A - Airway: may not be obstructed but there may be difficulty swallowing. B - Breathing: monitor respiration rate, use pulse oximetry, use pillows/cushions for sup- port until transfer. C - Circulation: monitor BP and pulse regularly. D - Disability: monitor level of consciousness, support affected side with pillows/cushions until transfer. E - Exposure: physical assessment will be required in case of secondary injury if the indi- vidual has been found collapsed. If incontinent, clean and change the individual, respecting their dignity and offer them continuous reassurance because they may be aware of what has happened but not be able to communicate. Medical transfer should be arranged immediately you suspect a stroke. Your area should have a clinical guideline for emergency response in cases of stroke that you should be up to date with. If there is no such guideline, why not be innovative and develop one? Can psychotropic medications cause medical emergencies? In rare cases, psychotropic medications can cause medical emergencies. Psychotropic med- ications do not need to be taken in large quantities, as in overdose, to provoke a medical emergency. Chapter 8 explored ADRs that can occur on maintenance doses of medication. However, certain medications such as tricyclic antidepressants when taken as an overdose can be fatal. When MHSUs are highly agitated, they may require rapid tranquillization; this has been known to result in a medical emergency. Here we explore medical emergencies linked to psychotropic medications, including: lithium toxicity; NMS; serotonin syndrome; rapid tranquillization. Lithium toxicity Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic range, making it more likely that MHSUs will experi- ence adverse effects. If these go undiagnosed, they may lead to lithium toxicity, which can be Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Lithium toxicity is related to the concentration of lithium in blood plasma. However, side-effects of lithium toxicity can occur even within therapeutic doses. The thera-peutic range of lithium is 0.4-1.0 mmol/L (BNF 2013). Mild to moderate lithium intoxication can occur at doses above 1 mmol/L. The signs of mild to moderate toxicity include: gastrointestinal symptoms - cramp, diarrhoea; neurological symptoms - hand tremor, disorientation, confusion, ataxia; blurred vision, thirst, drowsiness. Lithium overdose can occur above 1.5 mmol/L and may be fatal. A lithium concentration above 2 mmol/L is a medical emergency and requires treatment indicated under the emergency treatment of poisoning (BNF 2013: 241). The toxic effects of lithium include: nystagmus (involuntary rapid pupil movement); convulsions; renal muscle twitching, course hand tremor; severe vomiting and diarrhoea; seizures or coma; if untreated, death. Treatment of lithium intoxication In mild cases of intoxication, withdrawal of lithium and generous amounts of sodium salts and fluid will reverse toxicity. In severe cases, treatment with haemodialysis might be required if there are neurological symptoms or renal failure (BNF 2013: 40). Activated charcoal is not to be used, as it does not bind to lithium ions (Timmer and Sands 1999). Lithium intoxication may occur as an ADR resulting from the maintenance use of lithium. However, severe poisoning occurs as a result of overdose. When overdose occurs, the treatment of lithium poisoning is a priority. Timmer and Sands (1999) recommend the following: protect oral airway if consciousness is impaired; IV normal saline if volume depleted; whole-bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol (to prevent absorption); sodium polystyrene sulphonate (replaces lithium with sodium); haemodialysis: lithium level of 0.6 mEq/L: any patient; lithium level of 0.4 mEq/L: any patient on chronic lithium therapy; lithium level of 2.5-4.0 mEq/L: any patient with severe neurologic symptoms, renal insuf- ficiency, or unstable hemodynamically or neurologically; lithium level of 2.5 mEq/L: haemodialysis indicated only for patients with end-stage renal disease or patients whose lithium levels increase after admission or who fail to reach a lithium level below 1 mEq/L in 30 h. In cases of overdose, further advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service (http://www.npis.org). Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a life-threatening, neurological disorder caused by an adverse reaction to neuroleptic drugs. It has been described in association with all neuroleptic Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 201 medications in current use (Kohen and Bristow 1996). Rapid and large increases in dosage can trigger NMS. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported with non-neuroleptic drugs such as lith - ium, metoclopramide, carbamazepine, and antidepressants including dothiepin and amoxapine (Haddad 1994). Indeed, Patel and Bristow (1987) report a case of NMS in a patient prescribed droperidol 5 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg IV as post-operative anti-emetics. This syndrome is more prevalent in males than females and 90 per cent of cases begin within ten days of the start of treatment with a neuroleptic drug, though not necessarily for the first time (Haddad 1994). Risk factors for neuroleptic malignant syndrome These include (Kohen and Bristow 1996): previous history of NMS, known cerebral compromise; mental state: agitation, overactivity, catatonia; physical state: dehydration. Haddad (1994) suggests that the high fever observed may be due to the sustained rigidity and tremor, which produces considerable heat. Management of neuroleptic malignant syndrome Neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually lasts for five to seven days but may be prolonged if depot antipsychotics have also been administered (Keogh and Doyle 2008). Clinical manage-ment involves (Kohen and Bristow 1996): measurement of white cell count, electrolytes and urea, liver function, and creatine phos- phokinase; correcting dehydration and pyrexia; withdrawing neuroleptics, lithium, ECT and benzodiazepines not contraindicated; specific remedies (bromocriptine, dantrolene) are probably useful; referral to medical team. Differential diagnoses Although NMS is rare, we must be able to recognize it when it occurs. When considering a diagnosis of NMS, you should consider differential diagnoses that can present with similar symptoms. These include catatonia, heat exhaustion, extrapyramidal symptoms with intermit-tent fever, partial NMS (neuro-toxicity falling below full-blown NMS), thyrotoxic and lupus Bristow 1996). Serotonin syndrome Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that affects sensory perception, temperature regulation, mood control, appetite, and sleep (Tortora and Derrickson 2006). Reduced levels of serotonin can lead to depression. This is because the neurons that release serotonin take it back up, thus it only remains in the synapse for a short time. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a front-line treatment of depressive illnesses, as they prevent this 'reuptake', hence the name reuptake inhibitor. Therefore, serotonin remains in the synapse longer, reducing feelings of depression. Serotonin syndrome is a rare but life-threatening adverse reaction caused by an excess of serotonin. It can occur within the first 24 hours of taking the medication or when it has been increased (Keogh and Doyle 2008). The risk of serotonin syndrome increases when combinations Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Awareness of serotonin syndrome among prescribing doctors is poor. In a UK study, Mackay et al. (1999) found 85 per cent of GPs reported that they were unaware of the syndrome. This is an area where community practitioners can offer education to primary care colleagues. While serotonin syndrome is rare, practitioners should be familiar with the signs and symp- toms in case they come across it. This will ensure prompt intervention. Knowing the MHSU's medication regime will allow you to make a quick diagnosis, as it is unlikely to be present in MHSUs not taking serotonergic medications. Serotonin syndrome affects the autonomic and motor systems and the way people behave. Murphy et al. (2004) categorize the symptoms of serotonin syndrome as follows: autonomic - tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, fever progressing to hyperthermia; motor - shivering, myoclonus (involuntary tremor, behavioural - restlessness, agitation, delirium, coma. Serotonin syndrome is a differential diagnosis of NMS, as the symptoms are very similar. Management of serotonin syndrome Isbister et al. (2007) suggest that serotonin toxicity can have three stages of severity - mild, moderate, and severe. This helps to assess the level of intervention required. Initial manage - ment should begin with observation and screening, and Mackay et al. (1999) suggest care - ful monitoring in the early clinical experience with new drugs. The management of serotonin syndrome will depend on its severity. Extreme cases may require intensive care with cardiac monitoring and mechanical ventilation (Murphy et al. 2004). In all cases, all serotonergic medi - cations should be discontinued. Keogh and Doyle (2008) suggest using cooling blankets, fans, and so on for alleviating hyperthermia, drinking plenty of fluids, and monitoring vital signs and urine output. Risks to physical health during restraint Service users may suffer respiratory arrest or other physical injury during physical restraint (see Table 9.2). Prior to physical restraint, the team directly involved should consider the fol-lowing in all cases, but especially where there is a known history of cardiac illness: Know the MHSU's physical history. Know the MHSU's medications and how these might increase any risks. Follow good practice guidance on the use of physical restraint, e.g. NICE (2005) guidelines. Know the medical emergency policy.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Physical health emergencies in mental health settings 203 During restraint, skin colour, breathing, and posture should be checked. Pulse oximetry should also be used, especially post-intervention. Post-restraint care includes observation of vital signs, respiratory assessment, observation for cyanosis, and possibly ECG. The following equipment should be available so that a rapid response can be initiated in the event of a medical emergency (NICE 2005): suction machine; defibrillator; oxygen. Rapid tranquillization The aim of rapid tranquillization is to inhibit acute behavioural disturbances as quickly and safely as possible. This can be done by administering MHSUs medication. An agitated MHSU will normally be offered oral medication in an attempt to calm them down. If this is refused and the situation cannot be effectively de-escalated, then IM or IV medication may be given. Taylor et al. (2012) state that the aims of rapid tranquillization are threefold: to reduce the suffering of the patient; to reduce risk of harm to others by maintaining a safe environment; to do no harm. With rapid tranquillization, medication is usually given as an IM preparation but, depending on the severity of the disturbance, IV preparations may be used. Types of medications that may be used either as IM or IV preparations include benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, and antipsychotics, and Clopixol Acuphase. Antipsychotic drugs have cardiotoxic effects. When given as IV preparations, this can lead to QT prolongation, which can result in Torsade de pointes and sudden death; for example, haloperidol when given IV can cause cardiac arrest and death (Silva 1999). Lorazepam is used to calm agitated MHSUs but this can cause severe respiratory depression. Guidelines from NICE (2005) caution staff to be aware of the potential results of rapid tranquillization: loss of consciousness instead of tranquillization; sedation with loss of alertness; loss of airway; cardiovascular and respiratory collapse; interaction with medicines already prescribed or illicit substances taken (can cause side- effects such as akathisia, disinhibition); possible damage to patient-staff relationship; underlying coincidental physical disorders. Box 9.9 Case example During the evening shift, a violent incident occurs that requires therapeutic management with physical restraint and rapid tranquillization. How would you monitor the service user's physical health following this incident? Physical health monitoring following rapid tranquillization is an important, yet at times neglected, part of the therapeutic management of violence and aggression. During rapid tran- quillization, MHSUs receive specific types or combinations of medication that are designed to Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Sedation, as an ADR, is a goal of rapid tranquillization, so that risk can be safely and effectively minimized and managed. Physical health should be monitored by following established local guidelines. You should monitor: Level of sedation. Body and head posture to prevent postural asphyxiation. Cardiovascular system - BP, pulse, pulse oximetry. Respiratory system - respiration rate, respiratory effort, cyanosis. Temperature - there may be a risk of NMS (see above) with rapid tranquillization. Any extra pyramidal side-effects, such as dystonic reactions. Taylor et al. (2012) recommend monitoring at intervals of 5-10 minutes for the first hour, then half-hourly until the person is ambulatory. Effective safety measures must be in place to ensure the health and safety of MHSUs and staff. For example, during restraint when medication is required there is a risk of needle stick injury to both MHSUs and staff. It is important that the MHSU is safely restrained to reduce the risk of a flailing limb leading to a needle stick injury. For practitioners working in forensic units or psychiatric intensive care wards, TNA in this area should be based on NICE (2005) guidance. Here all staff involved in the process of rapid tranquillization should receive ongoing competency training to a minimum of the Resuscitation Council UK's Immediate Life Support, which covers the airway, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of defibrillators (NICE 2005). Conclusion Medical emergencies are rare events that require immediate intervention to prevent deterio- ration and stabilize the MHSU's health. This will stop when appropriate emergency services arrive and take over the emergency care of the MHSU. Good clinical decision-making and intervention in medical emergencies will be based on your knowledge of the MHSU's physical health, whether they are currently being treated for a physical condition, their past medical history, and current medication regime. Summary of key points Practitioners should be aware of local policies and procedures for medical emergencies. Practitioners should be up to date with first aid and basic life support training. Practitioners should be aware of ADRs that can result in medical emergency. Practitioners should reflect on the skills required to perform competently in an emergency situation. Practitioners should be up to date with using medical equipment such as a pulse oximeter or defibrillator.

Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 10 Chapter contents Government policy Caseload profiling Annual health checks Health education and promotion Identifying your training needs Challenges for the physical health agenda Learning outcomes At the end of this chapter, you will have: Explored the role of the MHN in improv- ing the physical health of MHSUs Examined the role of the MHN in combating stigma and advocating for MHSUs' rights Explored the public health role of the MHN in caseload profiling, HNA, and health education/promotion Examined NICE guidance that should sup- port nursing practice Considered developing working relation- ships with other healthcare professionals Box 10.1 ExerciseWhy should MHNs take on a physical healthcare role? Introduction 'I'm a mental health nurse; physical health is not my job.' Such sentiments do exist, but gladly they are in a minority. Research shows that MHNs are highly motivated to attend physical health training (Nash 2005). In a descriptive study of 20 MHSUs and 10 staff, Meddings and Perkins (2002) found that both groups had different perceptions about what getting better meant. Activities of daily living and access to help and support were rated most important by practitioners, whereas MHSUs rated improved material and physical well-being as the most important. Although a small study, it does show that MHSUs are interested in their physical health. Facilitating physical health and well-being is a complex task that crosses boundaries between providers, including health and education providers, mental health and primary care services, even the inter-professional team. Yet it is not unrealistic to expect MHSUs to have good standards of physical health care that can increase health outcomes and quality of life.

However, these need to be harnessed to influence organiza- tional behaviour and policy. Much of the work required has already been done, as reflected in the many NSFs and NICE guidelines (see Table 10.1). These require integration into the organization and delivery of MHSUs' care. Indeed, the UK Department of Health (DH 2010:12) has set a general target of reducing premature death in people with serious mental illness, and MHNs will have an important strategic role in implementing initiatives aimed at achieving this target. The nursing and policy landscape The UK Chief Nursing Officer's review of mental health nursing (DH 2006d) recommended that we focus on improving the physical well-being of people with severe mental health problems. Table 10.1 Key NSF aims and standards for health improvement and prevention Coronary Heart Disease Standard one The NHS and partner agencies should develop, implement and monitor policies that reduce the prevalence of coronary risk factors in the population, and reduce inequalities in risks of developing heart disease Standard two The NHS and partner agencies should contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of smoking in the local population Mental Health Standard one Health and social services should: promote mental health for all, working with individuals and communities combat discrimination against individuals and groups with mental health problems and promote social inclusion The Cancer Plan The Cancer Plan aims to: reduce the risk of cancer through reducing smoking and promoting a healthier diet raise public awareness with better, more accessible information Diabetes Standard one The NHS will develop, implement and monitor strategies to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in the population as a whole and to reduce the inequalities in the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes Older People As well as older people having access to all of the above, the NSF sets out health promotion activities that are of specific benefit to older people: increasing physical activity improving diet and nutrition immunization and management programmes for influenza requirements for preventing falls and strokes Source: Department of Health (2002) reproduced with permission Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 207 More recently, in 'No health without mental health' (DH 2012), the UK Government identified better physical health as a priority for MHSUs. The report contains a broad goal - 'More people with mental health problems will have good physical health' (p. 8) as well as specific goals that include tackling smoking, obesity, and co-morbidity (p. 11). It further suggests that service providers 'can use regular health checks and recovery-focussed healthy lifestyle care plan- ning. Integrating physical health into decisions about prescribing and monitoring of medica- tion is also important' (p. 19). The NMC (UK) (2010: 7) states that 'new nurses will be expected to meet the essential mental and physical health needs of people of all ages and conditions, as well as in their own field of practice'. Furthermore, they include specific reference to compe- tencies in mental health nursing practice for physical health (NMC 2010). While physical health and well-being was once a neglected area of mental health care, gov- ernment and professional policy is now bringing it more to the fore. Yet our main goals for physical health and well-being are not complex. They should be to: keep MHSUs healthy; prevent MHSUs from becoming ill; minimize the impact on MHSUs when they do become ill and strive to make them better as quickly as possible. These goals are broad enough to be adopted as general principles, or philosophies of physi- cal health care. As we have seen already in this book, very simple, measurable targets can be set that can ensure an evidence base for practice. This will provide measures for the effective- ness of our individual or organizational interventions. Targets should include: reducing obesity; reducing smoking; increasing physical activity; promoting positive health and well-being through immunizations and screening; decreasing alcohol consumption; monitoring ADRs. By focusing on these priorities, we can reduce the burden of ill health on individuals, fami- lies, and health services. These targets will impact on rates of heart disease, respiratory dis- ease, obesity, and diabetes, which are prevalent in MHSUs. Tackling inequalities in health may be more difficult to achieve but not impossible. Mental health services should be liaising strategically with primary care services in relation to commissioning physical care services. Practitioners should advocate on behalf of MHSUs to get access to primary care services: this will help reduce inequalities in care. We will address what can be done in relation to physical health and well-being in three dis- tinct ways: what individual practitioners can do; what mental health services can do; what education and training providers can do. Box 10.2 ExerciseHow is the NSF for diabetes or the NICE guidelines for diabetes implemented in the care of MHSUs? What can individual practitioners do? The review of mental health nursing in the UK (DH 2006d) recommends that MHNs have the skills to improve MHSUs' physical well-being (see Table 10.2).

In these difficult economic times, training budgets are usually the first to get raided to pay for services. However, this is short-sighted manage- ment. Investment in skills and the workforce will bring better long-term sustainable gains. Practitioners can still work at the micro MHSU-practitioner level, even though there is instabil- ity in the macro-economic level. Role of the mental health nurse The role of the MHN will change depending on the context of practice. For example, in inpa- tient settings there will be a better opportunity for increased health surveillance than commu- nity settings by virtue of MHSUs being in hospital. However, the broad principles of roles are similar (see Figure 10.1).Table 10.2 Recommendation 7 from the Chief Nursing Officer's review of mental health nursing (DH 2006d) Recommendation 7: MHNs will have the skills and opportunities to improve the physical well-being of people with mental health problems.

Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 209 Screening and identifying physical illness Acute inpatient nurses spend a lot of time with MHSUs and are in a good position to screen and identify physical health needs and initiate health promotion activities, such as smoking cessa- tion. They are also in a good position to work jointly with dietitians in planning healthy eating programmes. Similarly, community MHNs can facilitate physical screening in line with NICE guidelines for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Screening is part of the process of caseload profiling (see Chapter 2). Here the preva - lence of health problems is mapped. Practitioners need to have basic skills in screening for physical illness. These skills stem from knowledge of risk factors covered in this book and the ability to identify these in MHSUs. Practitioners already working with those who have a diagnosed physical condition may believe it necessary to supplant general skills with more specialist ones. Clinical audit will be an important factor in putting this information to use in commissioning health care, developing services, and identifying staff training needs. Caseload profiling and health needs assessment Caseload profiling is a good practical step that MHNs can take in beginning the process of facilitating physical health and well-being. Profiling is a form of HNA that we explored in Chapter 2. To begin, you will need to develop a caseload auditing tool. Table 10.3 provides an example of a caseload profile. Caseload profile Ruben is a community MHN with a current caseload of 30 MHSUs. He meets people at vari- ous times - weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Ruben recently attended a physical healthcare study-day and has now decided to profile the current health status of his caseload. Ruben checks each individual case file for any documented physical health problem. He speaks with MHSUs and their families to ask them about any current issues and explores any treatments they receive from the GP. He also asks about any hospital appointments. He is surprised at the extent of physical health problems he has uncovered. Following profiling, unmet needs can be examined. In the example in Table 10.3, a blood cholesterol test has not been recorded in the profile. This is irregular given the high rate of overweight and obesity, combined with prevalence of heart problems and diabetes in the pro- file. Yet this is not unusual, as cholesterol tests may not be performed often. However, in the HNA, this constitutes an unmet screening need. Unmet needs are not just medical, they may also be social (for example, ensuring MHSUs have the appropriate state benefits with which they may be able to include more healthy foods in their diet) or organizational (e.g. having occupational therapy and dietitian input to support dietary changes). Health needs assessment Table 10.4 represents a HNA based on Ruben's caseload profile. For illustration, we have used results from ten individual MHSUs. Family history is a free text box, as there may be multi- ple conditions. The table shows a socio-demographic breakdown of MHSUs on his caseload. Profiling exposure to risk factors shows a 70 per cent prevalence of smoking, a 50 per cent prevalence of substance use, a 30 per cent prevalence of obesity, and a 50 per cent prevalence of overweight. Blood cholesterol screening has now commenced. For clinical conditions, there is a 40 per cent prevalence of hypertension, a 30 per cent prevalence of diabetes, and a 20 per cent prevalence of prediabetes. The variable rate of health screening across the group is an obvious clinical practice development point.

Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 213 health care and screening. From here, Ruben can commence inter-professional collaboration to ensure complex physical conditions are properly assessed and managed. His role will involve liaison with primary care and specialist team members such as GPs, practice nurses, diabe - tes and respiratory nurse specialists, and cardiologists. Dietitians, substance misuse workers, social workers, and health promotion can be enlisted to provide interventions and advice. The scale of the physical health agenda becomes obvious if we consider a large profile and HNA, for example, in a 60-bed inpatient unit. While probably a daunting task, it is the type of health information we require to enable suitable commissioning of physical health services. It will also help us to determine our physical health education and skills needs. Health education and promotion We have a key role to play in preventing physical ill health, as we may be the only person the MHSU engages with. Our MHSUs are among the most vulnerable groups in society and face social exclusion. For example, we know from research that people with serious mental ill- ness face problems in primary care that range from their physical health not being adequately assessed (Kendrick 1996) to exclusion from GP lists (Buntwal et al. 1999). However, even when in contact with health services their physical needs may be neglected by diagnostic overshad- owing or practitioners not having appropriate physical care skills or training (Nash 2005). Changing health behaviours is complex and challenging, and MHNs need to understand this in relation to the lifestyle factor a MHSU wishes to modify. An understanding of models of health promotion is thus required when undertaking health promotion activities. Under- standing an individual's attitudes and motivation to change (and factors that influence this) will enable MHNs to effectively collaborate with MHSUs in developing tailor-made plans with achievable goals. A popular health promotion model is Prochaska and DiClemente's (1983) stages of change model, outlined below: Pre-contemplation - MHSUs do not see the need for change, do not want to change or are unaware that they need to change.Table 10.3 Example of a caseload profile: Ruben's caseload (n = 30) (Continued) Family history 10 have had a family member die from a physical condition; 8 from a smoking-related disorder and 2 from a heart attack 8 currently have family members with conditions such as COPD (1), diabetes (4), hypertension (3) Presence of risk factors Adverse lifestyle factors such as poor diet, smoking, physical inactivity and ADRs are common across this cohort. Poor health screening, surveillance, and preventative health measures are also common. My plan to manage these risk factors is as follows: 1. Develop closer links with primary care services 2. Liaise closely with secondary and specialist services for MHSUs with cooccurring physical conditions 3. Dedicate part of the CPA plan and multidisciplinary team meetings to physical health 4. Encourage MHSUs to access screening and preventative health initiatives 5. Look at a walking group to promote physical activity and social interaction 6. Give out public health information on smoking cessation and diet 7. Closely monitor ADRs 8. Involve family and carers in health monitoring 9.

Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 215 Contemplation - MHSUs are aware of problems but are ambivalent about addressing them. Preparation - MHSUs are ready to change or have tried to change, i.e. 'testing the water'. Action - MHSUs have taken action, e.g. they have gone to a smoking cessation group. Maintenance - MHSUs need practitioners to support them so that change can be fostered and positive lifestyle changes built upon. Relapse - lifestyle change is difficult and MHNs must appreciate that MHSUs may face particular challenges. For example, they may relapse a few times before they finally quit smoking. Mental health nurses should be empathetic and non-judgmental, so that they can empower service users to regain action. Opportunistic health promotion Opportunistic health promotion is a practical way to begin the process of health promotion. We are all in contact with MHSUs and carers at some stage of our work. Therefore, we should take this opportunity to raise awareness about positive physical health. This can be employed in inpatient areas where MHSUs are easy to reach or in the community, outpatient or other clinics. Box 10.3 Exercise Examine the contents of your ward notice board or MHSU information packs. Is there an opportunity to include health promotion material here? A crude audit of our areas will probably find more information about various take-away menus than healthy eating materials. The vending machines in and around our areas will have a disproportionate amount of high-calorie snack bars and fizzy drinks than healthy alterna- tives. We need to redress this imbalance. In the UK, each health authority has a health promo- tion unit that has many resources that can be used to raise consciousness. These may have a minimal cost or may even be free of charge. For example, posters beside elevators encourag- ing people to use the stairs is one way of promoting physical activity, and posters reminding MHSUs to reduce salt intake or eat more fruit and vegetables can promote healthy eating. Advocating for mental health service users' rights The disparity in health outcomes between MHSUs and the general population is startling, including conditions routinely managed in the latter. Nash (2013) states that MHSUs' physical health is a matter of social justice and that MHNs need to be advocates for the rights of MHSUs to physical care. Advocacy is important for securing the rights of access to proper physical health care for MHSUs in both hospital and primary care settings. International research indi- cates disparities in treatment of MHSUs and the general population. Roberts et al. (2007) found that MHSUs with schizophrenia were less likely than patients without schizophrenia to have smoking status noted and less likely to have either BP or cholesterol recorded. Nasrallah et al. (2006) found low rates of treatment for hypertension and diagnosed diabetes in the CAITE schizophrenia study, while Frayne et al. (2005) found disparities in diabetes care. Although MHSUs have increased health risks, they are less likely to receive general health checks, health education and promotion, screening and treatment for physical conditions. The reasons for this are outlined in Table 1.2 on p. 6. This is why advocacy is required. Service users with two complex conditions (e.g. schizophrenia and diabetes) may be unable to navi- gate poorly organized services or the intricate boundaries between mental health and primary care. Mental health nurses need to advocate more strongly on behalf of MHSUs; empower them to be more autonomous when visiting their GP; and increase our liaison and support of primary care colleagues. Advocating for MHSUs' rights will be a central aim of facilitating physical health and well-being. Although this should occur across all types of services, it will Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Box 10.4 ExerciseList the different healthcare professionals that you have collaborated/may have to collaborate with regarding the physical health of service users on your caseload. Inter-professional collaboration and liaison Some MHSUs will have complex health needs that require effective management to ensure best practice and efficient use of resources. You may not be able to undertake complex physi- cal assessments or monitor complex interventions, such as performing spirometer readings in COPD. This is why inter-professional collaboration and liaison is important; so that mental health and primary care or specialist services can work effectively with complex care cases. Depending on the physical condition, MHNs will liaise and collaborate with colleagues such as practice nurses, district nurses, diabetes nurse specialists, health visitors or palliative care teams. This means that some care roles will be clearly demarcated, so that nurses are operat- ing within their field of professional practice. Inter-professional collaboration has many rewards: financial in terms of the efficient use of manpower and resources, improved quality of care by appropriately qualified nurses, and developing innovative practice in meeting complex needs. Good communication will thus be a key part in facilitating physical care in a holistic way. Inter-professional working is required to ensure that the MHSU gets the best assessment and care plan. Nurse-led chronic disease management is part of the everyday workload for many practice nurses and nurse practitioners (Louch 2005). Ensuring MHSUs are able to access such clinics when they need to will thus require advocacy through collaboration and liaison. Partnership working with primary care colleagues will be a vital component of the physical health agenda and we already have this in shared care arrangements for people with SMI. Most community MHNs will have good working links with GP practices in their locality and collaboration is a natural extension of these links. What is now required is reciprocity in the shared physical care of people with SMI. Immunization: an example There is limited research on immunization uptake in MHSUs. However, following the 2013 mea- sles outbreak in Wales, there is a need to ensure that all vulnerable and excluded groups have access to appropriate immunization schedules. Guidelines from NICE (2009b) consider chil- dren and young people aged under 19 years a priority, particularly those who have not been immunized or partially immunized. In mental health care, this would indicate children and adolescents as a group for specialist practitioners to focus on. One way we can promote better health in MHSUs is to ensure up-to-date immunization records. Health screening and immunization programmes are meant to be for everyone, so MHNs need to advocate on behalf of MHSUs for access to general immunization programmes such as those for winter flu and pneumococcal vaccine. Choice is obviously a concern and we should empower MHSUs to make positive choices regarding immunizations. Practice nurses can help with expert advice, answering questions, and allaying the fears MHSUs may have regarding immunizations. Families and carers should also be consulted and encouraged to support the need for immunizations, especially during the winter. All mental health practitioners have a role in developing the physical care agenda. Men- tal health nurses already work in inter-professional ways within mental health care, so the Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 217 challenge may not be new. Nevertheless, there will probably be tensions in a range of areas, such as that between using the medical model to drive change rather than a social model; tension between managers and practitioners regarding rewards or resources; and tension between primary care and mental health services around the 'who-what conundrum' (Nash 2013: 114) - who should provide what, who is responsible for what, but most significantly who pays for what. Assessing your learning needs in physical health and well-being As a profession, nursing requires its members to engage in continuous professional develop- ment in order to extend practice and offer high-quality care to MHSUs. To achieve this, we must ensure that we are up to date with our knowledge and skills. This will ensure competence to practise safely. While predominantly an individual responsibility, our employers also share in this by providing us with access to appropriate education and training. Research shows that MHNs may be using and depending on skills gained during their stu- dent nurse training - skills that may consequently not be up to date (Nash 2005). Nash (2010) also found a general unawareness of propositional knowledge of physical health in a sample of qualified MHNs attending a physical health study day. For example, only 5 of the 88 attendees knew the therapeutic blood plasma level of lithium, one of the few readings a MHN is required to know. However, such issues are not confined to nursing. Phelan et al. (2001) state many mental health practitioners have little training in physical care and some experienced psychiatrists would probably admit to not having used a stethoscope or done a physical exam for a number of years. The lack of evidence relating to the physical care training needs of mental health pro- fessionals is surprising, and it is important that this is borne in mind when appraisal or training needs are being considered for continuing professional development. Training needs analysis Pedder (1998) defines TNA as part of a strategic training plan where 'training or learning objec- tives are established, knowledge is mapped, gaps are identified and appropriate action is taken to meet needs'. Training needs analysis is one way in which organizations can measure the training and skills needs of practitioners to meet the physical health and well-being agenda. This would normally be done through a training audit. However, practitioners can undertake their own TNA as a way of identifying their own training needs. It is important that the TNA is realistic, as the primary aim is to increase knowledge and skills to help meet the physical health and well-being needs of MHSUs and increase the quality of their care rather than being a means to an end for staff development. Thus, the TNA will be strategic, as it will aim to meet both the needs of MHSUs for high-quality care and practitioners in developing their scope for practice. The TNA should be linked to the physical health and well-being needs of your MHSU group. Therefore, in analysing your training needs you may also be recognizing the physical health and well-being needs of your MHSUs. How you prioritize importance will depend on your MHSU group and any commitments to physical health that your organization has made. Pri- oritizing your training needs will relate either to the prevalence of physical conditions in your MHSU group (e.g. a high prevalence of diabetes might indicate an area for training) or to the prevalence of risk factors (e.g. a high prevalence of smoking might indicate a need for training in smoking cessation). Training recommendations may have a very specific context. For example, if your MHSUs take lithium, an important training need would be the recognition of lithium toxicity and how to manage this. For practitioners working in forensic or other types of secure services, a TNA may look to develop skills for physical health and well-being during and following restraint or rapid tranquillization.

First, Sheila has kept up to date with her mental health nursing skills but has not undertaken any training in physi- cal health and well-being. This is not unusual, as being an expert practitioner in mental health is a common goal for us all. Facilitating physical health and well-being is a relatively new, but growing, area of training need where specific courses are now becoming more widely available. Sheila recognizes that she needs to improve her physical care skills in line with the new unit policy. She also notices certain risk factors for physical illness in her MHSU group. Combining all of these factors she can reflect on how best she can express her perceived learn- ing and skills needs and discuss these with her clinical supervisor or manager as part of the individual performance review.Box 10.5 Case example Sheila is a staff nurse working in a rehabilitation setting. She qualified ten years ago and has extensive experience in cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis. A new policy in her unit focuses on the physical health and well-being needs of MHSUs. Sheila has grown concerned at her lack of skills in physical health care. She has noticed that some members of her MHSU group are overweight, are heavy smokers, take little exercise, and are on atypi- cal antipsychotic medication - factors the policy highlights as risks to physical health. She needs to begin writing care plans that aim to tackle these risks but is not confident in her physical care planning skills. Box 10.6 Case example (continued) Sheila meets with her manager for a performance review. She has identified training needs required to implement the local policy and provide good MHSU care. She discusses these with her manager who is supportive of her identified training needs in the following areas: physical health assessment; screening for physical illness to include clinical observation skills; skills for health education and health promotion; managing the physical ADRs of psychotropic medications. Your own TNA will be influenced by: rates of current physical morbidity in your caseload; prevalence of risk factors for physical illness; prevalence of ADRs; the clinical skills you need to facilitate physical health and well-being. Box 10.7 Exercise Conduct your own brief TNA related to the physical health and well-being needs of your MHSUs. Education and support Primary care practitioners generally lack awareness of mental health problems. This not only relates to specific conditions but also to the problems caused by stigma, labelling, and stereo- typing. A challenge for community nurses is educating primary care workers about how these Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 219 can increase risks to our MHSUs' physical health. The lifestyle risks will be easy to illustrate, as these will be a common feature of their everyday work. However, they may not have had edu- cation that addresses stigma as a risk that can lead to social exclusion and how this impacts on the physical health of MHSUs. Challenging negative attitudes and stigma will be important in reducing health inequalities and increasing access to primary care services. Clinical supervision is another area where MHNs can offer support to primary care col- leagues. Increasing support to non-mental health workers can increase their confidence and ability to work with MHSUs. Providing limited training may not engender ownership of any change that is required. However, providing support through clinical supervision can help increase confidence, inter-professional working, promote networking, and explore avenues for further practice developments. What can mental health services do? Mental health services must ensure that resources are available to meet and sustain the physi- cal health and well-being agenda. This will entail strategic discussions between mental health services and primary care providers to determine: whose responsibility is it to meet the physical health care needs of MHSUs; what the respective roles are of staff members in facilitating physical health and well-being; how MHSUs can get timely access to primary care services; what can be done to support primary care staff in working with MHSUs. Most mental health facilities should also have some form of physical health and well-being strategy. This strategy will have measurable targets that can be audited (e.g. all MHSUs will have a physical assessment within 42 hours of admission). Mental health services also need to develop commissioning frameworks in order to utilize scarce resources effectively. Some might believe that our role in commissioning will be neg- ligible. However, the commissioning process will be informed by profiling our caseloads and prioritizing HNA (see Figure 10.2). Even if the decision is that there are no resources to meet Figure 10.2 How MHNs can influence commissioning physical health careExecutive discussion on how to meet the stated needsClient group Detailed report for commissioners Evidence of client needs/ unmet needsClinical audit data from physical assessmentsPhysical assessment Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Generating evi- dence will propel the issues into the policy arena and, once there, they will not go away. At some stage, the resources will have to be forthcoming. Quality and Outcomes Framework and Commissioning for Quality and Innovation UK In the UK, there are two schemes that can promote good practice in physical health and well- being of MHSUs. The first, Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), is an incentive scheme whereby GPs are awarded annually for good practice in monitoring and managing population health. For example, QOF best practice targets for MHSUs' physical health include (Health and Social Care Information Centre 2012a): 1 The percentage of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psycho- ses who have a record of BMI in the preceding 15 months. 2 The percentage of patients aged 40 years and over with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a record of total cholesterol:HDL ratio in the pre- ceding 15 months. 3 The percentage of patients aged 40 years and over with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a record of blood glucose level in the preceding 15 months. The second scheme is the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) payment framework, which enables commissioners to reward excellence by linking a proportion of providers' income to the achievement of local quality improvement goals (DH 2008b). Exam- ples of CQUIN in MHSUs' physical health include sharing CPA registers with primary care so that physical health can be integrated into the CPA, and completing an annual physical health check (NHS London 2012). Both schemes present both inpatient and community MHNs with opportunities to engage and advocate for the physical health needs of MHSUs. We need to incorporate MHSUs into such schemes as they serve two purposes: (1) meeting MHSUs' physical health needs and (2) promoting social inclusion and integration of MHSUs into general population health screen- ing and treatment programmes. Annual health checks Mental health services, in conjunction with primary care, should instigate a programme of annual health checks for MHSUs. While limited resources may make this target difficult to achieve, it should not be impossible with effective holistic care. This is where we have to tar- get our MHSUs effectively in order to produce health gains. For example, we could begin by considering annual health checks on MHSUs with bipolar disorder as recommended by NICE (2006a; see also Chapter 3). In a physical care algorithm for schizophrenia, NICE (2002) recommends routine physical checks in MHSUs, especially in primary care or if MHSUs have no GP contact. Although this is not mentioned in the updated schizophrenia guideline, they propose that checks should moni- tor cardiovascular disease and the promotion of healthy lifestyles (e.g. promoting good diet, exercise, and smoking cessation). Monitoring ADRs is also important, such as extrapyramidal side-effects and tardive dyskinesia, weight gain/diabetes, sexual dysfunction, lethargy, and effects on eyesight. Physical health reviews should include routine urine/blood screening for diabetes and a selective screening for other endocrine disorders (e.g. high prolactin levels), routine weight monitoring, and other adverse reactions. The physical care algorithm is very broad and this allows it to be adapted to meet complex local needs. However, this may reveal the lack of specifics that local services may require, most notably around resources, timing, and responsibility. People with SMI should be routinely and systematically health screened as part of a holistic care programme. Some of this screening may be gender specific (e.g. cervical smear screening Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 221 for women) and should be facilitated with close joint working and liaison with primary care services. This systematic screening should focus on the recognized 'big killers' of CHD, can- cers, and obesity, with respiratory screening also included for asthma and other respiratory disorders. Rethink Policy Statement 36 (Took 2001) advocates at least annual physical health checks. Physical health should not be seen in isolation at MHSU reviews and the integration of physical care, as part of the UK CPA process or other case review, would make the process truly holis- tic. Of course, there are resource implications in relation to training mental health profession- als in physical assessment and management skills. However, such issues have to be viewed in relation to the benefits of increased physical health of our MHSUs, their satisfaction with our services, and our closer working with primary healthcare colleagues. One aspect of the annual health check will be general health education and health promotion advice. This will be aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle and include: smoking cessation; diet and nutrition; sexual health; oral hygiene; exercise; alcohol and/or drug use. The annual health check should also include: immunizations - flu and/or pneumococcal, TB; allergies; screening for cervical or prostate cancer; self-screening of testes or breasts for lumps. There is no real consensus on what an annual health check should consist of, as there is always the question of resources in relation to two factors: having the necessary equipment to carry out an assessment; whose responsibility it is to meet identified health needs. Table 10.5 provides an example of an annual health check. Box 10.8 Case example Rajesh is 35 years old and has schizo affective disorder. He has been taking an atypical antipsychotic for five years. You have completed a first annual health check on Rajesh. You note that he has a waist circumference of 38 inches, a BMI of 31 kg/m 2, and a blood pres- sure of 135/85 mmHg. Rajesh smokes 30-40 cigarettes a day but does not drink alcohol. He takes little exercise and acknowledges his diet is poor. What types of condition do you think Rajesh is at risk of developing? The annual health check can be used to screen for conditions that we know MHSUs are at increased risk of developing, such as T2D, metabolic syndrome, obesity, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. We should also factor medication monitoring into any annual health check but because this should be a routine aspect of clinical work, we should not wait a year to do this. Adverse drug reactions should be monitored whenever we have appointments with service users. Monitoring physical health is also an opportunity for integrating other types of NICE guid- ance into our practice. For example, as MHSUs are at high risk of developing cardiovascular Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

This will illustrate what we should be looking out for, when to monitor, and what to do when cholesterol levels are abnormal.Table 10.5 Example of an annual health check Area Clinical assessment General survey Ask about new or existing physical conditions Baseline observations Temperature, BP, pulse, respirations, urinalysis Cardiac assessment ECG, pulse oximetry Respiratory assessment Peak flow for asthma sufferers, spirometry, chest sounds Endocrine assessment Blood glucose levels, thyroid function test, prolactin levels Weight BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio Lifestyle factors Smoking, alcohol/drug use, physical activity, diet and nutrition Blood screening FBC, blood cholesterol - HDL, LDL, and triglycerides, monitoring of medication levels, hepatitis status Public health Sexual health advice, contraception advice, immunizations - flu and/or pneumococcal, TB Adverse drug reactions Review of metabolic and coronary ADRs Review of other physical adverse drug reactions, e.g. sexual function Use NICE guidance and BNF guidelines to develop medication review criteria General health education and health promotion advice Smoking and smoking cessation, promotion of a healthy lifestyle, physical activity, education on self-screening, e.g. testes or breasts Other areas Oral health, hearing and sight tests (monitor sight in diabetes), skin integrity, mobility, allergies Box 10.9 ExerciseThink of your MHSU group and the physical illnesses they have. What types of health promotion activities can you instigate with them? Which other team members can you incorporate into these activities? The logistics involved in prioritizing annual health checks will need to be local, as the same arrangements may be difficult to implement in inner-city and rural areas. It would be pos- sible for the CPA to be used to facilitate the annual health check. For example, it can be performed prior to discharge and then yearly for MHSUs being discharged from hospital. For community MHSUs, it may be performed during various reviews. Table 10.6 illustrates the decisions that may be required about when, where, how, and by whom an annual health check is undertaken. The role of education providers The stereotypical view of academics in ivory towers rings true when education provision does not keep pace with shifts in clinical practice.

Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 223 where education providers seem to have been caught napping. However, this is changing rapidly and a range of courses and study days are now available in universities; for example, Middlesex University in London has developed physical care skills courses for MHNs. While education providers need to be able to respond quickly to changes in clinical practice, this should not be at the expense of quality. Education providers must not produce ad hoc courses that are not sustainable. A rush to provision can result in a diffusion of courses that quickly close because of low student numbers or poor quality. Being proactive and leading policy is better than being reactive and playing catch-up with it. The ability to respond quickly will stem from service providers and education providers having a close working relation- ship. Here education providers have a lot to learn from the different models and practices of working across boundaries that healthcare providers use daily. Closer joint working should involve educational in-reach, which will see the education provider jointly involved in TNA Table 10.6 Factors to consider when implementing an annual health check Goal All MHSUs, inpatient and community, require an annual physical health check Priority MHSUs already diagnosed with physical conditions MHSUs with SMI MHSUs with SMI treated with poly-pharmacy: SMI taking two or more antipsychotic drugs MHSUs taking lithium and an antipsychotic drug MHSUs taking antipsychotics and benzodiazepines MHSUs taking antipsychotic and antidepressant medications MHSUs being treated over the BNF recommended daily levels of drugs MHSUs with substance misuse problems: MHSUs injecting substances MHSUs taking multiple substances MHSUs on a methadone maintenance programme MHSUs with multiple physical health risk factors: policy-related targets, e.g. priority is given to screening for the big killers like heart disease and cancer MHSUs from some minority ethnic backgrounds MHSUs with a family history of medical illness Action Physical health check on admission may double as an annual health check Physical health check on discharge may double as an annual health check Physical health check performed as part of the Care Programme Approach may double as the annual physical health check Resources Equipment Training Clinical standards Responsibility Responsible medical officer GP Care manager Key worker Primary nurse Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Joint research and audit can also be undertaken, which will strengthen the strategic links between education providers and service providers, which in turn can underpin commitments to lifelong learning. Here the two parties, with different types of resources can explore innova- tion in educational delivery. For example, universities have virtual learning environments such as WebCT and there must be some way that service providers can get access to the resources held there. Education providers already have a portfolio of physical care courses for adult colleagues. Developing mental health specific versions of each would be unnecessary duplication of work. However, some inter-school cooperation could see variations of courses for MHNs or adult nursing academics involved in mental health teaching. For example, a respiratory care lecturer should be involved in respiratory assessment and airway management in the use of physical restraint. There are many such examples. The effectiveness of such interventions should be the subject of joint research. For exam - ple, does the provision of physical health education have an effect on the physical health and well-being of service users? Education providers should realize that the end recipients of their training courses are not the students in the classroom but the MHSUs in their living room. Box 10.10 ExerciseTake a few moments to reflect on your clinical practice. Which skills do you feel you need in order to provide physical care to your MHSU group? Challenges to meeting the physical healthcare agenda Stigma is probably the biggest barrier to facilitating physical health and well-being in MHSUs. Robson and Gray (2007: 458) suggest that MHNs are in a strategic position to have a posi- tive impact on the mental and physical well-being of people with SMI. Mental health nurses have a huge role to play in combating stigma and challenging the negative attitudes and stere- otypes people have of MHSUs. Stigma leads to social exclusion, which can result in MHSUs not accessing services. Practitioners working in the community will have a role in advocating and educating primary care colleagues. We also have a responsibility to challenge negative stere- otypes that our colleagues might have regarding their own MHSUs' physical health or ability to change lifestyle factors. There are many complex reasons why practitioners may resist undertaking a physical care role. For example, if a practitioner has low confidence in assessing physical health, they may be disinclined to do it. The more they disengage from this area of work, the higher the risk that they defer this to others and the opportunity for learning, or relearning, and extending practice is lost. If it has been some time since a MHN had any training or practice in physical health care, they may be reluctant to undertake any refresher. For some practitioners, there may be a partisan argument that as mental health specialists we should not undertake a physical health role as it is outside our scope of practice. Sometimes practitioners are not rewarded for extending their roles or undertaking training and in light of this they may be dissuaded from engaging with the physical health agenda. Whatever the argument, there will be losers on both sides. Service users may not get the holistic care that they need and MHNs will limit their scope of practice, breadth of knowl- edge, and development of new skills. The purpose here is not to argue for a generic medical/ psychiatric workforce, but for us to develop competent skills in the recognition of symptoms of physical illness, the assessment of physical health, and referral onto more specialist serv- ices when something significant is uncovered.

Practical steps in improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness 225 Conclusion We have a professional and ethical responsibility to remain up to date with our knowledge and skills. However, this is a responsibility that should be shared between practitioners and their organization. Organizations have the responsibility to provide training to practitioners but practitioners have a duty to utilize this for the benefit of MHSUs. Extending our role in relation to facilitating physical health and well-being will be dependent on: identifying appropriate training needs; linking these training needs to our MHSUs; having resources and support to underpin new roles; and developing specialist education and training. If this is undertaken strategically, it should lead to the delivery of high standards of physical health care for our MHSUs. Summary of key points Mental health nurses have a key role in implementing and sustaining the physical health- care agenda. Practitioners should identify their learning needs in conjunction with their MHSUs' physical health and well-being needs. Organizations should support staff for long-term development rather than short-term gain. Education providers and service providers need to work closely to develop a sustainable physical health training agenda. Quick quiz 1 Think about your MHSU group and the work you do. How might your own levels of knowledge and skills act as a barrier to effective care? 2 How do you think MHSUs and carers can be actively involved in the process of facilitat- ing physical health and well-being? 3 How would you deal with stigmatizing attitudes towards MHSUs? 4 Can you identify someone who could offer you clinical supervision and support around the area of facilitating physical health and well-being? 5 List examples of good practice in your clinical area.
