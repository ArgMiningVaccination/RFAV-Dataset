It has always been my favorite way to learn about herbal medicine, so my home library is full of herbal apothecary books. Transforming a plant into a potent medicine is an ancient skill passed down from generation to generation. When we handcraft herbal medicine in our kitchens with care and conscientiousness, we know our medicine chest is filled with potent and high-quality herbal remedies. A home apothecary filled with homemade herbal concoctions is enlivening and gratifying. To help get you started down the path of home medicine making, we've put together a list of our favorite books for creating your own natural medicine chest. This article shares our top picks for the best home herbal apothecary books, including essential medicine-making guides and recipe-rich herbal books. And if you want to take your passion even further, consider our top-notch [medicine-making course](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-herbal-classes/herbal-medicine-making-course/)! Four of the best home herbal apothecary books. Preparing herbal remedies at home connects us to the seasons, plants, and our bodies. When crafting herbal remedies, look at the big picture and notice how those medicines feel in your body. Which preparations emanate healing? My favorite, most potent botanical remedies have been made in the company of a good friend. Laughter, song, and story are often part of the mix. Along with a sense of connection, paying close attention to safety when making herbal medicine is essential. You'll want to know the contraindications for each herb, such as possible side effects and drug-herb interactions. Another consideration is the shelf-life of the preparation. Does it need to be refrigerated or kept out of light? How long will it last? When choosing a solid resource for making plant medicines, check if the author includes safety information and the shelf-life for each recipe. The best herbal apothecary books will consist of specific measurements and detailed techniques to get you started down the right path to creating your own natural medicine chest.
