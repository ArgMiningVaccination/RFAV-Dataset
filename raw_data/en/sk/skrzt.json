Deprey, DC As was the case with the Spanish Flu in the early 20th century, COVID 19 and the Delta variant express themselves in the human body as a deadly overreaction of the natural immune system leading, in some cases, to extreme respiratory failure and death. Research has shown that a number of healthy life habits can significantly improve the odds of resisting infection and/or survival of an infection with minimal physical reaction. I must begin with my endorsement of the 3 currently available vaccines as safe and effective when combined with good quality face coverings when indoors with non-family members. Unfortunately, the new Delta variant form of COVID19 seems to be producing a new worldwide wave of life-threatening challenge to even the double vaccinated. We must, then, recommit to doing anything we can to improve our chances with our natural immune system. What follows here is the culmination of my research into practical methods for strengthening general health, well-being, and therefore our immune function. Physical: Rest- 8 hours of quality sleep/day. Nutrient dense food- plant-based mostly with low-fat white meats and wild fish minimally processed. Active body motion 30 minutes/day preferably outdoors in fresh air and sunshine. No smoke/vape and light on alcohol (one to two units daily) Stimulation of the neurological control of white blood cell production via regular chiropractic spinal care. Diet/supplementation Daily: Vit D3 5,000 Ius (less if there is sun exposure), Vit C 2,000 mg, Zinc 50 mg (inhibits virus entry to cells), garlic fresh 1 TBSP, Green Tea- antimicrobial/antioxidant, Probiotic 30 billion CFUs (pills and/or yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut), Medicinal mushrooms (stimulate natural T-cells which destroy infected cells and reduce transmission to healthy cells), Astragalus- 500 mg 2x/day (preventive immune booster), CBD-hemp oil antianxiety rest/sleep Hydration - water, unsweetened green tea. Emotional: Talk about your feelings with loved ones and/or a certified professional counselor. Practice mindfulness stress reduction/meditation. Journal and/or mentally review what you are grateful for daily (best if before sleep). Social: Encourage deep connections with family, friends and community. Set practical boundaries in relationships. Get involved in a church, school, club or volunteer with a charitable cause where you make a difference. Spiritual: Focus on how you connect your inner soul with the greater world around you. Spend time in Nature. Practice the faith that is meaningful to you and respect and appreciate those of others. Mental: Seek learning opportunities that challenge your brain and intrigue your mind. Consume foods/supplements rich in Omega 3 fatty acids to reduce inflammation and promote neuron function in the brain. Avoid excessive alcohol, smoking and recreational drugs. Maintain a healthy gut (digestive system) to support brain function (probiotics, bone broth and collagen protiens). Laugh often- Relaxes the body, boosts the immune system, releases endorphins, protects the heart, burns calories, diffuses anger/conflict, helps battle diss-ease, even cancer (ref. Dr. Norman Cousins-Anatomy of An Illness), strengthens relationships and attracts others. Faking is good too. Best wishes for success in all your efforts to this end. Together we can make it through this challenging time. AND THE PEOPLE STAYED AT HOME by Kitty O\"Meara And the people stayed home. And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently. And the people healed. And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, mindless, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal. And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.
