[ Just 2 days left of an amazing eating plan I have followed adamantly. It has not exactly been \"easy peezy\" but rather a challenge and a commitment to support and connect with my body in a way I have never done before. I chose to do this cleanse to further help my digestive system in the most nourishing way I could find. Digestive health has a major impact on overall health and immunity. Your body wants to heal from whatever it is you are fighting. I truly believe your body has the ability to heal from the most extreme conditions and all disease. Miracles begin to happen when we listen and connect with our body and give it the love and nourishment it craves. If you are currently struggling with your health it is time for a change. Eating healthful foods and eliminating foods that cause problems is the most critical aspect of healing ANY health condition or illness.](https://lymeintolemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Medical-Medium-e1542143860655.jpg) For the last 4 weeks I have eaten only raw organic fruits and vegetables. Simple as that...! Vegetables and fruit in their raw state contain the highest level of nutrients of any foods. The vitamins and minerals plus other nourishing elements will strengthen and cleanse every single system in your body. I personally began to feel noticeable changes in my digestion within only a few days. My bathroom visits have been much more regular then they have been in my life (sometimes 2-3 times a day). Zero room for constipation when eating raw! My sleep has been more sound and I wake feeling more invigorated. My skin looks and feels better. This cleanse has also rebuilt my soul. My soul has learned that powerhouse foods like raw vegetables and fruits are the true essence of comfort. I have always wanted to try a detox, cleanse, or fast and felt this plan was achievable and still offered delicious foods. I honestly do not have too many cravings. If I need something sweet I grab a piece of fruit or a date. In the process I have fallen in love with mangoes. Here is my plan: EARLY MORNING Upon waking I start my day with celery juice. Celery juice has many nutritional benefits~ - Balances PH in the body/extremely alkaline - Helps lower blood pressure - Helps fight off bacteria and cancer agents - Helps purify the blood stream - Aids in digestion - Relaxes the nerves - Helps restore the thyroid - Anti-Inflammatory I will continue with my morning celery juice after my 28 days! BREAKFAST I make a fruit smoothie every day for breakfast. Usually my smoothie consists of one banana, strawberries, wild blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, frozen mangoes, 1 tsp Hawaiian Spirulina, 1 tsp Barley Juice Powder. I will continue this breakfast after my 28 days. MID-MORNING A piece of fruit or another small fruit smoothie. LUNCH A large salad with spinach and cucumbers as the base, then toss in fruits and or veggies of choice. This salad is BIG in size for me~ so do not chince or you will be hungry. For dressing, blend juice of one orange, with half an avocado and one clove of garlic and cilantro. MID-AFTERNOON If I become hungry in the afternoon I snack on celery sticks or a pear or an apple. DINNER My dinner is a time to get creative. I made the [Medical Medium ](https://www.medicalmedium.com/)spinach soup quite often and served it over cucumber noodles. Recipe: - Blend 2-3 tomatoes with the juice of 1 orange - Add 1 stalk of celery, a small handful of cilantro, a clove of garlic, and 2 handfuls of spinach all in a high speed blender Other dinner options include a large salad or homemade guacamole with broccoli and cauliflower or mango salsa Salsa: Mangoes, tomatoes, celery, cucumbers, cilantro, garlic - pulse all in blender. EVENING If I need an evening snack it is usually an apple and a date. Remember this cleanse is only one month of your life. The first week is the most difficult but gets easier as you move along. My month has flown by and now I have Thanksgiving to look forward to! Timing is EVERYTHING! 2 MORE DAYS TO GO!! I will start my transition period this weekend by SLOWLY introducing foods back in to my diet. Most likely I will begin with cooked vegetables, a little more fat (coconut oil), and maybe some quinoa. Plant based eating will forever be my way of life... this I know for sure! If you are looking for healing in a very achievable way, I suggest you pick up the book \"Medical Medium\" by Anthony William and enjoy!
