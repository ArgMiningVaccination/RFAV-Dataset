For some folks, what's perceived to be bad for them is likewise for their pets. Many unsupported opinions on the Internet say that vaccinations are unnecessary or fraught with extraordinary risk. But what is often not mentioned is that the risk of serious disease often far outweighs \u2014 not to mention out-costs \u2014 any vaccination-associated effects. People rejecting vaccinations for their own pets may also hope that, if a critical mass of other animals are vaccinated, infections will be contained. But in reality, gaps in protection can allow pathogens to stay alive, just biding their time to strike. So think about how disease can snowball in the absence of vaccination. It's a risky proposition. If you've heard of propylene glycol recently, it's likely in the context of pet food. That's because its addition to certain pet foods is blamed for making some animals sick. So just what is propylene glycol anyway? Panic often ensues when people confuse this compound with ethylene glycol, its distant cousin and the toxic component of antifreeze. But ironically, propylene glycol is used to make pet-safe varieties of antifreeze. It's also approved to maintain moisture in certain animal foods. However, cat foods are an exception, because propylene glycol causes abnormalities in feline red blood cells. But dogs have to ingest large amounts of the stuff before they show signs of toxicity, like sedation, staggering or seizures. Still, if you don't want to take chances, read the ingredient label before buying any food for your pet. Fur coats notwithstanding, our pets can struggle to stay warm in the winter. Here are some tips to keep them comfy and safe. Be sure to brush mats out often, because fluffy fur is a natural insulator. Pooch breeds with short coats benefit from doggy sweaters \u2014 particularly turtlenecks that cover the back and belly. Puppies don't do well in cold weather, so housebreaking in the winter is a challenge. You may want to train your pup to paper inside first, then move the training outside in the spring. Elderly dogs are also sensitive to the cold, so keep their walks short. And with any walk outside, stay away from frozen bodies of water \u2014 you can never be sure just how sturdy the ice is. Many a tragedy has befallen a plunging pooch and his would-be rescuer. Winter can be a wonderland \u2014 if you know how to keep your pet safe. Vaccinations save millions of pets, so it's a small price to pay if our furry friends have some mild side effects. But an allergic reaction is something different entirely. Minor side effects occur within hours of vaccination and are pretty common. They might include soreness or swelling at the injection site, a slight fever or mild lethargy. Nasal vaccinations can cause some coughing, sneezing or congestion for a few days. Just watch your pet until signs diminish \u2014 but see a veterinarian if they linger. Allergic reactions generally occur within minutes of vaccination but may develop hours later. No matter the timing, they're always emergencies. Signs can include vomiting or diarrhea, hives or facial swelling, trouble breathing or collapse. Because nothing's perfect, take the time to monitor your pet after vaccination. Around 50 cases of equine rabies are confirmed in the United States every year. So even though we talk a lot about rabies prevention in dogs and cats, it's just as crucial in our equine friends. What makes horses so vulnerable to rabies is their curiosity combined with a rabid animal's loss of fear of other creatures. The resulting chance interaction can be deadly. Equine rabies is insidious, with signs ranging from lackluster performance to strange behavior. That is, rabies can look like anything \u2014 or nothing. As with cats, dogs or people, once symptoms develop, rabies in horses is fatal. It's also infectious through contact with any body fluids. But the good news is that rabies is preventable with a vaccine that's reliable and safe in horses. So don't leave your horse at risk when a rabies vaccination could save the day. It's that time of year \u2014 when you resolve to shed weight and get some off of your four-legged friends too. Just don't forget your equine buddy! Horse obesity causes serious medical issues, so it's important to see how your steed measures up. Your horse's diet should depend on his body weight and condition. Here, we'll focus on weight. Scales provide the most accurate weights, but they're costly. Alternatively, using a weight tape from your local feed or tack shop can give you a reasonable estimate. You'll need two measurements. For heart girth, place the tape around your horse just behind the elbows. Next, measure body length from the point of the shoulder to the point of the rump. Plug these two numbers into an online horse weight calculator and voil\u00e0 \u2014 you've got your estimate. Weekly weigh-ins will help determine if a diet change might be in order. Foals with maladjustment syndrome \u2014 or \"dummy foals\" \u2014 mystified horse owners and veterinarians for years. These foals look healthy but act dazed and confused, seemingly unable to recognize mom or the need to nurse. Most come around \u2014 but only after days of grueling intensive care. So researchers studied the inner workings of horses to solve the mystery. Normally, a foal is calm in the womb because it produces natural sedatives called neurosteroids [neuro-steroids]. During birth, pressure from the mare signals the foal to stop producing these sedatives so it can be born on full alert. But persistent neurosteroids in dummy foals keep them zoned out, so they need more pressure. To this end, one researcher has utilized a soft rope harness over the foal's chest for about 20 minutes. When the rope is removed, most foals get up, nurse from mom and never look back. We know the term \"endangered species\" is serious business. But it's less clear how an animal or plant group earns that title \u2014 or becomes \"listed\" \u2014 and what it really means. Simply put, an endangered species is at risk of becoming extinct. And the goal of listing a species is to prevent that extinction by enforcing strict protection. But that kind of safeguard is costly. So federal agencies look at the urgency of a species' need to assess whether if it can be met in other ways. Scientists help determine if a species' habitat is unlivable, whether it's being decimated by humans or if its vulnerable to disease or predators. If a species meets any of these criteria, it's listed as endangered. The cost of protecting endangered species may be dear, but the price of maintaining the status quo can be far greater. Remember: there are no do-overs with extinction. Just like you're vulnerable to winter colds, your pooch is at risk of contracting an infectious cough this season. Don't worry \u2014 your dog can't catch your cold. But pooches pass plenty of other infections among themselves. Assuming your four-legged friend is kept cozy during the winter, cold temperatures aren't to blame. It's the increased time your buddy spends inside. A doggy day care center is akin to your workplace \u2014 where coughing, sniffling coworkers unwittingly spread their germs. The difference is that dogs often meet and greet by mouthing each other, which is a very efficient way to share infections. You can help protect your pooch from respiratory ailments this winter with a bordetella vaccination. Whether your dog's at day care, the kennel or just hanging with her pooch pals, she'll be better equipped to fend off pesky germs. Sam, a young Australian shepherd, was healthy hours earlier when his owner gave him his first heartworm preventative. But now he's in an emergency clinic barely clinging to life \u2014 and all because of a drug that was meant to protect him. Sam is one of many herding dogs with a mutation in the MDR1 gene, making them sensitive to ivermectin. This parasite-killing drug is used in products from heartworm preventatives to large animal dewormers. Ivermectin-containing pooch products are safe for most dogs but cause serious neurologic damage in those with the mutation. After six weeks of intensive care, Sam's back to normal. But not all MDR1-positive dogs are so lucky. A simple test identified Sam's mutation, and now he's on a different heartworm preventative. Ask your veterinarian if the MDR1 test is right for your dog. It could "}
