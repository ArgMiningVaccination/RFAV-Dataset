A new study finds that supplementation with 25(OH) vitamin D in an Italian cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients that were deficient, resulted in a reduced length of hospital stay compared to those who were not supplemented. A new RCT has found that the L-carnitine supplement Carnipure tartrate can increase platelet counts in patients testing positive for COVID-19, suggesting it may have a protective effect against thrombosis-induced complications. Vitamin D, zinc, and selenium supplements have significant evidence to suggest intakes reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and associated severe outcomes, whilst probiotics may enhance symptomatic and viral clearance. The Mumbai-based research organisation Vedic lifesciences achieves the NutraIngredients award for nutrition research product, with their submission proving the studied supplement to could enhance the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. The new study observes a significant association between supplement consumption and vaccination side effects in an Italian adult population, specifically spotlighting the effects of omega-3 and mineral supplement consumption in reducing associated adverse... Increased consumption of oily fish and the use of omega-3 fatty acid supplements may reduce the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, according to new research from the Fatty Acid Research Institute (FARI). In vitro tests on European black elderberry (Sambuscus nigra L.) have established antiviral activity that inhibits disease progression of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants, say researchers. Outpatients who were administered curcumin (CUR) and quercetin (QUE) after testing positive for early-stage SARS-CoV-2 were found to clear the virus at a significantly faster rate, compared to those receiving standard of care (SOC) alone. L-arginine combined with vitamin C can improve physical performance, muscle strength, endothelial function, and fatigue in adults with long Covid and should be considered a treatment option to relieve persistent symptoms, according to a study published... Gencor Pacific is eyeing new product development opportunities aimed at improving the quality of life in individuals who experience the lingering effects of COVID-19 infection, following new trial findings on one of its trademarked ingredients. Zinc is an essential trace mineral involved in modulating human immune responses and may prove to be an important therapeutic agent for viral infections, such as COVID-19, say the authors of a recent review. Researchers and stakeholders are reacting to new research that contradicts two previous meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials that found vitamin D to have a protective shield against respiratory illnesses. A standardised extract of Echinacea purpurea is an efficient and cost-effective antiviral counter measure to vaccination in the prevention of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and for reducing concomitant viral loads, say scientists. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has shown to inhibit the COVID-19 virus in both in-silico and in-vitro settings, and positive findings from a clinical trial are expected to be published in Q3, says functional ingredient firm Gencor. A combination of amino acids, B vitamins, and other bioactives may improve muscle and physical performance measures for people with persistent fatigue post-COVID infection, says a new study from Italy. While the COVID-19 pandemic brought a renewed interest to vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, D, and zinc for immune health, industry experts believe it has also led to novel combinations of ingredients that could work synergistically. A doctor diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 20 years ago at the age of 16, is so determined to help others with health issues he has carved a career in research, created a company and recently launched two products that promote immune health. Between the pandemic, inflation rates, global issues and more, an increasing number of consumers are turning to supplements to support their mental health.

A strong immune system is one of the best defenses we have for protection against common infectious diseases. This has never been more important than now, as we tackle another winter dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. In a year dominated by COVID-19, the countdown for 2021 has been dominated by stories about the gut, vitamins, minerals and anything else linked to supporting immune health and warding off the virus' effects. A meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials on more than 500,000 COVID-19 patients revealed no significant association between vitamin D supplementation and improved clinical outcomes based on current evidence. Exclusive findings on microbiome research centred around vaccine immunogenicity and gut microbiota changes in COVID-19 patients were revealed at the first edition of our Probiota Asia digital summit for 2021. Personalised Nutrition (PN) offers opportunities both for performance and active sports nutrition, according to FMCG Gurus' Head of Research & Insight, Mike Hughes but affordability remains a sticking issue. Nutraceutical ingredient suppliers and manufacturers are continuing to ramp-up their inventory to keep their supply chain stable amid ongoing uncertainties brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, including port closures and delayed vessels.
