The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND ART By activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, adjuvants hold the potential to unleash the natural functions of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to kill pathogens or cancer. Many adjuvants including TLR agonists engage innate immune receptors on APCs, inducing APCs to present antigens, produce cytokines, and provide costimulatory signals (1, 2) to antigen-specific CD8 T cells. In response to these signals, CD8 T cells proliferate and differentiate into CTLs capable of killing infected or tumor cells expressing their target antigen. In addition, such signals activate CD4 T cells, inducing their expansion and differentiation into Thl or Th2 T helper cells (3). One of the most important targets of improved adjuvant technology lies in the field of cancer immunotherapy, where the adaptive immune system is exploited to kill cancer cells based on their expression of cancer associated antigens or neo-antigens (4, 5). The effectiveness of cancer 1 WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 immunotherapy depends on the generation and activation of tumor-specific CTLs {5, 6) and on their maintenance of activity in vivo, leading to killing of tumor cells and a long lasting anti-tumor memory response (5). Thus, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-Ll and anti-CTLA-4 have achieved remarkable clinical success in the treatment of melanoma and other cancers through their action in blocking pathways that inhibit CTL activation (7, 8). However, even among those tumors known to be susceptible to checkpoint blockade, response rates of only about 20% have been reported for PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treatment (5, 9), possibly due to insufficient numbers or activation of tumor-reactive CTLs, or their failure to infiltrate tumors . These deficiencies may be exacerbated by immunosuppression induced by7 the cancer environment. In addition, the lack of T cell support is thought to be at least in part responsible for the lack of vigor exhibited by many synthetic vaccines against various pathogens as well as cancer-related cell surface antigens . ENREF 21 TLR ligands have long been known to act as adjuvants in adaptive immune responses {10, 11) signaling via adapter (MyD88, TRIF, and IRFs (12-14) . These and other transcription factors induce the expression of thousands of genes that carry 7 out the innate immune response \u00a215) . Several nucleotide-based (16), and STING agonist cGAMP {6) have been reported to improve the efficacy 7 of immune checkpoint inhibitors in pre- clinical models for cancer treatment. -2- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 These approaches aim to increase the number of tumor-specific CTLs upon which checkpoint inhibitors can act. However, they have relied chiefly on natural TLR ligands, which are difficult to synthesize, and in some instances quite toxic, presumably because they become 'widely disseminated in vivo, and activate myeloid cells indiscriminately, producing cytokine storm (17). Development was sought of agonists with superior pharmacologic properties, with defined structural and molecular mechanisms from which key adjuvant design principles can be learned. By screening a library of synthetic compounds, a potent human- and mouse-active TLRl/2 agonist, Diprovocim, was identified that has no structural similarity to any microbial TLR agonist. As described below, Diprovocim illustratively elicits strong adjuvant activity in mice, successfully inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging survival when combined with a cancer antigen and immune checkpoint blockade in the B16-0VA melanoma model. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Adjuvants enhance adaptive immune responses, sometimes through unknown mechanisms, and can be used to augment both humoral and cellular responses to cancer antigens. The invention described herein illustrates synergistic immunological effects of the synthetic chemical adjuvant Diprovocim, 'which targets the innate immune receptor TLR2/TLR1 in mice and humans, that vihen used in conjunction with a diseased cell marker immunogen molecule and a checkpoint inhibitor provides a synergistic effect in inhibiting the growth of a -3- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 diseased cell as compared to the use of the individual components or any two of those components. The present invention thus contemplates a method of inhibiting the growth of diseased cells in a mammal. Those diseased cells express a marker molecule that is absent from cells of the same type that are free of the disease or is present in the disease-free cells in significantly reduced numbers compared to said diseased cells. A contemplated method comprises the steps of immunizing a diseased mammal in need by: a) administering to the diseased mammal (i) an adjuvant-sufficient amount of a Diprovocirn compound, (ii) a T cell-stimulating amount of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and (iii) an immunizing amount of a disease marker molecule. The immunized mammal is b) maintained for a time period sufficient for the mammal to mount an immune response to the immunization and inhibit growth of diseased cells . A contemplated Diprovocim compound corresponds in structure to structural Formula V, \\ NH V / O wherein -A is -H (hydrido) or -C(O)NH-R 1^; R-t-, R^, r3 and 2-(4-fluorophenyl) a group with the provisos that: 1) at least two of R-*-, R^, R-3 and R^ (R-*--^) or at least two R-*-, Rz-, and (Rj---) are a trans- 2-phenylcyclopropyl, a trans-2-(4-fluorophenyl) - cyclopropyl group or a mixture thereof, or each of r!-z* is a 2-(4-fluorophenyl) ethyl group, 2) at least one depicted pyrrolidinyldicarboxamido group has the (SrS) configuration, and each depicted R substituent other than a Cg-Cpg hydrocarbyl group is a trans-2- phenylcyclopropyl , a trans-2-(4-fluorophenyl) - cyclopropyl group or a mixture thereof 'when each of R-*--^ is other than 2-(4-fluorophenyl) ethyl, 3) no more than two of Ri-4 are Cg-Cpg hydrocarbyl groups when -A is -C(O)NH-R^, and 4) vihen A is hydrido, one of R-*-\"3 can be a Cf-Cig hydrocarbyl group and the depicted R^- containing pyrrolidinylcarboxamido group can have either the R or S configurations, or a mixture of both configurations; -Z is one or more of (N) or CH; \"n\" is a number whose average value is one to about eight; \"m\" is a number whose value is 1 to about 6; \"p\" is a number whose value is 1 to about 6; and 6 .\"q\" is a number whose value is 1 to about Diprovocim-I (W0 2018/005812; Compound 3) displayed strong adjuvant activity in mice, particularly abetting cellular immune responses. Diprovoci m-1 Immunization against a genetically engineered tumor- specific antigen, ovalbumin, when adjuvanted with Diprovocim-1, inhibited the growth of B16 melanoma and prolonged survival in the presence of immune checkpoint blockade by anti-PD-Ll . Immunization with ovalbumin plus the Diprovocim or ovalbumin plus the anti-PD-Ll inhibitor, exhibited some benefit, but 100% of mice responded to immunization with the three -6- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 components : Diprovocim, immunogen and checkpoint inhibitor. The data suggest Diprovocim-I boosts the success of anti-PD-Ll treatment by increasing the number and activation of tumor-specific CTLs capable of responding to this checkpoint inhibitor. As disclosed in WO 2018/005812 and Morin et al., J Am Ckem Soc, In Press (2018), several members of the Diprovocim family have been prepared, their activi ty 3. ssaved, and have been given numbers such as Diprovocim-I through Diprovocim-6 . Several other compounds of the Diprovocim family having similar activity profiles, similar to somewhat lesser activity values in the assays used, have also been prepared and assayed. Diprovocim-I has been used herein as an exemplary member of the whole family, and is to be understood hereinafter to mean a Diprovocim family member is used when the word Diprovocim is used without an added hyphenated numeral. Thus, when used in connection with the words \"family\" or \"a\" as in \"Diprovocim family\" or \"a Diprovocim\", the word \"Diprovocim\" is used to mean a member of the Diprovocim family as defined by Formula V. The word \"Diprovocim\" used with the word \"preferred\" refers to a compound of Formula I, and the phrase \"more preferred\" or \"more preferably\" refers to a Diprovocim family compound of Formula la. A \"most preferred\" Diprovocim is one of the compounds lettered A-I noted below. A preferred member of the Diprovocim family of compounds is a compound that corresponds in structure to structural Formula I, below, WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 R1\\MUl in which -A -C (O) NH-R^ . The depicted W and Z moieties are as described above. A still more preferred member of the Diprovocim family of compounds is a compound that corresponds in structure to structural Formula la, be Iowp R1\\ NH Structural formulas of currently most preferred compounds of Formula Ia in which are as previously 7 defined, and -Z is hy^drido (-H) are shown hereinafter as compounds of Formulas A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I. A Diprovocim is utilized in an adjuvant- sufficient amount to contact host mammal cells that express an antigenic disease-related marker molecule. The host mammal cells that express an antigenic disease-related marker compound such as a -8- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 peptide sequence are also contacted with an immune response-stimulating amount of a checkpoint inhibitor, preferably an antibody or paratope- containing antibody portion.

Mice received a booster immunization on day 10 after tumor inoculation in which anti-PD-Ll (200 pg) was administered on day 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 after tumor inoculation by i.p. injection. On day O, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, anti-CD4 (300 pg), anti-CD8 (300 pg), anti-NKl .1 (300 gg), or a mixture of these three antibodies was administered to C57BL/6J mice by i.p. injection. Tumor volume (Fig. 5L) and percent mouse survival (survivors/total mice) (Fig. 5M) are illustrated. P values for tumor volume analysis apply to the final time point as indicated in graphs and 'were calculated by Student's t test. P values for survival analysis were calculated by Kaplan-Pleier analysis. All results are representative of two independent studies.

WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 Fig. 7 illustrates that a Diprovocim does not stimulate IFN- secretion by mouse peritoneal macrophages. IFN- in the supernatants of mouse peritoneal macrophages after treatment with Diprovocim or LPS for 4 hours was assayed. The means of three independent samples are plotted. P values were determined by Student's t test; no significant differences were found between responses of unstimulated cells {0 nM) and Diprovocim-stimulated cells. Results are representative of two independent studies . Fig. 8A and Fig. 8B illustrate that anti- PD-Ll antibodies do not inhibit Bl6 tumor growth in mice. C57BL/6J mice (n=8) were injected s.c. with 2xlOJ B16-0VA melanoma cells on day O. Anti-PD-Ll (200 pg) or mouse IgG2a isotype control antibody was administered on days 3, 6 and 9 after tumor inoculation by i.p. injection. Fig. 8A is a graph of tumor volume versus time and Fig. 8B is a graph showing percent mouse survival (survivors/total mice) versus time .

Data points for Diprovocim are shown generally to the left of data points for Pam3CSK4 in Fig. 9A, above data points for Pam3CSK4 where the lines diverge in Fig. 9B. The means of three independent samples are plotted. Results are representative of two independent studies . Definitions Antibody: a polypeptide that immunologically binds to a ligand group. Antibodies, as used herein, are immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules . Such portions known in the art as Fab, Fab'; F(ab')2 and Fy are included. Typically, antibodies bind ligands that range in size from about 6 through about 34 Angstroms (A) with association constants in the range of about 10^ to about IO-*-*-* M-I, and as high as 10-^-3 Antibodies can bind a wide range of ligands, including small molecules such as steroids and prostaglandins, biopolymers such as nucleic acids, proteins and polysaccharides, and synthetic polymers such as polypropylene. An \"antibody combining site\" or \"paratope\" is that structural portion of an antibody molecule comprised of a heavy and light chain variable and hypervariable regions that specifically binds to (immunoreacts with) an \"antigen\" or \"epitope\". The term \"antibody\" is meant to particularly encompass monoclonal antibodies that are suitable for injection (pharmaceutically acceptable) into a diseased mammal in need of treatment without -15- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 undo adverse effects due to contaminants. Such monoclonal antibodies can be obtained from the animal species that is immunized as discussed herein, such as a human. Or, the antibodies can be induced in one animal and the antibody-producing cells modified to produce antibody protein sequences of the mammal to be immunized. Although other species of mammal are contemplated for immunization, a human is a particularly preferred recipient of the immunization. As a consequence, a contemplated monoclonal antibody that v;as originally induced in a mouse, for example, can be more useful to a human recipient as a so- called \"humanized\" antibody 7, or as a \"chimeric\" antibody. These terms are used herein as described in International Nonproprietary Names (INN) for biological and biotechnological substances (a review) , World Health Organization (2016), \u00a72.7. The word \"antigen\" has been used historically to designate an entity that is bound by an antibody or receptor, and also to designate the entity that induces the production of the antibody. More current usage limits the meaning of antigen to that entity bound by an antibody or receptor, whereas the word \"immunogen\" is used for the entity that induces antibody production or binds to the receptor. Where an entity discussed herein is both immunogenic and antigenic, reference to it as either an immunogen or antigen is typically made according to its intended utility. The term \"immunoreact\" in is used herein to refer to specific an antigenic determinant-containing (antigen) and a molecule containingits various forms binding between molecule an antibody WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 combining site such as a whole antibody molecule or a paratope-containing portion thereof. An \"antigenic determinant\" is the structural portion of the antigen that is immunologically bound by an antibody 7 combining site or T cell receptor. The term is also used interchangeably 7 with \"epitope\" . Antibodies can bind a single epitope of an antigen (monoclonal) or multiple epitopes (poly/clonal) . In a proteinaceous material, the length of a linear epitope is usually 7 recited as being about 5 to about 7 amino acid residues . The articles \"a\" and \"an\" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, \"an element\" means one element or more than one element. The word \"hydrocarbyl\" is used herein as a short hand term for a non-aromatic group that includes straight and branched chain aliphatic as well as alicyclic groups or radicals that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Thus, alkyl, alkeny 7l and alkynyl groups are contemplated, whereas aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenyl and naphthyl groups, which strictly 7 speaking are also hydrocarbyl groups, are referred to herein as ary7l groups or radicals, as discussed hereinafter. Where a specific aliphatic hydrocarbyl substituent group is intended, 7I group is an alkyl group. As a consequence, a generalized, but more preferred substituent can be recited by WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 replacing the descriptor \"hydrocarbyl\" with \"alkyl\" in any of the substituent groups enumerated herein. Although long chain (e.g., Cyg) hydrocarbyl groups are contemplated, examples of shorter (Cx-Czj) groups are used illustratively here. a skilled worker will understand, a substituent that cannot exist such as a alkenyl group is not intended to be encompassed by the vrord \"hydrocarbyl\", although such substituents with two or more carbon atoms are intended. Usual chemical suffix nomenclature is followed vihen using the word \"hydrocarbyl\" except that the usual practice of removing the terminal \"yl\" and adding an appropriate suffix is not always followed because of the possible similarity of a resulting name to one or more substituents. Thus, a hydrocarbyl ether is referred to as a \"hydrocarbyloxy\" group rather than a \"hydrocarboxy\" group as may possibly be more proper when following the usual rules of chemical nomenclature. Illustrative a molecule having a structural region that binds specifically 7 to a particular receptor molecule, usually via electrostatic forces -18- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 and/or hydrogen bonds. An exemplary ligand is the epidermal growth factor molecule . The \"marker molecule\" (antigen or immunogen) can be but need not be expressed on the cell surface, and rather can be expressed anywhere in the diseased cell. The reason for that is that substantially all of the native cellular proteins of mammals are processed into shorter peptides by the cell and bound extracellularly by class I MHC molecules. Such native proteins are typically so processed during the organism's immaturity, and T cells or other immune cells that may be induced by those native protein portions are eliminated by the organism prior to maturity, resulting in \"self protein\" tolerance. As a result, except in cases of certain immunological diseases, only foreign peptides or neoantigenic peptides caused by disease such as cancer whose cells result from mutation are recognized as \"foreign\" and induce an immune response to the MHC-bound peptide . Further, as to mutations, at times the mutation can be a frame-shift mutation, and an un\u00ad natural sequence of amino acids results . The marker molecule can also be a \"tumor antigen;\" that is, a protein that can be expressed by other cells during embryonic development, for example, but is characteristically expressed much more by tumors than by normal cells. Or the marker molecule can be an oncogene product, for example, an abnormal fusion protein created by a recombination event within tumor cells. The marker molecule can also be the product of an infectious agent such as a virus or bacterium a s we11. -19- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 Peptide/Polypeptide: an oligomer or polymer comprising at least two amino acid residues in which adjacent residues are linked by a peptide bond between the alpha-amino group of one residue and the alpha-carboxyl group of an adjacent residue. The primary structure of a polypeptide has a primary amine group at one terminus and a carboxylic acid group at the other terminus of the polymer. A peptide or polypeptide is depicted herein and usually in the art from left to right and in the direction from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus . Also, a polypeptide in aqueous solution is usually in one or more zwitterionic forms depending on the pH of the solution. The words \"peptide\" and \"polypeptide\" are used interchangeably herein. Protein: a single polypeptide or set of cross-linked polypeptides comprising more than about 100 amino acid residues. Proteins can have chemical crosslinking, e.g., via disulfide bridges, within the same polypeptide chain or between adjacent polypeptides. When a protein is glycosylated it can be called a glycoprotein. When a protein comprises one or more discrete polypeptide/protein subunits linked together, as by a peptide linkage, amino acid residue sequence, disulfide bridge, and the like, the protein is frequently termed a fusion protein, fusion polypeptide, chimeric fusion, and the like. Receptor: a biologically active proteinaceous molecule having a structural region that specifically binds to (or with) another molecule (ligand) . An exemplary receptor molecule is an antibody combining site or a transmembrane cellular protein molecule involved in intra- or intercellular signaling such as the endothelial growth hormone WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 receptor referred to as EGFR, ERBB and also as HER2, and the like. The term \"residue\" is used interchangeably with the phrase amino acid residue . All amino acid residues identified herein are in the natural or L- configuration . In keeping with standard polypeptide nomenclature, [J. Biol. Chem., 243:3557-59 (1969)], abbreviations for amino acid residues are as shown in the following Table of Correspondence.

A salient benefit of the invention is that the combination immunization provides synergistic results in inhibiting diseased cell growth. An advantage of the invention is that the combination immunization provides T cell help that virus- and bacteria-f ree vaccines have often lacked. Another benefit that the invention provides is that those skilled in the art have been finding, studying and publishing formulas of disease-related immunogens that have been ultimately unsuccessful since the early 1980''s but can now be successfully put to use. Still further benefits and advantages of the invention will be apparent to the skilled worker from the disclosures that follow. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention contemplates a method of inhibiting the growth of diseased cells in a mammal . Those diseased cells express one or more marker molecules that are absent on cells of the same type that are free of the disease or are present in the disease-free cells in significantly reduced numbers compared to the diseased cells. Workers skilled in the art have published numerous articles and reviews discussing marker molecules that are -22- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 present in diseased cells in amounts significantly greater than the amount present in disease-free cells and methods for determining those differences. See, for example, Kim et al., BMB Rep 50(6):285-298 (2017) and the citations therein. In addition, techniques such as quantitative western blots performed with optical density scans or radioactivity detection means and other means are well known in the art. Cells \"of the same type\" are disease-free cells from the same organ and tissue as the diseased cells. A contemplated method comprises the steps of immunizing a diseased mammal in need by: a) administering to the diseased mammal (i) an adjuvant- sufficient amount of a Diprovocim compound, (ii) a T cell-stimulating amount of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and (iii) an immunizing amount of that marker molecule. The immunized mammal is b) maintained for a time period sufficient for the mammal to mount an immune response to the immunization and inhibit growth of diseased cells. A contemplated Diprovocim compound corresponds in structure to structural Formula V, \\ NH V / O wherein -A is -H (hydrido) are same are a 2-(4 fIuorophenyl)ethyl, group that: of R-*-, R^, r3 R^ (R^--^) are a trans- 2-phenylcyclopropyl, a trans-2- (4-fIuorophenyl) - cyclopropyl group or a mixture thereof, or each of r3\"4 is a 2-(4-fIuorophenyl) ethyl group, 2) at least one depicted pyrrolidinyldi carboxamido group has the (S,S) configuration, and each depicted R substituent other than a C2-C23 hydrocarbyl group is a trans-2- phenylcyclopropyl, a trans-2-(4-fIuorophenyl) - cyclopropyl group or a mixture thereof when each of r3\"4 1s other than 2-(4-fIuorophenyl) ethyl, 3) no more than two of R1-^ are C2-C23 hydrocarbyl groups when -A is -C(O)NH-R^ , and 4) when A is hydrido, one of R^\"3 can be a Cf-C^g hydrocarbyl group and the depicted Rj- containing pyrrolidinylcarboxamido group can have either the R or S configurations, or a mixture of both configurations; -Z is one or more (N) or CH; \"n\" is a number whose average value member of the Diprovocim family of compounds of Formula V is a compound that corresponds in structure to structural Formula I, below, in which -A = -C(O)NH-R^, and the depicted R1\\ r! 4, W and Z moieties are as described above. In one more preferred compound of Formula I, at least one member of substituent pair R-^ and R^ -25- WO 2020/028532 and (either R^- trans-2- (4- fluorophenyl ) cyclopropyl group. It is also preferred that at least one member of substituent pair R^ and R^ or pair rA and R^ has the configuration a trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl or trans-2-(4-fluoro- phenyl ) cyclopropyl Rj-, Rz, R^ and R^ have trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl or trans-2- (4-fluorophenyl ) More preferably of R-^, R^, R^ and has the (1S,2R) configuration of a trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl or a trans-2-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropyl group. In another preference, each depicted pyrrolidinyldi carboxamido group has the (S, S) g _ configuration and each depicted R- 11 substituent , a trans-2-(4-fluoro \u00ad phenyl ) cyclopropyl group mixture thereof, and bonds to the cyclopropyl moiety have a (IS,2R) configuration . In another aspect, up to two of R^-^ in a compound of Formula I or one of its sub-generic formulas can be a Cg-Cgg hydrocarbyl group. It is preferable that the hydrocarbyl group be an alkyl group and have a length of 4 to about 16 carbon atoms, and more preferably still, about 6 to about 10 carbon atoms . Straight chained hydrocarbyl groups are also preferred, although up to two methyl and ethyl group substituents or both can be present as can an carbocyclic ring, and also one or two double or triple bonds. Specific Cg-Cgg hydrocarbyl groups WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 are discussed previously in the discussion of the use of the word hydrocarbyl. As is seen from Formula I, each molecule contains at least one, and preferably two, 3,4- pyrrolidinyldicarboxyl groups. The carboxyl groups are bonded to amine-terminated , r3 and substituents, forming four (or three) amido linkages. The two pyrrolidinyldicarboxyl groups can also therefore also be referred to as two pyrrolidinyldicarboxamido groups . Substituents bonded to the carboxyl groups of a pyrrolidinyldicarboxyl group can be in a cis or trans conformation, that is the two substituents can both project above or below the plane of the depicted ring (cis), or one can project above that plane and the other substituent project below (trans) . A cis- disubstituted pyrrolidinyldicarboxyl group with two identical substituents has a symmetric configuration and does not have enantiomeric forms. A trans- disubstituted pyrrolidinyldicarboxyl group with those same two identical substituents has an asymmetric (chiral) configuration and has enantiomeric forms. The two chiral configurations are referred to as (S,S) and (R,R), and are shown below. It is preferred that at least one, and more preferably both 3,4-pyrrolidinyldicarboxyl groups have the (S,S) configuration . WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 On the other hand, when -A of Formula V is hydrido and one of is a C2_C]_\u00ab hydrocarbyl group, and more preferably, a C]_o-Ci_6 hydrocarbyl group. A preferred compound corresponds in structure to Formula Va, below, in vihich the depicted Rj- -1, W R1 and Z moieties are as described above. The depicted -C(O)NH-R^ group can be in either the R configuration, the S configuration or present as a mixture of both configurations. The compounds with the S configuration are slightly more active and therefore more preferred. In a compound of Formula Va, the number of carbon atoms of a R^ group here is preferably 2 to 18, and more preferably 10 to 16 carbon atoms. This hydrocarbyl group is also more preferably an alkyl group that is a straight chained substituent although methyl and ethyl branches can be tolerated as can double and/or triple bonds in the chain. Cyclic hydrocarbyl substituent compounds and carbocyclic ring-containing substituents can also be utilized. It is also preferred that W be CH. Structural Formula la, shown below, incorporates several of the above preferences. -28- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 R1\\ NH R4 Structural formulas of currently most preferred compounds of Formula Ia in which -Z is hydride (-H) are shown below as compounds of Formulas A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I. Diprovocim numbers from WO 2018005812 are included for reference. Diprovocim-1A 7-17I For a Compound of Formula F, \"g\" in both depicted amido groups is preferably the same number (length) of 5 to 9 methylene groups for maximal activity against both human THP-I cells and mouse macrophages, with g = 5 providing the most active compound for both cell types. For a Compound of Formula G, \"h\" in the depicted amido group is 1 to 17, preferably 7 to 17, and more preferably 9 to 15. For a Compound of Formula I, \"j\" in the depicted -31- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 amido group is 1 to 17, preferably 3 to 11, and more preferably 5 to 9. A contemplated immune checkpoint inhibitor is typically an intact antibody or the paratope- containing portion of an antibody. Such a contemplated antibody or antibody paratope-containing portion is preferably a monoclonal humanized, chimeric or human antibody. Illustrative checkpoint US to proteins B7-1 and B7-2 to inhibit T cell activity. Anti-B7-1 and anti-B7-2 paratope-containing molecules can also be used to block the CTLA-4/B7-1+B7-2 interaction, thereby providing checkpoint inhibitor activity much as do antibodies to either of the binding pair PD-I and PD-Ll . Marker molecules are discussed in detail hereinafter. These materials are typically proteinaceous and can be the whole protein or an immunogenic portion of the protein. When used in a method of inhibiting the growth of diseased cells in a mammal, an adjuvant- sufficient amount of a Diprovocim compound, a T cell- stimulating amount of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and an immunizing amount of an antigenic (immunogenic) disease-related marker molecule are administered to contact host mammal cells. Those three components can be administered together, but it is preferred that the checkpoint inhibitor be administered separately from the Diprovocim and the antigen (immunogen) that can usually be administered together. Preferably, the checkpoint inhibitor is -32- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 administered intravenously (IV), whereas the Diprovocim and antigen are administered together in an immunizing pharmaceutical composition intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC). Those administrations can be made within the span of a few minutes, hours, days or weeks. Many checkpoint inhibitors are antibodies or paratope-containing antibody portions that typically have an in vivo terminal half-life on the order of about 2 to about 4 weeks. [See, product label, Section inhibitor can be administered prior to, coincidently with or a few days after administration of the Diprovocim and immunogen. Each of the components can be administered a plurality of times during a course of treatment. The use of multiple administrations is illustrated herein . A Diprovocim compound is administered in an adjuvant-sufficient amount. In the studies illustrated elsewhere herein, Diprovocim-I (A) used illustratively herein acted as a robust in vivo adjuvant or TLRl/TLR2 agonist that evoked a potent TLR2-dependent adjuvant activity in vivo in mice at about 0.25 to about 5 mg/kg (i.m.) when co-injected with an immunogen in an immunizing pharmaceutical composition by an intramuscular route. An adjuvant- sufficient amount can be readily 7 determined for mammals of greater weight by techniques well known in the art. In addition, Diprovocim-I did not display 7 the overt toxicity that is characteristic of LPS administration when used as an adjuvant. -33- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 A checkpoint inhibitor is typically utilized in an amount discussed in the product label. Illustrative dosage and administrations include the following using melanoma as exemplary diseased cell for use in the recited amounts: Keytruda\u00ae\u2014 melanoma: 2 mg/kg 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by7 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks for up to 3 years or until documented disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity; Tecentriq\u00ae--administer 1200 mg as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 3 weeks; and Opdivo\u00ae--unresectable or metastatic melanoma 240 mg every 7 2 weeks . An immunizing amount of an antigenic (immunogenic) disease-related marker molecule depends upon the immunogenicity of the marker used. The selection of peptides immunogenic for B cells and T cells is well known in the art and will not be gone into here. Many 7 such useful peptides have been reported in the art but were not as successful formulated as vaccines as desired, presumably because of a lack of T cell help. It is believed that the three-part immunizing pharmaceutical composition overcomes that deficiency. Many 7 small disease-related marker molecules such as peptides having a length of about 5 to about 20 residues are themselves poorly 7 immunogenic, and are often best utilized as haptens chemically linked to a carrier molecule. Illustrative proteinaceous carrier molecules include keyhole human gammaglobulin have been used as a hapten carrier, as have many other molecules have been used in the literature . A contemplated disease-related marker molecule is present in and/or on diseased cells. Diseased cells are typically cancerous or pathogen- infected . Disease-related marker molecules or portions thereof useful as immunogens present in and/or on solid tumor cells, include cancer stem cell (CSC) markers that are rarely expressed on normal tissue cells are listed below. [Kim et al., BMB Rep 50(6):285-298 (2017).]. Exemplary CSC markers that are largely absent in normal (disease-free) cells and present in diseased marker molecules are typically present in and/or on solid tumor cells. Illustrative solid tumors include osteosarcoma cells, Kaposi's sarcoma cells, melanoma cells, prostate cancer cells, glioblastoma cells, small cell lung carcinoma cells, breast cancer cells, liver cancer cells, colon cancer cells, ovarian cancer cells, renal cancer cells, gastric cancer cells, neuroblastoma cells, pancreatic cancer cells, and Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. A contemplated disease-related marker molecule or portion thereof can also be present in and/or on pathogen-infected cells. Illustrative -35- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 infecting pathogens include one or more of a virus, bacterium, fungus and unicellular parasite. Illustrative viruses include influenza, hepatitis viruses A, B, C and D, herpes viruses such as Varicella zoster (HPV) , and the like. Illustrative bacterial pathogens include E. coli, E. faecalis, S. aureus, and the like. An illustrative unicellular parasite is the malaria sporozoite of P. immunogens include the following disease-related marker molecule peptides that are listed below with a citation to their publication source.

As a consequence, use of the influenza A extracellular M2e portion of that protein as the immunogenic marker can provide protection from all of the influenza strains.

More than 50 types (strains) of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been identified. In humans, different papillomavirus types are known to cause distinct diseases. For example, HPV types 1 and 2 cause common warts, and types 6 and 11 cause condylomas and genital flat warts. In contrast, HPV types 16, 18 and 33 are carried in a majority of cervical cancers and do not cause the usual condyloma, but rather persist diffusely in the cervical endothelium exhibiting only minimal pathologic changes. It is thought that the HPV types associated with cervical cancer are maintained in a latent state in cervical endothelium tissues for years after initial infection and then progress in some cases to cause cervical cancer. U.S. Patent No. 5,180,806 discloses several peptide sequences that induce the production of antibodies. Illustrative peptide markers of type 16-related HPV sequences disclosed in US Patent No. 5,180,806 are set out below as illustrative. That patent also discloses peptide sequences from type 18 and type 33, as well as sequences encoded by the E2 ORF of HPV types 6, 11, 18 and 33. HPV Type 16-related TYDSEWQRDQFLSQVKIPC HKSAIYTLTYDSEWQRDQC CINCQKPLCPEEKQRH A contemplated immunizing composition also typically contains pharmaceutically acceptable salts, buffers and the like excipients that collectively are referred to as pharmaceutically (or physiologically) acceptable diluents or carriers as compared to those that can be present in a composition that is not intended for pharmaceutical use, as in an in vitro assay. These compositions are discussed in further detail hereinafter. A Diprovocim compound useful herein can be provided for use by itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Exemplary salts useful for a contemplated compound include but are not limited to the following: sulfate, hydrochloride, carboxylate group include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, ammonium, and the many substituted ammonium salts . The reader is directed to Berge, J. Pharm . Sci. 1977 68(1):1-19 for lists of commonly used pharmaceutically acceptable acids and bases that form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutical compounds . In some cases, the salts can also be used as an aid in the isolation, purification or resolution of the compounds of this invention. In such uses, the acid or base used and the salt prepared need not be pharmaceutically acceptable. A contemplated immunizing pharmaceutical composition contains an adjuvant-effective amount of a Compound of Formula V or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof dissolved or dispersed in a physiologically (pharmaceutically) acceptable carrier along with the immunogenic marker. Such a composition can be administered to mammalian cells in vitro as in a cell culture to contact those cells, or the cells can be contacted in vivo as in a living, host mammal in need. As is seen from the data herein, a contemplated Diprovocim compound present at femtomolar to nanomolar amounts provides an adjuvant effect in in vivo and in in vitro assay studies. When used as a vaccine adjuvant, a Compound of Formula V is preferably administered together with the selected marker immunogen. Both components are preferably present together in a single immunizing pharmaceutical composition as noted above. However, the two ingredients can be present in separately administered immunizing pharmaceutical compositions, and those separate compositions can be administered -43- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 up to about one to about two hours apart. It is preferred when two separate compositions are administered, that they be administered as close together in time as possible. In another embodiment, some or all of the Diprovocim compound utilized can be chemically bonded to the immunizing marker compound. That chemical bond can be formed using the Z substituent shown in Formula V as where a Z substituent that includes a carboxyl group can be bonded to an amino group of an immunogenic peptide marker compound. Alternatively, where an immunogenic marker compound is utilized as a hapten bonded to a carrier molecule, the Diprovocim compound can also be chemically bonded to the same carrier molecule. A contemplated immunizing pharmaceutical composition is typically administered in vivo to a subject in need thereof a plurality of times within one month, such as daily or weekly, and can be administered over a period of several months to several years. More usually, a contemplated composition is administered a plurality of times over a course of treatment. A contemplated immunizing pharmaceutical composition is preferably adapted for parenteral administration. Thus, an immunizing pharmaceutical composition is preferably in liquid form when administered, and most preferably, the liquid is an aqueous liquid, although other liquids are contemplated as discussed below, and a presently most preferred composition is an injectable preparation. Thus, injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous solutions or suspensions can be formulated according to the known -44- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol . Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution, phosphate-buffered saline. Other liquid pharmaceutical compositions include, for example, solutions suitable for parenteral administration. Sterile water solutions of a Compound of Formula V or sterile solution of a Compound of Formula V in solvents comprising water, ethanol, or propylene glycol are examples of liquid compositions suitable for parenteral administration. In some aspects, a contemplated Compound of Formula V is provided as a dry powder that is to be dissolved in an appropriate liquid medium such as sodium chloride for injection prior to use. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of an injectable composition. Dimethyl acetamide, surfactants including ionic and non-ionic detergents, polyethylene glycols can be used. Mixtures of solvents and wetting agents such as those discussed above are also useful. Sterile solutions can be prepared by dissolving the active component in the desired solvent system, and then passing the resulting solution through a membrane filter to sterilize it or, alternatively, by -45- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 dissolving the sterile compound in a previously sterilized solvent under sterile conditions. A mammal in having diseased cells in need of treatment (a subject) and to which a pharmaceutical composition containing at least a Compound of Formula V and a immunogenic marker compound is administered can be a primate such as a human, an ape such as a chimpanzee or gorilla, a monkey such as a cynomolgus monkey or a macaque, a laboratory animal such as a rat, mouse or rabbit, a companion animal such as a dog, cat, horse, or a food animal such as a cow or steer, sheep, lamb, pig, goat, llama or the like. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form. In such form, the composition is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the Diprovocim and immunogen. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of the preparation, for example, in vials or ampules . Results Diprovocim induces cytokine production in both human and mouse cells From a chemical library containing approximately 100,000 members, a class of compounds was identified with bilateral symmetry capable of activating TNF biosynthesis in PMA-differentiated human THP-I myeloid cells . The initial members of the class emerged from an undisclosed compound sublibrary designed to promote cell surface receptor dimerization (18) . -46- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 Diprovocim-I , developed from this class after extensive structure-activity Diprovocim-1 relationship (SAR) studies. It induced dose- dependent TNF production by THP-I cells (EC50 HO pM) and human PBMC (EC50 875 pM) (Fig. OA and Fig. IB), and by mouse peritoneal macrophages 6.7 nM) OC ID). In addition to TNF, Diprovocim-1 induced IL-6 production by mouse BMDC (Fig. OE). However, Diprovocim-1 failed to stimulate type I IFN production by mouse peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 7). The other numbered Diprovocims studied and those defined by structural Formula I also share these activities. Diprovocim targets TLR1/TLR2 and activates downstream MAPK and NF- signaling pathway To determine the molecular target of the Diprovocims , effects were analyzed on peritoneal macrophages from wild type C57BL/6J mice and C57BL/6J mice deficient in various TLR signaling components. Induction of TNF by Diprovocim was completely absent in TLRl- TLR2-def not in TLR-6 deficient macrophages (Fig. Diprovocim activity was also Diprovocim targets the mouse TLRl/TLR2 heterodimer. TLRl or TLR2 antibody significantly reduced the effect of Diprovocim on THP-I cells, indicating that human TLRl/TLR2 is also a target of Diprovocim molecules (Fig. induced phosphorylation of IKKo:, , p3 8, JNK, and ERK, as well as degradation of in THP-I cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages, indicating that Diprovocims activate conventional TLR1/TLR2 signaling, including MARK and canonical NF- signaling (Fig. IC and Fig. 2D) . Diprovocim exhibits adjuvant activity in vivo Intramuscular immunization of wild type mice with ovalbumin (OVA) plus either alum or Diprovocirn induced similar levels of serum OVA- specific IgG, which were highly elevated compared to levels induced by immunization with OVA plus vehicle (Fig. 2A-Fig. 3C). Whereas immunization with OVA+alum induced primarily the Th2-related IgGl, and Fig. 3C). Dendritic cells (DCs) purified from draining lymph nodes and spleens 24 hours after immunization of mice with OVA+Diprovocim activated OT-I CDS T cells co-cultured with them, as evidenced by CD69 upregulation on the OT-I cells (Fig. 2D) . In contrast, DCs from mice immunized with OVA+vehicle failed to induce CD69 expression on OT-I CDS T cells (Fig. 2D). This finding suggests that Diprovocims activate antigen cross-presentation by DCs and cross\u00ad priming T cells in vivo. WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 To further investigate whether cross\u00ad priming stimulated by a Diprovocim results in the development of killing ability by CD8+ T cells in vivo, a CTL killing assay Fluorescent marker-labeled and peptide (residues, 257-263)- pulsed target cells were injected i.v. into mice immunized with OVA+Diprovocim and the number of live target cells was measured by flow cytometry two days later. About 70% of target cells had been eliminated in mice immunized with OVA+Diprovocim, compared to about 10% in mice immunized with OVA+vehicle (Fig. 2E) . These data demonstrate that Diprovocirn exhibits adjuvant activity in antigen-specific antibody production and CTL killing, which was abrogated in TLRl- and/or TLR2-def icient mice (Fig. 2 A-C, F and G) . Complete inhibition of Bl6 tumor growth by combined checkpoint blockade and anti-cancer vaccine adjuvanted with Diprovocim The adjuvant activity of Diprovocim was examined in preventive immunization of wild type mice against B16 melanoma expressing OVA (B16-0VA) (Fig. 3A). Mice were injected i.m. distal to the tumor cell injection site with OVA with or without Diprovocim on the same day but prior to inoculation with Bl6-OVA cells. Tumor growth rates and survival times vrere similar for mice immunized with vehicle alone, Diprovocim alone, or OVA alone (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4C). Relative to OVA alone, immunization with Diprovocim+OVA modestly but significantly slowed tumor growth rate but failed to prolong survival; a similar effect was observed with OVA immunization -49- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 combined with anti-PD-Ll treatment (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4C) . Strikingly, although without effect by itself (Fig. 8A and Fig 8B) when anti-PD-Ll treatment was added to Diprovocim+OVA immunization, there was complete inhibition of tumor growth and 100% survival through eight 'weeks of observation (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4C). This dramatic antitumor effect was dependent on OYA immunization since Diprovocim alone combined with anti-PD-Ll treatment had no effect on tumor growth or mouse survival (Fig. 3D and Fig. 4E); this finding is consistent with poor immunogenicity of Bl6 melanoma (19-21) . To determine whether surviving mice were endowed with specific and long-term memory directed against the cancer antigen, the five-week survivors from Fig. 3C were re-challenged with Bl6-0VA cells and B16 cells lacking OVA (B16) . In the absence of any further therapy, complete failure of Bl6-0VA tumor growth was observed, whereas Bl6 tumors grew rapidly (Fig. 3F). Both B16 and Bl6-0VA tumor cells grew7 at similar rates in naive C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 3F) . Taken together, these data indicate that when used as an adjuvant in a cancer vaccine, a Diprovocim promotes antigen-specific antitumor immunity 7, vihich is greatly enhanced when combined with T cell checkpoint blockade in mice. Immunization with a Diprovocim as an adjuvant produces antigen-specific memory responses that protect the host from relapse of tumor growth. The antitumor effect of a Diprovocim was examined in therapeutic immunization of mice with already established Bl6-OVA tumors. C57BL/6J mice -50- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 were immunized with OVA with or without a Diprovocim on the day of or three days after tumor inoculation and received a booster immunization seven days later {Fig. 3A). In some mice, alum was substituted for Diprovocim to permit direct comparison between these two adjuvants. For all conditions, anti-PD-Ll treatment was initiated on day 3 after tumor inoculation and repeated every three days thereafter for 12 days . Mice immunized with OVA alone on the day of tumor inoculation survived an average of 24 days, and 100% of mice (8/8) died by 38 days after tumor inoculation . As expected, Diprovocim+OVA administered on the day of tumor inoculation completely inhibited tumor growth, permitting 100% of mice {8/8) to survive through 54 days of observation {Fig. 3G and Fig. 4H). When alum was used instead of a Diprovocim in the same study, tumor growth was partially inhibited, and the average survival time was 37 days, with 25% of mice (2/8) surviving past 54 days (Fig. 3G and Fig. 4H). When immunization was delayed until three days after tumor inoculation, Diprovocim+OVA still significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged average survival compared to OVA alone {41 days vs. 22 days) (Fig. 31 and Fig. 4J). In contrast, alum+OVA inhibited tumor growth but only slightly increased average survival time (30 days); the survival curve for alum+OVA was not significantly different from the curve for OVA alone (P = 0.082) (Fig. 31 and Fig. 4J). In pre- and post-tumor treatment, the effect of Diprovocim on tumor growth, survival rate, and survival time was superior to that of alum. -51- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 Diprovocim enhances antitumor CTL responses cellular mechanism by which combined anti-PD-Ll treatment and Diprovocim-adjuvanted immunization eliminates tumors was examined. Tumor- infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) of mice immunized with Diprovocim+OVA or alum+OVA were analyzed three days after tumor inoculation (Fig. 4A) . Tumors were collected 14 days after inoculation, and single-cell suspensions were antibody stained and analyzed by flow7 cytometry to detect total leukocytes, CD4 and NK cells, DCs, and macrophages. The leukocytes were also stained with antibody to the H-2Kb MHC-class I tetramer bound to the OVA peptide (residues 257-264), as well as antibody against CD8 to identify tumor-specific CD8 T cells. OVA immunizations containing a Diprovocim significantly increased the frequency of leukocytes in tumors compared to vehicle+OVA (Fig. 4B). Further analysis of these TILs revealed that a Diprovocim increased the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells including activated CD4 and CD8 T cells (CD44nig!1) and OVA-specific CDS T cells, as well as the frequency of NK cells (Fig. 4C - Fig. 5H) . Alum+OVA immunization showed a trend towards increasing TILs (Fig. 4B), which reached statistical significance for total and CD44nign CDS T cells (Fig. 4E and Fig. 5F). However, the magnitude of the increase was reduced compared to that induced by Diprovocim+OVA. OVA-specific CD8 T cells were not increased by7 alum+OVA immunization (Fig. 4G) on day 14 after tumor inoculation; neither were total and CD44high CD4 T cells (Fig. 4C and Fig. 5D) The frequencies mice immunized Diprovocim+OVA, and alum+OVA {Fig. 41 and Fig. 5J). Overall, these data indicate that the intra-tumor frequencies of CD4 and CDS T cells, activated CD4 and CDS T cells, OVA-specific CDS T cells, and NK cells, but not DCs or macrophages, correlated with the antitumor effects of Diprovocim and alum in immunized mice. To determine the immune cell population (s) necessary for the antitumor effect of Diprovocim+OVA plus anti-PD-Ll, mice were depleted of CDS T cells, CD4 T cells, NK cells, or all three cell populations using cell type-specific antibodies. The depletion antibodies were administered i.p. on the day of BIG- OVA tumor inoculation {day O) and every three days thereafter for 15 days {Fig. 4K). The effect of Diprovocim+OVA on both tumor growth and mouse survival was abrogated when mice were depleted of CDS T cells or all three cell types together {CD4 T, CDS T, NK cells) (Fig. 4L and Fig. 5M). In contrast, depletion of CD4 T cells or NK cells had little effect on the anti-tumor activity of Diprorocim+OVA (Fig. 4L and Fig. 5M). Interestingly, a slight, statistically significant difference between the effects of CDS T cell depletion vs. CD4+CD8+NK cell depletion was noted on tumor growth in mice treated with Diprovocim+OVA plus anti-PD-Ll, in which tumor growth was greater in mice depleted of all three cell types. However, this difference did not translate to a difference in either survival rate or time. This finding suggests a minor role of either CD4 T cells, NK cells, or both, in mediating the -53- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 effects of Diprovocim+OVA plus anti-PD-Ll. These data demonstrate that CD8 T cells are necessary for tumor eradication by therapeutic Diprovocim+OVA immunization and checkpoint inhibition in mice. Discussion It is believed that cancer vaccines targeted to tumor neoantigens can boost the success of immune checkpoint inhibition for cancer treatment by increasing the number and activation of tumor- specific CTLs capable of responding to checkpoint inhibitors. However, the type and magnitude of the T cell response to immunization depends critically on the vaccine adjuvant; currently only few7 adjuvants are approved for use in humans . Here, the actions of a novel and potent adjuvant, Diprovocim, that engages and activates human and mouse TLRl/TLR2 heterodimers are described. A Diprovocim bears no structural similarity to other reported synthetic chemical ligands, nor to the natural ligands that activate TLRl/TLR2 (22-26). A Diprovocim is more potent and efficacious in activating human TLRl/TLR2 than Pam3CSK4 (Fig. 9A and Fig. TLR2-dependent humoral and CTL responses to a co\u00ad administered antigen. When combined with checkpoint inhibition, a Diprovocim-adjuvanted immunization causes antigen-specific eradication of a rapidly fatal tumor, and induces memory responses capable of preventing tumor regrowth. Cure of the tumor is observed despite the fact that checkpoint inhibition alone is insufficient to prevent a fatal outcome -54- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 {Fig. 8A and Fig. 8B), supporting the premise of this combination immunotherapy. The data support the following key mechanistic events mediating the antitumor effect of Diprovocim-adjuvanted immunization plus checkpoint inhibition (Fig. 5). Diprovocim binds to TLR1/TLR2 on APCs, activating them to produce pro-inflarrmatory cytokines and take up the administered tumor-specific antigens for processing and presentation via MHC I and MHC II. Antigen presentation, costimulatory molecule expression, and cytokine secretion by APCs induce proliferation and activation of antigen- specific CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, which develop cytolytic activity toward tumor cells. NK cells are also activated by pro-inf lamrnatory cytokines and infiltrate the tumor site. The addition of anti-PD- Ll inhibits the major immunosuppressive mechanism active in the tumor microenvironment, permitting uninhibited T cell activation and proliferation in response to TCR/CD28 ligation (27-29) , further promoting tumor cell lysis mediated by CD8 T cells. Numerous reports document both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects of TLR2 signaling, which may depend on the cell type or type of cancer under study. For example, TLR2 signaling supports tumor growth through induction of immune suppressive cytokines such as IL-IO , and activation of myeloid derived suppressor cells and tumor associated macrophages (30-32) . In contrast, TLR2 signaling also promotes tumor regression by stimulating DC activation and cross-presentation (33), and downregulating Treg function (34\u201436). For a Diprovocim, the overall outcome of systemic TLR2 activation, in the context of OVA -55- WO 2020/028532 PCT/US2019/044421 immunization combined with immune checkpoint inhibition, was tumor cell lysis and tumor growth inhibition mediated by tumor-infiltrating antigen- specific CD8 T cells. The therapeutic index of an adjuvant presumably depends upon the efficiency of conjoint targeting of antigen to an APC, and activation of that APC. The mode of interaction between a Diprovocim and TLR2 has been studied by X-ray crystallography, and its contacts with this subunit of the receptor will be reported elsewhere. The structure of a Diprovocim-TLRl /2 complex points to opportunities for a Diprovocim modification to incorporate immunogenic peptides, which might permit optimization of the therapeutic index by assuring that all active Diprovocim molecules are accompanied by antigen. Diprovocim is easy to synthesize and can be rapidly adapted to incorporate tumor-associated antigens and neoantigens. These features make it an attractive candidate for clinical development.
