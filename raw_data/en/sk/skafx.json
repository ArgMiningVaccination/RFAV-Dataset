Two-Dose Primary Series Participants 18 years of age and older Safety of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted was assessed in a clinical study conducted in the United States (US) and Mexico (NCT04611802; Study 1). In this study, 26,106 participants 18 years of age and older have received at least one dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. Additional safety data are available from three other clinical trials in the United Kingdom (NCT04583995; Study 2), South Africa (NCT04533399; Study 3), and Australia (NCT04368988, Parts 1 and 2 in Australia and the US; Study 4) which evaluated a COVID-19 vaccine containing the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (rS) protein and Matrix-M adjuvant but manufactured by a different process. Adolescents 12 Through 17 Years of Age Safety of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in adolescents was assessed in the adolescent primary series expansion of Study 1 conducted in the US. In this study, 2,232 participants 12 through 17 years of age have received at least one dose of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (n=1,487) or placebo (n=745). Safety Data from Study 1 In Study 1, an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study, participants 18 years of age and older have received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (n=19,735) or placebo (n=9,847). Overall, male, 48.0% were female; 75.0% were White, 11.8% were Black or African American, 4.1% were Asian, 6.7% were American Indian (including Native Americans) or Alaskan Native, and 1.6% were multiple races; 21.9% were Hispanic/Latino. Demographic characteristics of participants were well balanced between the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and placebo groups. During the study, COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use became available, and participants, when eligible for vaccination, were offered the opportunity to cross over from the originally assigned study treatment to the other study treatment (vaccine or placebo) in a blinded fashion (\"blinded crossover\"). In the post-crossover period, 6,416 participants received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, and 15,298 participants received placebo. The demographic characteristics of participants in the pre- and post-crossover groups were comparable. Due to data quality issues at two study sites, a total of 289 additional participants were excluded from the safety analysis set. Study 1 also included an adolescent primary series expansion. In the pre-crossover period, among adolescent participants who received at least one dose of vaccine (n=1487) or placebo (n=745), 52.5% were male, 47.5% were female; 74.4% were White, 13.9% were Black or African American, 3.4% were Asian, 2.1% were American Indian (including Native Americans) or Alaskan Native, and 5.3% were multiple races; 18.5% were Hispanic/Latino. Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and placebo groups. During the study, COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use became available, and participants, when eligible for vaccination, were offered the opportunity to cross over from the originally assigned study treatment to the other study treatment (vaccine or placebo) in a blinded fashion (\"blinded crossover\"). In the post-crossover period, 665 participants received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, and 1,353 participants received placebo. The demographic characteristics of participants in the pre- and post-crossover groups were comparable. Study 1 was amended to include a booster dose in which 12,738 individuals 18 to 96 years of age received a booster dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted starting approximately 6 months after the two-dose primary series. Participants 18 years of age and older Solicited Adverse Reactions During the pre-crossover period, local and systemic adverse reactions were solicited within 7 days following each dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted or placebo in participants using an electronic diary.

Of participants who received two doses of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in the pre-crossover period (n=19,111), 78% had a follow-up duration of at least 2 months (median = 2.5 months) after Dose 2. Of participants who received two doses of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in the post-crossover period (n=6,346), 99% had a follow-up duration of at least 2 months (median = 4.4 months) after the last dose. From Dose 1 through 28 days following Dose 2 in the pre-crossover period, the overall frequency of non-serious unsolicited adverse events was similar in the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted group (11.6 %) and the placebo group (11.2%). The most frequently reported unsolicited adverse reactions were chills (0.4% vaccine recipients vs. 0.1% placebo recipients), lymphadenopathy-related reactions (0.3% vaccine recipients vs. 0.1% placebo recipients), and injection site pruritus (0.1% vaccine recipients vs. 0.0% placebo recipients). Lymphadenopathy-related reactions included lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, lymph node pain, and axillary pain. All lymphadenopathy-related reactions occurred in participants 18 through 64 years of age. In the pre-crossover period, serious adverse events were reported by 199 (1.0%) participants in the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted group and by 108 (1.1%) participants in the placebo group. In the post-crossover period, serious adverse events were reported by 88 (1.4%) participants who received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and by 178 (1.2%) participants who received placebo. Within 7 days of any dose (including 26,151 Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted recipients and 25,145 placebo recipients in both the pre- and post-crossover periods), hypersensitivity reactions (including urticaria, hypersensitivity, angioedema, and swelling of the face, lips, ear, and/or eyelids) were reported by 26 participants after the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (0.1%) and 8 participants after placebo (0.03%). Of these events, 1 reaction (generalized urticaria and facial angioedema with a duration of 2 days) was serious and occurred 2 days after Dose 1 of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. Within 28 days of any dose, the following numerical imbalances with more events in vaccine than placebo recipients (including 26,151 Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted recipients and 25,145 placebo recipients in both the pre- and post-crossover periods) were observed for the following serious and other adverse events of interest. - Myocarditis and/or pericarditis were reported by two participants after the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (0.01%) and no participants after placebo. One serious event was reported by a 67-year-old male 28 days after Dose 1, associated with concomitant COVID-19, and one non-serious event was reported by a 20-year-old male 10 days after Dose 1. Among the two reported events, one was reported as resolved and one did not have follow-up available. Reports of myocarditis and/or pericarditis from Study 1 and Study 2 (see Safety Data from Study 2) provide evidence for increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following administration of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. - Events of cardiomyopathy or cardiac failure were reported by eight participants after the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (0.03%) and one participant after placebo (<0.01%). All events were serious. Additionally, an event of congestive cardiac failure was reported after the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted by a participant who was excluded from the safety analysis set. Currently available information on cardiomyopathy or cardiac failure is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. - Events of acute cholecystitis were reported by six participants after the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (0.02%) and two participants after placebo (0.01%). All events were serious. Currently available information on cholecystitis is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. - A total of 12 non-cardiac, non-neurovascular thrombotic and embolic events were reported by 11 participants after the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (0.04%) and a total of seven events were reported by six participants after placebo (0.02%). Events following the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (n=5), arterial occlusive disease (n=1 each); six of the events were serious, including pulmonary embolism (n=5) and deep vein thrombosis (n= 1). Events following placebo included pulmonary embolism (n=3), and deep vein thrombosis and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (n=2 each), all of which were serious except deep vein thrombosis and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (n= 1 each). Currently available information on non-cardiac, non-neurovascular thrombotic and embolic events is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. Events of uveitis (iritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis) were reported by 3 participants after Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (0.01%) and 2 participants after placebo (0.01%). All events were non-serious. One participant had onset of uveitis after Dose 1 of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted which resolved and then recurred following Dose 2. The two placebo recipients with events appeared to have had a previous history of uveitis and one of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted recipients had a history of iritis. Currently available information on uveitis is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. Adolescents 12 Through 17 Years of Age Solicited Adverse Reactions During the pre-crossover period, local and systemic adverse reactions were solicited within 7 days following each dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted or placebo in participants using an electronic diary. The reported frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions are presented for participants 12 through 17 years of age in [Table 3](#Table3). |Event||Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted||Placebo | N = 1448 n (%) N = 1394 n (%) N = 726 n (%) N = 686 n (%) - [*](#footnote-reference-30) - 7 days included day of vaccination and the subsequent 6 days.

Participants who only received the first dose in the pre- and post-crossover periods were monitored for non-serious unsolicited adverse events through 49 days after administration of vaccine or placebo and for serious adverse events for the duration of study participation. In the pre-crossover period 1,487 participants received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and 745 participants received placebo. In the post-crossover period, 665 participants received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and 1,353 received placebo. Of participants who received two doses of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in the pre-crossover period (n=1,468), 86% had a follow-up duration of at least 2 months (median = 71 days) after Dose 2. Of participants who received two doses of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in the post-crossover period (n=638), 43% had a follow-up duration of at least 1 month (median = 30 days) after the last dose. From Dose 1 through 28 days following Dose 2 in the pre-crossover period, the overall frequency of non-serious unsolicited adverse events was similar in the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted group (15.5%) and the placebo group (15.3%). The most frequently reported unsolicited adverse reactions were lymphadenopathy-related reactions (0.9% vaccine recipients vs. 0.0% placebo recipients), fatigue (0.5% vaccine recipients vs. 0.0% placebo recipients), decreased appetite (0.3% vaccine recipients vs. 0.0% placebo recipients), arthralgia (0.2% vaccine recipients vs. 0.0% placebo recipients), injection site pruritus (0.2% vaccine recipients vs. 0.0% placebo recipients), and myalgia (0.1% vaccine recipients vs. 0.0% placebo recipients). Lymphadenopathy-related reactions included lymphadenopathy, lymph node pain, and axillary pain. In the pre-crossover period, serious adverse events were reported by 7 (0.5%) participants in the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted group and by 2 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group. In the post-crossover period, serious adverse events were reported by 3 (0.5%) participants who received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and by 2 (0.1%) participants who received placebo. Within 28 days of any dose, one serious adverse event of interest of myocarditis was observed. The event was reported by a 16-year-old adolescent participant 2 days after Dose 2 of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. Safety Data from Other Studies with Primary Series Study 2 was a randomized, placebo-controlled study that included a crossover design. Approximately 10,800 participants received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine containing SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (rS) protein and Matrix-M adjuvant, manufactured by a different process than the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted evaluated in Study 1, and approximately 10,900 participants received at least one dose of placebo. Serious events of myocarditis in a 19-year-old male and pericarditis in a 60-year-old female were reported within 10 days following administration of Dose 2 and Dose 1, respectively, of the vaccine. Both events were reported as resolved. No events of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported following administration of placebo. A serious event of Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome was reported 9 days following administration of Dose 1 of the vaccine. No events of Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome were reported following administration of placebo. In Studies 3 and 4, approximately 5,500 participants received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine containing SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (rS) protein and Matrix-M adjuvant, manufactured by a different process than the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted evaluated in Study 1. No serious adverse events considered related to vaccination were reported in these studies. No events of myocarditis/pericarditis or Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome were reported in vaccine recipients in these studies. Booster Dose Following a Primary Series of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in Participants 18 Years or Older In an open label portion of Study 1, 12,738 participants 18 years of age and older (based on enrollment until March 26, 2022) received a single booster dose of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (0.5 mL) at least 6 months after the two-dose primary series (median of 11.0 months between completion of primary series and booster dose). Safety analyses included evaluation of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions within 7 days after a booster dose (n=238) and nonserious unsolicited adverse events within 28 days after a booster dose (n=298). Safety analysis also included evaluation of serious adverse events and adverse events of interest after a booster dose (n=12,738) with a median follow-up of 121 days post booster dose through data extraction of August 18, 2022. The safety follow-up is ongoing. Among the 12,738 boosted participants, 84.3% were between 18 and 64 years of age and 15.7% were 65 years of age and older, 50.6% were male, 49.4% were female; 72.6% were White, 14.4% were Black or African American, 3.8% were Asian, 6.5% were American Indian (including Native Americans) or Alaskan Native, 0.2% were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 1.7% were multiple races; 21.4% were Hispanic or Latino. Solicited Adverse Reactions Local and systemic adverse reactions were solicited within 7 days following the third (booster) dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted using an electronic diary. The reported frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions in participants 18 years of age and older are presented in [Table 4](#Table4). |Event||Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted Booster | N = 238 n (%) | | |Local Adverse (non-serious and serious) Participants were monitored through 28 days after the booster dose for unsolicited adverse events. Out of 12,738 total booster participants, data are available for 298 participants for non-serious unsolicited adverse events until May 19, 2022 (median follow-up post booster of 122 days). There were no unsolicited adverse events that occurred in more than one participant. Additionally, data for serious adverse events and adverse events of interest, including but not limited to allergic, neurologic, inflammatory, vascular, and autoimmune disorders, are available for 12,738 participants until August 18, 2022 (median follow-up post booster of 121 days). An event of myocarditis was reported by a 28-year-old male participant 3 days after a booster dose of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in Study 1. The event following the booster dose was adjudicated as a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction; however, clinical features were also consistent with myocarditis (chest pain and elevated troponin), and no cardiac catheterization or cardiac MRI was performed during the acute presentation. A serious adverse event of autoimmune hepatitis was reported in a 57-year-old male participant approximately 12 days after a booster dose of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. A year prior to vaccination, the participant had transient increases in alanine transferase (ALT), up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). From a normal baseline ALT prior to receipt of the first dose of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, ALT increased to 4 times ULN following the second dose of the primary series. After the booster dose, a recurrent and higher ALT increase was observed (7 times ULN). Viral hepatitis tests were negative, and no alternative etiologies have been identified. The event has been ongoing for 8 months and is not resolved with azathioprine treatment. Currently available information for this event is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. Two serious adverse events in the injected arm were reported, including muscle edema in a 51-year-old female with onset 7 days after booster vaccination and cellulitis of the injection site in a 58-year-old male with onset 3 days after booster vaccination. The cellulitis resolved following antibiotic and steroid treatment. The muscle edema was not responsive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and has been ongoing for 6 months and is not resolved. Available information for these events is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. A serious adverse event of extensive left leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was reported 7 and 10 days, respectively, post booster in a 35-year-old female participant receiving oral contraceptive therapy. She required surgical intervention, thrombolytic therapy, and needs prolonged anti-coagulation. Available information for these events is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. Booster Dose Following Primary Vaccination with Another Authorized or Approved COVID-19 Vaccine The safety of a Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted booster dose in individuals who completed a primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from the report of an independent, multicenter, randomized, controlled, Phase 2, trial conducted in the United Kingdom (ISRCTN 73765130). This study was conducted in adults aged 30 years and older with no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. One study group (n=114 participants; median age 63 years) received Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted administered at least 84 days (median 105 days) after completion of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine primary series. Reported adverse reactions through 28 days following a Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted booster dose did not identify any new safety concerns, as compared with adverse reactions reported following two doses of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted given as a primary series. 6.2 Post-Authorization Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-authorization use of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis Nervous System Disorders: paresthesia, hypoesthesia 8 REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS See Overall Safety Summary ( [Section 6](#S6)) for additional information.

Drug Interactions There is no information on co-administration of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted with other vaccines. 11. Use In Specific Populations 11.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted during pregnancy. Women who are vaccinated with the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted during pregnancy are encouraged to enroll in the registry by visiting https://c-viper.pregistry.com/. Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. In a developmental toxicity study, 0.1 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of SARS-CoV-2 rS protein (5 mcg), one-fifth the quantity of adjuvant (10 mcg) and inactive ingredients which comprise the formulation buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, and 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 80) contained in a single dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 27 and 13 days prior to mating, and on gestational days 7 and 15. No vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal development or postnatal development were reported in the study. 11.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data are not available to assess the effects of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. 11.3 Pediatric Use Emergency Use Authorization of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age is based on safety and effectiveness data in this age group and in adults. The Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted is not authorized for use in individuals younger than 12 years of age. 11.4 Geriatric Use Clinical studies that evaluated primary vaccination with the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted included participants 65 years of age and older receiving vaccine or placebo, and their data contribute to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy. In an ongoing Phase 3 clinical study (Study 1), 12.6% (n=2,480 Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, n=1,235 placebo) of participants were 65 years of age and older and 1.8% (n=361 Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, n=179 placebo) of participants were 75 years of age and older. Vaccine efficacy in participants 65 years of age and older was 78.6% 50 through 64 years of age. [see [Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18)](#S18)]. Overall, there were no notable differences in the safety profiles observed between participants 65 years of age and older and younger participants. [see [Overall Safety Summary (6)](#S6)] In the clinical study that evaluated a booster dose of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, 15.7% (n=2006) of participants were 65 years of age and older and 2.6% (n=326) of participants were 75 years of age and older. Overall, there were no notable differences in the safety profiles observed between participants 65 years of age and older and younger participants. [see [Overall Safety Summary (6)](#S6)] 13.

Clinical Studies 18.1 Efficacy of Two-Dose Primary Series in Participants 18 Years of Age and Older Study 1 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study in participants 18 years of age and older in United States and Mexico. Upon enrollment, participants were stratified by age (18 through 64 years or 65 years of age and older). The study excluded participants who were significantly immunocompromised due to immunodeficiency disease; had active cancer on chemotherapy; received chronic immunosuppressive therapy or received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products within 90 days; were pregnant or breastfeeding; or had a history of laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19. Participants with clinically stable underlying comorbidities were included as were participants with well-controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A total of 29,945 participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted or placebo 3 weeks apart. Assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19 are planned for up to 24 months after the second dose. The primary efficacy analysis population (Per Protocol Efficacy [PP-EFF] Analysis Set) included 25,657 participants who received either the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (n=17,272) or placebo (n=8,385), received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 on day 21 median 21 days, range 14-60), did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 6 days after the second dose. In the PP-EFF Analysis Set, 48.5% were female; 21.5% were Hispanic or Latino; 75.9% were White, 11.0% were Black or African American, 6.2% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.4% were Asian, and 1.7% were multiracial. The median age of participants was 47 years (range 18-95 years) and 11.7% were 65 years of age and older. Of the study participants in the PP-EFF Analysis Set, 95.2% were at high risk for COVID-19 due to living or working conditions involving known frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2, comorbidities (chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, severe obesity, and diabetes), or age 65 years. Between participants who received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions. Participants in the PP-EFF Analysis Set were included in the primary efficacy analysis up until the time that they received their crossover vaccination. As of the September 27, 2021, data cutoff date, the PP-EFF Analysis Set had a median follow-up of 2.5 months post-Dose 2 during the pre-crossover period. Efficacy of a Primary Series in Participants 18 Years of Age and Older Vaccine efficacy in participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 6 days after the second dose is presented in [Table 5](#Table5). Based on data accrued through September 27, 2021, the efficacy of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted to prevent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 from 7 days after Dose 2 was 90.4% (95% CI: 83.8%, 94.3%). In the PP-EFF Analysis Set, no cases of moderate or severe COVID-19 were reported in participants who had received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, compared with nine cases of moderate COVID-19 and four cases of severe COVID-19 reported in participants who had received placebo. |Subgroup||Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted||Placebo||Vaccine Efficacy (95% CI) (%)| |Partici-pants| N Cases| n (%) |Mean Incidence Rate Per 1,000 Person-Years| N n (%) [](#footnote-59) - [*](#footnote-reference-58) - Vaccine efficacy (VE) evaluated in participants without major protocol deviations who are seronegative (for SARS-CoV-2) at baseline and do not have a laboratory confirmed current SARS-CoV-2 infection with symptom onset through 6 days after the second dose, and who have received two doses of vaccine or placebo as randomized. - [](#footnote-reference-59) - Mean incidence rate per 1,000 person-years was estimated with weighting for age strata reflective of the distribution seen in the study population. - [](#footnote-reference-60) - Based on log-linear model of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection incidence rate using Poisson regression with treatment group and age strata as fixed effects and robust error variance, where VE = 100 \u00d7 (1 - ratio of incidence rate) (Zou 2004). - [\u00a7](#footnote-reference-61) - Met primary efficacy endpoint criterion for success with a lower bound confidence interval (LBCI) >30% at the planned primary confirmatory analysis.

Vaccine efficacy in participants of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity was participants who were not Hispanic/Latino. Vaccine efficacy in participants 65 years of age and older was 78.6% in participants 50 through 64 years of age. 18.2 Effectiveness of a Two-Dose Primary Series in Adolescents 12 Through 17 Years of Age Effectiveness in adolescents 12 years through 17 years of age is based on a comparison of immune responses in this age group to adults 18 years through 25 years of age. Study 1 is an ongoing Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study that included 2,247 participants 12 through 17 years of age in the United States. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted or placebo 3 weeks apart. The study excluded participants who were significantly immunocompromised due to immunodeficiency disease; had active cancer on chemotherapy; had received chronic immunosuppressive therapy or had received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products within 90 days; were pregnant or breastfeeding; or had a history of laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19. Participants with clinically stable underlying comorbidities and participants with well-controlled HIV infection were included. In Study 1, an analysis was conducted of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers 14 days after Dose 2 in a subset of adolescents 12 through 17 years of age and participants 18 through 25 years of age from the adult main study. Noninferior immune responses as assessed by geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates were demonstrated in a comparison of adolescents 12 through 17 years of age to participants 18 through 25 years of age ( [Table 6](#Table6)). |Assays||Time| Point |12 Years Through 17 Years||18 Years Through 25 Years||12 Years Through 17 Years/ | 18 Years Through 25 - The 95% CI for GMT is calculated based on the t-distribution of the log-transformed values, then back transformed to the original scale for presentation. - [](#footnote-reference-63) - GMR is defined as the ratio of two geometric mean titers for comparison of two age cohorts.

The 95% CI for the difference of SCR between groups was calculated with the method of Miettinen and Nurminen. descriptive efficacy analysis evaluating PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 cases was performed in 1,799 participants who were included in the per-protocol efficacy (PP-EFF) Analysis Set, which required receipt of two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 on day 21), no exclusionary protocol deviation(s), and no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 6 days after the second dose. In the PP-EFF Analysis Set, 47.2% were female; 15.8% were Hispanic or Latino; 76.1% were White, 12.9% were Black or African American, 1.1% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 3.6% were Asian, and 5.6% were multiracial. The median age of participants was 14 years (range 12-17 years). Of the study participants in the PP-EFF Analysis Set, 25.3% were obese. Between participants who received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics. The median interval between doses of study vaccine was 22 days (range 14-43). As of the August 9, 2021, data cutoff date, the PP-EFF Analysis Set had a median follow-up of 67 days post-Dose 2 during the pre-crossover period. Vaccine efficacy in participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 6 days after the second dose is presented in [Table 7](#Table7). Based on data accrued through August 9, 2021, the efficacy of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted to prevent PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 from 7 days after Dose 2 was 78.29% (95% CI: 37.55%, 92.45%). No cases of moderate or severe COVID-19 were reported in participants who had received the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted or placebo. |Subgroup||Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted||Placebo||Vaccine Efficacy (95% CI) (%)| |Partici-pants| N |COVID-19 | Cases n (%) |Mean Incidence Rate Per 100 Person-Years||Partici-pants| N |COVID-19 | Cases n (%) |Mean Incidence Rate Per 100 Dose Following a Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted Primary Series in Participants 18 Years and Older Effectiveness of a booster dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted was based on assessment of neutralizing antibody titers (MN50) against the original Immunogenicity analyses compared the MN50 titers following the booster dose to the MN50 titers following the primary series. In the open-label booster phase of Study 1, participants 18 years of age and older received a single booster dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted at least 6 months after completion of the primary series. A subset of 243 participants were included in the per-protocol immunogenicity (PP-IMM) analysis set, did not have serologic or virologic evidence (if available) of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 28 days post booster dose. Among participants assessed for immunogenicity, 87.2% were 18-64 years of age, 12.8 % were 65 years of age and older, 51.0% were males, 49.0% were female; 15.6% were Hispanic or Latino; 81.5% were White, 11.1% were Black or African American, 0.4% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.9% were Asian, and 1.6% were multiracial. The median age of participants was 52 years (range 19-79 years). Prespecified immunogenicity non-inferiority analyses included an assessment of MN50 geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio and difference in seroconversion rates. Seroconversion for a participant was defined as achieving a 4-fold rise in MN50 from baseline (before the booster dose and before the first dose of the primary series). The analysis of the GMT ratio of MN50 following the booster dose compared to the primary series met the non-inferiority criteria for a booster response (lower limit of the 95% CI > 0.67) and point estimate > 0.83. The lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates was -14.4%, which did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for a booster response (lower limit of 95% CI for the percentage difference of -10%). These analyses are summarized in [Table 8](#Table8) and [Table 9](#Table9). | = Per-Protocol Immunogenicity.| |Note: The median duration between the time of the second dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted and the time of the booster dose was 10 | point estimate > 0.83 criteria: Yes| | Booster Dose| (N = 239) SCR (%) (95% CI) |Primary Series| (N = CI) [#](#footnote-79) - [*](#footnote-reference-74) - PP-IMM Analysis Set included participants who received two doses (0.5 mL 3 weeks apart) of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted in the initial vaccination period or in the blinded crossover vaccination period, had an immunogenicity blood sample collected at Day 35, did not have serologic or virologic evidence (if available) of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 28 days post booster dose, did not receive an emergency use authorized COVID-19 vaccine, received the booster dose, and remained blinded on study and without major protocol deviations until 7 days post-crossover Dose 2. - [](#footnote-reference-75) - The analysis included a total of 239 participants of the PP-IMM analysis set who had immunogenicity data (microneutralization) available for both the booster and primary series - [](#footnote-reference-76) - 95% CI is based on the Clopper-Pearson method. - [\u00a7](#footnote-reference-77) - Based on the Tango method. - [\u00b6](#footnote-reference-78) - Comparison between SCR of 28 days post-booster relative to time of booster and SCR of 14 days after second dose of the primary series relative to time of first dose. - [#](#footnote-reference-79) - Non-inferiority of the single booster dose was achieved if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference of the proportion of participants with SCR at 28 days after a single booster dose relative to the time of booster vaccination versus at 14 days after the second dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted relative to the time of first vaccination was > -10%.

[WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA)? ] An EUA is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical products, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. An EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. A product authorized for emergency use has not undergone the same type of review by FDA as an FDA-approved product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of the scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic. An EUA is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 EUA declaration justifying emergency use of this product, unless terminated or revoked (after which the product may no longer be used).
