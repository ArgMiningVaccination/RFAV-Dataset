Bu t the true facts were less impressive. The team at Seoul National University used 242 eggs from 16 women donors; from which they derived 30 blastocysts. They ende d up with just one line of stem cells, derived from a blastocyst mad e from an enucleated egg and transplanted nuclear material from the same woman .2 The theoretical possibility of producing stem cells for therape utic purposes from cloned embryos has thus moved one step closer butmany practical difficulties remain. First, the low efficiency of mammalian cloning (only 0-5% becom e viable offspring) 3highlights the high frequency of genetic abnormalities resulting from the technology. It is not yet known whether simi lar abnormalities would occur in stem cells derived from cloned emb ryos, but it stands to reason that they would. Second, some of the di seases given as candidates for cell therapy are autoimmune conditions like type I diabetes; suggesting that cloned stem cells derived from the patient would induce the same rejection when transplanted and t hus be ineffective. Third there remain concerns, based on the difficul ty of controlling the growth of transplanted fetal cells, about embry onic stem cells functioning abnormally after transfer. These concerns about the likely effectiveness and safety of therapeutic cloning have not been truthfully conveyed to a publ ic fed on 20 second soundbites which fail to do justice to the scienti fic facts or complex ethical issues involved. Even if the practical difficulties are overcome, the key ethica l objection remains. The end of saving life cannot ever justify t he means of creating and cannibalising human embryos, cloned or otherwis e. Furthermore, allowing such research at all will lead inevitably to attempts to produce reproductive clones, as long as rogue scien tists exist. And meanwhile, huge advances in the ethical alternative of adult stem cell technology continue to make embryo cloning rapidlyredundant. It is very sad that the British media and public have been consistently misled into seeing cloned embryos as a panacea for treating diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, through the Governme nt's failure to highlight the dangers and to rectify misconceptions about the properties of adult stem cells propagated in the now seriously dated 2000 Donaldson report Stem Cell Research . Selective interpretation and presentation of scientific data is both irresponsible and dangerous because it falsely raises the hopes of vulnerable people. Honest and balanced reporting of the facts s hould always take precedence over the prestige and profit motives of the British government and biotech industry. Cloning and cannibalising embryos for stem cells in the way tha t the Korean scientists have is unsafe, unnecessary and unethical. A gullible and ill-informed public needs to be better informed of the dang ers and made more aware of safer ethical alternatives for developing tr eatments for people with degenerative diseases. 1. www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1094515 2.

Nature Med 2002; 8:215-6Editorials The Joffe Bill returns Still a Trojan horse for euthanasia Lord Joffe's Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill ,1which seeks to legalise Dutch- style euthanasia in the UK, has returned, after running out of time last parliamentary session. Skilfully reworked and renamed the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill ,2it passed its second reading in the House of Lords on 10 March and now goes to a Lords' Select Committee fordetailed scrutiny. The last such Select committee in 1994 firml y opposed any change in the law to allow euthanasia but the debate has si nce moved on with high profile cases of motor neurone disease adversely i nfluencing public and medical opinion. The revised Bill seeks to legalise euthanasia for 'terminally i ll' patients for whom palliative care cannot ease suffering, but the definit ions of 'terminal illness' and 'unbearable suffering' remain loosely, a mbiguously and relativistically defined. It remains a dangerous document that Christian doctors should o ppose. Christian doctors should make every effort to ensure that the c ommittee hear again the many good arguments against legalising euthanas ia, along with specific critiques of the Bill's revised wording. 1.

Christian doctors need to respond The government has launched a new consultation on 'action to im prove patients' health', which will feed into the production of a new White Paper this summer. Choosing health?1builds on government advisor Derek Wanless' new report Securing Good Health for the Whole Population2and seeks feedback from groups and individuals on ten key public he alth areas: accidents, alcohol misuse, diet, drugs, exercise, inequa lities, mental health, obesity, sexual health and smoking. Health Secretary John Reid claims that a healthier population c ould save \u00a330bn a year in NHS spending and says the government needs to ' help people to make healthy choices by providing information, encour agement and support, and by working with the right partners at the righ t levels'. He wants to 'find the right balance, rejecting the nanny state, an d the Pontius Pilate state, which washes its hands of its citizens' health'.3 Much of the consultation document is good common sense with the expected exception of condoms being advocated as the key soluti on to unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. This is a great opportunity for Christian doctors to get involv ed in an important public debate, and to advocate biblical and evidence- based solutions, rather than leaving a secular humanist agenda to imp ose itself by default. If merely a handful of Christian doctors submitted a f ew well worked paragraphs to answer questions in just one of the ten ar eas of concern it could make a huge difference.

Available free on request from Department of Health Publicati ons, PO Box Saunders is CMF General SecretaryI nstructions are useful, but examples are more effective. T oday's healthcare workers very much need good rolemodels. Oh, for another Florence Nightingale, a ThomasBarnardo or a Mother T eresa. Well, where did their inspiration come from? None other than Jesus Christ. I suggest there can be no greater role model for us today. Jesus is a uniquely appropriate model for healthcare workers because his ministry brought him into contact with a wide spect rum of needy and diseased people. Jesus also had a teaching and tra ining ministry. He had students and we can learn important lessons fr om how he taught them. Moreover, Jesus is totally original. The Go spels give us a glimpse into his private life. So we can see what mad e him tick and what kept him going. Considering Jesus lived 2000 years ago, on the face of it a lot of people might struggle to discern any relevance to current probl ems in the NHS. But although enormous changes have taken place in thepractice of medicine over the centuries, and particularly in th e last decades, none of these has displaced the centrality of the medi cal consultation as a one to one relationship between a person in n eed and someone with power to help. Of course healthcare workers do not have the exact same calling as Jesus, the Saviour and Redeemer. Even so, we are part of a team that is in the business of making people whole and this inevitably i nvolves the spiritual dimension. Rightly understood, our healthcare dut ies can be regarded as a vocation to heal. Nor do we have the same nature as Jesus. He was divine, and had an insight and authority and power to which we cannot aspire. B ut even if we view him merely in human terms we would see in him t he very best to which we can aspire. Jesus was uniquely gifted. He was never at a loss for the appropriate word or illustration. Nevertheless, as a man, he wa s severely and repeatedly tempted to take easy alternatives to hi s Father's will. We see that in Jesus' relationship with the reli gious elite of his day. He could be uncomfortable, challenging the establis hed consensus and the accepted ways of doing things. At times he wo uld have been a challenging colleague. But he never fell. Although we are all too fallible, we have Jesus' promise of his Spirit if we as k for this gift. 1So I believe Jesus is a role model for everyone, whatever his o r her calling, a role model who the apostles Peter and Paul exhor t Christians to emulate.2,3 I suggest, however, that Jesus is especially relevant to health care workers, even though it is important to recognise that it is no t possible to follow Jesus effectively without first submitting to his aut hority. He must first be our Saviour and Master before he can be our patte rn. Then, when we do follow him, it is not a matter of slavish obed ience to a set of rules or an attempt to earn merit, but the impulse of love. 'I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the w illof him who sent me.'4Everyone's life is dominated, consciously or unconsciously, by some supreme desire, which determines all his or her actions. For a healthcare worker, it may be promotion or re spect or reward: good pay without too much hard work or the satisfaction of a job well done. Jesus' supreme desire was to please his Father.5,6,7 Nothing deflected him from this course. So the night before hiscrucifixion, Jesus' prayer to his Father, in agony of spirit, w as 'My Father, if it is possible may this cup be taken from me. Yet no t as I will but as you will.' 8 This supreme aim determined all Jesus' attitudes and actions. I t was because he wanted to do his Father's will that he waited be hind in the temple, at the age of twelve, to hear what the rabbis we re teaching, while his parents set off for home. When they finally found him, he answered their reproach with, 'Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?'9It was because he wanted to do his Father's will that he waited to the age of 30 to start his public work; allowing only three years for a ministry that was to change the world. I t was because of his determination to do his Father's will that he ne ver married, in spite of the fact that he regarded marriage as the norm and lived in a society that shared this outlook. He chose, instead, to surround himself with a community that had close, affectionate - yet chaste - relationships with men, women and children. It was for the same reason that he spent hours in prayer and meditation on God's Word. He made a habit of attending thesynagogue services. It was in obedience to his Father's will th at he was judicious in his use of time and didn't do everything he mi ght have done. He made the training of his twelve select disciples his priority. It was to fulfil his Father's will that he followed the Old T es tament moral law and legal requirements, such as commanding patients c ured of leprosy to report to the priest for confirmation. And yet th e uncomfortable Jesus had a strong sense of which laws were centr al and which were merely human traditions. His willingness to heal on the Sabbath is a powerful example. So, then, what is our overall aim? As followers of Jesus, can w e justify all our actions on the basis of our supreme allegiance to him. For Jesus, obedience to his Father's will involved sacrifice - the supreme sacrifice. And he made it clear that each of his follow ers, likewise, must be prepared to 'take up his cross'. 10 David Short is Emeritus Professor of Medicine in Aberdeen 4 TRIPLE HELIX IISPRING 04spirituality Dave Short on following Jesus in the workplace IMITATING CHRIST IN HEALTHCARE 1.

One of themost pressing needs was for goodChristian medical literature. John was not a writer, or an editor, but he made the writings o f Christian doctors accessible at a time when needs were immense,doors of opportunity were wide open, and the internet and theassociated spread of the English language were making the worlda global village. He made an enormous contribution in helpingCMF embrace and make the best use of new systems andtechnology and managed the production and distribution ofjournals and newsletters, booklets and books, brochures and CDs , tapes and webpages. I expect that John will get quite a pleasant surprise when the Lord shows him the fruit of his labour: reaching literally thou sands of Christian doctors and medical students, not just in the UK b ut in over 50 countries around the world, secondary school student s in 3,000 British schools, and over a million visitors to the CM F website. People whom he never met, and who probably had neverheard his name, but who have benefited from what he did. Rather like Jeremiah's scribe Baruch, John didn't seek great things for himself, but sought rather to make others great. Notleast among these were members of CMF's student journalcommittee. Many remember his patience, practical help andattention to detail when often hard pressed by his own deadline s and his generosity in helping some of them to become the greatChristian medical writers of the future. All of us in the office have special memories. For me what will live is seeing him just a week before he died when he popped injust to be sure that everything was OK. He was pale and short o f breath and obviously unwell, and yet cheerful and enthusiastic.What I will treasure most is the way he spoke about his childre n Matthew, Beki and Peter of whom he was so immensely proud. One of John's last projects was a book on Christian healing. Fo r reasons that will probably remain a mystery to us, God chose no t to heal John in this life. But now John is in the presence of t he risen Lord and Saviour he loved and sought to serve and hishealing is complete. It's perhaps a poignant reminder that Jesu s did not come ultimately to empty the hospitals but to empty thegraveyards. Peter Saunders is General Secretary of Christian Medical Fellow shipJohn Reader An American friend was walking up the graveldrive of John and Thea'shome when he noticed a blade of grass poking through, andteasingly remarked, 'however did youallow that to grow in the wrong place?'No- one who has seen John'simmaculate gardens, his highlyorganised garage or him working on thehouse in his spick and span boiler suitcould have the slightest doubt that anypractice or organisation would be runwith the utmost efficiency and care. Unlike so many people, John combined attention to detail with a broad vision and international perspective. He never failed to see the wood for the trees. He combined high personal standards withsympathetic partnership and teamwork, efficiency with compassio n and an infectious sense of humour. John qualified from Liverpool University Medical School in 1957 and was among the last but one group to be called up for national s ervice. Returning to civilian life he worked in general medicine and cl inical pathology but realised that he wanted to look after the whole p atient rather than become highly specialised. So he entered general pr actice. John started in a two-person partnership in Marple in 1965 and stayed there for 29 years. The practice grew from two to five partners . He knew and was loved by the whole community and one of his formerpatients remarked 'I always had the utmost respect for Dr Reade r' and that could be echoed a thousand times. He joined CMF as a second-year student and was on the executive committee as a junior doctor. Later he became chairman. He show ed his organisational skills early on, starting conferences in nor thwest England and later national conferences. He was already explorin g wider horizons as the International Christian Medical and Dental Asso ciation (ICMDA) was developing. In 1992, two years before he retired from practice, John and Th ea became joint general secretaries of ICMDA. The work grew. Thebedroom in their Cambridge home was soon too small, so an offic e was found. When they took over there were 26 member countries andcontacts in eight others. Eight years later there were 44 and l inks with 36 more. John visited 23 different countries, many of them with Thea. The last World Conference John and Thea attended was in Durban, South Africa. There were 800 delegates from 57 countries. It wa s a moving experience to hear singing to African rhythms in a packe d conference hall. John was already looking forward to a far bigg er international conference, with 'a great multitude that no one c an count', not 57 nationalities but people 'from every tribe, people and l anguage', singing before Christ's throne.

It can be describedmost simply as the insertion of needlesinto the skin at specific points in order to treat disease or promote good health. Used in many NHS practices, particularly pain clinics, acupuncture is acquiring increasingrespectability. A UK regulatory body is beingconsidered. The British Acupuncture Council(BAcC) exists for the non-medically qualified andthe British Medical Acupuncture Society (BMAS)for doctors. 1T raining courses vary from a few weekends up to two years. Chinese training lasts sixto ten years. Related techniques include acupressure, auricular acupuncture, electroacupuncture, reflexology andshiatzu. Origins Archaeological evidence suggests that acupuncture was practised in the Stone and BronzeAges. Used in China for over 3,500 years, the firsttextbook was the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (Huang Di Nei Jing Su Wen) around 500 BC, followed by The Classic of Acupuncture (259 AD). 2 Persisting as part of traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, it was challenged by western medicineduring the early twentieth century but reaffirmed bythe communists in the 1950's. It was introduced intoEurope in 1683 by Willen T en Rhijne, a Dutchphysician. 3It was first mentioned in the Lancet in 1823 as a treatment for rheumatism.4It has been at the forefront of the recent surge of interest in CAM(Complementary and Alternative Medicine). Principles and practice The philosophy and principles of Chinese acupuncture are based on T aoism, incorporating itsconcept of life force or ch'i (qi) that pervades allthings, animates all life and flows freely through the body in normal health. It has two components, yin(negative force) and yang (positive force). The ch'icirculates around the whole body but particularlythrough twelve main channels, termed meridians. When ch'i is in balance, the body is healthy; if it is blocked or out of balance, ill health results.Needling specific points connecting to meridiansrestores energy balance. Around 365 regular pointsare described. Intervention is usually by dry-needling the skin with solid needles (0.12 - 0.3 mm gauge) to depthsof one to two millimetres (shallow needling) or fiveto 60 millimetres (deep needling). The needles maybe manipulated and then withdrawn or left in situfor 30 minutes or more, sometimes accompanied byelectrical stimulation or moxibustion, the burning ofpowdered mugwort plant around the needles.Presently, self-acupuncture is uncommon. Herbalremedies may also be advised. As foods are believedto be yin or yang in effect, dietary advice may begiven. In auricular acupuncture, specific points relating to the whole body are said to be represented on theear but these cannot relate to the normal meridianpositions. Diagnosis in traditional Chinese acupuncture assesses the state of ch'i in the body and specificorgans. This involves detailed inspection of thetongue and pulse, identifying up to 28 qualities (suchas 'empty' and 'floating') in six pulses in each wrist. 5 Medical checklist Does it have a rational scientific basis? There is no supporting scientific evidence for the existence of ch'i, life force or meridians.6They cannot be identified with anatomical, nervous or 6 TRIPLE HELIX IISPRING 04feature AcupunctureGeorge Smith probes this popular ancient therapy KEY POINTS Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese therapy with philosophyand principles based inTaoism.

Westerndoctors who useacupuncture attribute to counterirritation, endogenousopiate ofmyofascial points.But although it has beenextensively investigated,evidence for its specificefficacy is limited andsafety Photo vascular channels. Attempts to localise acupuncture points by histological examination have failed andelectro-physical investigations have beeninconclusive. Western medical acupuncture Attempting to distance itself from T aoist roots, a western version has evolved based on three theories: 1. The gate control of pain theory suggests that insertion of needles can modify the sensation ofpain by closing a 'pain gate' in the nervoussystem. 7This stops pain sensations passing up the nervous system whilst the 'gate is closed' inresponse to the needling. This is traditionalcounter-irritation, as when using kaolinpoultices. 2. The opioids theory suggests that endogenous analgesics (such as endorphins) are responsiblefor acupuncture's efficacy. 8 3. Myofascial trigger points . It was believed that these were points of fibrositis or other painfulsoft tissue or rheumatic conditions. However,their existence and significance is in doubt.Their possible correlation with acupuncturepoints is being researched but no definiteevidence has emerged. 9 Whilst there may be scientific validity in these theories, much more research is needed. Significantevidence would emphasise the gap between therituals of traditional Chinese acupuncture andwestern therapy. Does it work? Acupuncture is probably the most researched of all alternative therapies. It is therefore surprisingthat there is little convincing evidence for itsefficacy. Acupuncture research is complex,particularly regarding the provision of a credibleplacebo in randomised controlled trials. 'Shamacupuncture' employs a Steitberger needle or ParkSham Device: the point is withdrawn into a hollowneedle without skin puncturing. 10 An in-depth investigation indicated possible benefit in dental pain, low back pain, nausea andvomiting but there was inconclusive or completelynegative evidence in a wide range of otherconditions reviewed. 11,12These findings were confirmed by a ten-year assessment of systematicreviews, meta-analyses and random controlled trialsin the Department of CAM at Exeter University.'Close to 100% of pain sufferers benefited from\"sham acupuncture\".' 13Rather than showing specific efficacy for real acupuncture, many of theresults indicated that both real and shamacupunctures were good placebos. '...minimalacupuncture is easily incorporated into primary careconsultations but there is no convincing evidencefor its effectiveness'. 14Is it safe? It is a popular myth that acupuncture is safe. At least 50 fatalities have been recorded from lung,cardiac and nervous complications. 15 Acupuncture hazards IIncorrect or delayed diagnosis ILocal reactions: pain, bruising, infection, andhaematoma IMoxibustion burns IT rauma: pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade,spinal cord illness: hepatitis, endocarditis,septicaemia, osteomyelitis, auricularperichondritis and HIV IFainting and post treatment drowsiness The incidence of adverse effects is around one in 10,000-100,000. A Norwegian survey reported that30% of acupuncturists and 12% of doctors notedadverse effects. 16A recent paper reported five adverse reactions including a fatal case ofpneumothorax and cardiac tamponade. 17 Christian checklist There is no real dispute that traditional Chinese acupuncture is rooted firmly in the T aoist religion withits concepts of ch'i, yin yang and Universal Life Force.T ao means 'The Way'. The Yellow Emperor explains:'Yin Yang is the way (T ao) of heaven and earth, theprinciple of everything, the parents of all changes, theorigin of life and death, the palace of god. Healing ofdiseases requires the seeking of the origin...' 18 This is quite foreign to biblical Christian teaching and faith in a personal sovereign Creator God andheavenly Father. Western acupuncture seeks to distance itself from these beliefs and engage with the scientific. Despitethe sincerity of those who attempt this, I believe thegap is too wide and leads to confusion and compromise. Conclusion Despite considerable research, no compelling evidence has been established for acupuncture'seffectiveness and safety concerns cannot be ignored.The Christian carer's attitude to acupuncture mustreflect integrity, respect truth and reject life and faithprinciples based on a non-Christian belief system.Consequentially, this precludes the use of traditionalChinese acupuncture and careful biblicaldiscernment is required when considering the use of western acupuncture. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil. (1 Thessalonians 5:21-22 KJV) Jesus said, 'I am the way, the truth and the life'.

Personal communication between author and ChinesetranslatorReferences Photo: Anthea Sieveking / Wellcome Photo LibraryIt is more than six years since the Lancet published Dr Wakefield's paper describing anew syndrome of bowel disease and autismin MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccinated children. 1Almost none of the subsequent research has found any evidence tosupport this causal link. Yet the controversy rageson. Rather than living with the theoretical risk ofautism, many parents are facing the known risks ofmeasles, mumps and rubella, or are paying formultiple, single immunisations. At times the Government's continuing reassurance has strengthened its opponents'armoury. 2After all, Dr Wakefield is a dedicated doctor (through neither a paediatrician norepidemiologist), a father himself, whose painstakingwork suggested the unthinkable: that a routinevaccine might be partly responsible for the surge inautism diagnoses over the past two decades. Whenhe refused to end his research, his consultantposition at a London teaching hospital becameuntenable. Eventually, with his supporters claimingpersecution in Britain, he moved his research to theUnited States. Some argue that general practitioners advocating MMR are not objective as the uptake proportionsaffect their practice incomes. Yet doctors who haveseized the opportunity to set up single vaccineclinics have hardly brought honour to themselvesbut have cashed in on the fears of the lay public. Systematic reviews Meanwhile the evidence against a link between MMR and autism continues to grow. Recentsystematic reviews of over 20 previous studies havefailed to find any evidence of a link. This presentsa dilemma for the media, which tends to presentboth sides of an argument, even when one side is aminority, maverick viewpoint. 3Imbibing the media's reports, a confused public now feel thatevidence in favour of a link between MMR andautism is finely balanced. Yet the idea behindsystematic reviews is familiar to us all. Beforebuying a new car, many of us read every carmagazine we can get hold of. If most reporters giveit a glowing report, we ignore the one who gave itthe thumbs down and follow majority opinion. Sowhy do we act so differently over the immunisationof our children? Legal action Recently, the Legal Services Commission withdrew support for a class action involving thefamilies of over 1,000 autistic children who soughtcompensation from MMR's manufacturers. \u00a315million of legal aid - \u00a315,000 per child - hadalready been spent unsuccessfully attempting to 8 TRIPLE HELIX IISPRING 04media and medicine David Pitches draws lessons from the MMR/autism debate MMR AND AUTISM - muddled medical reasoning KEY POINTS R ecent systematic reviews have failed to confirm the linkbetween the MMR vaccineand autism claimed inAndrew Wakefield'soriginal by exposure of possiblevested financial interests,many people remainunconvinced that thevaccine is safe andvaccination remaindangerously low. The caseraises serious issues abouthow scientific informationshould be handled bygovernment, the courtsand the media. Christiandoctors should also taketo heart lessons aboutresponsible research andreporting, being honestabout conflicts of interestand working hard to winthe trust of our patients.Year Percentage of MMR vaccinated two rate of 95% is needed to confer herd immunity. In 2000, a Dublin measlesoutbreak of 355 cases resulted in three deaths. TheMMR uptake rate in the affected area was only70%. 16Experts predict similar outbreaks here.17 South East London had the lowest uptake in2002-2003: only 66% of two year olds wereimmunised. The risks for measles encephalitis and death are around one in 1,000. 18Photo: PAmedia and medicine demonstrate a link between MMR and autism. This compares starkly with \u00a33.5 million committed bythe Government in 2002 to the Medical ResearchCouncil's autism research programme. In pursuit ofcompensation, a number of these autistic childrenunderwent colonoscopy and lumbar puncture. As noBritish hospital would perform them, seven childrenwere flown to the United States for these tests. Theresults were unvalidated and uninterpretable. 4 Conflict of interest Recently it emerged that some of the children in Dr Wakefield's study had been referred and fundedthrough legal aid, despite no acknowledgement of thisin his 1998 paper. Subsequently, Dr Richard Horton,editor of the Lancet , announced he would not have published the paper if he had known of this conflict ofinterest. 5Since then, ten of Dr Wakefield's co-authors have issued a joint public statement, retracting theinterpretation placed upon their findings. 6 Disturbing questions This debacle raises many disturbing questions about the nature of scientific research and theconveyance of its findings. It highlights theimportance of high research standards. It wasentirely reasonable to raise concerns about MMR'ssafety if research suggested harmful effects.However, prior discussion with other experts wouldhave ensured that appropriate methodologies werefollowed. Editors of prestigious medical journalscarry much responsibility. Had the original paperbeen published in an obscure paediatrics journal,subsequent medical history might have beenentirely different. Vaccine opponents often take theline we should avoid MMR until scientists canprove beyond doubt that it does not, under anycircumstances, cause autism. Yet science cannotprove a negative. Are courts ever an appropriate place to prove or disprove medical beliefs? Indeed, had the MMR caseproceeded to court, it would have made a disturbingprecedent for future groups seeking legal aid to fundresearch for speculative claims. Is funding from anyother source less controversial? After all, MMR'smanufacturers and the Government sponsoredMedical Research Council funded several of thestudies that failed to find a link between autism and MMR. Opponents of the vaccine criticised thesestudies for potential conflict of interest whilst failingto admit their own. In the present climate, could anystudy be funded and conducted without attractingcriticism from the 'other side'? Learning points What can Christians learn from this unhappy saga? Firstly, we should not be afraid to pursueresearch but must do so in a responsible manner.We must recognise the limits of our abilities and notbe afraid to seek advice from others. 7Secondly, we should be aware of any conflict of interest,particularly financial. 8Thirdly, we must elicit the trust of our patients and the wider public. Patientswho supported Dr Wakefield commented that theytrusted his team because they were really listenedto. 9Sadly, previous doctors had failed to inspire such confidence! Finally, it brings us back to theprofound question that Pontius Pilate asked Jesus.What is truth? 10Is it a commodity that can be bought with enough research resources or eloquentlegal arguments? How do we convey truth when webelieve we have it? Christianity is an evidence-based faith. Events narrated in the Bible were diligently recorded topreserve what eyewitnesses saw as the truth. 11Yet knowing the truth is not sufficient preparation forsharing it. Experts who are called upon to defendMMR's safety believe passionately in it. Yet, simply'knowing the truth of MMR' and conveying this tothe media has not been enough to persuade thepublic. Rather than merely confronting patientswith hard medical facts, it is important to listen totheir fears, build up trust and lead by example. 'Yes,I thought about it too but chose to protect mychildren with MMR.' Similarly, whilst we can beconfident about the truth of the Bible, simplypassing on these truths to sceptics is akin to tossingpearls before swine. 12We should always be prepared to give an answer to those who ask us butin gentleness and with respect. 13 David Pitches is a Specialist Registrar and HonoraryClinical Lecturer in Public Health at the University ofBirmingham SPRING 04 IITRIPLE HELIX 91.

For fouryears she had been a social outcast, rejected by her husband and village because of the 'shame'of her condition. Further enquiry uncovered a history offemale genital mutilation in childhood which causedvaginal stenosis. She had subsequently married andbecome pregnant but during the second stage of labourprogress was arrested and the baby died in the birthcanal. The infant had to be removed surgically and theyoung woman was left with a fistula which leaked urinecontinuously. The subsequent repair of the fistula changedthis woman's life and enabled her to make a new start(picture left). The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 , which took effect at the beginning of this year in Englandand Wales, makes it illegal to take girls abroad forfemale genital mutilation (FGM). It also increasesthe maximum penalty for committing or aiding theoffence to 14 years in prison. FGM includes various procedures in which the healthy female genitalia are removed or mutilatedcausing serious complications. The 1985 Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act made the practice illegal in the UK but left many girls at risk of being takenoverseas for the ritual - whether as a young baby orat any time up until marriage. FGM is practised in 28 African countries, parts of South East Asia and the Middle East. In the UK,communities originating from such countries(mainly Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen) maycontinue the practice. 1About 7,000 girls under the age of 17 are thought to be at risk in the UK, and atleast 74,000 women have been subjected to theprocedure. 2Worldwide between 100 and 140 million females are thought to have been affected. FGM is regarded as a traditional cultural practice by those who support it, seen by some as acleansing process, protecting virginity and familyhonour. It is not, as sometimes stated, a religiousrequirement. It is sometimes intended to providemore sexual pleasure for the husband and increasedfertility. Women may support it as an aspect of theircommunity identity. The view from the West is of an abusive event, commonly excising all or part of the clitoris and/orlabia, and sometimes stitching together the labiamajora. (In some communities the latter may bereversed after the marriage ceremony and it may beredone after childbirth). Pain, haemorrhage, infection and sometimes death may result in theshort term. In future years problems ofmenstruation, urinary and pelvic infections,psychological symptoms, sexual difficulties,infertility and difficult childbirth may ensue. Therisk of dying in childbirth is doubled, the risk ofstillbirth is increased three or four times. 3 Clearly FGM is no 'female equivalent' of male circumcision. It has no foundation in religiouswritings or as a covenant sign. It is more a sign ofmale domination over a woman's life. In the book of Genesis, God creates Eve from Adam's side, to be at his side and to be united withhim throughout life. 4However, as a consequence of the Fall husbands began to rule over their wives andthe complementary relationship that God originallyintended for marriage was lost. 5The new covenant that Jesus gave to the world brings a new freedom forall who believe in him. 6There is no place in God's kingdom for abuse and oppression, nor for the idea,bound up with FGM, that sexual pleasure is only formen. Song of Songs reminds us that both the lover and the beloved take pleasure in physical love. The Songsays of the beloved that her own body is hers to give. 7 Therefore no one has the right to abuse it. Paul reminds husbands to 'love their wives as their own bodies'. He goes on, 'He who loves hiswife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated hisown body, but he feeds and cares for it'. 8Such care is grossly distorted when FGM is perpetuated byadults who have failed to see the harm it does andwho have promoted it within the family they love. Attitudes are changing thanks to education about the consequences of FGM. Several Africancountries have banned the practice and others arepursuing educational programmes. In the UK, girlsaged seven to nine are most likely to be mutilatedand doctors should be vigilant. Insensitive handlingof child protection procedures may result in thechild being taken abroad. The new legislationmakes this less likely and is to be welcomed butthere is no room for complacency. There is a needfor continuing education of healthcare professionalsand involved communities, both in terms ofdiscontinuation of the practice and giving help tothose already mutilated.

Song of Songs 8:128. 1999.Female genital mutilationPhoto: PApaediatrics In the field of child protection, the pendulum of public, and perhaps more importantly, media opinion seems to be swayinguncontrollably, and consequently quite dangerously, at themoment. A year ago, Lord Laming published his inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbie. 1Lord Laming highlighted the seriousness of the extreme end of child abuse and emphasised that child abuse should be treated with the same rigour as any other potentially life-t hreatening disease. Professionals were blamed for not listening to the chi ld, for missing signs of abuse and for poor communication. Perhaps abov e all, many professionals at all levels were blamed for not acceptingresponsibility for their role in the child protection process. Now, less than a year later, we have seen prominent paediatrici ans brought before the GMC because of concerns about their actions in diagnosing child abuse, the overturning of three cases where mo thers were convicted of having murdered their babies, and a review of a huge number of cases, both criminal and civil, where expert evidence has influenced the legal process in suspected child abuse. 2,3,4So what are we to make of these swings in opinion? What are the likely impacts on children, families and professionals? And can we find ways of w orking that avoid some of the difficulties that have been highlighted? Professionals working in the child protection field have always been vulnerable and open to criticism. That has been seen before in situations such as the Cleveland Inquiry, and in the numerous public inqui ries into the deaths of children from abuse. My perception is that thisvulnerability is, at least amongst paediatricians, but probably also on a much wider basis, even more marked now than ever before. There is a general perception that 'you are damned if you do and damned if you don't'. One direct consequence of this is that we are already s eeing reluctance amongst many professionals to get involved in this a rea. 5The potential knock on effect of this is that with fewer profession als entering the field, or being prepared to take on child protection work a s part of their remit, child abuse could be missed, or inadequately asses sed, and children could be put at greater risk. There is also a specific issue in relation to expert evidence. Few of these cases are clear-cut, and there is always the need for professional opinions, based on the best av ailable evidence. Where that evidence is limited, as it too often is in this field, the courts will necessarily have to rely on conjecture and indi vidual expert opinions. Again, fewer professionals are now prepared to stick their necks out and offer their opinions for fear of being pill oried one way or another. Again the consequences are likely to be detrime ntal to children, with more prolonged or inconclusive legal proceedings . The problem here seems to lie more with the systems we have for dealing with these complex cases than with the individuals who are currently being blamed. That, I believe gives hope for signific ant change. A lot is happening in the wake of Lord Laming's inquiry and the publication of the green paper Every Child Matters6and the recent Children Bill ,7with improved systems for multi-agency working, information sharing, training and audit. But there is still a l ot to be done, both in national debates and policy, and in localimplementation. As Christians we need to be engaged at all leve ls, influencing debates and developments. For those of us who are working with children and families, I b elievethe biblical advice in Micah 6:8 provides perhaps the best prin ciples for our personal and professional approach to the field. Micah sugg ests that the Lord requires three things of us: To act justly . We must work for justice, seeking to promote the truth, and to speak out on behalf of the vulnerable. Primarily we need to keep the welfare of children paramount, even more so for those who a re particularly vulnerable: the disabled, those from ethnic minori ties, asylum seekers, those living in poverty. But we also need to re member that many parents too are vulnerable. We need to seek integrity in our legal systems and in the procedures we use to protect and safeg uard children. If a parent is wrongly convicted of murdering their c hild, that is one of the gravest miscarriages of justice that can occur and a double tragedy for the family concerned. However, if a child dies beca use of professional or societal failures to protect that child, that i s even more of a tragedy. T o minimise the risks of either tragedy occurring, w e need a clear framework and approaches that recognise the paramountimportance of the welfare of the child, whilst also recognising the needs of families. There is a need for a wider debate on whether crim inal conviction is necessarily the best response to suspected infant icide 8,9 To lov e m e rc y . Compassion needs to be the bedrock of all our work: compassion for children, for families and even for abusing pare nts. They too may be victims.10It is not always easy to balance justice and compassion, but I believe it can be done. When confronted withinadequate or harmful parenting, we should not be afraid to rem ove children if that will be in their best interests, but perhaps w e should more often be asking 'what is needed to enable these parents to look after this child?' rather than 'can these parents look after th is child?' T o walk humbly with our God . Our personal and professional lives need to be marked by humility and righteousness. We all make mi stakes and need to be prepared to admit it. We need to recognise ourlimitations, but within that to do our best to act with integri ty. Above all, we mustn't be afraid to engage in these difficult areas, trusti ng in a God who walks with us as encourager, friend and guide.

Sidebotham P Autumn: 8-10References Photo: PAMost health professionals know all about tiredness. Long hours andthe demands of the job leave all ofus exhausted. Here I want to address the issue of spiritual tiredness. Spiritualtiredness is a form of exhaustion in our soul, in ourinnermost being. Spiritual tiredness is not helpedby working long hours but its source is not the longhours. Spiritual tiredness comes when we give upbelieving that Christ was speaking the truth whenhe said, 'What good will it be for a man if he gainsthe whole world, yet forfeits his soul?' 2 It's my observation that in medicine it is particularly difficult to avoid this form of tiredness.Part of the reason is due to the place that medicinehas in our national psyche. As Britain has becomemore and more post-Christian, people naturallytend to cast around for a new source of hope. Oneof the resources that people often look to is thedoctor. The hope for a medical cure in manypeople's minds is the nearest they get to salvation.Hospitals become temples and doctors the priestsof this new religion. In his book How to be Good , Nick Hornby portrays a GP called Katie Carr whohas been caught up in this idolatry of medicine. Shebelieves her mere status as a doctor makes hergood. 'Listen.' She says, 'I'm not a bad person. I'm a doctor. One of the reasons I wanted to become a doctor was that I thought it wouldbe a good - as in Good, rather than exciting or well paidor glamorous - thing to do. I liked how it sounded. \"I want to be a doctor.\" \"I'm training to be a doctor.\" \"I'ma GP in a small North London practice.\" I thought itmade me seem just right, professional, kind of brainy, nottoo flashy, respectable, mature, caring...anyway. I'm agood person, a doctor.' It's easy to fall in love with the status that we automatically acquire in the medical profession - tobe intoxicated with the idea that the skills that wehave are the answer to people's problems, becausepeople treat us in that way every day of our lives.But there is a cynicism that follows hard on theheels of such idolatry. When we place an unreasonable expectation on anything we are never far from experiencing crushingdisappointment and cynicism. In his book The End of Christendom , Malcolm Muggeridge described this as engaging in 'idiot idiot despair': 'On the one hand' [he said] 'some new policy or discovery is confidently expected to put everything torights: a new fuel, a new drug... world government. Onthe other some new disaster is confidently expected toprove our undoing. Capitalism will break down. Fuelwill run out. Plutonium will lay us low. Atomic wastewill kill us off.....' This wild fluctuation is exactly what we see in the book of Ecclesiastes, a meditation on life, as theauthor puts it 'under the sun'. That is life without 12 TRIPLE HELIX IISPRING 04bible study KEY POINTS S piritual tiredness results from trying to find satisfaction in things that do notultimately satisfy; like alcohol,sex, retail therapy or evenmedicine itself. All such idolatryleads eventually to cynicism,despair and a weariness of thespirit. The writer of Ecclesiasteshad learnt from bitter experienceabout the deficiencies of such amisguided lifestyle, but despitebeing realistic about the chaos ofeveryday existence, found hope intaking an eternal perspective. Weneed to cultivate 'the marks offaith' - being generous to othersdespite the pressures we feelourselves, and being bold in whatwe undertake for God, notwasting our opportunities asthough following Christ made nodifference.Peter Comont finds advice for doctors from The Teacher of Ecclesiastes1 spiritual tirednessLiving with bible study God - or at least life without God as an active loving dynamic agent in our world. In the first couple of chapters the author, who calls himself 'The T eacher', recalls that he activelyexplored potential sources of satisfaction 'under thesun'. He indulged in laughter, alcohol, sex, retailtherapy - it didn't satisfy. So he pursued wisdom butthat actually only helped him see the futility of lifemore acutely. Like the man who said to Dr Johnson: 'You are a philosopher Dr Johnson. I have tried too in my time to be a philosopher, but I don't know how,cheerfulness is always breaking in.' Most especially he realised that death strikes a fatal blow to all our idolatrous hopes. We know inmedicine that is shoved under our noses. Everyperson's medical history is terminated by what theAmerican's sometimes rather coyly call 'a negativepatient outcome' - death. Living in that world; aworld where everyone is only looking at life 'underthe sun', draws us inexorably towards cynicism anda profound weariness of the spirit. Then asEcclesiastes unfolds, however, it starts to becomeclear that The T eacher cannot sustain his radicalscepticism. Faith cannot help breaking through. The Teacher's faith For me that is epitomised in Ecclesiastes 11:1. Here The T eacher still affirms that the world is achaotic confusing place. T rying to do anything ofvalue in the real world is like scatteringbreadcrumbs in a river. You just set them loose andoff they float we know not where. Was it worthshowing real love to that patient who simply tookthe prescription and was gone? Would it have beenless costly if we had just been distantlyprofessional? Have I ever seen fruit from prayingfor my patients? Or is it all chaff in the wind? T rue. It is chaff in the wind, bread on the water - all floating away we know not where. But thereare results. We just need a longer perspective. TheT eacher says we will see fruits 'after many days'.We may even have the privilege of seeing resultsin our lifetime, but there is no guarantee. Jesus wasabsolutely clear that the main reward is onjudgment day: 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since thecreation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave mesomething to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me somethingto drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in.' 3 Just occasionally we get encouragements to help us keep going. I know a couple who worked in the1970s in a hospital in a Muslim country. Recently thewife by accident met a young man who had recentlybecome a Christian. He told her that he had beenseriously ill as a baby and his mother had taken himto the very hospital where that couple had beenworking. Always afterwards this boy's mother hadtaught him to respect Christians because she said 'it was Christians who saved your life'. As a young adult he began to search spiritually and eventually was converted. 'Cast your breadupon the waters for after many days you will find itagain.' 4 Cultivating marks of faith We need to cultivate the marks of faith mentioned in verses 2-6. The first is generosity orliberality. Knowing that life is unpredictableshouldn't paralyse us. None of us know which ofour patients will respond to our Christian love andconcern, or which prayers God will answer with ayes. So we need to be confident to give and letGod sort out what he will do with the gift. This is one reason why I'm not a great fan of a totally focused life. It's common for Christiandoctors to feel that the medical profession is sodemanding with so many opportunities that theirwhole ministry must be focused on that world. Itseems to me that an undue focus on one area ofministry can in fact lead to a thoughtlessness andeven heartlessness about other areas ofopportunity. The T eacher says you don't know what ministry will bear fruit so spread it around. It may beteaching Sunday school which is the realcentrepiece of your crown, or involvement in thatsmall group Bible study, or your befriending of thatmarginalised person. Jesus got the balance right.He had focus, 'set his face towards Jerusalem' andyet on the way he would turn aside to help people,sometimes to the complete exasperation of hismore calculating disciples. Give portions to seven yes to eight5 The second characteristic of Ecclesiastes-like faith is boldness. The T eacher is telling us herethat once things have happened they havehappened. You see a rain cloud which is ready toshed its load - it will rain. You see a tree fall in acertain direction that is where it will lie. Lifedoesn't offer reruns. It may be that you know that there are aspects of your life which require attention. Perhaps it ischurch involvement, a call to a different ministry,to get your prayer life in order, or to be morepublic about your faith at work. You have found Christ - don't waste your life as if it made no difference. A few years ago OsGuinness wrote a book which I would thoroughlyrecommend. It is entitled The Call . The subtitle sums up Christ's call on our lives: Everything we are.Everything we have.Everything we do.Don't grow weary. Don't grow cynical. Follow Christ - it is worth it.

Matthew 16:26; see also Mark 8:28 and 11:2-6ReferencesSpiritual tiredness...exhaustionin our soul,in ourinnermostbeing. Recently I undertook a round trip of several hundred miles to renew various neglected but inspiringfriendships. I found a friend's motto 'relax in-todisaster' an enormous source of illumination as I travelled and talked. My friend had had to give up nursing after an adverse reaction to a yellow fever vaccination. The discovery of chronicautoimmune disease prevented her intended departure formissionary service. Recently she had developed breast cancer wi th back pain suggestive of secondaries, but her GP had never befor e encountered relieved laughter when scans revealed 'only' aslipped disc. Despite all these and other worries, she stillundertakes short-term missions and, nearer home, is a cheerfulencourager of other cancer sufferers. My first stopover on the trip coincided with a home Bible study group where I sat beside a young woman whose apparentlyhealthy and beloved stepson had died suddenly during a sportsactivity. Her husband and their other son were grieving in waysthat unintentionally excluded her, but her own trust in God wasbeing greatly strengthened by the sensitivity and prayerfulfellowship of that group. Next came an old friend from university days. Widowed early in life she successfully raised two lovely Christian daughtersalongside doing a demanding professional job. Now impaired inhealth she lives in an apparent backwater to be nearer hergrandchildren. Some would find such a changed lifestylefrustrating but she exerts a quiet and consistent Christianinfluence on two young lives (and several older ones.) In contr ast, in the nearby city, I had lunch with a clergy wife whose husban d had publicly but controversially backed the authority of the Bi ble. Now at the eye of the ensuing storm he is being painfully abuse d, even by fellow Christians. T ravelling on, I stayed with two Christians, converted late in life and now eager to use their lovely home as a base for sharing th e Good News with friends and neighbours. A couple of years ago th e husband developed a malignant melanoma. It is alreadypronounced spreading and incurable, but their faith remainsunshaken. I was quietly assured, 'We are in the Lord's hands.' From that home I moved on to a middle-aged paraplegic friend, born with such severe spina bifida that she has been told (inpublic debate...) that she should not have been allowed to surv ive at birth. Although now in constant pain, she has helped toestablish and maintain a Christian foundation for disabled chil dren in India, making regular visits to see them. They cluster round her wheelchair and movingly call her Mother. The next call was on a family whose doctor father had given up a job that he found too demanding and too far away to allowadequate time for his children. Intermittent locums now allowfamily ties to grow stronger whilst he also has more time to wa it on the Lord, trusting him to clarify the next step. His serenity w as striking. A farmhouse weekend followed, with ample nourishment for body and soul to share with three generations of other goodfriends, gathered together for a holiday with Grandpa. Overdecades he had watched his much loved wife dying of Alzheimer'sdisease whilst he conscientiously met the taxing demands ofchurch oversight. On retirement he moved to an inheritedproperty, remote from his previous supporters, then becamesuddenly and dangerously ill. Unexpected but timely visitors we re probably instrumental in saving his life. Although still recove ring he lives alone in the new home, but keeps a positive outlook,grateful for the attentive love of his family and for the faith ful provision of his God. These encounters were reflected on and jotted down during a long delay whilst a mechanic dealt with a puncture found duringthe journey. I had met others on my travels but these particula r stories showed me the good that was emerging during or after ha rd times. My friends had variously experienced sudden calamity,bereavement (including retirement), personal hostility, seriousillness, chronic disability, unemployment, loneliness and, in s ome cases, blow after blow. Yet they had each found that their lovi ng Lord was holding them, so often with prayerful support from oth er believers. It is naturally hard for us to feel very relaxed when troubles come, but experience of the Lord's ways gently teaches us torespond positively rather than to react negatively; to trust wh en we cannot see. After all, the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus looked to many like an unmitigated disaster yet, in God's time and throug h his Spirit, resurrection followed, with the promise of new life and strength to all believers. God remains able to turn something that looks bad into something good, which glorifies him as we entrust it to hisunfailing love. Not only are my friends finding this for themse lves but their stories offer a telling witness and encouragement forothers -and to think that without the frustration of my punctur ed tyre I might never have found time to take it all in.

I'm surprised that the PCT has a sex change policy! I'd have a silent prayer, then ask someopen-ended questions. 'OK, tell me moreabout why you think you need a sex change?' 'What do you expect from a \"sex change\"?' 'How doyou see yourself: a man attracted to men or a woman ina man's body?' Finally, 'What are you hoping I coulddo for you today?' This would establish his agenda. As a Christian doctor, this consultation would raise several issues. Is John's depression being effectivelymanaged? What is the relationship between hisdepression and self esteem, his sexual orientation andidentity? Are there sexual health matters that needaddressing such as STI screening? How do I balancesupporting John in his struggles and promoting hishealth whilst not facilitating his sin? My security andidentity are rooted in my relationship with God (1 John 3:1). How do I sensitively communicate this? Before attending surgery, John concluded that he needed a sex change. I would affirm his decision tosee me and suggest that we address these issues atfurther consultations. I would suggest that many otherpeople struggle with their identity and sexuality; sexchange treatment may not help him. I would alsoexplain that we have physical, social, psychologicaland spiritual aspects. Wholeness lies in addressingeach of these. I would defer referring John for counselling until I had considered my PCT's policy further. In any referral,I would mention that, on conscientious grounds, I couldnot assist him having a sex change. John's genetic status,primary and secondary sexual characteristics make hissex male. Gender is the social characteristics associatedwith one's biological sex. For John to be consideredtranssexual, his gender must more closely match that ofa female. Sex change treatment would rid John of hissexual characteristics and help him live as a woman.Whilst appreciating his struggles, to participate in sexchange treatment would be deceit. God created each ofus in his image, male and female, and he doesn't makemistakes (Genesis 1:27). James Tomlinson completed the VTS in 2004 and is a GP in West Bromwich As I have been treating John's depression for some time, I would express myconcern that he is uncomfortable with hissexuality. I would hope to explore his thinking over the past few months, his motivation forthis request and his expectation of what treatmentmight involve. I would also consider his lifestyle andwhat he expects afterwards. I would ask how he viewshis body and what he wants to look like. It would beimportant to review his depression diagnosis andtreatment effectiveness. Recognising that this is a verysensitive subject, I would be willing to refer him forspecialist counselling. However, at some point, I would have to explain my position to him. If the outcome of his counselling werea recommendation for sex change, I could not takeresponsibility for this myself. It would be against myconscience. I believe God created us male and female and that no individual (even with the support of a 'specialist'panel) can choose later in life to change the God-givengender into which (s)he was born (Genesis 1:27). Thisissue has tremendous implications for society at largeand the institution of marriage in particular. I would tryto explain to John that I believe in a Creator. Myunderstanding of the doctor's duty in treating his/herpatients is to restore people to what God originallyintended. In my view, giving sex change treatment goesbeyond this remit. Much would depend on how the conversation went. I would express my willingness to see John again aboutthis and to continue his depression treatment. If, aftercounselling, John was still so uncomfortable with hisidentity and gender that he was determined to pursuetreatment for sex change, I would clarify my legalposition with the General Medical Council and myPCT . Then, if required, I would refer him on toanother GP for his treatment. This would be a momentto reiterate my concern for John's welfare and to clarifymy willingness to see him again for any other condition.

Photo: Wellcome Photo LibraryPhoto: Catherine Riley / Wellcome Photo Libraryhead to H eroin addiction is a chronic disease with associated morbidity andmortality as well as forensic, publichealth and social consequences. Methadone has been increasingly used since Dole andNyswander's original trial in 1965. 1Its half-life is far longer than that of heroin, being 24 and two hoursrespectively. It can be taken orally rather than smokedor injected like heroin. The fact that methadone itselfis addictive is certainly a negative side effect but Ibelieve that this factor is far outweighed by thepositive therapeutic effects seen every day in ourpatients. Evidence based therapeutics Methadone is a rigorously well-tested medication that is safe and efficacious for the treatment of opioid withdrawaland dependence... Heroin releases an excess of dopamine inthe body and causes users to need an opiate continuouslyoccupying the opioid receptors in the brain. Methadoneoccupies these receptors and is the stabilizing factor whichpermits heroin addicts on methadone to change theirbehaviour and cease heroin use. 2 Used carefully for maintenance or detoxification, methadone satisfies all the criteria for a good andevidence-based therapeutic intervention. Theliterature is vast but I recommend Ward et al's book onthe subject. 3 Cessation of heroin use . All other positive effects flow from ending reliance on a street drug that must beadministered every few hours and requires total lifeconcentration on obtaining the next fix. Crime reduction . Several randomised controlled trials (RCT s) support the view that methadonemaintenance treatment reduces heroin use and crime. 4 This is very evident amongst my inner-city Dublinpatients. The danger of street sale of prescribedmethadone can be minimised by careful protocols anddispensing systems such as supervised ingestion. HIV reduction . Reviews are consistently concluding that methadone maintenance treatment effectivelyreduces HIV spread and injection-related behavioursknown to transmit it. 5I watched many young patients develop HIV and die in the 1980's and early 90's; now,I feel strongly about the need for interventions toprevent this dreadful infection. Holistic health improvement . This is very evident in patients treated with methadone in properly run GPled treatment programmes. All other health uptakes areimproved: women's health; diagnosis and treatment ofhepatitis C and HIV and vaccination for hepatitis B;diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems suchas depression as well as improved child health andprimary infant immunisation uptake. These are all spin-offs of primary care methadone treatment. Although itis difficult to quantify in the literature, I can report frommy own practice that routine and opportunistic healthcare is almost non-existent in the drug injectingpopulation but very much improved for those who visitmy surgery 52 times a year for our methadoneprogramme. Spiritual benefits . These are readily apparent in many patients on methadone treatment. Those injecting orsmoking heroin are rarely in a position to contemplateanything but their immediate physical craving. Theycannot easily identify the spiritual void in their lives.There is a deep spiritual dimension to every case of addictive behaviour. In my role as a director of T een Challenge Ireland, I am aware that some addicts canbecome drug free without medication by the HolySpirit's power as they repent and believe in Jesus. 6 Conclusion I feel duty bound to offer a scientifically proven and ethically approved intervention for a chronic,potentially fatal illness that is very prevalent in thecommunity for which I work. In my opinion, I wouldhave been guilty of medical negligence if I had notgained training in methadone treatment and offeredit to appropriate patients.

Itbelongs in a grey underworld of degradation and corruption, not masquerading inthe surgery as a disease. Addiction is just one ofthe areas invaded by the medical model, which isall too eagerly accepted by addicts themselves. 'Iwill be forced to take drugs if you don't give memethadone.' In other words, 'I am the victim of adisease for which you have the cure and you areresponsible.' If we treat addiction as a diseasethen we turn a moral problem into an illness andtransform addicts into victims, barely responsiblefor their own lives. As an inner-city GP , I prescribed methadone for four years. In my experience, it almostinvariably fails to do anything for drug users.Addicts use it to buffer their habits, cutting downon heroin costs. Morphine substitutes do notreally help addicts control their habit and do notbreak the ingrained behavioural pattern ofescaping to drugs in times of stress and crisis. Morphine substitutes are used because coming off drugs, the 'detox', is seen as a horrificexperience that we cannot expect addicts toendure. Yet, coming off drugs is not the realissue, nor is it half the horror that it is imaginedto be. Many long-term addicts have 'turkeyed' ona number of occasions. Staying drug free is theproblem. How often have we seen addicts comeoff drugs and then fall back again? The cardinal aim of rehabilitation for substance users must surely be a substance free life. Ifirmly believe that we cannot fight substanceswith other substances. In the prison where Iwork, the detox regime is a complex protocolinvolving four different drugs that are issueddaily. One of these, buprenorphine, has a highstreet value and is escaping onto the prison drugmarket. The same drug is getting into the prisonfrom the surrounding area as the local GPs areprescribing it. At the clinic where thesesubstances are doled out, it is only too obviousthat becoming drug free is the last thing on therecipients' minds as they argue aggressively andnoisily about the dose regime that they agreed to only a day previously. Some try every way ofavoiding swallowing the drugs so that they can goon to sell them. I am so grateful that I am notinvolved in this professionally disreputable fiasco. The use of opiate substitutes may also disguise the poverty of rehabilitation programmes where the workers have little to offer in the shape of transformed and attractive lifestyles. It replaceswhat should be of the utmost importance in drugrehabilitation: the devoted care of peoplecommitted to rehabilitating drug users,themselves genuinely committed - with all thelikely ups and downs - to becoming drug free.The reputed horrors of 'rattling' become verymanageable or disappear altogether when highlycommitted people give withdrawing addicts aconstant ministry of prayer and care. This needsto be within the context of an ongoingprogramme of support as they attempt verydifficult personal changes. It is here thatChristians have so much to offer as we have theGospel! Harm reduction programmes are prevalent throughout medicine. In the context of drugaddiction, harm reduction is based on the addict'schoice to remain an addict and we are colludingwith him or her if we are drawn into it. done for drug addicts? 'No!'

It may well play a part in awhole person approach but themost important thing to giveeach patient is self-respect.'Love your neighbour asyourself' (Matthew 19:19). If Jesus can see the best in theworst sinner, cannot we, hisfollowers? One of my patients dealt \u00a32,000 of heroin each week inorder to feed his habit. He hadrefused to countenancewithdrawal. Suddenly hestopped using and dealing andgot a job. Much later I askedhim what had changed him. He replied, 'You did. You werethe first person in my life whotreated me with respect.' We should not prescribe methadone to our patients unless we are prepared to walk thatextra mile with them.

( Guardian 2003; 4 December) EutycHusEutycHus 18 TRIPLE HELIX IISPRING 04letters Frozen Embryos Dave Stevens , CEO of our US sister organisation CMDA, reports on an excitinginitiative. It was interesting to read about excess frozen embryos in the UK in your recent review ( Triple Helix 2004; Winter:12-13). We face a similar situation in the US with an estimated 400,000human embryos in storage, many thousands ofthem unclaimed. Working with one of ourmembers, we recently opened the 'NationalEmbryo Donation Centre'. Although we areworking with an adoption agency, we havelessened the expense of going through a lengthyadoption process to make it more economicallyfeasible for couples to adopt. There are over 100couples waiting for adoption and we can servethe UK if there are couples that are willing todonate embryos. See www.embryodonation.org Contraceptive prescribing Although he agrees in theory with Ruth Selwood's arguments for not prescribing contraceptives for unmarried patients (TripleHelix 2004; Winter:16-17), Chesterfield GP Neil Ritchie raises some practical objections. Ruth Selwood raises two main ethical considerations. First, is prescribingcontraception for unmarried couples 'harmreduction' or is it 'facilitation of sin'? Second,is the 'contraceptive' acting after fertilisationand thereby abortifacient? But the situationcan be more complex than this. Both the combined pill and the IUS can be prescribed for menstrual symptoms alone.However, people can and do change theircircumstances, and there is always the riskthat people may be tempted to have sexoutside marriage (possibly more so, due to theadditional contraceptive effect). Thereforeprescribing the pill and the IUS for theseindications alone, to the unmarried, could beviewed as making it easier for them to sin inthe future. With the IUS there is, of course,also the issue of its abortifacient effect on thethird party embryo. Where is the line drawnfor the responsibility of the prescriber? It would seem justified to offer the IUS to a married woman with a sterilised husband if shehad menorrhagia. However, if she then chose tocommit adultery (with a fertile partner), wouldthe prescriber then be held responsible (at leastpartially) both for facilitating sin and theabortifacient effect?My view is that some degree of trust seems necessary. I tend to think that perhaps we canonly act and take responsibility on theassumption of honesty from the patient and thesituation as presented to us now. These practical issues are important to address, as consistency is vital both for ourown peace of mind and also to maintain therespect of our colleagues. Retired Somerset GP Michael Elwin argues that prevention is better than cure. Issues regarding contraception and abortion continue to appear frequently in Triple Helix . The problems of sexual immorality are notnew, and we find in Scripture a number ofexamples: Lot's daughters (Genesis 19), Davidand Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11-12), Amnon andTamar (2 Samuel 13). But there is little biblicalteaching about how to cope with our verypowerful sexual feelings, nor how to deal withthe consequences of misuse. The 1967 Abortion Act was made partly to try to stop the dreadful damage illegal backstreet abortions were causing, and there aresome women alive today who would not bewere it not for legal safe abortion. This doesnot make abortion right, but the sin that leadsto abortion is not unforgivable. I wonder whatJesus would do if he were a doctor confrontedwith this problem? He condemned the hardlegalism of Pharisees; might he also condemn'hard-line' Christian doctors? Control and right use of our sexuality is difficult, perhaps impossible without Christand the Holy Spirit. Given our diversity ofviews with respect to the status of life beforebirth, and especially the early embryo, shouldwe not rather concentrate on helping youngpeople to cope with their sexuality, andencourage marriage and faithfulness, ratherthan just concentrating on abortion andcontraception? It is surely better to try andcontrol the flood at source. Christian practices Lisburn GP Lloyd Gilpin asks if business partnerships with non-Christians are biblical. I was glad to see the article 'Is a Christian GP best off in a Christian Practice?' ( Triple Helix 2004; Winter:18) I did feel however that animportant point was omitted. As Christians we should carry out our work to the best of our ability - not seeking to pleasemen but our Lord (which in turn will give best patient care). Surely then, we would not want tobe unequally yoked with non-Christian partners(2 aChristian doctor in today's moral climate isdifficult enough without having the pressure tocompromise our principles in order to make thepractice run more smoothly or profitably. The advice given to many seeking a partnership is to choose carefully because it islike a marriage - for many reasons! I understandthose who like to be kept on their toes by non-Christian partners and the opportunity it affordsfor witness, but many of these opportunitiesexist to both employed staff and patients in a'Christian partnership'. We may have no say over attached staff, but whom we choose as partners is something wehave a definite say over. A business partnershiplike general practice is more than just a job and Ifeel Scripture would have us consider carefullywho we 'yoke' ourselves with in our service forthe best of masters - our Lord Jesus Christ.

SPRING 04 IITRIPLE HELIX 19Journey to Eden Richard Porter Ambassador Publications2003 \u00a312.99 Pb 410 ppISBN 1 84030 143 0 Why is this gripping tale of Le Carre styleespionage spiced withscience fiction being reviewed in Triple Helix? The answer is that Journey to Eden is a tender story of Christian testimony and also embodies Richard Porter'sfascinating hypothesis that reawakens thecreation / evolution debate. As a novel itprovided one of my most enjoyable (can't putit down) reads. However, the moststimulating aspect is the author'sentrepreneurial concept that enlivens thediscussion over whether the first few chaptersof Genesis are a poetic portrayal of God'screation or are indeed a scientific record. The fiction is surprisingly realistic with its contemporaneous setting in occupied Iraq. Itsurrounds a brilliant young Russian-trainedIraqi scientist who develops a satellite-linked'time probe' which, like H G Wells' timemachine, has the potential to see into therecent past and so reveal atrocities ofoppressive communist regimes. The plottakes off with the involvement of a youngChristian doctor, her geologist husband andboth the Russian secret service and the CIA. Porter goes on to propose that cosmic time, unlike biological time (ie the body clock), hasbeen slowing down since the world wascreated. He cites over 100 references insupport including, for example, theastronomical red shift phenomenon. On thisbasis he finds it reasonable to propose thatthe patriarchal fathers of the Old T estamentdid live for 800 years or more when the Earthwas spinning round the Sun more quickly.Equally, as time slowed, it became possiblefor man to run a 4-minute mile. Records willcontinue to fall. He says that even carbondating is susceptible to cosmic time, and askswhat basis we have for accepting that time isabsolute. From this, he surmises that theworld could well be only a few thousandyears old. Professor Porter's considerable lateral thinking ability (known to those who haveshared in his clinical research inorthopaedics) combined with his spiritualdepth comes to the fore in this dynamic book. It is more than a scientific allegory; it isa rare combination of scientific thesis andgood novel writing. However, like all goodtheses, it provides more questions thananswers and so we still have to accept that'now we see but a poor reflection as in amirror' (1 Corinthians 13:12).

As with infants, Level 1 offers pleasure through immediate satisfaction. Level 2 isself-centred and competitive, like youngchildren whose inexperience makes themjudge by appearances. They squabble overdesirable toys, showing how autonomies canconflict when perceived rights excluderesponsibilities. Debates about beneficenceand non-maleficence conducted at Level 2 areskewed by viewing pain as intolerable, hencepromotion of abortion and euthanasia, with noserious regard for alternative but costlieroptions. Like many in early adolescence,those at Level 3 have ideals beyond self,applying principles (truth, goodness, justiceand beauty) which benefit others. Based onsupposed 'love', though, the outworking isoften materialistic (eg care orders notparentcraft, handouts not hands on). Level 4brings an eternal perspective to these sameprinciples with God's love inspiring andundergirding their application, thus involvingpersonal self-giving. It is this common nature, capable ofeventual maturity, which the writers see as defining a person. For 'the tyranny of themajority' that seeks to exclude some as non-persons indicates a culture dominated byminds at Levels 1/2. This affects views (andlaws) on personal rights, justice, ethics and thecommon good. Conceptual growth spurtsoften follow painful crises. Yet 'suffering well'opens up possibilities of developing Level 3/4humility, empathy, justice and, sometimes,prayer. Competitiveness becomes creativecooperation, whilst the goal of freedom frompain yields to that of freedom for other-centred love. This brings lasting, notephemeral, comfort and happiness both tocarers and cared for. Those at Levels 3/4 are urged to teach their perceptions about personhood to the moreimmature. Theoretically, this should be eye-opening, stimulating other-love and therebybringing about communal and culturalhealing. Yet even with the Lord himself asteacher most hearts, ears and eyes remainedclosed. He indicated that conversion precedeshealing (Matthew 13:15). However convincingthe philosophy, therefore, education alone isnot enough. Informed heads and repentanthearts can be separated by stiff necks.

The subject was as timely then as it isnow: 'The future of professional freedom'.This address was subsequently published byCMF and could bear re-reading. The memoirs are typically unpretentious, but will evoke many memories for the oldergeneration of CMF members and for thosewho knew Ron Winton. His was a life wellspent and an example to follow.

As Pete Moore recognises, 'Anyapproach to define who I am is doomed fromthe outset because we will always be morecomplex than can be catered for by any singledefinition. It is however, not intractable toinvestigation once you have broken thesubject down into bite-sized pieces, and haveadmitted that revealing the nature of oneaspect of our existence is not the same asdescribing humanity.' With this in mind, he explores nine different aspects of human existence -embodiment, consciousness, genetics, history,relationship, materiality, spirituality, sexualityand society - by telling the stories of peoplefor whom a single aspect is especiallyrelevant. For embodiment we read aboutArthur White, the reigning world championpower lifter, whose physical ability has beena defining feature of his life. A very differentexperience is seen in the story of David Bird,who was born with a vascular anomalysurrounding one of his eyes that hasprofoundly affected the way others view him,and consequently his own self-perceptionand personal development. The importanceof our history is considered through theresearch of David Barker, whose findings show that our health is radically influencedby the diet and environment that ourgrandmothers experienced whilst pregnantwith our mothers. Some well-known interviewees, such as Rowan Williams and Mary Warnock, areincluded in the chapter on spirituality.However, it was the stories of everyday peoplethat really drew me in. These provokedconsideration of the various environmental,historical and biological factors that haveinterplayed to make me who I am today, andhow changes to any of these might affect mylife. It is, perhaps, this kind of reaction thatPete Moore hopes to produce. Modernscientific thought often reduces us tocategories that determine who we are, 'thereare two branches in particular that are currentlymaking that sort of claim - genetics andneuroscience.' Pete Moore's aim of 'taking aholistic view of our existence' highlights howlimited such a view of humanity is. The content is not specifically Christian, though some of the interviewees express aChristian faith, and it does not detailphilosophical arguments on existence. Rather,there are some interesting insights, engagingstories, and useful overviews of currentthought - all of which make this an enjoyableand stimulating read.

So Isat on my hotel balcony and in the airportlounge writing this review and felt guiltysince taking work on holiday is definitely oneactivity which the authors do not applaud! This is a very good book. The authors aretwo female academic GPs and a teenage daughter. Their writing is given addedweight by being based on survey data andresponses. Within an attractively printedpaperback, about 100 pages of text areaddressed directly to the reader. Both thequotations that are highlighted in text boxesand the well chosen cartoons succeed inbreaking up the text, making it a veryreadable book. The nine chapters covercareer-marriage conflict, the team family,stress, surviving time pressures, theimportance of listening and talking, takingtime off duty, and illness. The final chapteron making a logical plan will appeal to thosepersonalities who like the grid box solutionapproach to problem solving, but are lessuseful to intuitives like me. There is no Christian angle to this book, and in fact the only biblical material is the listof seven deadly sins, curiously unreferencedin an otherwise very well referenced piece ofwriting. Whilst these are described as strongmotivators, the authors clearly do not regardthem as desirable ones, although most ofthem can be observed on a regular basis inthe NHS. This book sits very harmoniouslyalongside biblical teaching, and bothChristians and non-Christians will benefit. Itis timely since many of us have been forcedinto a much greater degree of personalreflection about our work and its personalimpact as we go through appraisal. In thefinal chapter the authors state: 'This book isfilled with good advice. You will have heard aconsiderable amount of it before...' They areright, but what makes this book special is theway that knowledge is illustrated and applied. Who should read it? Any doctor will benefit, but those who need it most are unlikely tochoose to read it, at least until they getdesperate, have burned out, or their marriageshave failed. It would make a superb gift to thenewly or recently qualified doctor, which isprobably where it will be most effectivebefore attitudes become hardened. It haseasily solved the problem of what to give myGP daughter for Christmas! And if I ruled theNHS I would give this book as a free handoutto all doctors with their appraisal forms, andthen make sure that it was handed on to theirliterate family members.

My seven-year-old granddaughter was worriedwhen she heard that I had suffered a heartattack. Who indeed? I was a fit non-smoker with no previous ill health. Could it be due to stress, the sub tle demon that seems to lie behind so many of today's ills? How had I managed to allow things to get to this state? Three years havepassed. With a change of job and a more relaxed environment, Ihave remained well. Recently, I read a Proverb and the wholeexperience came back to my mind... Above all else, guard your heart , for it is the wellspring of life. (Proverbs 4:23) This verse led me to Paul's urging of the Philippians... Rejoice in the Lord always... Do not be anxious about anything, b ut in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends allunderstanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true...think about such things. Wh atever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me - put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. (Philippians 4 :4-9) This brought another scene to mind. Some years previously in T anzania, a group of nuns, led by the Mother Superior, appeared in my gynaecology clinic. One of the sisters complained of a numbe r of non-specific symptoms. After examining her, I wrote out a ra ther unusual prescription and they all left. Minutes later, there wa s a furious knocking on my door and the nuns all burst back in anddemanded that I teach them the chorus that I had prescribed. All your anxiety, all your care. Bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.Never a burden he cannot bear, never a friend like Jesus. (from All Your Anxiety by EH Joy) After an impromptu choir practice, I could hear the words echoing round the department as they marched out of the hospita l. What was Paul's advice to those wanting to guard their hearts and minds against the physical, emotional and spiritual onslaug hts of this world? What was his prescription for a stressful situat ion? ILearn to rejoice and give thanks in every situation. IPray into every situation and be thankful. IFill your mind with good and excellent things. IFollow his example and put the things you learn into practice. He goes on to talk about having learned the secret of contentment 'in any and every situation' and of the fact that h e can do all the things that Jesus has asked him to do through th e strength he supplies (Philippians 4:12-13). I was given all sorts of lifestyle advice after my heart attack . Yet, 'above all else', I needed to relearn these spiritual lessons a nd to know afresh the peace that passes all understanding in my heart . I needed to enter into that rest that is ours in Christ. Perhaps these are lessons that we all need to be relearning continually in th e midst of our busy and stressful lives. I have come to see each day as a gift from God, days that might not have been. We were made with only one heart and are givenonly one life here on earth. Heed the words of the writer ofProverbs: above all else, guard your heart in order to enjoy th e life and work that God has given you to do for him.
