The 2024 Retreat Center Schedule is available [here](https://insightmeditationsociety.my.site.com/IMSPORTAL/s/sign-up-for-retreats). Our Retreat Center courses offer guidance in Buddhist meditations known as vipassana (insight) and metta (lovingkindness). While the context is the Buddha's teachings, these practices are universal and help to develop awareness and compassion. Retreats range from a weekend to three months - most are suitable for both new and experienced meditators. Please click on a course title below for a full description and to register. IMS retreat fees are on a sliding scale basis that allows participants to pay according to individual means. At the Retreat Center, fees do not include compensation for the teachings, and teachers rely on the generosity of retreatants for a sustainable income. There is an opportunity to offer donations to the teachers at the end of each retreat. "}
