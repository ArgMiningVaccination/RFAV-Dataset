The University's affirmative-action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, student services, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to process student com-plaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the University's policy of nondiscriminationbased on gender or disability. Inquiries concerning Title IX may be directed to the affirmative-action officer. Employment-related discrimination complaints, including those filed by studentemployees, are processed in conformity with the provisions outlined in existing staff personnelpolicies. Complaints related to discrimination in academic areas are reviewed in conformity withthe procedures established by the academic administration.20 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Nondiscrimination Policy Loma Linda University was established by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as an integral part of its teaching ministry. The University affirms that Christian principles are incom-patible with various forms of discrimination that have divided societies, and that all per- sons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people.Therefore, the University is committed to equal education and employment opportunities formen and women of all races and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race,color, or national origin in its educational or admissions policies, financial affairs, employmentprograms, student life and services, or any University-administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended and is in substantial compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination inEmployment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Adjustment Act of 1974;and does not discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment on the basis ofage or because they are disabled veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era. In addition, theUniversity administers student programs without discrimination on the basis of age\u2014except inthose programs where age is a bona fide academic qualification for admission\u2014in accordancewith the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employment, includingbut not limited to 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; Sec. 12926(d)(1); T itle II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the California Code of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article I, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. TheUniversity believes that Title IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees againstunreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of theSeventh-day Adventist church. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblicalprinciples of morality and deportment as interpreted by the Seventh-day Adventist church. TheUniversity claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in 34 CATALOG Accommodation for Disability Loma Linda University is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as with local and state requirements. The University iscommitted to providing education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommo- dations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants for whom such accommodation does not funda-mentally alter the chosen program or create an undue burden. For information regarding accommodation for disability, the student should consult the office of the dean of the school to which application for admission is being made. Following acceptance, the student may be asked if he or she has a disability requiring accommodation. A student who desires accommodation for a disability (e.g., physical, learning,or psychological) identified after acceptance should consult the office of the dean regarding a request for accommodation. The accommodation request must be submitted in writing on thedesignated form. The completed form and the required supporting documentation will be evalu-ated by appropriate University entities to determine whether or not the applicant can be expect-ed to perform the essential functions of the program. All discussions will remain confidential.

ASEVENTH -DAY ADVENTIST HEAL TH -SCIENCES INSTITUTION ABOUT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 33 University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal Traditionally the ceremonial mace represents the authority vested in the highest offi- cer of a governing body. In an educational institution, the authority symbolized by the mace derives from respect for the authority of knowledge and for the rights andvalue of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic community assumes the obliga - tion and challenge to ensure for its members a climate conducive to growth in knowl-edge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda University evokes further ideas. Its two metals, bronze and aluminum ,suggest the value of lessons both ancient and contemporary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this macestands upright in celebration of the free human spirit. Its open construction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflict. The eight vertical supporting elements (at three points bound together as for strength and stability in unity) uphold a graceful oval that points outward to the universe, the province of inquiry . Within the oval, the University seal appears to float unfettered.The basic design of the coat of arms and the seal of Loma Linda University\u2014established in 1905 as theCollege of Medical Evangelists\u2014is a contemporary modification of the shield, a heraldicdevice. Within the seal, the broken sword suggests the compassion and mercy of those who serve others with love, selflessness, and restraint from attitudes of self-aggrandize- ment and acts of destructiveness. The lighted torch symbolizes the learner's zeal to advance truth. It also suggests the illuminating power of knowledge and the University's central purpose of forwarding andperpetuating good through the enlightened, searching, caring mind and conscience of theindividual. The ancient staff of Aesculapius ,long associated with medicine, represents in the modern and broad sense the combined services of all the healing arts and sciences. Across the base of the shield, the open book symbolizes the Word of God\u2014the foundation of all truth, the source of the Christ-centered commission, the inspirationfor all endeavor of humanity for humanity. Framing the shield are, at the left, the wreath of oak leaves and acorns ,presented in ancient times to honor the civic contribution of one who had saved his brother-citizen's life; and, at the right, the wreath of laurel ,presented to honor personal achievement. The emblems of the seal imply that one who has the privilege of learning also has the obligation of valor and honor. On the scroll below the shield is the motto \u2014adopted in 1955 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this institution\u2014 To Make Man Whole. MAKE MAN WH OLE OT LO MALINDAUNIVE RSITY University Foundations HISTORY Loma Linda University is part of the Seventh-day Adventist system of higher education. In 1905 the University (formerly College of Medical Evangelists) was founded\u2014through aseries of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelistsreceived its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both Schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care, a revolutionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine--have been joined by Allied Health Professions,Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, Science and Technology, the Graduate School, and theFaculty of Religion. The curricula of the University are approved by their respective professionalorganizations. From its small beginnings, the University has achieved widespread recognition,having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other university. Itremains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with thechurch. From 1918 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962 all health-professional education was consolidated at LomaLinda. In 1967 Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three-tower facility, alandmark cloverleaf structure. The Medical Center continues on the cutting edge of health care,providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportunities for students. In 1990 the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda University a health-sciences universi- ty\u2014part of a complex comprised of Loma Linda University Medical Center, faculty practiceplans, and affiliated institutions. The University is a leader in the field of health-sciences educa-tion, research, and service. The most current campus census figures (January 1, 2005) indicate that the core of the combined faculties consists of 1,126 full-time teachers. Part-time and voluntary teachers(1,385\u2014 largely clinicians in the professional curricula) bring the total to 2,511. As of AutumnQuarter 2004, students from 92 countries are represented in the enrollment of 4,034.34 UNIVERSITY CATALOGThis imposing three-story structure\u2014the Loma Linda Resort and its surrounding acreage\u2014was purchased in 1905. Incor- porated in August of that year as the Loma Linda Sanitarium, in October it opened its doors to patients and nursing students. Today the original property is part of an expanding health sciences campus, which includes three medical facilities, licensed for 785 beds\u2014 Loma Linda University Medical sHospital (LLUECH), 2003\u2014licensed under LLUMC as Loma Linda University Community Medical Center (LLUCMC), 1993, formerly known as Loma Linda Community Hospital; an acute psychiatric care facility ,licensed in 1991 for 89 beds\u2014 the Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC); five Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center (LLUAHSC) institutes, four LLU research centers, and various school-related research centers (see Learning Resources); and Loma Linda University (on-campus, distance-education, and online degree programs )\u2014 through the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Public Health; the Faculty of Graduate Studies; and the Faculty of Religion.ABOUT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 35 1905 School of Nursing opens 1909 School of Medicine, renamed the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) 1922 Department of Dietetics1937 School of Medical Technology*1941 School of Physical Therapy*1945 Radiologic Technology Program*1948 School of Tropical &Preventive Medicine (reorganized as School of Public Health, 1964) 1954 Graduate School (restructured as Faculty of Graduate Studies in 2005) 1953 School of Dentistry 1958 Dental Hygiene Program1959 Occupational Therapy Program*1963 Medical Records Administration Program*1966 Schools/Programs (see *) are consolidated as School of Allied Health Professions 1967 Loma Linda University campus merges with La Sierra College 1968 Loma Linda University Medical Center dedicated1990 Loma Linda and La Sierra campuses become two separate universities 1990 Faculty of Religion (originally School of Religion) 1991 Loma Linda University designated as a health- sciences university 1997 Loma Linda University and Medical Center corporately linked together through Loma LindaUniversity Adventist Health Sciences Center(LLUAHSC) 2002 School of Pharmacy 2003 School of Science and Technology 36 UNIVERSITY CATALOG University Philosophy Asimplied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation both to God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment perme- ated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advancesthe ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Loma Linda University Fundamental Values COMPASSION \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and suffering of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which LLU has taken as a central symbol for our work. INTEGRITY \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one' sconvictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM \u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery, but to freedom. JUSTICE \u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly , renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually, to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue theoppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF-CONTROL \u2014The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY \u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner; the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance.ABOUT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 37AUnique University Loma Linda University has always combined a devotion to academic excellence with a con- cern for spiritual values and a high sense of mission. The motto of the University, \"tomake man whole,\" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in whole-ness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the Biblical principles which provide its foundation have remained unchanged. SEVENTH-DA YADVENTIST HERIT AGE Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and has a deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. It viewsrespect and sensitivity for all people, regardless of their culture and ethnicity, as a part of true Christianity. We recognize that students come from many different faiths. This Universityhas a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious values that differ fromours. We look upon the various perspectives of each spiritually committed student as enrichingtoour campus and educational environment.38 UNIVERSITY CATALOG OUR UNIQUE FEATURES Two distinctive features of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which are part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first-time students. The first is the concept ofSabbath rest which reminds us of God as Creator. Adventists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During thesehours you will find that University offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facil-ities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship. Asecond distinctive feature worth noting is the emphasis on health and wholeness. As a stu- dent you will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness center, a health and fitness com-plex which received a national award for excellence in utility and design. The cafeterias on cam-pus feature well-prepared vegetarian meals. You should also note that the University holds that adrug, alcohol, and tobacco-free lifestyle is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness.\" Thismeans that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\"drugs while enrolled at the University. SPIRITUAL LIFE Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout theweek. Besides regular Friday evening and Saturday services, you will find that many class, school, club, and University activities include a component of worship and praise to God.ABOUT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 39 CHAPEL SERVICES Inkeeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda University students have special requirements, such as chapel service attendance each Wednesday morning in the UniversityChurch. The chapel programs provide a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learn- ing. Undergraduates who stay in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in theresidence halls each week. RELIGION CLASSES Classes in religion are part of the core curriculum in each of the University's schools and programs. These classes deal with the study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (whichconcentrates on ways to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients in a man- ner that is noninvasive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to thestudent's field of study and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner which reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity ofthe University and themselves as members of its community.40 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Learning Environment The total resources of the University offer a wealth of opportunity to the student with ini- tiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. The academicresources, affiliated clinical facilities, and community agencies constitute a rich educa- tional environment both in classroom instruction and in guided experience. Major facilities uti-lized for clinical affiliations and internships include the University Medical Center; the Jerry L.Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center; and numerous other hospitals and agencies located inthe Redlands, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles areas, as well as throughout the United States and abroad. In addition, students find varied opportunities for service and learning in the immediate University community, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteerprograms.

Webb Memorial Library\u2014the central library of Loma LindaUniversity\u2014go back to 1907, when a small library col-lection was started in a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium. In 1953 the growing collection was moved to its own building on the Loma Linda campus. In1981 a new library was built, funded by a Del E. WebbFoundation grant, giving the library a total floor space of 87,670 square feet. This structure now houses the main library; while the old structure is now sharedbetween the Department of Archives and SpecialCollections and the bound retrospective journals. As ofJune 2003, the library had a total collection of 353,019books and bound journals; 165,856 print and electron-ic books; 8,211 current print and journaltitles; and 6,060 media items.

Forinternational students, on-campus employment isABOUT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 47allowed but limited by visa regulations (e.g., for F-1 and J-1 students, employment is limited to a maxi-mum of twenty hours per week while school is in ses-sion). Scholarships, assistantships, and living stipendsare rarely available at Loma Linda University becauseit is a small, private university (i.e., not supported bythe U.S. or California state government but rather is church sponsored). Employment plans require approval by a designated school official (DSO) in International Student and Scholar Services. VISAS F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security toissue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 stu-dent visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda University. This visa allows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates, precep-torships, and English-as-a-second-language studies).Degree-earning students are subject to study-load requirements and are allowed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student hasbeen accepted into a program, has paid the advancedeposit, and has documented his/her financial plan forthe chosen program. International Student andScholar Services can be contacted at 909/558-4955 forfurther information regarding F-1 student visas and theregulations governing these visas. Jexchange-visitor's visas Loma Linda University has an Exchange V isitor Program that is approved by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorized tosponsor/host degree-earning students, nondegree (con - tinuing education) students, short-term scholars, visit- ing professors, and research scholars. The J-visa form,DS-2019, is issued after an exchange visitor has beenaccepted into a program, scholar position, or professorposition; and has documented his/her financial plan(including health insurance for J-1 and J-2 depend-ents) for the chosen program. Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visi- tors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g.,Fulbright scholars).

Under current exchange-visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda University. Also, their credits earned can be either degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on theexchange category. Contact International Student andScholar Services at 909/558-4955 for further informa-tion and regulations governing the Exchange VisitorProgram. Other visas Internationals may enter the U.S. on a wide vari- ety of visas. However ,avisa may have to be changed before a student can commence academic studies at this University. For further information regarding regu-lations and study options for specific visa types, con- tact International Student and Scholar Services at909/558-4955. Transfer students International students currently attending other schools in the United States who have either an I-20 oraDS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma Linda University must do a school-to-school transfer. Thetiming of a transfer is critical in order to maintain visastatus; therefore, it is important to consult with aninternational adviser as soon as the acceptance letteris received.

It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below standard; student duties are neglected; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstratedeficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity. Procedures for evaluation of academic and nonacademic performance\u2014as well as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in the current CATALOG and in each school's section of the Student Handbook .Grievances regarding both academic and nonacadem- ic matters must be processed according to these published grievance procedures.

Prospective students who have questions concerning the University's expectations should seek specific information prior to enrollment.

This seven-digitnumber will be used on all correspondence and notedon all payments to the University. A University identi-fication card using this identification number and abar code will be issued to each student after comple- tion of their initial registration and financial clearance. The identification card allows access to various student services, including the libraries, StudentHealth, recreation facilities (i.e., the Drayson Center),parking, etc. Also, the bar code on the card allows cur-rently enrolled and financially cleared students tocharge against their accounts at the Campus Bookstoreand campus cafeterias, and for ticket sales availablethrough the Student Services office. In subsequentquarters, the card's bar code is automatically reactivat-ed at each registration with financial clearance. In some cases, a second identification card is nec- essary for students on clinical rotation in the LomaLinda University medical centers. This card is issuedby Loma Linda University's Human ResourceManagement office and is valid only for medical cen- ter-related activities and does not replace the student identification card. For further information regarding these identifica - tion cards, please contact Student Services. Residence hall The University is coeducational and accepts both single and married students.

ACADEMIC AUTHORITY The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all academic matters, with the exception of General Education requirements, and is charged with the inter-pretation and enforcement of academic requirements.Any exceptions or changes in academic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not valid unless approved by the dean. Any actions taken by individualfaculty members with regard to these matters are advi- sory only and are not binding on the school or theUniversity unless approved by the dean. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The academically dishonest act intentionally violates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of knowledge from teacher to student, and is inconsis-tent with good professional and moral behavior.Accordingly ,the penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to: theft; falsifying or changing grades or other academic records; plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of someone else's work; knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying informa- tion during examinations or other academic orprofessional practice assignments; using unauthorized aids during examinations; loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final exami- nations, comprehensive assessments, take-home tests,open-book tests, and any other assignment given by aninstructor or preceptor whether for a grade, points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exer- cise). Instructors and students are charged with the responsibility of reporting instances of academic dis-honesty for investigation. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain theintegrity of the academic process. Substantiated viola-tions are to be brought before the designated discipli-nary body for action. Disciplinary action may includereceiving a failing grade on the examination or assign - ment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspen- sion, or permanent dismissal from the program.ABOUT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 63CONDUCT Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clinical training. Professional conduct includes (but is not lim-ited to) punctuality; and respect for other people, theirproperty, and their right to learn. It also includes anappropriate respect for those in authority. Students ofLoma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselves, the program, the school, or the University. Because students may be exposed to patients' rel- atives and friends in any public place, and becausetheir conversations and their attitudes have an effecton those around them, students are asked to observethe following: Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record must be held instrict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment and other clini- cally related topics should be extremely guarded.Apatient's family and community people may be listening and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to a malpracticelitigation. Ajoking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayed sinceit may seem uncaring and be disturbing to thosewho are ill and suffering, as well as to the familymembers. Student and staff behavior in professional situa - tions may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancinglifestyle. Amore in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the LomaLinda University Student Handbook.

Posted deadlines for registra-tion and change of registration are in effect and bind- ing. The school will not intercede to obtain a variance. After consultation with their academic adviser, students register online. Registration procedureincludes entering classes online, clearing financialarrangements with the Office of Student Finance, and having a student identification picture taken for the ID card first-quarter registration only). Students areadvised to print the Request for Clearance SubmittedWeb page to retain written documentation that theyhave requested financial clearance. Alate-registration period of at least a week prior to the beginning of the quarter and extending to fivedays after the quarter begins is provided, during whichalate-registration fee of $50 will be charged. (Always check the W eb for specific dates of registration, since they vary during some quarters due to holiday sched - ules.) Students may not attend class without being reg-istered, and in no case may registration take placelater than the seventh calendar day of a term unlessthe course is offered as an intensive that requires reg - istration before the end of the first day of class. Nocredit is granted for academic work performed duringany quarter without registration. Change in registration Achange in registration requires filing a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form with theOffice of University Records. Students receive writtenverification each time a change of program is officiallyapproved. Students are advised to retain this written verification as documentation of their registration. Changes in registration after the second week affectthe student's grade record. Course changes Astudent may add courses that follow the general University calendar during the first seven calendardays of the quarter .Courses that follow the general University calendar may be dropped during the firstfourteen days of the quarter without academic or financial penalty. Course changes after the fourteenthday of the quarter affect the permanent grade record.AChange of Program form must be filed. Students may withdraw from a course prior to the fourteen calendardays before the final examination week, after whichtime withdrawals are no longer permitted.Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load is con-sidered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a full grad-uate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter. Professional programs, however, require considerable clinical experience, for which only partial academiccredit is given at times. Consequently, a full study load often is not reflected by the number of academic cred- it units carried. Tobe considered a full-time student, an under- graduate student must be registered for at least 12 units of course work per quarter; and a graduate stu - dent must be registered for at least 8 units. A registra- tion of 400 clock hours per quarter is also considered to be full time for any student. This is based on fortyhours per week for a ten-week quarter . The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or anoth- er institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduatestudent and 12 quarter units for a graduate student.Full-time study loads are those specified by the depart-ments for each program. Students of exceptional abili-ty may register for additional course work upon rec - ommendation of the department and consent of the dean. Non-LLU courses as part of total load for financial aid Regular courses for which a student is registered at another financial-aid eligible institution constitutepart of the student's study load. Courses must be transferable and required for completion of the stu- dent's Loma Linda University degree program. Correspondence and independent study courses are excluded, per federal-aid regulations. Only when thestudent enrolls in such courses using the ConsortiumAgreement form (from the Office of Financial Aid) will the course(s) count on the student's total load as eligi- ble for financial-aid and loan-deferment purposes. Aperson who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or thesis, isclassified as a student. By filing an Academic Load Validation form every quarter at registration, the aca- demic load may be validated for loan-deferment. BACKGROUND CHECKS Some clinical affiliation sites require background checks for all incoming students; these checks must be completed no later than two weeks prior toclinical placement. The student will be responsible forobtaining the background checks, including the cost. ABOUT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 65 Academic Policies and Information Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. In thissection (Section II) are the University regulations. See Section III for regulations that per- tain to each school.The following elements must be covered by the check, at a minimum: past 7 years, 3 counties, Officeof Inspector General (OIG), Social Security number,other names (maiden, married, etc.), addresses, andsex offender database. STUDENT LEVEL Students enrolled in a professional program in which they are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior will be classified according to the level of thecourse work they are taking (e.g., a student with a pre-vious baccalaureate degree pursuing another baccalau-reate degree would be classified as a sophomore while taking sophomore-level courses, etc.). Students enrolled in block programs are classified according to the level of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master's-1st, 2nd, or 3rd year; or fresh-man, sophomore, junior, senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [professional year 1]). and clinical; 901-999, continuing education without academic credit. 500-level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate degree unless it is approved by theinstructor ,and both deans (dean of the school offering the course and dean of the school in which the studentis enrolled) give permission; and provided the creditdoes not apply toward both an undergraduate and agraduate degree. Approval is not needed if the courseis part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply toward a baccalaureate degree. UNIT OF CREDIT Credit is recorded in quarter units. One unit repre- sents 10-11 class hours in lecture or 30-40 hours in laboratory practice. ATTENDANCE Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laboratory, chapel) is required beginning with the first day of each term. A pattern of absence, excusedand unexcused, will be referred to the school's desig-nated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are defined as follows: Illness, verified by a physician's statement or offi- cial statement from Student Health Service sub - mitted to the school's designated academicauthority; Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (verified by a written statement from a facultysponsor);Recognizable emergency approved by the school's designated academic authority. Tardiness is disruptive, distracting, and inconsis- tent with professional behavior. Students who arriveafter the beginning of class may be counted absent. Information regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. CLEP TheCollege Level Examination Program (CLEP), a national program of credit by examination, offers persons of all ages and backgrounds new opportunities to obtain recognition for college-level achievement, nomatter how acquired. As of July 2001, general examinations are no longer offered; however, the policy remains in effectfor students who took general examinations prior to that date. No credit is granted for the CLEP general examinations in English composition, mathematics, orscience courses requiring a laboratory. As of July 1, 2004, in order to receive Loma Linda University credit, students must complete all examina - tions for CLEP credit within six months after having received their initial degree-compliance report. A stu-dent will be allowed to challenge a given course byexamination only once. CLEP scores will be accepted at C or better until percentiles are available from CLEP. Credit is granted for scores at or above the 50thpercentile for the subject examinations, and at the65th percentile for general examinations in thehumanities, natural sciences, and social science s/ history . CREDIT BY EXAMINA TION For certain courses offered by the University, a stu- dent in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examination adminis-tered by the appropriate school and department. Suchan examination is at least equal in scope and difficultyto a final examination in the course and may includematerials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. Agraduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by exami - nation is to validate prior knowledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a requiredcourse in the degree program is a repeat of prior learn - ing, the student may request a waiver, thus making it possible to take elective courses that would increaseknowledge. Astudent currently enrolled in a degree program at this University who desires credit by equivalency examination petitions the dean of the school offeringthe course, and, upon approval, pays a testing fee. SeeSchedule of Charges in the Financial Information sec-tion for examination fee. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate cred- it already earned through course work, includingcourses taken for audit. Agrade of CR (Credit) is given only after the stu- dent has completed one quarter, or the equivalent, atthis University; and has earned 12 units of credit withagrade-point average of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses.66 UNIVERSITY CATALOGUnits earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equivalency examination is determined byeach school but may not exceed a maximum of 20 per- cent of the units required for the degree or certificate. COURSE WAIVER Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An examination for waiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quarter of the program ofstudy. Waiver of a specific course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a programor residency requirements. A waiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which an unsatisfactory grade was received. For examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section. Permission to waive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approval of thedepartment chair and consent of the dean. INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the Office of the Dean. The student is responsible for completion ofthe Directed/Independent Study T itle Request form in addition to the regular registration. University policylimits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergrad-uate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degreeprogram. Individual programs may further limit theseunits. The Office of the Dean should be consultedregarding limits on credit earned through independentstudy. Independent study is to be completed in ade-quate time before graduation to allow recording in theOffice of University Records. CORRESPONDENCE COURSE Asageneral rule, the student may not register for a correspondence course that duplicates a course offered at this University. (The School of Nursingmakes exceptions when a religion or cognate course conflicts with a clinical course; or when scheduling prevents a student from completing a religion or cog-nate course during the summer in order to reduce thecourse load during the regular school year.) If the stu- dent is a candidate for graduation, the course must be completed no later than one month before graduation.Information and application for Griggs UniversityHome Study International (the Seventh-day Adventistcorrespondence school) in W ashington, DC, may be obtained from the Web at www.griggs.edu. In the School of Pharmacy, permission to take a correspondence course for credit requires priorapproval of the department chair and consent of thedean.EXTENSION STUDY Tobe acceptable for credit, an extension course must be evaluated as to its equivalence to an accepted course. To assure that the course will transferto Loma Linda University, the student should contactthe Office of University Records prior to taking thecourse. Registration for extension study requires priorapproval of the department chair and consent of the dean.

Charles J. Goodacre, D.D.S., M.S.D. Dean, School of Dentistry.School Foundations HISTORY Asmall but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to form an organization that wouldserve as a catalyst, urging the Seventh-day AdventistChurch to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men werethe founders of the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectives through mensuch as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on hisown time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventistdentists who were willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NAS- DAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to sup-port the dental school project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong financial base in support of theirgoals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H.Branson, asked Dr . Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Official action was taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit ofLoma Linda University' s School of Medicine. Dr . Prince was selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry. His leadership in organizing and eventuallyadministering the new School of Dentistry was facili - tated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of theAmerican Dental Association Council on DentalEducation. Forty-two students comprised the inaugu - ral class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under thedirection of Dr . Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department of Periodontics. V iolet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960 Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean. During this period the school experienced positivegrowth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculumwas developed in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliaryutilization (DAU) program was initiated to provideenhanced learning for dental students. The MonumentValley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding from pub- lic sources fiscal support for the clinic building and forfaculty housing. New advanced-education (postdoctor - al) programs were initiated in five clinical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics,and oral pathology . During the 1970s the School of Dentistry contin - ued its evolution into one of the premier clinical pro- grams in the United States. Dr . Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contributions THE SCHOOLS 93 was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was complet- ed in May 1976. The new building more than doubledthe number of clinical units; provided facilities for spe-cialized areas of clinical instruction; and includedeight new research laboratories, new classrooms, semi-nar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacheroffice space, and a commensurate expansion of sup- port facilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic was remodeled, and an outpatient surgi- center was developed to meet the needs of thosepatients requiring general anesthesia for dental treat-ment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for develop-mentally disabled children and adults, many of whomrequire such a treatment setting. The BiomaterialsResearch Laboratory was constructed; and newadvanced-education programs were initiated in pedi- atric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiolo- gy, and prosthodontics. A new program was estab-lished in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education forforeign-trained dentists. An increasing number of den-tal professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advancedknowledge to share in their own countries. TheInternational Dentist Program continues to offer anintensive, twenty-one-month course of study leading toa D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-monthcertificate program limited to dental missionaries fromother countries who sense the need for updated con-tinuing education. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provid-ed two new patient entrances. The expanded SurgeryCenter for Dentistry and the enlarged PediatricDentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor . An additional student laboratory was also included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowedfor expansion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-sixadditional operatories.

Advanced Dental Education Programs Overview JAMES D. KETTERING, Associate Dean, Advanced Dental Education, School of Dentistry; Coordinator, Graduate Programs in Dentistry, Faculty of Graduate Studies The School of Dentistry offers advanced dental education programs in specialty and nonspecialty disciplines of dentistry. Graduate degrees\u2014Master of Science and doctoral degrees\u2014are available. The purpose of these programs is to offer candidates anopportunity to integrate advanced clinical training with meaningful exposure to applied basic science and research. For applications and additional information,interested applicants should contact the individualprogram director. The School of Dentistry offers eight advanced dental education programs: Advanced dental education programs leading to a professional certificate with an option to also completethe Master of Science degree are: Endodontics Implant Dentistry Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics Pediatric Dentistry Periodontics ProsthodonticsTHE SCHOOLS 95 Postdoctoral study leading to a professional certifi- cate upon completion of the program is offered in\u2014 Dental Anesthesiology. These programs are organized in line with the standards of the Council on Dental Education of theAmerican Dental Association, and the objectives andcontent meet the requirements of the respective spe-cialty boards. In addition, the programs in endodon-tics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics anddentofacial orthopedics, pediatric dentistry, periodon-tics, and prosthodontics are accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation, a specialized accrediting body recognized by the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation and the United StatesDepartment of Education. Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committeesof the school accomplish this by examining evidenceof scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards,and significant qualities of character and personality . Applicants are considered for admission only on therecommendation of the program in which study isdesired. PREDOCTORAL D.D.S. PROGRAM The Admissions Committee looks for evidence of per- sonal integrity, intellectual vigor, good health, self- discipline and motivation. In broad terms, the followingare standards required for admission: 1. Intellectual capacity to complete the curriculum. 2. Emotional adaptability and stability.3.Social and perceptual skills. 4. Physical ability to carry out observation and commu- nication activities, and the possession of sufficientmotor and sensory abilities to practice general den- tistry. All materials submitted for admission should be sent to: Office of Admissions School of Dentistry Loma Linda UniversityLoma Linda, CA 92350 Required Students preparing for the predoctoral program are required to complete a minimum of three academic yearswith no fewer than 96 semester or 144 quarter units in acollege or university accredited by a regional accrediting association. Preference is given to applicants who have completed or will complete the requirements for a bac-calaureate degree prior to admission. A maximum of 64semester or 96 quarter units of credit may be acceptedfrom an accredited junior or community college. A complete academic year of classwork (8 semester or 12 quarter units) in general biology, general chemistry,organic chemistry, general physics, and English composi-tion must be completed within five years prior to admis- sion, with a grade of C or above in each course. A mini-mum grade-point average of 2.7 in science subjects andin nonscience subjects, averaged separately, is required.The average grade-point average for accepted students issubstantially higher. Recommended The subjects listed as required form the minimum background for professional study. In order to be better pre-pared with specific vocabulary and understanding, theapplicant should particularly include science courses with content similar to courses offered during the first year of the professional curriculum. The applicant's purpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowledge, the cultivation of aninquiring mind, the practice of efficient methods of study,and the habit of thinking and reasoning independently.These are of paramount importance to the applicant's devel-opment as a unique and responsible human being. The choice of electives can broaden the applicant' s view of the scope of knowledge. Being well-read will give a perspective on the sweep of human thought throughoutthe ages, and often this will be of assistance in written and verbal communication and will improve the ability tothink and express oneself well. Psychological, social, philosophical, and religious insights will help to developbasic resources for the solution of personal problems andthe growth of that self-understanding the student must first have in order to understand and help associates. Transfer, course waiver Credits from professional schools (business, medical technology , nursing, pharmacy , or medicine) do not fulfill admission requirements. Credit for studies taken at a mil- itary service school is granted to veterans according torecommendations in the Guide of the American Council on Education and/or the California Committee for the Study of Education. The University reserves the right torequire satisfactory completion of written or practicalexaminations in any course for which transfer credit isrequested. An applicant from a college or university outside the United States or Canada or from a nonaccredited collegeor university in the United States must complete a mini-mum of one full academic year (24 semester or 36 quar-ter credits) in competition with other preprofessionalstudents in an accredited college or university in the United States. A grade of C or above in each course com- pleted is required. (A grade of C- will not be accepted.) A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or above, but no credit results. Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant hasbeen accepted to the program, and must be approved bythe course director at this University and the school'sassociate dean for academic affairs. T uition is not reduced if courses are waived or if a student takes less than a full load. Transfer from another school of dentistry in the United States is not recommended and is considered onlyin unusual circumstances. A transfer applicant shouldexpect to begin at the first-year level and will be consid - ered only if there is space available at the appropriate level or in the dental class desired. An application fortransfer will be considered when the following informa - tion is received in the school' s Office of Academic Affairs: letter from applicant, stating reason for requesting96 UNIVERSITY CATALOG transfer; letter of recommendation from the dean of the den- tal school where the applicant is enrolled; official transcripts sent directly to the Office of Academic Affairs for both predental and dental school courses completed; Dental Admission Test results. Application procedure The school participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service(AADSAS). Cards requesting an AADSAS applicationare available at most colleges and universities and alsoon the Internet at <www.adea.org>; or e-mail at <aad-sas@adea.org>. The application should to be complet- ed and returned to the Washington address indicatedon the application. AADSAS processes this applicationand sends copies to the schools of the applicant' s choice. The School of Dentistry at Loma Linda University recommends that applicants file their AAD-SAS application before October 1 in order to be com-petitive. To be given consideration for the next enter- ing class, the student' s application deadline is December 1. The following is a step-by-step process for completing an application to Loma Linda University. 1. Supplementary application . When an AADSAS appli- cation arrives at Loma Linda University, it is screened; and qualified applicants are sent a supple-mentary application for the School of Dentistry . 2. Supplementary written materials . The applicant must return the completed supplementary applica-tion and materials within 30 days. This includes: anessay specific to Loma Linda University, a wallet-sized photograph, and the application fee of $75. 3. Transcripts . Official transcripts may be sent to AAD- SAS and then released by AADSAS to the School ofDentistry. When an applicant becomes an acceptedstudent, official transcripts, mailed directly from allcolleges/universities, are required. An applicant's filewill not be given consideration by the AdmissionsCommittee until all official transcripts are on file. 4. References . The applicant is asked to supply a mini - mum of three personal references. It is recommend - ed that these include an academic reference from a science instructor; a reference from an employer; acharacter or religious reference such as from a min-ister; and a reference from a friend in the dental profession. If the applicant has attended a college or university that has a preprofessional committee thatprepares a preprofessional evaluation, it is requiredthat Loma Linda University be sent a copy of thisevaluation from the committee. Members of the applicant's family are excluded from writing the required letters of reference, although letters will beaccepted for the file in addition to those required.Recommendation letters may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to Loma Linda University School of Dentistry . 5.Dental Admission Test . The applicant is required to complete\u2014and must meet specific criteria related toperformance on\u2014the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Preference is given to applicants who have taken the test no later than October of the academic year pre-ceding that for which admission is desired. The stu-dent entering the first year is expected to have taken the test within the past two years. If the test has beentaken more than one time, the most recent scores areused for admission criteria. The committee reviews all scores on the test, giving priority to the academicaverage score and the perceptual ability score. The DAT scores must be on file at Loma Linda University before an acceptance to the School will be issued. Test results should be sent to Loma Linda University, School of Dentistry, Office of Admissions. 6.Interview . The applicant's records will be screened when the supplementary application, recommenda-tions, and transcripts are on file. The applicant may then be invited to the School for a personal inter- view. An interview is required for admission. The interview provides an opportunity for evaluation ofnoncognitive factors, including communication skills, personal values, motivation, and commitmentto goals of the profession; as well as genuine concern for others in the service of dentistry. At the time of the interview, a tour of the School will be given by a current student in the program. 7. Observation. It is important that preprofessional stu- dents seek experience observing and assisting in adental office to become familiar with the work of adentist or a dental hygienist. Prior to interviewing,applicants are expected to complete a minimumtwenty hours of observation/work experience in adental facility, ten of which must be done in a gener-al practitioner' s office. 8. Acceptance . The accepted student receives an acceptance letter and a follow-up letter with informa - tion relative to required forms and deposit deadlines. 9. Pre-entrance health requirements /Immunizations It is expected that necessary routine dental and medical care will have been attended to before thestudent registers. New students are required to have certain immuniza - tions and tests before registration. Forms to docu- ment the required immunizations are provided forthe physician in the acceptance packet sent to thestudent by the school. In order to avoid having a holdplaced on the registration packet, the student is encouraged to return the documentation forms in the provided envelope to Student Health Service no later than six weeks prior to the beginning of classes. Students enrolling in the School of Dentistry must provide documentation of having had the following immunizations and tests: MMRs\u2014measles (rubeola), mumps, two previ-ous MMRs) PPD (TB) skin test (current skin test result or x-ray report) Tetanus/Diphtheria booster Chicken pox blood test and/or immunization If no known history of chicken pox, then studentmay choose blood test (which may reveal pre-existing immunity) and/or immunization (if noprior immunity). Hepatitis-B vaccination series Students who know themselves to have had hepati-THE SCHOOLS 97 tis-B in the past should employ extra protection when involved in direct patient care and mayrequest a modified curriculum, if necessary. Thisseries of three vaccinations may be completed atthis University (even if it was begun elsewhere)through the Student Health Service. (The studentwill be charged a fee.) A recent eye examination performed by an oph- thalmologist or optometrist. For further information, consult the Student Handbook 2002, Section V\u2014University Policies: Communicable disease transmission prevention poli- cy; and the Student Health Service office, extension88770. If a returning student is assigned to a clinical facility that requires a tuberculosis skin test, then the studentis required to have the test within the six months before the assignment begins. 10.Deposits . The student accepted into dentistry must submit a deposit of $1000 and the required forms to the Admissions Office. All deposits become part ofthe first quarter's tuition. Failure to submit thisdeposit will result in the loss of the applicant's posi-tion in the class. The remaining balance of the firstquarter' s tuition and fees is due no later than the day of matriculation in late September. If the applicant has submitted a completed application for financialaid by March 2, and if the Stafford application hasbeen submitted by June 15, the final installment canbe paid utilizing University-assisted sources. TECHNICAL STANDARDS In harmony with its own education, research, and service objectives, and using the American Dental Educators Association suggested guidelines, LomaLinda University School of Dentistry has identifiedtechnical standards for its programs. The qualifiedapplicant will meet, or will have the potential to meet,the following technical standards\u2014standards thatevery student in the dentistry programs is expected toreach. Cognitive abilities School of Dentistry students must have abilities that allow them to accurately and effectively measure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize.Students must be able to comprehend three-dimen-sional relationships and to understand the spatial rela- tionships of structures in order to fully and completely solve dental problems. In addition, students must beable to visualize and comprehend physical demonstra - tions in the classroom, laboratory, and clinic. Effective problem solving requires students to gather , organize, and assess relevant information in order to arrive at an integrated solution. Observation For learning to occur , students will be required to observe and interpret demonstrations and experiences.Such observation requires the functional use of vision,touch, hearing, and somatic sensation. Observation isfurther enhanced by the sense of smell. Students must be able to acquire information from written documents; and to visualize information pre - sented in images from papers, films, slides, or videos.They must be able to interpret radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistivedevices. Students must be able to observe patientsaccurately, at a distance and close at hand. They mustbe able to observe and appreciate verbal and nonver-bal communications when performing dental opera-tions or administering medications. All students in the School of Dentistry must pos- sess adequate visual and tactile skills to perform dental examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity,accommodation, and color vision are necessary to dis-cern differences and variations in color, shape, andgeneral appearance between normal and abnormalhard and soft tissues. Touch and somatic sensation arerequired for effective learning, as well as for effectiveevaluation and treatment of patients. A student mustalso possess sufficient visual acuity to read charts,records, small print, and handwritten notations. Communication Students in the School of Dentistry must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. Thus stu-dents' communication with patients, faculty, and staff will be facilitated when eliciting or providing information; orwhen documenting changes in patients' mood, activity , and/or posture. Students must also be skilled in observingand understanding nonverbal communication. In addi-tion, they must develop the professional judgment that will enable them to discern when and how to maintain patient confidentiality. Motor skills School of Dentistry students should have sufficient motor and sensory capability in both hands to be able toprovide general dental care. They must possess the motorand sensory capabilities to perform diagnostic proce-dures\u2014including such diagnostic maneuvers as palpation,percussion, and auscultation; and to perform basic labo - ratory tests. Exercising these capabilities requires coordi - nation both of gross and fine muscular movements, equi- librium, and functional tactile and visual senses. Students must be able to operate foot controls, utiliz - ing fine movements; and to operate high- or low-speed dental instruments, accurately performing movements ofless than one-half millimeter. They must also demon-strate well-developed tactile sense and precise controlwhile using dental hand instruments. Students must be able to perform basic life-support (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, andphysically restrain patients who lack motor control.Additionally, they must be able to position or reposition themselves around the patient and dental chair while sit- ting or standing. Behavioral and social attributes Students must possess the emotional stability and resilience required for full utilization of their abilities in the context of a full and challenging education pro - gram. Success in the educational program requires use of good judgment; prompt completion of all responsi-bilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients;and development of mature, sensitive, and effectiverelationships with patients. It is also imperative that students be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectivelyunder stress. Students must be able to adapt to changingenvironments, to display flexibility , and to learn to func - tion in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical98 UNIVERSITY CATALOG problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, hon- esty, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, cul-tural sensitivity, and motivation are all personal qualitiesthat will be assessed during the admissions and educationprocess. Disabled applicants and students It is Loma Linda University's policy to comply fully with the provisions of The Americans withDisabilities Act [42 U.S.C., Sec. 12131 (2) (1990)].The school is committed to providing dental educa-tion\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified appli- cants who will be able to perform all technical stan- dards with or without accommodations; and for whomsuch accommodation does not fundamentally alter theSchool of Dentistry courses or create an undue bur-den. During the application process, the school requests that an applicant disclose any disability for which an accommodation may be needed. TheAdmissions Committee requires written domentationof the disability, which they will review prior to mak- ing an assessment as to whether or not the applicantcan be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. A student who desires accommodation for any dis- ability identified after admission must complete a request form available in the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs for evaluation with appropri-ate University entities. Appropriate and reasonableaccommodation will be provided, as necessary. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCED DENT AL EDUCA TION PROGRAM S/POSTDOCTORAL PROGRAMS An appropriate degree from an accredited college or university is required for admission into the Advanced Dental Education Programs and postgraduateprograms. A doctoral degree in dentistry (Doctor ofDental Surgery or Doctor of Dental Medicine) or theequivalent is required for admission to all programs.

CODE OF ETHICS Aschool of dentistry is a place where the professionals of tomorrow are selected and trained in the develop - ment of professional and ethical attitudes that are con - sistent with the highest goals of the profession. It is for this purpose that the School of Dentistry has a code of ethics. This code is a means of educating and training the future dentist in areas of professional ethical activity,and is a means of developing an ethical and moralawareness that will help the individual serve the public and the profession in an enlightened manner. The Code of Ethics of the School of Dentistry as found in its entire - ty in the Student Handbook 2002 shall apply to all stu - dents in the school\u2014including dental hygiene, dentistry, international, graduate, and certificate students. In addi - tion, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars, and exchange students involved in school advanced-educa tion programs shall also be subject to all school policies. THE SCHOOLS 99 STUDENT ASSOCIATION Membership in the Dental Students Association is open to all students. The objectives of the organi- zation include creating a common bond among stu-dents\u2014orienting them to organized dentistry, encour-aging and fostering missionary activities, stimulatinginterest in current scientific development, providingprograms of broad academic scope, promoting stu- dents' various interests, and providing social activities for students. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES Conventions The annual Alumni-Student Convention, spon- sored since 1960 by the Alumni Association, givesopportunity for students to meet alumni and hear pre-sentations by prominent guest lecturers in dentistry. Students have the opportunity to make research presentations in the form of table clinics. The winners are then invited to present their table clinics at stateand national dental conventions. A dedication service is held during the conven- tion, giving students an opportunity to dedicate theirprofessional life to Christ. First-year students (D1) arepresented with personalized Bibles; graduating stu-dents (D4) are given personalized lab coats. Academic Information REGISTRA TION The student must register on or before the dates designated by the Office of University Records. Early registration is encouraged. Registrationprocedures include recording information on formsfurnished by the Office of University Records, clearingfinancial arrangements with Student Finance,completing requirements of the Student HealthService, and having student identification picturestaken. Late registration is permissible only in case of a compelling reason; a charge is made if registration isnot completed by the designated dates. The studentmay not attend class without being registered, and inno case may registration take place later than the first week of the term. A change in registration after the second week affects the grade record. A student maynot concurrently register for courses in another schoolof the University without permission of the associate dean for academic affairs. ATTENDANCE Regular atttendance at all appointments (class, clin - ic, laboratory, chapel) is required beginning with the first day of each term. a pattern of absence maybe referred to the Academic Review Committee forconsideration and action. LENGTH OF ACADEMIC RESIDENCE To fulfill the requirement pertaining to length of aca - demic residence, the student must be registered for a full course load at the University for the entire senioryear for the Bachelor of Science degree; and the entire D3 and D4 years for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. DEAN'S LIST Outstanding academic performance will be reward- ed by publication of the Dean's List each quarter. The eligibility requirements are: complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the quarter; achieve a term grade-point average of at least 3.5 with no grade lower than a B-; receive no Incomplete grades on the grade report. SPECIAL EXAMINATION No provision is made for quizzes or examinations missed because of voluntary absences. An exception is made in the case of a disabling disease or other compelling emergency . An excused absence must be signed by a student health physician or the associate dean for student affairs and must be presented to the instructorwithin three days of the absence. To take an examination at a time other than that for which it is scheduled, thestudent must secure in advance the consent of both the instructor and the associate dean for academic affairs. REPEA TING/REMEDIA TING A COURSE If a student receives an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for him/her to do additional work. Based on the original grade earnedby the student, and upon the recommendation of theAcademic Review Committee, one of the following planswill be pursued: 1.For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades) the student must reregister for the course, review the course work independently,repeat required assignments or quizzes, and takeany or all course examinations as required by thecourse director. The highest grade allowed for aremediated course is C. At the discretion of theAcademic Review Committee and course director , the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering. 2.For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory , and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. Both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student' s permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade- point average.

Membership of each committee consists of the associate dean for aca- demic affairs, the associate dean for student affairs, theassociate dean for admissions, and the course directorsof all courses required of the respective class in the aca-demic year . The associate dean for clinic administration and primary attending faculty are members of the D3/D4 Academic Review Committee. In addition, eachcommittee has two student members appointed by thedean in consultation with the DSA officers. Student committee members will be in the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed. The Academic Review Committees meet once per quarter to evaluate student academic and clinical per-formance and progress records. Students whose perform - ance does not meet the stated academic standards and students who are being considered for discontinuationmay be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate candidates for promotion, academic proba-tion, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as well as stu-dents who should receive special recognition for academ-ic excellence. The process for evaluation of academic perform- ance is as follows: 1. The Academic Review Committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identifies students whose academic and/or clinicalperformance is below acceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for student affairs notifies a stu- dent facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a meeting called for the pur- pose of allowing the student to appear before thecommittee to present reasons why action should notbe taken. The Academic Review Committee consid-ers the student's presentation and all available infor-mation before making a recommendation. 3. The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options: Academic probation Remedial action Academic leave of absenceAcademic discontinuation Please refer to Academic Disciplinary Policy formore specific descriptions regarding each academ - ic sanction. 4. Appeals of Academic Review Committee decisions may be appealed to the dean. Such appeals are notexpected to be routine and should be consideredonly in circumstances where new and relevant infor-mation exists that was not available for considera-tion by the Academic Review Committee. The deanwill review the matter and either render a decisionor appoint a three-member ad hoc committee.Members of this committee will not have beeninvolved in the Academic Review Committee deci-sion process. The ad hoc committee will determinewhether the process was appropriately followed,review new information, and judge whether therecord supports the decision. They will report theirfindings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appealing student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinicalassignments during the appeal proceedings. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINAR Y POLICY Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is given an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by memorandum to the student. Criteria for placement on academic probation A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Term or cumulative grade-point average (G.P.A.) below 2.0. 2. Failing (F/U) or unsatisfactory (D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree.THE SCHOOLS 101 3. Clinical performance below minimum expected for current academic level. 4. Social/behavioral/ethical problems that significant- ly impact academic and/or clinical performance. Level of academic probation The level of academic probation indicates the seri- ousness of the cumulative academic deficiency.However, depending on the seriousness or nature ofthe academic deficiency, a student may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level 1 First term on academic probation. Level 2 Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. Level 2 EXCEPTION: Continued academic proba- tion due to failing grade in a course thatcannot be repeated until a later term. Level 3 Third term on academic probation, consec- utive or nonconsecutive. If a student is unable to remove academic probationarystatus within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinua-tion. Level 3 EXCEPTION: Continued academic proba- tion due to failing grade in a course thatcannot be repeated until a later term. Level 4 If a student meets criteria for academic pro - bation for a fourth term, consecutive or non - consecutive, s/he will be considered for aca- demic discontinuation. Conditions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1. May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2.May not take any elective courses. 3.May not participate in any elective off-campus service learning or mission activities. 4.Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have been ful- filled, unless the student is discontinued. Remedial action As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action may consist of: 1.counseling, tutoring; and/or repeating assignments, or course work, or completing additional assignments or coourse work possibly including repeating anacademic year or portion thereof. 2. Other specified requirements. Academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specified period of time during which the student is withdrawn from the academic program. Upon request to and approval by the Academic Review Committee, the student may returnto the program at a year/term level specified by thecommittee. The student may be requested to fulfill spe-cific requirements prior to reentering the academic pro-gram. Guidelines for placement on academic leave of absence The following are guidelines for selection of aca- demic leave of absence as the academic sanctiondeemed best to aid the student in ultimately becominga competent dentist or dental hygienist. Academic leave of absence may be considered for a student whois in one or more of the following situations: Student has a serious academic deficit that cannot be removed while continuing with current course work. At the end of the academic year, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the next academicyear. Student has three consecutive quarters on academic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Examination on schedule after two attempts andrequires full study time to prepare for the NationalBoard Examination. Student fulfills criteria for academic discontinuation yet shows promise for future success despite current deficiencies. Return from an academic leave of absence requires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the associate dean for academic affairs. The studentmust meet the requirements for readmission specified bythe Academic Review Committee at the time the leave ofabsence was granted. The requirements for readmissionmay also be reviewed by the Academic ReviewCommittee. Academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are as fol - lows: D1 Year Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulativeG.P.A. Three consecutive quarters on academic probation.

STUDENT -INITIA TED ACADEMIC GRIEV ANCE PROCEDURE If a student wishes to contest a grade, s/he should discuss the grade first with the instructor , where appropriate; then with the course director, if applicable; and finally with the department chair. Ifthe student is not satisfied, s/he may then appeal to the associate dean for academic affairs (for further discussion of the academic grievance process, seeLoma Linda University Student Handbook ). SERVICE LEARNING The Service Learning Program at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry continues the original purpose of the school\u2014to train dental healthprofessionals to provide service to underservedpopulations, both locally and abroad. Field experience for students of dentistry and den- tal hygiene includes extramural opportunities withinthe U.S. and in foreign countries. In addition to pro-viding clinical treatment, service-learning experiencesinclude local health fairs and elementary school dentalhealth presentations. Service experiences may lastfrom one day to several weeks.All dental and dental hygiene students are required to complete assigned service-learning rota-tions and minimum clock hours as described in eachprogram. Students are also required to be in good and regu- lar standing to be eligible to participate in electiveinternational service-learning experiences. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and alliedhealth curricula, the School of Dentistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching basic sciences, the Alumni Hall for Basic Sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teach- ers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to den-tistry occupy the School of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. Webster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall, facing the University Church and adjacent to the Medical Center . The facili- ties effectively accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service pro-grams. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the student with initiativeand willingness to develop individual capacity to thefullest extent. Students find varied opportunities forserving and learning in the immediate University com - munity, in school-sponsored service-learning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volun-teer programs. BASIC SCIENCES DEP ARTMENTS SERVING THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTR Y The Loma Linda University departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry and microbiology, andphysiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serve as the foundation for the dentalsciences by leading toward an understanding of normalstructure and function, as well as introducing the basisfor pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the first year of the dental hygiene and the first two years of the general dentistrycurricula as parts of three conceptually integratedsequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, inanatomy , and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biol-ogy. Students are encouraged to extend their knowl-edge and apply it for their own well-being and for the well-being of their patients. The Department of Anatomy provides students with the opportunity to learn the fundamental mor - phology of the human body, including gross anatomy, histology , neuroanatomy , and embryology . The Department of Biochemistry enables students to learn the fundamentals of biochemistry as theyapply to the practice of dentistry. The Department of Physiology and Pharmacology enables the student to describe the normal physiologi-cal functions of the major body systems as they relateto the mastery of dentistry; and to apply the principlesTHE SCHOOLS 103 and basic concepts of drug action, safety, and disposi- tion. This basic science focus provides a basic fund of knowledge that is essential for the practice of dentistryand dental hygiene. The faculty are dedicated to pro-viding students with tools that expand their thinkingand challenge them to ask probing questions and to earnestly search for answers. Their aim is to prepare students to excel scientifically. The higher aim is, through the Christian atmosphere of this University, toprepare students to become truly compassionate den-tists. Financial Information FINANCIAL POLICIES The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by thedean. Any statement by individual faculty members,program directors, or department chairs in regard tothese matters is not binding on the school or theUniversity unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, thestudent should be prepared to make these paymentsduring scheduled registration for each academic year.There may be adjustments in tuition and fees aseconomic conditions warrant. GENERAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year . Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have beensettled.

Roger Hadley , M.D. Dean, School of Medicine School Foundations HISTORY The professional curriculum in medicine, usually requiring four academic years of study and experi- ence in a university and hospital setting, was firstoffered at Loma Linda University in 1909. More thannine decades later , the events since 1909 seem blurred by the rapid changes that institutions of higher learn- ing experience in an effort to keep pace with the growth of knowledge. SINCE 1909 The first two years of medicine were always taught on the Loma Linda campus. From 1913 to the mid- 1960s, the third and fourth years were taught in Los Angeles at what is now White Memorial Medical Center (the first part of which was built in 1918) and at near-by Los Angeles County Hospital (now Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center). Construction of LomaLinda University Medical Center (inclusive of clinical,teaching, and research facilities) allowed the entirefour-year curriculum to be offered on and near the Loma Linda campus, beginning with school year 1966-67. The medical center was occupied in July 1967.Our Mission The mission of the School of Medicine is to continue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). PREPARING THE PHYSICIAN Our overriding purpose is to foster the formation of Christian physicians, providing whole-person care to individuals, families, and communities. Fulfillingthis responsibility requires: Education Creating an environment in which medical stu- dents, graduate students, and residents will acquirethe knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes appropriateto Christian health professionals and scholars. Research Cultivating a creative environment for inquiry and discovery of new routes to wholeness through basicand clinical research. Service Providing timely access to cost-effective, compre- hen-sive, whole-person care for all patients, regardlessof their circumstances or status. Developing the whole person Affirming the Christian view of wholeness\u2014which recognizes that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body, and that the development of stu-dents involves more than the training of the mind;promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritualgrowth in our faculty and our students; and transform - ing our daily activities into personal ministries. Reaching the world Providing whole-person care wherever the opportu- nity arises; participating with the world community inthe provision of local medical education; providing inter-national physicians and scientists the opportunities forprofessional interaction and enrichment; sharing thegood news of a loving God as demonstrated by the lifeand teachings of Jesus Christ\u2014these are the goals of thestudents, faculty , and graduates of the School of Medicine. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation,and graduation. Section III gives the general setting forthe programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important toreview specific program requirements (Section IV) inthe context of the general requirements (Section III)applicable to all programs. Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the THE SCHOOLS 109 schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experienceoffered by this University. The admissions committeesof the school accomplish this by examining evidenceof scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards,and significant qualities of character and personality.Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. THE STUDY OF MEDICINE Preparation for the practice of medicine begins early in life and early in the student's schooling. The greater the aptitudes for and interests in learning widely and appreciatively in the major areas ofknowledge--the natural sciences, the humanities, the behavioral sciences--the more able and versatile thestudent is likely to become. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine looks for applicants who are best suited to fulfill the mission of the school and to successfully practice medicine. The school desires stu-dents who demonstrate ability to learn independently,to think critically, and to articulate clearly--both oral-ly and in written form--their ideas and opinions. It isimportant that students in the School of Medicinedemonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and showevidence of sensitivity to the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine puts forth considerable effort to ensure thatan applicant is qualified for medical school. The appli-cant's credentials are reviewed to assess scholastic per-formance. The committee also looks for prerequisitequalities of character and personality , potential for self-direction and the use of discriminating judgment,and dedication to the ideal of service to society. GENERAL ENTRANCE INFORMA TION Atotal of 85 semester (128 quarter) units o f credit from an accredited college is required for accept- ance by the School of Medicine.

CLEP and Pass/Fail performances are not accept- able for the required courses. The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is required. Scores older than three years will not be considered. APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND ACCEPTANCE It is important to know the specifics of the applica- tion process and to begin the application process well in advance of the date of anticipated (or desired)entrance to medical school. Where to write The School of Medicine is a member of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Applications must be submitted throughAMCAS. Their application is available on the web at<www.aamc.org/students/amcas/application.htm>. Deadline Application should be made directly to AMCAS between June 1 and November 1 for entry in August ofthe following year . Fees The AMCAS fee is required each time an applica- tion is submitted. An additional fee to the School of Medicine is required with each supplementary applica - tion. Procedure The application procedure is as follows: l.The applicant submits a formal application to AMCAS, with fee and requested transcripts. The applicant's evaluated data are forwarded to theSchool of Medicine by AMCAS. 2.When the application is received from AMCAS, Loma Linda University School of Medicine requests completion of a supplementary applica-tion and reference forms. The prospective studentshould provide evidence of exposure to healthcare through personal involvement, or in other ways confirming the applicant's decision to become a physician. 3. After the supplementary application and letters of reference have been submitted and reviewed, theapplicant may be invited for an interview. 4.The information submitted by the applicant through AMCAS, the supplementary application, the letters of reference, and the interview reportsare then evaluated by the Admissions Committeeof the School of Medicine. This committee deter-mines whether an applicant is accepted or reject - ed. All applicants are notified of the final decision of the Admissions Committee regarding theirapplication. Acceptance notices are sent to regu - lar applicants beginning December of the year pre - ceding admission to the School of Medicine, con - tinuing until the class is filled. 5. The accepted applicant sends a written acceptance of his/her offer of admission as a student, together110 UNIVERSITY CATALOG with a $100 acceptance deposit, by the announced date (about thirty days after the notification ofacceptance). This deposit is refundable until May 15of the year in which the student has been acceptedfor entry. In summary, the Admissions Office requests the following: Loma Linda University School of Medicine sec- ondary application and $75.00 application fee. Appraisal of the applicant's character, ability, and suitability for a medical career by persons knowl-edgeable about the applicant's past performance. A preprofessional recommendation packet, if available, from the applicant's undergraduate col-lege/university. Applicant's availability for interviews. Pre-entrance health requirement and health insurance Students must meet the immunization require- ments as stated. In addition, students are expected tohave routine dental and medical care and elective sur-gery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with a health insurance policy through the University'sDepartment of Risk Management. This policy remainsin effect for students who are regularly enrolled, pro-vided they register and pay tuition and fees on timeeach quarter. Since the maximum benefit of the policy(as of the time this CATALOG went to press) is $100,000 and does not cover preexisting illnesses ordental or optical care, students are encouraged to maintain a personal, current policy that covers preex - isting illnesses and/or has a higher benefit. A studentwho does not have health insurance coverage forhis/her spouse/children will need to purchase itthrough the University' s Department of Risk Manage- ment at the time of registration. Government regula - tions prohibit the use of student loan funds to provide medical insurance or services for a student's spouse orchildren. Students who wish to review a copy of the current student health plan or have further questions aboutthe plan should call Risk Management (909/558-4386).Annual tuition also covers the cost of disability insur - ance. Details will be presented during orientation orupon request.

It is the responsibility of students to check their e-mail and mailboxes and the bulletin board daily . REQUIRED SUPPLIES Microscope The student is expected to have access to a satis- factory compound microscope (usually one rentedfrom the school) that meets the following require-ments: The microscope shall be no older than fifteen years. The lenses shall be in good condition and shall include scanning and oil-immersion objectives. The equipment shall include an Abbe condenser with rack and pinion adjustment, an irisdiaphragm, and a mechanical stage. Textbooks Students are required to purchase the textbooks adopted by the School of Medicine CurriculumCommittee. Instruments Students are required to purchase the instruments adopted by the physical diagnosis course. PRACTICES AND REGULATIONS Length of academic residence To fulfill the degree requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, it is the usual policy that the student must be registered for full-time course work during the entire junior and senior academic years for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Course exemptions Students who seek exemption from registering for courses that they took prior to entering the School ofMedicine must qualify for the exemption by passing acomprehensive examination covering the course mate-rial in question. Should the student qualify, in lieu of the regular course the student will be required to participate in anadvanced program that may include additional studies,research activities, and/or teaching. A written paperwill be required from all students completing theadvanced program. The course director, the associate dean of educa- tional affairs, and the student will work together todetermine the content of the advanced program. Fulltuition, equivalent to that of the regular program, willbe charged. Examinations Students must take examinations at the scheduled time. Students who arrive more than 15 minutes lateto an examination\u2014or after another student has leftduring the examination for any reason\u2014will be deniedthe opportunity to take the examination. Should a student miss an examination because of an excused absence, the examination cannot be madeup at a later time. Instead, the comprehensive finalexamination in the course for which the missed exami-nation occurred will be weighted an amount extra, proportional to the weighting of the missed examina- tion(s). In addition, course directors may require otherremediation at their discretion. In order to have an excused absence, the student must obtain a written excuse from the Office of the Dean prior to the administration of the test in ques - tion. This written excuse must then be provided to thecourse director. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide documentation fromStudent Health that they were indeed ill. Whether ornot this documentation is an adequate excuse formissing an examination will be left to the discretion ofthe Office of the Dean.112 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Students who miss examinations without prior approval from the Office of the Dean have an unex-cused absence. As a result, the student will receive azero for the missed examination(s). In the event of a bona fide emergency, where prior approval is not feasible, the Office of the Dean must becontacted as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. Grading policy Course directors submit grades at the end of the course, indicating the overall evaluation of the stu- dent's performance in the course. The grade reflects the success or failure of the student in meeting theobjectives of the course in terms of knowledge, skills,attitudes, and values. The grade will be recorded as SATISFACTORY if the student exceeded the minimum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be UNSATISFACTORY if the student did not meet the minimum requirements for overall per- formance. The grade assigned will be MARGINAL PASS if the student met but did not exceed the minimumrequirements for overall performance. Complete promotion and retention policies are distributed to each class at orientation. Class standing Class standing is determined by the Office of the Associate Dean for Educational Affairs and is based on student performance on in-house, faculty-generatedexaminations and on NBME subject examinations. Promotion Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic performance. Both cognitive and noncognitive evalua-tions of academic performance\u2014as well as assessmentof personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession\u2014are utilized in making promo- tion decisions. The Academic Review Committee ofthe School of Medicine periodically reviews studentperformance and progress and recommends promo-tion, retention, or dismissal on the basis of the overallacademic record. The Student Handbook contains additional details regarding the criteria used by theAcademic Review Committee for promotion decisions. Academic probation Students whose cumulative academic record at the end of any academic year is less than satisfactoryare placed on academic probation. Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must file a Change of Program form; to completely withdrawfrom school, a Total Withdrawal form must be com-pleted. These forms should be completed and submit - ted on the last day of class attendance. The date of withdrawal used in calculating tuition refunds will bethe date on which the properly completed form is sub - mitted to the Office of University Records. USMLE Steps I and II policy States vary in the number of times a student can attempt USMLE examinations and still be eligible forlicensure. A significant number of states allow nomore than three attempts. The school has defined itsown limits for number of attempts allowed. Our policyrequires students enrolled in the Loma LindaUniversity School of Medicine to pass Step I in nomore than three tries.Students must complete the clinical course work required for graduation within three years of startingthe clinical curriculum; they are permitted a maxi-mum of four sequential attempts to pass Step II of theUSMLE. The student's first attempt at passing Step IIof the USMLE must take place only after s/he has satis-factorily passed all junior clerkships and prior to his/her completion of all required senior clinical course work. A student who has failed Step II but who has com- pleted all course curriculum requirements mustremain enrolled in the School of Medicine as a direct-ed-study student until s/he either has passed Step II ofthe USMLE or failed Step II of the USMLE for thefourth time. During this directed study, the studentwill be charged tuition. DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DEGREE The School of Medicine requires that a candidate must have met the following requirements for the Doctor of Medicine degree: Completed all requirements for admission. Attended an accredited medical school for four academic years, the last two of which must havebeen spent at this school. Completed honorably all requirements of the cur- riculum, including specified attendance, level ofscholarship, length of academic residence, andcredit units.

Given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistentresponsiveness to the established aims of theUniversity and of the school. Discharged financial obligations to the University. The candidate is required to participate in gradua- tion exercises upon completion of the academic pro-gram. If the candidate is out of sequence with his/her current class but would like to participate in the com- mencement exercises, s/he must have completed aminimum of three months of the required senior clerk-ships, i.e., medicine, surgery, family medicine, neurolo- gy, ambulatory care, and intensive care/emergency medicine by April 1 of the year of graduation. Consentfor the student to be absent, granted by the chancellorof the University, is contingent on the recommendationof the dean to the chancellor . The families and friends of graduates are invited to be present at the official Conferring of Degrees service. COMBINED-GRADUATE-DEGREES PROGRAMS Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine andmedical research may wish to enroll in one of the com-bined-degrees programs:THE SCHOOLS 113 MEDICAL SCIENTIST PROGRAM (M.D./PH.D.)\u2014SM/GS The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides studentswith a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered jointly by the School of Medicine and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. During the first threeyears of the program, students follow an integratedcurriculum that includes medical courses, graduateeducation, and research training. In the first year thecurriculum includes a course sequence\u2014taught by aninterdisciplinary faculty\u2014that integrates aspects of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, cellphysiology, and cell and molecular ultrastructure intoa rigorous survey of cellular biology. In addition to thisfoundation, students learn of new developments in the basic sciences and biomedical sciences through weekly seminars and monthly correlative sessions. Duringsubsequent years, formal courses continue to broaden and integrate into a meaningful whole an understanding of the clinical consequences of cellularevents. Beginning in the fourth year and continuing for two or more years, students pursue full-time researchon a project of their own design within the graduateprograms of human anatomy , bio chemistry , microbiol - ogy and molecular genetics, physiology , or pharmacolo- gy. Research training within these programs is availablein nationally recognized research laboratories in the School of Medicine. After completing the Ph.D. degree,students return to the medical curriculum for the twoyears of clinical training required to obtain the Doctorof Medicine degree. For acceptance into the Medical Scientist Program, graduation from an accredited college isrequired. Students must simultaneously submit appli-cations to the School of Medicine and the Faculty ofGraduate Studies. Scores on the general test of theGraduate Record Examination are required. TheDepartment of Biochemistry requires and theDepartment of Physiology and Pharmacology recom-mends a basic course in calculus and two quarters ofphysical chemistry . Students who have completed at least 8 units in biochemistry may qualify for reduced biochemistry course work in the Medical ScientistProgram. For information regarding tuition waivers and scholarships, contact the director of the Medical Scientist Program. COMBINED DEGREES (M.D./M.S. OR M.D./PH.D.)\u2014SM/GS The M.D./Ph.D. Combined-Degrees Program may be obtained through the School of Medicine. It and includes many of the features of the Medical Scientist Program. Students in the combined-degrees programcomplete the first two years of the standard medicalcurriculum. This is followed by three or more years ofgraduate course work and research to qualify for aPh.D. degree, or at least one year for an M.S. degree,before commencing the last two years of the medicalschool curriculum\u2014the clinical training\u2014for theDoctor of Medicine degree. Majors are offered in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and moleculargenetics, physiology, or pharmacology. For the M.D./M.S. and M.D./Ph.D. Combined- Degrees Programs, the prerequisites and GraduateRecord Examination requirements are similar to thosedescribed for the Medical Scientist Program, except that biochemistry is not required. LICENSING EXAMINATIONS National The graduate who holds credentials from the USMLE may be granted a license by endorsement ofthe examining board of most states. Additionalrequirements made by some states are given in a pam-phlet that may be obtained from the Office of the Deanor from the Federation of State Medical Boards, 400 Fuller Wiser Road, Suite 300, Euless, TX 76039-3855.

Helen Emori King, PhD, RN Dean, School of Nursing School Foundations HISTORY The School of Nursing, established in 1905, was the first in a group of schools which in 1961 became Loma Linda University. In 1907 the first class tograduate included seven students\u2014five women andtwo men. In 1949 the School of Nursing became a college-based program granting the baccalaureate degree. The first master's degrees in nursing weregranted in 1957. The Associate in Science degree program was begun as an integral part of the school in 1970. The School of Nursing received its firstaccreditation by the National League for Nursing(NLN) (61 Broadway, New York, NY 10006) in 1951.The most recent accreditations were by thetheCommission on Collegiate Nursing Education (OneDupont Circle NW , Suite 530, Washington, DC 20036- 1120) in 1999; and the California Board of RegisteredNursing (1170 Durfee Avenue, Suite G, South El Monte, CA 91733) in 2003. Our Mission The mission of the School of Nursing, in accord with the comprehensive mission of Loma Linda University, is the education of professional nurses whoare dedicated to excellence in nursing science.Individuals from diverse ethnic, cultural, and racialbackgrounds are encouraged to embrace opportunitiesfor lifelong growth and satisfaction from a careercommitted to health care. Baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs contribute to the development of expert clinicians, educators, administrators, andresearchers who benefit society by providing and improving delivery of whole-person care to clients\u2014individuals, families, groups, and communities. Committed to Christian service and distinctive Seventh-day Adventist ideals, the school seeks to reflect God' s love through its teaching and healing ministry. GOAL OF UNDERGRADUA TE PROGRAM The goal of the undergraduate program is to prepare competent nurses who are committed to compassionate, Christian service. Upon completion of the baccalaureate degree program, the nurse will beable to: 1. Think critically and use systematic planning processes in assisting clients to achieve and maintain optimal wellness. 2. Respect the uniqueness of individuals from physi - ological, psychological, sociocultural, develop- mental, and spiritual perspectives; and recognizethe individual' s right of self-determination. 3.

Nursing functions to assist individuals and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness.Through a variety of roles, nurses put into practice abody of knowledge and a repertoire of skills to assistthe human system with health problems. The School of Nursing provides an environment in which studentsand faculty can grow in professional competence andChristian grace. PHILOSOPHY OF NURSING EDUCATION In support of the philosophy, mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the philosophy, mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirmsthe following beliefs: Learning is an interactive process that involves all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the development of potential, promotes maturation of values,cultivates the ability to think critically andindependently, and encourages a spirit of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the development of professional and technical nursing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual variables on their lives\u2014learn in different ways and bring differentmeanings to the learning experience.

Academic Policies and Practices ACADEMIC RESIDENCE To qualify for an Associate in Science degree from Loma Linda University , the student must take a minimum of 24 units while in residence at the University; to qualify for a Bachelor of Science degreefrom Loma Linda University, the student must take aminimum of 32 of the last 48 units\u2014or a minimum of45 total units\u2014while in residence. A minimum ofthree clinical nursing courses is required as part ofthese units. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for computinggrades: 94 -100% A 91 - 93% A- 88 - 90% B+ 85 - 87% - 67% DBelow 62% F NURSING COURSES Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate cur- riculum are divided into approximately equal compo-nents of theory and clinical laboratory practice. Agrade for a nursing course represents a combination ofthe theory and the clinical laboratory grades. In orderto pass a nursing course, a student must receive agrade equivalent to a C or above in both the theoryand clinical laboratory sections of the course. A grade of C- or below places the student on provisional statusand the course must be repeated. Clinical laboratory Laboratory assignment is under the direction of the instructor. In this assignment the student hassupervised experience in the care of patients.Tardiness or unexcused absences from clinical labora-tory is cause for failure. Absences due to extenuatingcircumstances (e.g., personal illness or death in thefamily) must be made up. When a clinical laboratory is made up during nonclinical time, there is a $50 make- up fee. Clinical practice Nursing students are required to practice in client-care settings under the supervision of a regis-tered nurse. Each student will be expected to be able to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinical practice by assessing; planning; implementing nursing proce-dures; and evaluating the care of individuals, families, and communities. In the performance of routine nurs- ing care, all students will function within the policiesof the clinical agency and demonstrate the professionalbehavior outlined in the University CATALOG and University Student Handbook. Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for careprior to actually giving care: They must come preparedfor the clinical experience and must adequately assessa client using the Neuman-Systems Model. Studentsare expected to perform skills safely . Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may be dropped from the clinical course. Repeating a course Any nursing course or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School ofNursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower mustbe repeated before the student can progress to anothercourse. When a student repeats a course, both the origi-nal and repeat grades are entered on the student' s per- manent record; but only the repeat grade and credit arecomputed in the grade point average and included inthe total units earned. Named cognates are: biochemistry , developmental psychology, epidemiology, ethics, nutrition, sociology, and statistics. Withdrawing from a course A nursing student may withdraw only once from a nursing or named cognate course. A student may with-draw (W), failing, from no more than two quarters. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION Challenge/equivalency examinations An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examinations in the course. Undergraduate students with prior education in nurs - ing or in another health care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California statelicensure. The applicant's background in health caretheory and clinical experience must be commensuratewith the theory and skills required for the course. THE SCHOOLS 127 To be eligible to write the NCLECX-RN examina- tion, the student must have completed all requirednursing course work listed in this CATALOG . Further, the student needs to be aware that, under the laws ofCalifornia, a candidate for the examination is requiredto report all misdemeanor and felony convictions. If acandidate has a criminal history, the California Board of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination covering theoryand an examination of clinical competence. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion of thechallenge examination. A grade of S is recorded forchallenge credit earned by examination only after thestudent has successfully completed a minimum of 12units of credit at this University with a G.P.A. of 2.0 or above. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. For further information, see the \"Schedule ofCharges.\" Advanced Placement Program Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the school for an entering student who has passed one or more examinations of the Advanced Placement (AP)Program with a score of 3, 4, or 5. ACADEMIC PROGRESSION Progression is contingent on satisfactory scholastic and clinical performance and the student' s respon - siveness to the established aims of the school and the nursing profession. Students are considered to be making satisfactory progress as long as they maintain a C average (2.0G.P.A.) and complete the total number of units required per year: YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL 1st 29 2nd 48 3rd 96 4th 144 5th 193 Probation status and dismissal Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 2.0 for undergraduate students and 3.0 for graduate students are placed on academic probation, and the number of units for subsequent reg-istrations is restricted to a maximum of 12 units perquarter. Students with 2 quarters of unsatisfactory per- formance jeopardize their standing in a degree or cer- tificate program. For undergraduate students a grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognatecourses. Required cognates include: biochemistry , devel - opmental psychology, epidemiology, ethics, nutrition, sociology, and statistics. Each nursing course and/orrequired cognate taken while enrolled at Loma Linda University in which a student receives a C- or below mustbe repeated. A nursing course or required cognate maybe repeated only once. A student with a C- or below in anursing or required cognate is placed on probation. A student on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 under the supervision of the LearningAssistance Program (LAP) and to communicate regu -larly with the academic adviser. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at atime. When the course work has been repeated suc-cessfully, the probation status is removed and the stu-dent is returned to regular status.

Section III gives the general setting forthe programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important toreview specific program requirements (Section IV) inthe context of the general requirements (Section III) applicable to all programs. Admissions Information The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and iscapable of profiting from the educational experienceoffered by this University . The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidenceof scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards,and significant qualities of character and personality . Applicants are considered for admission only on therecommendation of the program in which study isdesired. Prerequisites for admission Applicants given preference will have successfully completed a baccalaureate degree in chemistry, biolo-gy, physics, or a related scientific field. The minimumrequirement for acceptance without the B.S. or B.A. degree is completion of the 60 semester- or 105 quar- ter-credit prepharmacy program (see Prerequisite course requirements). This usually requires two-to- three years of college-level study. Students who already have a bachelor' s degree must insure that all of the prepharmacy requirements in the sciences, mathematics, and general education(communication, humanities/fine arts, and social sci-ences/behavioral studies) have been completed. In order for a course to fulfill the biology and chemistry prerequisites, it must be at the level of those requiredfor a major in the field; introductory courses are notacceptable.

Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook 2002 more comprehensively addresses University and schoolexpectations, regulations, and policies and is availableto each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to aparticular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. The School of Pharmacy prepares a school-specif - ic Student Handbook, which is provided to all stu- dents. Regulations, policies, procedures, and other pro- gram requirements are contained in this handbook. Academic Policies and General Regulations EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION The School of Pharmacy participates in the California Board of Pharmacy's approved 1,500- hour Supervised Experiential Program. This programhelps to fulfill part of the requirements that studentsmust meet in order to take the California PharmacistLicensure Examination or the North AmericanPharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX).Successfully completing the School of Pharmacy's didactic experiential programs, and successfullypassing the California and/or NAPLEX examination,allows a student to become a registered pharmacist(RPh). The experiential program consists of a variety of early, intermediate, and advanced experiences designed to provide the student with professional experience through the use of a structured and super- vised program of study. Students participating in theexperiential program will receive a Loma LindaUniversity School of Pharmacy Experiential Program Manual. Guidelines and policies are listed in this man- ual and must be adhered to for successful completionof the program. Didactic education is a systematic approach intended to convey instruction and information (class-room, laboratory, recitation, etc.). Experiential educa- tion is related to or derived from providing experi- ences in real-life professional settings. In pharmacyeducation, the experiential component is designed toprovide in-depth exposure to and active participationin selected pharmacy-practice settings. Pharmacy stu- dents are exposed to prescription processing, com - pounding, documenting services, obtaining drug histo-ries, drug-therapy monitoring, counseling, evaluatingdrug usage, drug-distribution systems, and other rele-vant pharmacy-practice activities. Under the philosophy of pharmaceutical care, the School of Pharmacy offers early and intermediateexperiential courses that support students' growth,strengthen their self-confidence, and prepare them tofunction as self-directed learners. The advanced-practice experiences are designed to help studentsintegrate and refine the skills learned in the first threeyears of pharmacy (didactic) course work. The ultimate goal of the experiential program is to produce well-rounded, competent, caring, responsible,professionals who can deliver exemplary pharmaceuti-cal care, as well as effectively communicate withdiverse patients and colleagues. In order to complete the curriculum successfully, graduate from the School of Pharmacy, and become alicensed pharmacist, the student is required to com-plete a minimum of 1,500 hours of practice experi - ences. The director of experiential education coordi the three school-based levels of edu- cation and also assists with the state-mandated experi-ence (internship) described below. INTRODUCTORY PHARMACY-PRACTICE EXPERIENCES (IPPE) The goal of the introductory experiential education is to expose students to practitioners who provide pharmaceutical care. Under the tutelage of a School of Pharmacy preceptor , who is also a licensed pharmacist, the student may have some exposure to direct patient care. This early exposure helps the student become familiar with the health careenvironment, learn the unwritten rules of how tonavigate in a busy practice setting, and begindeveloping the confidence that will be required infuture clinical experiences.THE SCHOOLS 135 ADVANCED PHARMACY-PRACTICE EXPERIENCES (APPE) Students are required to complete six, six-week advanced practice experiences in specific clinical areas. Four will be in required fields: ambulatory care;community practice; internal medicine; and a specialty population (pediatrics, psychiatry, or geriatrics). Two experiences will be in elective fields (see curriculum section). PREREQUISITES FOR APPE In order to progress to the advanced pharmacy- practice experiences, a student must meet the following requirements: Assessment examination: Students must pass the PY3 end-of-year PY4 standing: Students must achieve PY4 stand- ing, as defined by the School of Pharmacy. TheOffice of Student and Professional Affairs will noti- fy the director of experiential education when stu- dents successfully complete all PY3 work, includ-ing seminar attendance. Immunizations: Students must safeguard them- selves and be sure that all University-requiredimmunizations are up to date. Students areresponsible for keeping the records of their ownimmunizations accessible. For the protection ofpatients and the students themselves, it is highlyrecommended that students receive the influenzavaccine in October during their PY4 year . Some sites may require this immunization. Tuberculosis screening: Students must be screened and cleared for tuberculosis (complete aPPD test or chest x-ray) during July of the PY4year (immediately before starting the advancedpractice experiences in August). A record of thisclearance must be on file in the office of the direc - tor of experiential education. Intern license: Students must hold a valid California Pharmacists Intern License throughoutthe advanced practice experiences. Intern hours: Students must have completed at least 150 intern hours prior to the beginning ofadvanced practice experiences. CPR/First aid: Students must hold valid certifica- tion in both CPR and first aid. Effective dates must be current through the PY4 year. Portfolio: Prior to beginning rotations, the stu- dent's professional portfolio must be up to date and must concur with the School of Pharmacy's guidelines. Background check: Facilities require a back- ground check of all personnel, including studentswho are placed on site for practice experiences. Some institutions may require the student to signa confidentiality agreement or disclosure state - ment. Student health card: Students must carry the Loma Linda University student heath insurancecard with them at all times.EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS The majority of the student's time during experien- tial courses is out-of-the-classroom activity and under the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacypreceptor. Although the student generally will be offcampus, Loma Linda University's code of conduct andthe guidelines found in this University CATALOG remain in effect throughout the pharmacy program. In addition, the following guidelines apply to all profes-sional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and excessive tardiness will not be tolerated. Students must have a working e-mail account (that is on record with the Office of ExperientialEducation and the Office of Student and Professional Affairs) and are required to check the account at least daily to keep informed of impor-tant information or announcements. All experiential-education assignments are made through the Office of Experiential Education andare the responsibility of the director of experien- tial education. No student is allowed to change rotation sites without the express written consentof the director. Switching sites without such con-sent may result in a student failing the rotation. Students are not to function as an agent or employee of the site. The student must identifyhim-/herself as a pharmacy student from theLoma Linda University School of Pharmacy. Whileparticipating in this graded experience, studentsshall not, under any circumstances, receive finan-cial remuneration from the experiential site.Failure to adhere to this policy will result in sus-pension and removal from the rotation as well asreceipt of a failing grade in the course. All financial obligations associated with the stu- dent's pharmacy education are the responsibilityof the student. These responsibilities includetransportation, food, lodging, and any other inci - dental costs related to off-site assignments. Concurrent employment during the experiential experience is not encouraged and does notexclude or excuse students from any responsibili - ties associated with course requirements. PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT Documentation of a personal philosophy, along with goals, methods for improvement, accomplish- ments, self-evaluation, and reflection are useful toolsin long-term professional development. Over the four years of the pharmacy program, students will be required to develop and keep updated a professionalportfolio. Although portfolio content may be highly individ- ualized and reflect personal aspirations and experi-ences, the School of Pharmacy will stipulate certaininclusions. The portfolio may be built to emphasizesome areas (e.g., professional service) and place littleor no emphasis on others. Ideally , it is a tool that is utilized in a periodic evaluation process. The portfolio should be considered a work in progress. There are no absolute right or wrong thingsto include. The portfolio is always a reflection of the136 UNIVERSITY CATALOG student and those activities that are building his/her professional history. As such, it provides valuableinsights into a student's thinking, planning, self-evaluation, and goal-setting activities at multiple stepsalong the journey. A variety of seminars and working groups will be used over the four-year program to help students begin and refine their portfolios. This work will occur with assistance from the student's faculty adviser and other mentor/role-model professionals. It is important to update portfolios with recent activities added on a regular basis. Some students findthat daily or at least weekly updating is advisable inorder to capture the most complete information. It isdifficult to maintain an accurate and detailed portfolioif revising is done at longer intervals. When possible,information from previous educational, personal, and work experiences should be added to the developing portfolio to set a baseline of comparison to current goals and accomplishments. The following information is often included as a part of individual portfolio sections: Philosophy statement related to area Goals for activities Performance on key assignments Methods to improve and expandSpecial recognitions/evaluations Self-evaluation/reflection PORTFOLIO CONTENT Listed below are major portfolio sections that students should consider using. The emphasis may change over time to reflect current activities. Some sections may include additional information (as shown) to supplement the general areas: Classroom learning activities Internship/Experiential activitiesProfessional Professional organizations: member/officer/ committees Conventions/meetings attended (as a officer/attendee/presenter) Projects ongoing Continuing pharmaceutical education (CPE) attended presentations/projects for the generalpublic Service/Outreach Community service/Mission efforts activities Personal development Growing spirituality\u2014in research/patient care settings Research Research/projects\u2014current/planned/completed: Clinical research Basic/bench researchResident projects Special projectsOther activities of note In addition, students will be asked to include sec- tions in their portfolio that focus on the values, mission, and goals of the School of Pharmacy.Such reflections may include the following areas: Reflections on School of Pharmacy values, mission, and goals Teaching and learning Health care team Competence Pharmaceutical careEthics and integrity Compassion and empathyHumanitarian efforts Service and outreachProfessional standards LeadershipDiversity Global community Lifelong learning Spirituality Wholeness/Wellness ResearchIntegration of physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of health Sharing knowledge with patients and health care professionals Responsible management of health care resources and the environment At the time of application to the program, stu- dents are required to prepare a personal statement,which includes comments on three of the nine valuesimportant to Loma Linda University School ofPharmacy. These values are: Competence Scholarship Integrity Global outreach Service Leadership Lifelong learning Wholeness Spirituality It is expected that the final program course\u2014 Reconnections\u2014will encourage students to share theevolution of their growth in a number of these areas. PHARMACY SEMINARS It is required that each Doctor of Pharmacy student satisfy the seminar requirement before being cleared for graduation. This activity is considered to be an enrichment that will orient the student to a broadrange of current professional issues and concerns, aswell as demonstrate the need for and foster a love forlifelong learning. Over the duration of the four-year program the following policies apply to pharmacy seminars: Each student must attend a minimum of twelve ACPE-approved continuing pharmaceutical educa- tion programs or other pharmacy seminar. At least two must be attended during each academic year of enrollment. A maximum of two seminars per meeting or con - ference may be attended to meet this require - ment. Attendance at the opening general session of aTHE SCHOOLS 137 conference cannot be used to meet this require- ment. A Pharmacy Seminar Attendance Documentation Form must be completed for each program attend-ed. This form must be turned in to the Office of Student and Professional Affairs within fourteen days of the seminar attended. The student should also keep a copy for his/her files. This seminar requirement must be met during the student's enrollment in the School of Pharmacy and isseparate from course registrations. Attendance at med- ical grand rounds outside the requirements of an expe- riential education course can be counted as part of this requirement. Seminar activities that qualify to meet this requirement are those that have received priorapproval from the Office of Student and ProfessionalAffairs. Students should check with the office before attending programs. In general: Local pharmacy association meetings are approved. State pharmacy association meetings are approved. National pharmacy association meetings are approved. LICENSURE, INTERNSHIP , AND THE CALIFORNIA ST ATE BOARD OF PHARMACY General information In order to participate in introductory and advanced pharmacy-practice experiences (IPPE andAPPE), the student must hold a current CaliforniaPharmacist Intern License. It is the responsibility ofthe Office of Student and Professional Affairs to notifythe California Board of Pharmacy of any student whodiscontinues the pursuit of his or her degree, with - draws from courses, or is dismissed from the program. Such students are also required to return their InternLicense to the board within the timeframe required bylaw. The required forms, examination dates, and licen - sure requirements are available at the California State Board of Pharmacy Web site, www.pharmacy.ca.gov.Students are strongly encouraged to visit this site on aregular basis to monitor changes. Pharmacist intern hours The California State Board of Pharmacy requires 1,500 hours of acceptable intern experience. Otherstates have different requirements (see specific criteria for each state in which licensure is desired). The School of Pharmacy's introductory and advancedpharmacy-practice experiences will fulfill 600 of thesehours. The remaining 900 hours must be completed out - side the School of Pharmacy curriculum and consist of employment in a pharmacy under the immediate,direct and personal supervision of a pharmacist. Thisexperience must be predominately related to sellingdrugs, compounding prescriptions, preparing pharma-ceutical preparations, keeping records, and makingreports required by California and federal regulations.The student is eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) aftercompleting 1,000 internship hours; but the 1,500-hourrequirement must be completed before the studentmay become licensed. The summer after the first pro-fessional year (PY1) is ideal for students who arelicensed pharmacist interns to begin to earn required intern hours. It is the individual student's responsibili- ty to ensure that all requirements for licensure are met, and also that all forms are properly completedand promptly sent to the California Board of Pharmacywithin the specified timelines. Beginning with the sec-ond professional year of study (PY2), internship hoursmay be earned during quarter breaks and the summer.They may also be earned after graduation. The following recommended schedule for complet- ing intern experiences will allow the student to obtainsufficient hours to sit for NAPLEX. It is the student's responsibility to complete the appropriate number of hours for licensure. Recommended Timetable for Earning Intern Hours (maximum) Time Possible Countable Cumu- hours in lative California TOTAL (maximum ) Summer after PY1 year 400 400 400 PY2 Christmas break 80 80 480 Summer after PY2 year 400 400 880PY3 Christmas break 80 80 960 Summer after PY3 year 80 80 1040 PY4 Christmas break 80 80 1120 Curricular practice experiences 1,720 600 1,720 After graduation As needed to reach 1500 *Currently , there is approximately a two-month period between taking the examination and receiving testresults. During this time, graduate interns can com-plete additional hours. INTERN PHARMACIST LICENSE Each first-year professional student (PY1) must submit a completed California State Board of Pharmacy Application for Registration as an Intern Pharmacist and a $65 check (made payable to theCalifornia Board of Pharmacy) to the Office of Studentand Professional Affairs\u2014see Web page <http://www. pharmacy.ca.gov/pdfs2/intern_app1ication_pkt.pdf>. This document and payment are due during studentorientation. Students are responsible for keeping their phar- macist intern license current and valid. The Board ofPharmacy must be notified of any change in address,student status, or name change. A photocopy of a validintern pharmacist license must be on file in theschool's Office of Experiential Education. 138 UNIVERSITY CATALOG LICENSURE EXAMINATION IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES To become licensed as a pharmacist in California, the student must: Be a graduate of a school of pharmacy that is accredited by the Accreditation Council onPharmaceutical Education and that is recognizedby the California State Board of Pharmacy (suchas Loma Linda University). Complete a total of 1,500 hours of acceptable intern experience (a minimum of 1,000 of thesehours must be completed in order to take theexamination). Submit proof of completion of the 1,500 hours (completed documents), along with completedInstitutional and Community ExperienceAffidavits (see www.pharmacy.ca.gov). Pass both multiple-choice and essay sections of the NAPLEX. Submit the required licensure fee. Licensure in other states is granted after the stu- dent passes the NAPLEX. Requirements for eligibilityvary from state to state and may be verified by check-ing the NABP Web site, <www.nabp.org>. with following the school's recommendationsfor obtaining intern experience, will meet the hoursneeded to sit for the NAPLEX in most states. CONTINUING PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION Successful completion of the School of Pharmacy program and passing of the licensure examination are only the first steps in becoming a professionalpharmacist. Each state requires adherence to somemethod of validation for continuing pharmaceuticaleducation (CPE) in order to maintain an active licenseto practice. Practitioners licensed in more than onestate must be sure to comply with each state'srequirements. In recognition of the importance of lifelong learn - ing, Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy has a seminar attendance requirement for graduation.Attending and reflecting upon professional programs ispart of continuing professional development (CPD). Most states define their requirements in terms of continuing education units (CEUs). In general, onehour of programming is counted as 1 hour of CPE and0.1 CEUs. In addition to attending conferences or sem-inars, other methods can be used to obtain needed credits, such as completion of self-study sections from professional journals or on-line sources. Programs that offer CPE hours must qualify and be accredited by the Accreditation Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE) or their respective state board of pharmacy . The ACPE adheres to strict standards on the types of programming acceptable forcredit and ensures that providers comply with properrecord keeping and documentation requirements. In California, registered pharmacists are required to earn 30 hours (3.0 CEUs) of continuing pharmaceu-tical education every two years and pay a fee to theCalifornia State Board of Pharmacy to keep theirlicense current. Other states may require more orfewer hours of CPE, require validation on a yearly basis, and/or stipulate specific topics in which to getcredits. The School of Pharmacy recommends that stu- dents develop the habit of regularly attending programsthat offer CPE, and that they become diligent in keep-ing track of CPE statements of credit. Such statements may be required by the state board of pharmacy, along with the periodic relicensure application and fee. E-MAIL ACCOUNTS/MESSAGES All pharmacy students are provided with a Loma Linda University e-mail account. The address will be assigned during registration. A substantial portion of the School of Pharmacy's communication will be viae-mail, and failure to receive a message because of an inactive or unchecked e-mail account is not a validexcuse. Problems that may occur with students having the same last name and first initial will be handled through the Media Services Department. Students are responsible for keeping their e-mail accounts open and accessible. A current e-mailaddress must be on file with the Office of Student andProfessional Affairs. Student should monitor, at leastdaily , their account for important messages or notices sent by the School of Pharmacy . An important notifi - cation could be sent with less than 24 hours notice. COMPUTERS As part of its educational mission, the School of Pharmacy requires the utilization of computers, computer systems, and networks. On-campus comput - ing resources are intended for University-related pur- poses, including: direct and indirect support of instruction, research and service missions, university administrative functions, student and campus-life activities, and the free exchange of ideas within the University community and among the University and thewider local, national, and global communities. The School of Pharmacy is also bound by the Appropriate Use of T echnology Policy , as described below. Students are also referred to the Loma Linda University Student Handbook for a more detailed explanation of the University's policy on computer use. TECHNOLOGY POLICY The following is intended to ensure that all members of the University computing community shall be given privacy in their work; that no one shall be subjected to abusive behavior by others using the system; that the resources available to the communityshall not be consumed by only a few individuals; and that computer resources shall not be destroyed by electronic vandalism. It should be clearly understoodthat the following points are illustrative and not all-inclusive: Only authorized persons\u2014defined as students, faculty, staff, and members of Loma Linda University-sanctioned programs\u2014may use LomaLinda University's computing (computers, printers, networks, software,THE SCHOOLS 139 etc.); and these may be used only for legitimate purposes relating to teaching, course work,research, and administration at Loma LindaUniversity. Members of an academic community are entitled to privacy in their work. It is a violation of University policy to obtain a password that belongs to someone else or to access another user's files ore-mail account on the network. These violationsare forms of theft and will not be tolerated. Accessing any file other than one's own is prohib- ited, unless that file has been made publicly accessible. Reading, writing, and editing directo- ries and/or passwords belonging to others is pro- hibited. This prohibition includes, but is not limit-ed to, files left on a floppy or hard disk, misplacedor discarded listings on storage media, etc. Posting a message under someone else's name is prohibited.

Federal law also crimi - nalizes the transportation of such materials in interstate commerce. Loma Linda University must comply with these laws and will enforce them among all students,faculty , staff, and visitors. Furthermore, the place- ment of pornographic and obscene material on aLoma Linda University computer or server is aviolation of Loma Linda University policy.Violators will be subject to the disciplinary action of expulsion and/or termination. CHAPEL, PHARMACY FORUM, AND PROFES- SIONAL DEVELOPMENT A TTENDANCE Chapel, pharmacy forum, and professional develop- ment are required activities for the School of Pharmacy . These weekly (or more frequent) events are important to the professional and spiritual growth of students. Both aspects of growth are key objectives ofthe Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy pro - gram. For the purposes of record keeping, being marked tardy twice will be counted as one absence. Honors, awards, and scholarships presented by the School ofPharmacy will use the attendance record of thoseunder consideration as one of the criteria for awards.Students who miss an excessive number of chapels,pharmacy forums, or professional development meet-ings will be ineligible to be considered for the Dean' sList, honor roll, honor society memberships, and other awards and honors. Students who have perfect attendance at chapel, pharmacy forum, and professional development willhave their names entered into an \"incentive\" drawingat the end of each quarter. CHAPEL Attendance will be taken by University officials at all chapel sessions and daily during Week of Devotion. Student marked absent from a third chapel during aquarter must go to the Del Webb Library and reviewthe tapes of all missed chapels and submit a written synopsis of each to the Office of Student and Professional Affairs within the prescribed timeframe.Throughout the academic year, this make-up requirement will also be triggered once a student hasbeen recorded as absent from five chapels. Each additional chapel missed over the limits established above will require five hours of University- chapel service activities to be completed by the stu - dent. The Office of Student and Professional Affairs, together with the dean and the University chaplain,will determine when, where, and how this service willbe performed. PHARMACY FORUM Attendance will also be taken at all pharmacy forum meetings. A second absence during any quarter may lead to a grade of U (unsatisfactory). Eachadditional pharmacy forum missed over the limitsestablished above will require five hours of School ofPharmacy service activities to be completed by thestudent. The Office of Student and Professional Affairs,together with the dean, will determine when, where,and how this service will be performed. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT Attendance will be taken at the professional development meetings. A second absence during any quarter may lead to a grade of U (unsatisfactory). Each additional professional development meeting missed over the limits estabished above will requirefive hours of School of Pharmacy service activities tobe completed by the student. The Office of Studentand Professional Affairs, together with the dean, will determine when, where, and how this service will be performed. BULLETIN BOARDS Students are responsible for monitoring on a regular basis all notices placed on School of Pharmacy bulletin boards. Additionally, notices may be handed out in class or placed in the student's mailbox.

If present, they must be kept covered. Cosmetics and nails The emphasis is on natural appearance (e.g., eye- brows natural looking, eye shadow and mascaraused only in moderation). Fragrances must be inconspicuous; excessive fra- grances are not appropriate. Avoid using heavily scented colognes, perfumes, after -shave, powders and/or other toiletries; these can often be a source of sensitivity to others. Fingernails should be be closely trimmed, main- tained in a professional manner , and must not interfere with patient care or professional duties.Nail polish, if worn, should be clear or light incolor . Artificial fingernails are not allowed in patient- care areas because they not only harbor bacteria,but they also interfere with important functions. Required in the laboratory and for direct patient-care activities Individuals are to wear the University ID badge at all times. When wearing a laboratory coat, the name tag must be on the coat at all times. Neck chains or earrings may not be worn by men. In laboratory and patient-care areas, footwear must adequately protect the feet. Open-toe shoes or sandals are not to be worn in laboratories, patient-care areas, or while on expe-riential rotations. Casual dress guidelines Casual wear is appropriate only for specified days or events. On all occasions, attire must be mod-est. In settings where shorts are specified as accept- able, they must be clean, neat, and no shorterthan midthigh. Violations of appearance standards Violations of appearance standards will be report- ed by faculty members. These violations are referredto the Office of Student and Professional Affairs or theassistant dean for academic affairs. Following an inves - tigation, the faculty member and/or administrative per - sonnel will meet with the student in an attempt to arrive at a resolution/correction of the matter. Failureto arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution/correctionwill result in a referral to the Academic andProfessional Standing Committee, which will follow thecommittee's normal due-process procedures. HONOR ROLL AND DEAN'S LIST The Office of Student and Professional Affairs compiles a list of students who have demonstrated their academic excellence by achieving an outstandinggrade point average each quarter . A student who earns a 3.30-3.69 grade point average, with no incomplete grades, during a term is given honor roll standing. Astudent who earns a 3.7 or better grade point average,with no incomplete grades, is given Deans' Liststanding. PERFORMANCE LEVEL In order to remain at regular academic status, pharmacy students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.3. Failure to maintain goodacademic performance will result in action by theAcademic Standing Committee. In addition, a grade of at least a \"C-\"must be earned in any course for which credit is to be applied towards the Doctor of Pharmacydegree. In order to have any grade changed, the student must repeat the course. This includes attending lec - ture and/or laboratory sessions as required, completing assigned work, and taking any required examinations.Courses being repeated by a student will have tuitioncharged on a per credit-unit basis, using the currentfee schedule established by the school. Both the origi-142 UNIVERSITY CATALOG nal and repeat grades are entered in the permanent records, but only the second grade is computed in thegrade-point average. A course may be repeated only once. Continuation in the pharmacy program is seriouslyjeopardized for the student who consistently earnsgrades below C+. Students who receive less than a C- grade in a course will be monitored closely for aca- demic progression. ACADEMIC PROBATION Students will be placed on academic probation if they have a cumulative grade-point average less than 2.3 at the end of any quarter. Students on academic probation for two consecutive quartersjeopardize their standing in a degree program. Students on academic probation will be required to meet with their adviser to determine what steps are needed to increase academic performance. The num- ber of units for subsequent registrations may be restricted. The student will be expected to adhere to the plan worked out with the adviser. The adviser willinform the Academic Standing Committee of the stu-dent's compliance and progress. Academic probationwill be lifted when the cumulative G.P .A. rises above 2.3. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL Astudent will be dismissed from the School of Pharmacy if the cumulative G.P.A. remains less than 2.3 for three consecutive quarters. A dismissedstudent may reapply and be considered forreadmission. The Admissions Committee will revieweach case separately and reserves the right todetermine the provisions for each individual situation.The committee will define the readmission conditionsfor each student. A student is eligible to reapply and be considered for readmission the next academic year after studies inthe School of Pharmacy have been discontinued. GRADE APPEALS Astudent has the right to file an appeal if there is disagreement over the score received on an individual test, final examination, or assignment. Theappeal must be in writing, using the procedures outlined in the section on Grievance Procedures (in this CATALOG ). Appeals must be filed within seven business days following the return of the examinationor assignment in question. For final examination-grade appeals, the appeal must be filed within seven days after the end of finals week. For appeals of final coursegrades, the appeal must be filed within twenty-onedays after the published date that grades are due at theend of an academic term and shall also follow the procedures outlined in the Student Grievance Procedures section. Any examination or assignmentreturned to the instructor for specific question(s)review or for an appeal is also subject to further reviewof other questions.REVIEW OF EXAMINATIONS Students shall have ample opportunity to review their examinations within a reasonable time frame after the test has been given. Instructors must eitherreturn the graded examination for the student to keepor permit the student to review his or her examinationin class or other set time during recitation periods. Forexaminations not returned, an additional test review may be requested by the student. This should be done in a prescheduled, arranged format agreed upon between the student and instructor and set at a timeconvenient to both. An instructor may prohibit thetaking of notes during an examination-review sessionin order to maintain question security. Anyexamination given back to the instructor for specific question(s) review is also subject to further review of other questions. MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS Instructors must implement a make-up examination policy in their course. This procedure must be clearly stated in the course syllabus and be discussedwith students on the first day of class. It mustprescribe exactly what will happen if a student missesan examination, quiz, final, or other point-generatingactivity. If rescheduling is an option that the instructorchooses, the test should be given as soon as isconvenient for the instructor . In the absence of a specific course policy set by the instructor , the contingency School of Pharmacy policy shall apply. An instructor's policy may be more stringent or less strict than these back-up guidelines. For unexcused absences, a zero score shall be entered as the grade for .the missed examination, quiz, assignment, final, or other point-generating activity. For excused absences of an examination or quiz, the instructor may either reschedule a make-uptest or have the point value of the missed assess - ment activity added to the final examination. Theinstructor is permitted to offer less credit for amake-up activity than the original activity wasworth. For excused absences of a presentation, activity as a team member, or other point-generating activity, the student shall receive a zero gradeentered for the activity unless the instructor is willing and able to reschedule the activity . EXAMINA TION T ARDINESS Students arriving late for an examination, quiz, final, or other point-generating activity may be denied admission to class, at the instructor's option, until the activity is over . Once a student who has been taking the examination or quiz has left the room (either after completing the test or for another reason) noone shall be allowed to enter the room for the purpose of starting the examination or quiz. In general, aninstructor should not let the first student leave theroom until: After 1 minute for an unannounced quiz of less than 10 minutes duration;THE SCHOOLS 143 After 5 minutes for a scheduled quiz of 10-to-20 minutes duration; After 15 minutes for a scheduled examination of 50-to-90 minutes in duration; or After 20 minutes for a scheduled final examina- tion of 100-to-120 minutes in duration. EXAMINATIONS Students who have completed an examination (or quiz) must turn in the examination or quiz to the proctor and leave the room and general vicinity immediately. Please refer to the examination-tardinesspolicy for exceptions to this rule. PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY In addition to emphasizing academic excellence and integrity, Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy also stresses professional growth, development, excellence, and integrity. Chronic tardiness to ornumerous absences from courses and/or otherrequired activities are considered inappropriate professional behavior and show a lack of commitment to professional growth. Students exhibiting suchbehaviors may be placed on professional probationuntil such time as the behavior has been modified.Students who have been placed on professionalprobation are not eligible to hold ASP/SNPhA or classoffices, or to receive any honors or awards. A studentmay also be dismissed from the program, after dueprocess, as a result of conduct unbecoming to apharmacist. STUDENT PROGRESSION The curriculum is designed to be followed in a stepwise, block manner. All prerequisites must be completed before a student can enroll in a course.Students must pass all the professional courses in eachyear before enrolling in courses in the next year (i.e.,PY1 courses must be completed before entering PY2courses, etc.). In addition, each student must pass theend-of-year comprehensive qualifying examination;failure to pass this examination may delay progression into the next year's course work. In addition to the Loma Linda University academ- ic regulations, the rules outlined below will be used toprovide for the immediate intervention of the Academic Standing Committee. If it is deemed neces- sary, the committee may intervene at times other than specifically stated below in order to ensure the aca - demic integrity of the School of Pharmacy. The following rules apply to student performance in course work and progression through the curricu- lum toward graduation: Students are required to enroll in and complete courses in sequence, completing at each level all prerequisites. No student will be permitted to takecourses out of sequence or enroll in a coursewithout having satisfied the prerequisites. A minimum grade of C- is required to pass all pharmacy courses and electives. Students are required to keep abreast of school/class activities by checking e-mail, bulletinboards, student mailboxes, and postal mail at theaddress on record. Students are required to follow the dress code of the school as an integral part of their training andprofessionalization. Student attendance in classes is considered the cornerstone of professional behavior and isexpected in all classes, especially during point-generating activities. Experiential education activ-ities and other off-site activities have a mandatoryattendance requirement. Experiential education program sites (introducto- ry and advanced) are provided off campus. Some of these sites may be located a significant distancefrom Loma Linda University. Students are respon-sible for their transportation and possible reloca-tion to their assigned site and for their own hous-ing during this period. The faculty of the School of Pharmacy reserves the right to revise the curriculum at any time to assure that students acquire the most current and relevant training possible. If curricular changesbecome necessary, every effort will be made toapprise students of the change and how it impacts their course of study. However, assurance of well- prepared graduates will prevail as the dominantconcern. One of the requirements for progressing from one professional year to the next is passing a compre - hensive, qualifying examination covering the pre- vious three quarters' course work. Failure to passthese examinations may delay progression intothe next year's course work. The School of Pharmacy will graduate only those students it deems ready\u2014morally , ethically, and professionally\u2014to practice pharmacy; and conse - will reserve the right to withhold the rec- ommendation for graduation of any student whodoes not conform to these standards. One of the requirements for graduation is passing a NAPLEX-style comprehensive examination.Each student must score 75 percent or better;failure to pass this examination may delay thegraduation of the student. A student may be dismissed from the program, after due process, as a result of conduct unbecom - ing to a professional pharmacy student or a phar - macist. INFECTION CONTRO L/BIOHAZARD- EXPOSURE REDUCTION At the first pharmacy forum of each new academic year, students must be certified or recertified in Loma Linda University's infection control and biohazards training. The primary purpose of thistraining is to: minimize the student's exposure to biohazardous materials; increase awareness of blood-borne pathogens (BBPs) that may result from contact with blood,body fluids, or tissues; and make students aware of the University's policies and procedures on exposure to blood-borne pathogens (see Student Handbook ).144 UNIVERSITY CATALOG A copy of Loma Linda University's Infection Control Manual is on file in the Office of Student and Professional Affairs. The school emphasizes the impor-tance of individuals taking personal responsibility fortheir own health and safety and asks that all studentsfollow universal precautions and University policy andprocedures as a means of safeguarding their own health. Observing standard precautions is the single best strategy to reduce the risk of blood-borne pathogens(BBP) exposure. This includes using adequate barrierprotection (gloves, safety glasses, mask) when perform-ing any activities in which the potential exists for BBPexposure. Familiarity with and use of safety devices onneedles, syringes, and intravenous equipment can alsoreduce the risk of accidental BBP exposure but willvary among medical institutions. Completion of thehepatitis B immunization series with documented presence of antibody to hepatitis B should provide full protection from transmission of this virus. Loma LindaUniversity students are to complete immunizations aspart of their pre-entrance health requirements. TheSchool of Pharmacy expects full compliance with these requirements and makes every effort to verify that a student's immunizations are complete. Students may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens (BBPs) in the course of their clinical, didac-tic, extracurricular , and/or research duties. Although a number of different pathogens (viruses, bacteria, etc.) may be transmitted from patients to health care work-ers, three organisms are of particular risk and concern:hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HVC),which can lead to liver disease; and the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS.Although a vaccine is available to prevent HBV, thereis no vaccine currently available for HVC or HIV.Following an exposure, the risk of contracting HIVmay be reduced by taking medications as part of post-exposure prophylaxis; however there is no preventa-tive treatment for hepatitis C. An exposure is generally defined as a percuta - neous injury (a needle or sharp object puncture or cuts on the skin); or contact of mucous membrane(s)or nonintact skin with blood, tissue, or body fluids thatare contaminated with visible blood. Current estimatesof the average percutaneous exposure are: HIV = 3/1,000 (0.3%), hepatitis C = 1-3%, hepatitis B = 30% (in nonimmune). EXPOSURE TO BLOOD-BORNE PATHOGENS This section outlines the actions to be taken following blood-borne pathogen (BBP) exposure. When such an exposure (or \"needlestick\") occurs, the following steps must be followed exactly. 1. The exposure site should first be thoroughly washed and irrigated. 2.The student should promptly report the incident to the supervising faculty member or preceptor. 3. An incident report must be completed on site, giv- ing details of what occurred. The contact informa-tion of all involved parties should be obtained as part of this document. 4. The student should seek immediate evaluation at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC)Emergency Department and identify him-/herself to the triage nurse as a School of Pharmacy stu- dent who has just experienced an exposure to blood-borne pathogens. The student will bereferred to a special team of professionals trainedto handle this situation. If the exposure occurs ina facility that insists the student follow their pro-cedures and seek treatment on site rather than atLLUMC Emergency Department, then the studentshould seek guidance from his or her supervising faculty member or preceptor as to what to do. 5. In incidents that involve a specific patient, that patient should be asked to accompany the stu-dent, or report on his or her own, to the LLUMCEmergency Department for evaluation as well (at no cost to the patient). 6. Within five days, in all exposure incidents involv- ing another person, the supervising faculty mem- ber or preceptor must submit the incident reportand the student's report\u2014detailing all subsequentactions taken\u2014to the Office of Student andProfessional Affairs. 7.Students should cooperate with the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up recommendations made at the time of their exposure assessment. Expenses incurred for testing, counseling, and postexposure prophylaxis will be covered by LomaLinda University, provided: the BBP exposure was directly related to student activities, and the student followed the preceding outlined proce - dures. The National Clinicians' Prophylaxis Hot Line, 888/448-4911 (24 hour , toll-free) is available to help health care students exposed to blood-borne diseases on the job. Staffed by trained physicians, the toll-freenumber provides students and clinicians with adviceon how to treat health care workers' accidental occu-pational exposure to BBP . The hotline operates out of San Francisco General Hospital and is run in collabo - ration with the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Questions about the BBP policy or procedures should be directed to school's Office of Student andProfessional Affairs or the director of experiential edu-cation. CPR AND FIRST AID CERTIFICATION All students must be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and in first aid during their enrollment in the School of Pharmacy. The school willprovide one training program for students during ori-entation week. If students fail to obtain the certifica-tion at that time, they are responsible for the addition - al costs required for certification. Participation inTHE SCHOOLS 145 Operation Immunization and enrollment in the intro- ductory or advanced pharmacy-practice experienceswill not be allowed until both certifications are cur-rent. Financial Information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction orreimbursement of tuition must be approved by thedean. Any statement by individual faculty members,program directors, or department chairs in regard tothese matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, thestudent should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees aseconomic conditions warrant. GENERAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year . Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have been settled. DEPOSITS Upon notification of acceptance, the applicant must make a $500 deposit to hold a place in the class. This amount is deducted from the tuition and fees dueat registration and is nonrefundable should an appli - cant decide not to register.

DeanMission, Goals, and Values OOUURR MMIISSSSIIOONN The mission of the School of Public Health reflects a distinctly Christian orientation and purpose in preparing students as public health professionals forlocal, national, and international service. The Schoolintegrates instruction, research, and service to achieveeducational excellence. In keeping with itsSeventh-day Adventist heritage, an integration of thephysical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions isencouraged. Our goals The goals of the School of Public Health are to: 1. Educate public health professionals for service in local, national, and international settings. 2. Integrate public health practice with teaching and research in the careers of faculty and theeducation of students. 3. Expand and disseminate public health knowl- edge through research and scholarly activities. 4. Promote the development of positive personal- health habits in faculty , staff, and students as integral to spiritual values and Christian com- mitment. 5. Provide public health education through inno- vative programs to meet the needs of the spon- soring church and populations underserved by public health training and education. 6. Provide public health leadership within the University and the community . 7. Encourage responsible management of resources and the environment. 8. Provide appropriate consultation. 9. Encourage an educational environment sup- portive of diverse population groups. Our values The School of Public Health believes that the values held by the School and its faculty and staff\u2014and which it seeks to develop in its students\u2014are a consequence of a loving relationship between God andHis created beings. This relationship is reflected in the following values: Compassion toward fellow human beings, creatures, and nature Acceptance of each individual as a priceless child of God Respect for the beliefs, ideas, opinions, and cultures of others Equity in interactions with all races, individuals, ethnicities, and cultures Integrity by matching belief with action Faith in the outworking of God's ultimate purpose Wisdom in research, study , and service THE SCHOOLS 149 School Foundations HISTORY The School was begun in 1948 with the organization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research and teaching. After its reorganization in1961, the Division of Public Health and TropicalMedicine began to offer master's degree programsthrough the Graduate School. Establishment of theSchool of Public Health was authorized in 1964, andplans were made for faculty and facilities to meet therequirements of the Committee on ProfessionalEducation of the American Public Health Association. In 1967 the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (which had been organized in 1922 as the School of Dietetics) became a department of the School of Public Health.The name of the School was changed to School of Health in October 1970. Because the meaning of theterm \"public health\" has gradually broadened to emphasize lifestyle\u2014consistent with the goals of the School\u2014the original name, School of Public Health,was readopted in August 1987. The Center for HealthPromotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine,and the Preventive Medicine Practice Group weremerged into the School of Public Health in 1990. This resulted in expanded faculty and resources. The School of Public Health also serves as the Departmentof Preventive Medicine in the School of Medicine. ACCREDITATION The School has maintained continuous accreditation since it was accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currentlyaccredited by the Council on Education for PublicHealth, 800 Eye Street NW , Suite 202, W ashington, D.C. 20001-1397. The School is also a member of the Association of Schools of Public Health. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation,and graduation. Section III gives the general setting forthe programs of each school. The subject and unitrequirements for admission to individual professional programs are outlined in Section IV. It is important to review specific program requirements (Section IV) inthe context of the general requirements (Section III)applicable to all programs. General Information INSTRUCTIONAL F ACILITIES Facilities for the School of Public Health\u2014offices, lecture and seminar rooms, teaching and research laboratories, work and storage areas\u2014are locatedmainly in and adjacent to Francis Nichol Hall.Additional offices and research facilities are located inEvans Hall and the Parkland Building.DEPARTMENTS AND CENTERS The instructional, research, and service programs within the School are organized and administered by six academic departments and three centers. Thedepartments are: environmental and occupationalhealth, epidemiology and biostatistics, health adminis-tration, health promotion and education, global health,and nutrition. They are described in the appropriate section of this CATALOG . The three centers are: the Center for Health Promotion, the Center for Health Research, and the Center for Health and Development. Center for Health Promotion (CHP) The center is a health-promotion-and-mainte- nance facility within the Adventist Health System/Loma Linda. It offers a wide spectrum of pro-grams dealing with weight management, executivehealth, stress management, smoking cessation, nutri-tion, exercise, and alcohol and drug dependency. Group sessions, individual counseling, and health assessment are some of the aspects of the programs asthey are conducted in the community or in a corpo- rate setting. The CHP is a major training center for students. Center for Health Research (CHR) The center encourages involvement in research by identifying research opportunities and providing supportin developing grant applications. It provides researchand statistical services, monitors financial status ofgrants and research endowments, and provides focus forthe research activities of the School by identifyingresearch priorities. The research efforts of the School are consistent with its overall philosophy: protection, promotion, andpreservation of human health through the harmoniousdevelopment of one' s mental, physical, and spiritual resources. It is the School's policy to encourage those research activities that are especially relevant to itsmission and that utilize the natural abilities, specialinterests, and professional expertise of its facultymembers. School of Public Health researchers concen - trate on projects that examine the effects on health ofvarious aspects of lifestyle, including personal and cul-tural habits. Of special importance is research directedtoward those aspects of disease prevention in whichhealth may be related to individual choices of lifehabits and lifestyle. The School makes special efforts to encourage research projects that are most likely to enrich the instructional program. In developingresearch projects, faculty members carefully considerhow to encourage student involvement. The goal is to bring mutual benefit to the students' academic devel- opment and to the purposes of research. A wide vari - ety of research methodologies are employed. These provide students with valuable experience throughexposure to a broad spectrum of the techniques of sci - entific investigation. Substantive research findings are incorporated regularly into the teaching program. Center for Health And Development (CHD) The center facilitates the development of global and cross-cultural consultation and training activitiesfor the School of Public Health, which has been desig-nated a World Health Organization (WHO) Collabor-ating Center for Primary Health Care and HumanResource Development. It assists the School in adapt-ing its programs to the needs of international students,150 UNIVERSITY CATALOG visiting scholars, and students who intend to pursue a global health career. Programs in global health drawupon the spectrum of expertise available in theUniversity to produce services especially adapted tothe needs of people in resource-scarce areas, includingrefugees, people in the inner cities, the rural poor, andpeople in the developing world. The School has been involved with many projects\u2014both service and train- ing-in Africa, Asia (including the People's Republic of China and the Indian subcontinent), Latin America,the Caribbean, eastern and southern Europe, andOceania; as well as with underserved populations inthe United States. Through a network of internationalschools of public health and medicine and throughhealth care institutions, the School of Public Healthalso facilitates the exchange of curricular information,program planning, and faculty interaction to furtherenhance professional public health education globally. The CHD also serves the wider University community and the world as a primary resource center. Computer Center The School maintains two state-of-the-art comput- er laboratories. The Computer Center assists studentsin utilizing a variety of software programs and access - ing on-line services relevant to students in all pro-grams. Word processing, spreadsheet, graphics, statisti-cal, nutritional, and other types of software are avail - able for use. Workstations are capable of running Internet software to allow the user direct access to theInternet, including the capability to use File T ransfer Protocol, the World Wide Web, newsreaders, Gopher, and T elnet. T raining in using computers is available through courses offered by the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and iscapable of profiting from the educational experienceoffered by this University. The admissions committeesof the School accomplish this by examining evidenceof scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards,and significant qualities of character and personality . Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. Computer literacy Students are strongly encouraged to develop their computer skills and literacy prior to coming to the School. Computer literacy is a prerequisite for some courses. ADVANCED STANDING Graduate students with previous course work in areas of public health may apply for limited units of advanced standing. If approved by the program directoror department chair and the director of admissions andacademic records in the school, degree requirements\u2014exclusive of elective units\u2014are reduced. Courses takenduring the past five years are considered in an evaluationof the student' s qualification for advanced standing.Competency in courses taken more than five years previ- ously may be considered if the content has been usedprofessionally on a regular basis. No advanced standing isgranted for life experience that is not in conjunction withprevious course work. Advanced standing is not grantedfor religion courses. PROGRAM ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN PUBLIC HEALTH Content and length of programs vary according to an individual applicant's background (see \"Advanced standing\") and classification on acceptance. Specificadmissions requirements for individual degree programscan be found in Section IV of this CATALOG . Subject/diploma requirements A high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED, is required. Eligibility Eligibility for consideration by the Admissions Committee is based on a grade point average of at least 2.5 (on a 4.0 scale) for all course work (science andnonscience subjects computed separately) presentedin fulfillment of entrance requirements for all under - graduate majors in the School. A limited number of students whose background and experience showpotential for success but whose GPA is between 2.0and 2.49 may be admitted on a provisional basis.

Many of the programs offered have matured on campus for adecade or more; one program was established half acentury ago. The school offers degree programsthrough the doctoral level, postdegree certificates, andcertificate programs in Chinese Studies and Spanish;as well as courses that meet the University's GeneralEducation requirements. T echnology programs, such as instructional technology , are currently being developed by the school. PHILOSOPHY The School of Science and Technology is mission- driven and academically incorporates the University's commitment to the teaching and healingministry of Jesus Christ, which produces wholenesswithin transformed lives. Transformation is a lifelongfaith and learning process\u2014a process committed topursuit of the highest levels of scholarship, profession-alism, and spiritual well-being. This pursuit seeks tounderstand and promote healthy minds, communities, social systems, families, and the environment. Wholeness for self and for others is central to a balance between mind, body and spirit. Such whole-ness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity, tothe environment, and to God. The School of Science and Technology values the time-honored and separate traditions in higher educa- tion for academic and professional programs and advo-cates the integration of knowledge bases and research focus between and among the \"pure\" and \"applied\" sci-ences. Philosophy In the School of Science and Technology of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both facultyand students is the quest for meaning. Because thisquest is served by knowledge, graduate students areobliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery oftheir field of study . They also participate with the fac - ulty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. Objectives The School of Science and Technology attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit ofknowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christiansetting the education necessary for scholarlycareers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, andcontribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of mankind. Application and Admissions APPLICA TION AND ACCEPT ANCE Application procedure 1. The application should be filled out and mailed, together with the application fee, to the School ofScience and Technology Office of Admissions. (See Section II.)

It is the applicant's responsibility toarrrange to have the transcripts\u2014including officialEnglish translations, if applicable\u2014sent directly THE SCHOOLS 165 by the registrar of each school attended to the School of Science and Technology Office ofAdmissions. Transcripts that come via anintermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is often desirable and should be arranged with the coordinator of the program in which the student wishes to study. Acceptance procedure 1. When the program that the student wishes to enter has evaluated the applications and made itsrecommendation, the dean of the School ofScience and Technology takes official action andnotifies the applicant. The formal notice ofadmission should be presented at registration asevidence of eligibility to enter the School ofScience and Technology. 2.As part of registration, accepted students will be asked to file with student health service a medical history with evidence of certain immunizations. 3.Transcripts of records and all other application documents are retained by the University and may not be withdrawn and used for any purpose.Records of students who do not enroll or whowithdraw prior to completion are retained for twoyears from the date of original acceptance to theSchool of Science and Technology program. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Afour-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the Schoolof Science and Technology. Transcripts of theapplicant's scholastic record should show appropriatepreparation, in grades and content, for the curriculumchosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern ofundergraduate courses prescribed by differentprograms, the student should note the specificrequirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies maybe fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must becompleted prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergradu - ate record with a grade-point average of B (3.0) or bet - ter in the overall program and in the field of the major. Some students with an overall grade-point averagebetween 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally tograduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior years are superior or there is other evi- dence of capability . Graduate Record Examinations Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with applications for admission to many degree programs. New test scoresare needed if it has been over five years since the lasttest was taken. Applicants are advised to request infor-mation specific to their proposed program of study . Students may address inquiries about these examina-tions to Graduate School's Office of Admissions, whichcan provide application forms and information aboutspecial administration of the examination on daysother than Saturday. Application forms for the GRE and information regarding examination times and places are furnishedby Educational Testing Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the West); and P.O. Box 6000,Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publica-tions (including study materials) call 800/537-3160.Also visit the GRE Web site at http://www.gre.org formore information on online registration, sample testquestions, frequently asked questions, etc. When pressure of time makes it impossible to secure the results of the GRE or its alternatives, stu- dents seeking admission who have otherwise above-average achievement may be admitted provisionally,subject to review when the required test results arereceived. In such cases, test results are to be submit-ted within the first quarter of attendance. Certain pro-grams with limited admissions may require the GREresults prior to acceptance, while some programsrequire the subject test. Please check student guidesfrom individual programs for further information. Programs that do not require the GRE must sub- mit one additional measure of a candidate's prepara-tion for graduate study. This may be either an evalua-tion of critical essay writing skills, the Miller analogytest, or the results of a structured interview. Re-entrance Students who are currently enrolled in the School of Science and Technology may request transfer to adifferent program or a more advanced degree level by completing an application form and submitting two let- ters of reference along with the appropriate fee.Transcripts on file with the University are acceptable. English competence All international students are encouraged (particu- larly those who do not have an adequate score onTOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of English profi-ciency) to attend an intensive American LanguageInstitute prior to entering their program. Further infor - mation about opportunities for such programs can beobtained from the Office of Admissions. Further studyof English may be required to assure academicprogress. FROM MASTER'S TO PH.D. DEGREE Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degree. If at the time of applicationthe student wishes to qualify for the Doctor ofPhilosophy degree, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, anapplication form should be submitted, along with let-ters of reference, to the dean of the School of Science and Technology. If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete thatdegree before embarking on doctoral activity for cred-it. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to trans - fer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality andscope to his/her doctoral program. Second master's degree A student who wishes to qualify for an additional master's degree in a different discipline may apply.166 UNIVERSITY CATALOG The dean of the School of Science and Technology and the faculty of the program the student wishes to enterwill consider such a request on its individual merits. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Science and Technology program while admitted toanother program at this University or elsewhere. Theexceptions to this are the combined-degrees programs,discussed in the following paragraph. Combined degrees The School of Science and Technology provides for concurrent registration for two degrees only in itscombined andM.S./M.P.H. Concurrent application is required in some but not all of these: See Programs and Degrees in Section IV of this CATALOG . See Combined-Degrees Programs in Section IV. CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The School of Science and Technology offers several postbaccalaureate certificate programs. Students accepted into such programs will be assigned to anadviser who will work with them as they fulfill theprogram requirements. Students will be required tomaintain a B- (2.7) grade-point average, with nocourse grade below C (2.0). All certificate students arerequired to take at least one 3-unit religion course(numbered between 500 and 600). MASTER OF ARTS MASTER OF SCIENCE MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK Adviser and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an adviser who helps to arrange the programof study to meet University requirements; subsequent-ly (no later than when applying for candidacy), thestudent is put under the supervision of a guidancecommittee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (whereapplicable), guiding research, administering final writ-ten and/or oral examinations, evaluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and ultimately recommending the student forgraduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subject and classified either as prereq - uisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking certain subject or program prerequisites are not admit-ted to the master's degree program until the prerequi - sites are completed (at Loma Linda University or else-where) and acceptable grades are reported. However,subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant fromadmission or enrollment; but they must be removed asspecified by the adviser or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this University. Study plan The student's adviser should develop with the stu- dent a written outline of the complete graduate experi-ence, with time and activity specified as fully as possi-ble. This will serve as a guide to both the student andthe adviser as well as to members of the guidancecommittee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful con- sultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit The time allowed from admission to the School of Science and Technology to conferring of the master'sdegree may not exceed five years. Some consideration may be given to a short extension of time if in the dean's opinion such is merited. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course com-pletion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, writ - ten reports, or examination to assure currency in thecontent. Residence Students must meet the residence requirements indicated for their particular program (never less thanone academic quarter). The master's degree candidatemust complete one quarter of full-time study at theUniversity or perform the thesis research at theUniversity . Although students may register for up to 12 units each quarter, a student is considered in full-time residence if registered for at least 8 units. Minimum required grade-point average The required minimum grade average is B (3.0) with no course grade below C (2.0) on all work for themaster's degree. This average must be maintained informal courses and in research, computed separately . A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B grade average on all work accepted for transfer and onall work taken at this University, computed separately. Research competence Student skills required in languages, investigation, and computation are specified in each programdescription in this CATALOG . Comprehensive and final examinations The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or beforethe published dates. If a candidate fails to pass thefinal oral or written examination for a graduate degree,the examining committee files with the dean a written analysis of the candidate's status, with recommenda- tions regarding the student's future relation to theSchool. The student receives a copy of the committee'srecommendation. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least one unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis prepa-ration are under the direction of the student's guidancecommittee. The student is urged to secure the commit-THE SCHOOLS 167 tee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before peti-tion is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for the- sis credit whether the work is done in residence or inabsentia. If the student has been advanced to candida-cy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and the- sis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involves aquarterly fee of $65 (2005-2006) paid at the beginningof each quarter. A similar continuing registration fee isassessed for each quarter the student fails to registerfor new units. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technology or designation of regular graduate standingdoes not constitute admission of the student to candi- dacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular sta - tus, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and Technology Form A)from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's adviser and the program coordinator ordepartment chair . Students petitioning the School of Science and Technology for candidacy for the master's degree mustpresent a satisfactory grade record, include a state - ment of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the stu-dent's guidance committee, and note any other qualifi - cation prescribed by the program. Students are usually advanced to candidacy during the third quarter afterentering their course of study toward a degree in theSchool of Science and Technology. Specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATA- LOG governing the specific program chosen. Religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course. Courses (numberedbetween 500 and 600) in social ethics, bioethics, psy-chology of religion, and philosophy of religion meetthis requirement. Combined-master's degrees programs A number of combined-degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more comprehensivepreparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Both require concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Science and T echnology and/or a professional school in the University . These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined-Degrees Programs\" in SectionIV of the CATALOG . THESIS AND DISSERT ATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure thecommittee's approval of the topic and research designas early as is feasible. Such approval must be securedbefore petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the\"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" available at theSchool of Science and Technology Office of Admissions.Consultation with the Office of Admissions can help thestudent avoid formatting errors that would requirehim/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The lastday for submitting copies to the school office in finalapproved form is published in the Events Calendar (available from the academic dean's office). Binding A fee will be assessed to cover the cost of binding copies of thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the University library and the appropriate department or school collection. This same fee will also apply to per-sonal copies bound at the student's request. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evidence of mature scholarship; productive promise; and active awareness of the history,resources, and demands of a specialized field. Adviser and guidance committee Each student, upon acceptance into a degree pro- gram, is assigned an adviser who helps arrange thestudy program. Subsequently (no later than whenapplying for candidacy), the student is put under thesupervision of a guidance committee. The School ofScience and Technology requires advisers for Doctor ofPhilosophy degree candidates to have demonstratedconsistent research productivity in their chosen disci-plines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doc - toral degree mentors. The guidance committee, usually chaired by the adviser, is responsible to and workswith the coordinator of the student's program inarranging course sequences, screening dissertationtopics, recommending candidacy , guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluat - ing the dissertation/project and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and recom- mending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subjects and classified as either pre-requisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prerequi - sites are not admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma LindaUniversity or elsewhere) with acceptable grades. Subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the adviser or dean, usually atthe beginning of the graduate experience at thisUniversity. Study plan The student's adviser should develop with the stu- dent a written outline of the complete graduate experi-ence, with time and activity specified as fully as possi-ble. This serves as a guide to both the student and theadviser as well as to members of the guidance commit-tee when it is selected. The study plan is changed onlyafter careful consultation. The student is ultimately168 UNIVERSITY CATALOG responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. Thedynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dila-tory or even leisurely pursuit of the degree unaccept-able. Seven years are allowed for completion afteradmission to the Ph.D. degree program. Extension oftime may be granted on petition if recommended bythe guidance committee to the dean of the School of Science and Technology. Course credit allowed toward the doctorate is nul- lified eight years from the date of course completion.Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successfulpetition, through reading, conference, written reports,or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence The School of Science and Technology requires two years of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F.T, Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of theUniversity after enrollment in a doctoral degree pro- gram. During residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combinationof these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units eachquarter; 36 or more clock hours per week is full time inresearch. Students may be advised to pursue studies for lim - ited periods at special facilities not available at Loma Linda University. Such time may be considered resi- dence if the arrangement is approved in advance bythe dean of the School of Science and Technology. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, read-ing, and reflection. But neither the passage of time norpreoccupation with study assures success. Evidence ofhigh scholarship and original contribution to the fieldor professional competence form the basis for deter-mining the awarding of the degree. Minimum required grade-point average Students must maintain a grade-point average of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular standingtoward the doctorate. This average is to be computedseparately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a grade between C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply toward the degree, at the discre - tion of the guidance committee. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B average on all workaccepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. Clinical probation Programs with a clinical component may recom- mend that the student be placed on clinical probation. Details are contained in the program guides for the programs concerned. Research competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate research competence by their investigative activities.Expectations and standards of achievement with thetools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages,and computers are specifiedfor each program inSection IV of this CATALOG . Comprehensive examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examinations over theprincipal areas of study to ascertain capacity for inde-pendent, productive, scientific work; and to determinewhether further courses are required before the finalyear of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports ofresults. Success in the comprehensive examination is aprerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until the following requirements have been met: demonstrated reading knowledge of one foreign language, if applicable; completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equivalent. The final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doc-toral degree candidate is required to appear before anexamining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination for a graduate degree, the examining committee fileswith the dean a written analysis of the candidate's sta - tus, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the School. The student receives a copy ofthe committee's recommendation. Project (required for the Doctor of Psychology degree) All Doctor of Psychology degree students must register for at least 1 unit of project credit. This shouldbe done in the last quarter of registration prior to com-pletion. The research and project preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. Thestudent is urged to secure the committee's approval ofthe topic and research design as early as possible.Such approval must be secured before petition is madefor advancement to candidacy. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has regis-tered for but not completed the research and project, continuous registration is maintained until the manu- script is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $65(2005-2006) paid during registration each quarter . A similar continuing registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Dissertation (required for the Doctor of Philosophy degree) All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of dissertation credit. This should be done in the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance commit-tee. The student is urged to secure the committee'sapproval of the topic and research design as early aspossible. Such approval must be secured before petitionis made for advancement to candidacy. Consultation with School of Science and Technology Office of Admissions can prevent the stu - dent from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. THE SCHOOLS 169 Students register and pay tuition for the disserta- tion whether the work is done in residence or inabsentia. If the student has been advanced to candida-cy, has completed all course requirements, and hasregistered for but not completed the research and dis-sertation, continuous registration is maintained untilthe manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $65 (2005-2006), paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to registerfor new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to University Microfilms International and to the National OpinionResearch Center. The School of Science andTechnology office provides appropriate informationand forms. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technology does not constitute candidacy for a gradu- ate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and TechnologyForm A) from the student to the dean, with support from the student's adviser and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will include, in addition,confirmation that comprehensive written and oralexaminations have been passed. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candidacy nolater than the previous November 15. One full quartermust be allowed between the achievement of candida-cy and the quarter of completion. Specific program requirements Doctoral programs differ from each other. The unique program requirements appear in the programssection of this CATALOG (Section IV) and in the pro - gram guides available from specific departments. Religion requirement All doctoral students take at least one 3-unit reli- gion course. Courses (numbered between 500 and600) in social ethics, bioethics, psychology of religion,and philosophy of religion meet this requirement. Combined-degrees programs A number of combined-degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional prepara- tion in clinical, professional, or basic areas related tothe student's field of interest. All require concurrentadmission to the School of Science and Technology and a professional school in the University. These cur- ricula are described in greater detail below under theheading Combined-Degrees Programs, Section IV . The combined-degrees programs provide opportu- nity for especially well-qualified and motivated stu - dents to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization,teaching, or investigation of problems of health anddisease in man. For admission to a combined-degrees program, the student must have a baccalaureate degree; must quali - fy for admission to the School of Science andTechnology; and must already be admitted to theSchool of Medicine, the School of Dentistry , Faculty of Religion, or the School of Public Health. Applicationmay be made at any point in the student's progress inthe professional school, though it is usually made dur-ing the sophomore year. Students in this curriculumstudy toward the M.A., M.S., M.S.W., Psy.D. or Ph.D. degree. Students may be required to interrupt their pro- fessional study for two or more years (as needed) forcourses and research for the graduate degree sought.Elective time in the professional school may be spentin meeting School of Science and Technology require- ments. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until dis-continuance is recommended by the School of Scienceand Technology or the professional school. The usualdegree requirements apply. Master of Science in marital and family therapy withMaster of Public Health Master of Science in marital and family therapy with Master of Arts in clinical ministry These two combined-degrees programs allow the M.P.H. or M.A. degree student in clinical ministry to dual-count units with the master's degree in marital and family therapy. This enables the student to beawarded the combined-degrees in less time than wouldbe required by the separate programs. Master of Social W ork with Master of Public Health This combined-degrees program earns the student an M.S.W. in social work with an M.P.H. in maternal,and child health or global health. See Section IV. Master of Arts in biomedical and clinical ethics with Doctor of Psychology This combined-degrees program gives the psychol- ogy student the opportunity to be enriched throughthe study and understanding of ethical issues, as isrecommended by the American PsychologicalAssociation. It also adds the psychological componentoften missing in the field of biomedical ethics. Doctor of Public Health withDoctor of Psychology The program enables a Dr.P.H. degree student to meet his/her elective and religion requirements with appropriate courses from the Psy .D. degree program, and allows work on the dissertation in an area that is acceptable for the Psy.D. project\u2014thus obtaining thecombined-degrees in less time than is required by the separate programs.

Anthony J. Zuccarelli Interim Dean FOUNDATIONS OF GRADUATE STUDY Recognizing the need to provide advanced educa- tion, the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. Thenew school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958, the firstPh.D. to be awarded by a Seventh-day institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda University, the University assumed oversight of thegraduate education conducted by La Sierra College inRiverside, California. By 1963 the School of GraduateStudies had been renamed the Graduate School, with ahome in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall,in honor of a former department chair. The two cam-puses comprising Loma Linda University\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014were separated in 1990. In 2005 the Graduate School was restructured as the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It continues to pro-vide oversight of graduate programs, supported byother schools of the University; promotes and encour-ages independent judgment, mastery of research tech- niques, and contribution to scholarly communication; and relates intellectual achievements to the service of mankind. PHILOSOPHY In the Faculty of Graduate Studies of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this questis served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of theirfield of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. OBJECTIVES The Faculty of Graduate Studies attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian settingthe education necessary for scholarly careers inthe sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judg- ment, mastery of research techniques, and contri-bution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of mankind.

Yellon The School of Medicine through its Division of Human Anatomy in the Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, along with other departments ofthe University, offers programs leading to the Master ofScience and the Doctor of Philosophy degrees in the field of anatomy. These departments are active partici- pants in the systems biology curricula, which consist ofinterdisciplinary courses and seminars coordinated bythe faculties of the Departments of Anatomy ,Physiol - ogy and Pharmacology, and Biochemistry and Microbi- ology in the School of Medicine. The degree programsprovide opportunities for qualified students to preparefor careers in teaching and research. Prerequisites for acceptance include results of the GRE General T est. Scores on the T est of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) are required from students whose native language is not English. Applicantsshould have a bachelor' sdegree or equivalent from a foreign university ,with a strong undergraduate prepa- ration in the biological and physical sciences\u2014includ - ing a full year each of general biology, general chemistry ,organic chemistry, and physics. Other upper -division sciences and calculus are strongly rec - ommended. Exceptions are considered by the faculty onan individual basis. The program reserves the right to decide on the equivalence of courses presented bythe applicant. Graduate programs in anatomy provide opportuni- ties for qualified students to study all aspects of humanmorphology from both didactic and investigative pointsof view. Study and research on other species and inother biomedical disciplines may be included in the student' scurriculum. Students are introduced to research methods, both literature and laboratory, while working on a significant problem. Students acquireexperience in scientific communication by participat- ing in seminars, writing critical reviews, and reporting results of research experience either in thesis/disserta - tion form or as publishable/published papers. Details ofthese programs are available in the Anatomy Program Guide. The Anatomy Program encourages the student to build a career in biomedicine on a solid foundation ofbasic medical sciences. Four specialty areas are avail-able for the M.S. degree thesis or Ph.D. degree disserta- tion research: 1. CELL BIOLOGY includes advanced study in cel- lular and molecular biology, electron microscopy, his-tochemistry, tissue culture, and quantitative imageanalysis. Research emphases are cell-cell communica-tion, regulation and modeling of bone-cell activities, receptor biology in development, in vitro fertilization, and elucidation of the molecular and cellular bases of developmental anomalies. 2. DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY approaches human anatomy from a developmental perspective,emphasizing the genetic basis of morphogenesis andfinal structure. Comparative developmental approachesare used to understand the mechanisms employed thatregulate structure and function. 3. NEUROBIOLOGY is an integrated program with advanced courses in neuroanatomy and neurophysiol- ogy. Research emphases include neural systems in the regulation of biorhythms; neurocytology; and electronmicroscopy and sensory systems in development,aging, and diabetes. 4. RADIATION BIOLOGY builds on advanced courses in quantitative morphology and cell, molecular , and radiation biology. The proton accelerator at LomaLinda University Medical Center provides a uniqueopportunity to study functional responses of normaland cancerous tissue to proton and other radiations.

GONZALEZ, JR., Program Coordinator FACULTY Faculty for the Medical Sciences Program are drawn from the graduate faculty associated with the basic science departments of the School of Medicine andwith the Department of Natural Sciences in the Schoolof Science and Technology. The Biomedical Sciences Program provides an opportunity for qualified students to register for selected graduate-level courses in the biomedical sci - ences. These courses are identical to those taken by students in the master's and doctoral degree programs;however, the certificate program enables students to complete their studies with one academic year of full- time commitment. The program is intended to providepostbaccalaureate experience in the rapidly changingarea of biomedical sciences. As such, it will either aug-ment other career choices\u2014such as high school teach-ing, patent law ,and biotechnology management; or improve the preparation for professional training in medicine or dentistry. Admission Students entering the program will have completed abaccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) meeting the criteria outlined in the School of Medicine and Schoolof Science and Technology Admission Information Sec-tion III of this CATALOG .Students who have not taken the Graduate Record Examination may be consideredif they have a Medical College Acceptance Test with noscore less than 6 and an aggregate score greater than20. A Dental Aptitude Test score greater than 15 is also acceptable. Course of study Students will be required to complete 28 units selected from courses indicated by the program coordi-nator. These courses will include 3 units of religion,with the remaining 25 units selected, in consultationwith the program coordinator, from offerings in the bio-logical sciences. The program may include 1 unit of appropriate seminar and up to 6 units of research. Since many of the courses offered in the basic medical sciences are sequenced or anticipate specific undergraduate experi- ences, students will be required to meet all course pre-requisites. Students may choose to select course sequences that could be applied to one of the Master of Sciencedegree programs that the School of Science and Tech- nology offers in the biological sciences. Course work at the level of B (3.0) or above would be transferred tosuch a Master of Science degree program upon presen-tation of a petition for academic variance to the dean of the School of Science and Technology. Although several of the courses may share lecture experience and tests with the School of Medicine doc-toral degree program, such courses will not be trans-ferred to the School of Medicine; and a student subsequently admitted to the M.D. degree program should expect to take, and pay for, the normal medicalschool curriculum.

The Child Life Specialist Program prepares individu- als to provide child life services in health care set- tings. Child life services strive to promote optimumdevelopment of children and their families, to maintainnormal living patterns, and to minimize emotionaltrauma. As integral members of the health care teamin both the ambulatory care and inpatient settings,child life staff provides children opportunities for gain - ing a sense of mastery, for play, for learning, for self-expression, for family involvement, and for peer interaction.* Mission* The mission of a child life specialist is to meet the needs of infants, children, youth, and families in times of stressful or traumatic life events and situations. The philosophy and practice of child life will be applicableto any heath care setting and transferable to otherenvironments or situations in which the potential forinfants, children, and youth to cope, learn and master is placed at risk. The services provided by the child life profession will be wholistic and preventive and willutilize applied child-development and family-systems theory. The objectives of such services will be to mini- mize the negative impact of situational disruptionswhile maintaining normalcy in growth, development,and family systems relationships. The child life profession has developed since the 1920s to improve health care experiences for childrenby providing play ,preparation, and educational pro - grams. These child life services are necessary for pro- moting the emotional stability and healthy development of hospitalized children while mitigating the fear and pain associated with treatment. The child life specialistis an early and ardent advocate of frequent family visitsand parental participation in the care of the child. Individuals who receive child life specialist certifi- cation are qualified to apply for professional level certi - fication from the Child Life Certifying Committee. The national child life certification fosters uniform andimproved standards of practice and ethical conductwhile it enhances the status and credibility of the pro-fession. *Adapted from the Child Life Council W eb site (CLCC)THE PROGRAMS 199The programs The Child Life Specialist Program leading to an M.S. degree or certificate is offered by the School ofScience and Technology's Department of Counselingand Family Sciences through the Marital and FamilyTherapy Program.

Clinical internship Students must also satisfactorily complete an approved, 400-hour clinical internship (RELG 695).The program recommends that this requirement bemet by the satisfactory completion of one quarter ofclinical pastoral education (CPE) at an accredited CPEcenter. (Note: Acceptance into a quarter of CPE is atthe discretion of the CPE supervisor and must bearranged individually and in advance.) The expectationof the program is that all students will complete all course work before entering the clinical internship. In certain cases, however, a student may petition thecoordinator of the program to take the clinical intern- ship out of sequence. Even in such cases, the recom- mendation is that RELR 565, RELR 567, and RELR 568be completed before entering the clinical internship. Students who wish to receive academic credits for their clinical internship may register for RELR 524 Clinical Pastoral Education. If taken as a selective, this course may account for a maximum of 6 academicunits. After the 400-hour segment, a clinical evaluation form must be submitted to the program coordinator. Comprehensive examination Each student must pass a comprehensive examina- tion. This examination will test the student' s ability to integrate and apply knowledge from the overall pro- gram. This examination must be successfully com - pleted before the student defends a thesis, project, orpapers. Thesis, project, or publishable papers Each student must either prepare a thesis while registered for RELR 698, prepare a project while regis-tered for RELR 696, or prepare two major papers ofpublishable quality. Independent research for eitherthe thesis or the project is done while registered forRELR 697. The project option must be designed andimplemented within the confines of the program andunder the auspices and direction of the program coor - dinator . The student must provide an oral defense of the thesis, a project, or two major papers. By the timestudents complete 12 quarter units in the program, they must declare whether they intend to complete athesis, a project, or two major papers.

Coding Specialist \u2014AH (certificate) DIANA S. MEDAL, Program Coordinator PAULINE CALLA, Clinical Coordinator FACULTY Diana S. Medal Terri L. Rouse ADVISORY COMMITTEE Rita M. Stiffler , Chair Darlene DownsCarel HansonMelissa Hingula Health care facilities need coders who accurately select ICD-9-CM codes, CPT codes, and DRG and APC assignments for diagnostic and surgical informa - tion recorded in health records. In most instances, financial reimbursement is directly tied to thesenumeric codes. The statistical information generatedfrom these codes is also used in research, qualityimprovement in patient care, education, and admin - strative decision making. Opportunities Coding specialists are in demand in acute-care and ambulatory-care facilities, physician' s office practices, and long-term care facilities. A variety of government agencies require coding expertise as well. The need for accurate, skilled coders is acute in California and throughout the nation.

Thisdegree will become an integral part of Loma Linda Uni - versity's mission, as illustrated by the Good Samaritan sculpture on the mall of the campus. The sculpturedepicts the biblical parable told by Jesus in Luke 10:30-37, which contrasts indifference and ethnic pride with attitudes of empathy and compassion. School counseling credential School counseling began as a profession in the early 1900s when vocational guidance emerged as aresponse to America's industrial revolution and to theadvisement needs of veterans with educational bene-fits. Over the next century, school counselors becamevital members of the mental-health community asmore responsibility for at-risk children, adolescents, and young adults was shifted to education. The California Pupil Personnel Services (PPS) Cre- dential in school counseling can be obtained by stu-dents pursuing the M.S. degree in counseling (72 units)or those wishing to add a 25-unit certificate to their 78- unit M.S. in marital and family therapy (total of 103 units). Mission and curriculum Guided by the University's mission of whole-per - son health care, California's new standards for school counseling, and the expanding nature of professionalcollaboration in mental health, the counseling curricu - lum is organized into the following three domains. 208 UNIVERSITY CATALOGI Educational foundations and beliefs II Theoretical and cognitive competence III Counseling competence and commitment to service Each candidate is expected to combine the knowl- edge and skills learned throughout these domains withan understanding of the University's mission to formu- late a well-thought-out, clearly articulated personal belief system which is demonstrated in ethical values and behaviors. Development of this personal epistemol-ogy requires each candidate to examine lifelong-learn-ing related to meaning, purpose, hope, and service.These issues include: Beliefs about the nature, origin, and future of humans Equality and inclusion Honoring personal and cultural values with sensitivity toward diversity Influence of religious traditions and communities of faith Integrity toward self and others Sources of strength and renewal Spirit of generosity Competence and conscientiousness ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Entrance: Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer quarters Minimum G.P.A. 3.0 (on 4.0 scale) in bachelor's degree or final 45 units of program Official transcripts of college work Prerequisite courses: statistics and abnormal psychology Three letters of reference Statement of purpose Interview with faculty PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS (72 units) DOMAIN I PREREQUISITE: G eneral statistics (3) Educational foundations and beliefs Foundational courses in learning theory, educational psychology, sociocultural competence, research, and sta-tistics are considered foundational to building competence as a school counselor. These courses include the following: COUN 501 Research: Quantitative (3) COUN 502 Research: Qualitative (3)COUN 545 Gender Perspectives (2)COUN 547 Social Ecology in Dev (3) COUN 574 Psychological Foundations of Education (4) MFAM 535 Case Presentation and Professional Studies (4) RELR 564 Religion, Marriage, and Family (3)DOMAIN II PREREQUISITE: Abnormal Psychology (3) Theory and cognitive competence Candidates are challenged with a variety of theo- retical constructs from which to develop an approachto counseling that is compatible with their own beliefsystems and personhood. They are expected to learn how to deconstruct theories, critically evaluate them, and create a foundation upon which to build their pro- fessional skills and relationships. Courses include: COUN 575 Counseling Theory and Applications (3) COUN 556 Psychopathology and Diagnosis Procedures (3) COUN 568 Group Process Theory and Procedures: Theories in Marital and Family Therapy (3) COUN 576 Exceptional and Medically Challenged Children (3) COUN 577 Assessment in Counseling (3) COUN 584 Advanced Child and Adolescent Development (3) COUN 674 Human Sexual Behavior (3) DOMAIN III Counseling competence and commitment to service The counseling program is based on the assump- tion that counseling competence develops from thefoundational knowledge, personal epistemologies, andtheoretical understanding learned in Domains I and II. Another assumption is that competence embraces the concept of service. Activities involving case studyand field experience are designed to emphasize serviceand the development of altruism. By helping K-12pupils sense the dimensions of personal need andworth in others, candidates grow in their ability torespond with compassion, empathy, and cultural com-petence. Working in education, school counselors helpK-12 students in their personal development, careerpreparation, and academic achievement in order tobecome lifelong learners.

The principles of restorative jus-tice elevate the dimensions of justice that: promote the acceptance of responsibility, promote the fulfillment of obligations, embrace forgiveness and reconciliation, and culminate in the restoration of personal and social relationships. This multidisciplinary approach to deviance and the administration of justice takes into considerationthe social, physical, and spiritual well-being of victims,offenders, and communities\u2014which provides a deeperunderstanding of crime and the struggle of the moderncriminal justice system. Program objectives The purpose of the Criminal Justice Program is to prepare students to think critically, analytically, andcreatively about the problems of crime and social con - trol in the contemporary world. The program isdesigned to meet the diverse needs of criminal justiceprofessionals. It will accomplish a number of objec - tives, including: To prepare students for careers in law enforcement, corrections, criminal justice administration, and planning. To provide students with a thorough knowledge of social science theory and of applying criminological theory and research to current problems in criminal justice. To provide students with a thorough knowledge of current issues in criminal justice; and of theimportance of the relationship of criminal justiceto other disciplines and professions, such as socialwork, psychology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, and public health. To prepare students for the application of various computer technologies to decision-making in the criminal justice system. To prepare students to conduct social research on crime and the effect of policies and programs on crime outcomes. Program description All students must complete a two-year program consisting of 48 quarter units of course work. There are 28 units of foundation content required for all stu - dents, followed by one of the two concentrations:administration or forensic mental health. Students opt-ing for the administration concentration will studypublic administration, the economic dimensions ofsocial policy, organizational theory, program planning,and policy analysis as they relate to contemporaryproblems in criminal justice. The forensic mental health concentration provides students with bothglobal and domestic perspectives on violence, mentalhealth, and drug and alcohol abuse issues. Both con-centrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection aboutpublic philosophy and ethical issues in criminal justicethat will provide students with a deeper understanding of the logic influencing policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. PREREQUISITE This master's degree builds on a broad liberal arts(general education) foundation. Consistent withthis view, the program assesses the liberal arts foundation of students applying for the M.S. degree in criminal justice. The required prerequi- site course work provides students with founda-tion concepts and/or skills in each of the following: Interviewing and counseling (3) Human growth and development (3) Cross-cultural issues (3)Introductory statistics (3) Unit values represent a quarter system of measure - ment. Content from multiple courses may be used to meet most requirements.

TOTAL UNITS 48 PRACTICUM AND SEMINAR HOURS 480 + 60 Cytotechnology \u2014AH (B.S., certificate) MARLENE M. OTA, Program Director Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad field of clinical laboratory science. The cytotechnologist, working under the direction of a pathologist, detects cell changes caused by different disease processes; and is able to differentiate between normal, atypical, andmalignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopicabnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from vari - ous body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the patholo-gist in detecting cancer at its earliest and potentiallymost curable stage. As a result, physicians are able todiagnose and treat cancer long before discovering itsexistence by alternate methods. Opportunities Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employmentoutlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with thedemand for trained workers exceeding the supply.Cytotechnologists can advance to supervisory posi-tions, participate in research activities, or becometeachers in the field. Advancement is based on experi-ence, skill, and advanced education. The program The Cytotechnology Program, based on the com - pletion of two years of study at an accredited college oruniversity, leads either to a certificate or to a certifi-cate and a Bachelor of Science degree. The program ofstudy begins with the Autumn Quarter. A certificate is awarded at the completion of the fourth quarter of study, and those electing to continue are awarded theBachelor of Science degree upon the completion of anadditional two quarters of study. With the certificate in cytotechnology and the baccalaureate degree, the stu- dent is eligible to take a national examination andbecome a registered cytotechnologist. Registered cytotechnologists entering the program to receive the Bachelor of Science degree are consid- ered to have completed, on the basis of registry, the equivalent course work listed in the first four quartersof the program. A total of 64 quarter units is appliedtoward the graduation requirements, provided thecourse work in pathology is equivalent to that offered inthe certificate program at this University . Where credit in pathology is not equivalent, the requirement may bemet by taking AHCJ 402, 403 at this University; or bycompleting a minimum of 8 quarter units of upper-divi-sion course work in developmental biology or compara- tive animal physiology at an accredited college or uni-versity. A writing-validation examination and a math- ematics-competency examination will be administeredto all students. For those students achieving a score ofless than 4 on the Wholistic Writing Score Sheet, reme- dial writing must be taken within the first academic year. Upon retest, the student must achieve a score of 4 or higher. A passing score of 75 percent must beachieved in the mathematics competency examination.

KRISTI J. WILKINS, Chair FACULTY Darlene Webster Kristi WilkinsEllen Young Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the undergraduate program of the School of Dentistry, is largely concerned with preventive oral health services and maintenance care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratoryexercises, and clinical assignments have been devel-oped to provide training in the variety of proceduresdelegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continualgrowth and proficiency in performance of all traditionaland expanded-function procedures. The purpose of the program is to develop profes - sionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally pre-pared to deal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate thelatest in research are important adjuncts to clinicaltraining. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a variety of career options avail - able to a dental hygienist. Curriculum Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with preventive health services.The hygienist works in association with the dentist inprivate-practice offices, industrial organizations,schools, hospitals, state or federal public health serv-ices, and the armed forces. Salary ranges compare withthose for registered nurses. The curriculum is organized as a four-year college program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. Thefreshman and sophomore years of largely prescribed,preprofessional study may be taken at any accreditedcollege. The professional program begins with the jun - ior year in the School of Dentistry. The program is approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditationof the American Dental Association. The first class atthis University graduated in 1961. Philosophy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integrity, indus- try, responsibility, and depth of human understanding.Therefore, the program of instruction is planned on astrong liberal arts foundation. The student is encour - aged to take electives that contribute to breadth ofknowledge and quality of values. The choice of electivesin early college work is important for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in applicants with the potential to become hygienists who are well-read and gracious persons\u2014prepared to communicateeffectively in professional and community relation-ships. They should be able to draw on knowledge of thestructure and function of the human body in healthand disease, applying resources based on Christian ideals and values to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to develop the atti- tudes and skills which will most effectively serve soci-ety. Goal The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to edu- cate competent, concerned, and active members of thedental hygiene profession who possess the ability toeffectively perform the expanding scope of practice ofthe dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian val- ues and beliefs and the concept of whole-person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowshipamong faculty and students are interwoven into dailyacademic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interac- tions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, this pro-gram also places great importance on providing anatmosphere in which students can develop the skills necessary to objectively assess new theories and trends in dentistry, in light of scientific knowledge and princi-ples. By combining Christian values with an apprecia - tion for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply sound principles to patient careand exhibit God' s love in the quality of service they render. Admission The student must have a diploma or its equivalent from a four -year secondary school, and must meet col - lege-entrance requirements. After successful comple- tion of the prescribed pre-entrance course work in anaccredited college or university , admission to the Den - tal Hygiene Program is in the junior year. For entrance to the junior professional year, the applicant must have: 96 quarter or 64 semester units of acceptable college credit. NOTE: Loma Linda University requires all students who graduate with a baccalaureate degree to complete a minimum of 68 quarter units of general education, which are integratedinto the entire undergraduate program.

The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive inscope, and that is based on sound biological principles . Curriculum Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to ben- efit society and, therefore, continually assesses its pro-fessional services to ascertain what measures,attitudes, and skills most effectively serve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to knowledge of the structure and function of the human being inhealth and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery andcorrelation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associatedprofessional personnel in both delivery of healthcare and contribution to community well-being byeducation for the prevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for con- tributing to the body of scientific knowledge by ques - tioning, investigating, and teaching; for remainingsensitive and adaptive to the needs of humanity inever-changing conditions; and for maintaining con-sciousness of the individual obligation to live, practice, and strive for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be com- pleted in four academic years, fulfills requirements forthe Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Objective The primary objective of the dental curriculum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purposeof the University and the goals of the School of Den - tistry, which include advancing knowledge and under-standing of health, disease, and ways to improve healthand the dental health care-delivery system throughbasic and applied research. Admission standards Before starting the first (D1) year, the applicant must have completed a minimum of three academicyears and no fewer than 96 semester or 144 quarterunits in a college accredited by a regional accrediting association. Acceptance is contingent on completion of specified subject requirements. A four-year undergrad-uate curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree is highlyrecommended. A student having completed such adegree is given preference for admission to the dental program. As a rule, credits earned in professional schools (business, medical technology ,nursing, veterinary medicine, pharmacy ,or medicine) do not fulfill admis - sion requirements. Loma Linda University School of Dentistry insists that all dental students must possess the capabilitiesrequired to complete the full curriculum in the allottedtime and to achieve the levels of competence requiredby the faculty. In broad terms, the following are stan- dards required for admission: Intellectual capability to complete the curriculum.Emotional adaptability and stability. Social and perceptual skills. Physical ability to carry out activities in observations and communications, and thepossession of sufficient motor and sensory abilities topractice general dentistry. For admission, the applicant must meet specific criteria related to past academic performance (G.P.A.),performance on the Dental Admission Test, and analy-sis of a personal profile interview. The weight given tothese admission factors is approximately equal. Students who are enrolled in a graduate program in the University are not considered for admission untilthey have completed or have been released from the graduate program. Credits for college work should show a minimum grade-point average of 2.7 in science subjects and innonscience subjects, averaged separately. The student must have a grade of C or above for all required pre- entrance course work. Prior to consideration for admission, the applicant is required to have taken the test recommended by theAmerican Dental Association. The student entering thefirst (D1) year is expected to have taken the test withinthe past two years, preferably not later than October ofthe year preceding admission. At the applicant'srequest, test results are sent to the School by the test - ing service. Information may be obtained directly from the American Dental Association, 211 East ChicagoAvenue, Chicago, IL 60611. Or an application form anddescriptive material may be obtained from the Schoolof Dentistry . Physical requirements Atechnical standards policy defines special physi- cal requirements for students entering the School ofDentistry. This policy is outlined in Section III of this CATALOG under Admissions Information and is avail- able in the School of Dentistry Office of StudentAffairs. Background The subjects listed as required form the minimum background for professional study. The student shouldavoid duplicating science courses that are offered inthe professional curriculum and should plan a college program in keeping with individual interests and abili- ties. The student' spurpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowledge, the cultivation of an inquiring mind, the practice of efficient methods of study, andthe habit of thinking and reasoning independently . These are of paramount importance to the student's development as a unique and responsible human being. The choice of electives can broaden the student's view of the scope of knowledge. Being well read will give a perspective on the sweep of human thought throughout the ages, and often this will be of assistance in written andverbal communication and will improve the ability tothink and express oneself well. Psychological, social,philosophical, and religious insights will help developbasic resources for the solution of personal problems andthe growth of that self-understanding the student mustfirst have to understand and help associates.220 UNIVERSITY CATALOGPRE-ENTRY REQUIREMENTS Although the predentistry curriculum in an accred- ited college can be completed in three years, a bac- calaureate degree, or the equivalent, is stronglyrecommended.

Periodontics encompasses the study of the sup-porting structures of the teeth; as well as the etiology,pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases thataffect the supporting structures of the teeth. The studyof periodontics helps form basic concepts of health anddisease. These concepts are applied in the treatment ofperiodontal diseases and in the maintenance of dentalhealth over a patient's lifetime, providing comprehen- sive dental therapy for the individual patient. In this way the Department of Periodontics contributes directly to the School of Dentistry' sacademic and serv- ice mission \"to make 705 Introduction to Periodontics PERI 741 Essential Periodontal Therapy ,Lecture (1) PERI 742 Essential Periodontal Therapy, Laboratory (1) PERI 751 Planning and Evaluation in Periodontal Therapy (1) PERI 765 Special Topics in Periodontal Therapy (2) PERI 805 Periodontal Surgical Therapy (1)PERI 875 Periodontics Clinic (7.5) RESTORA TIVE DENTISTR Y DOUGLASS B.

Wilber Although the science of epidemiology began with the investigation of the infectious disease outbreaks, the modern plagues of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and injuries are also considered by the modern epi-demiologist. Contemporary epidemiology builds uponthe premise that disease or health is not randomly dis - tributed within populations. Epidemiology comprisesthe research methods that identify and isolate the underlying causes of disease and injury as well ashealth. The diversity of this investigative science isillustrated by a number of research accomplishmentsranging from identification of control and preventive measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus; to etiologic processes important in the development of malignantneoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious dis - eases. Other accomplishments of epidemiology includediscovery of social and biological mechanisms involved in the spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis throughhuman populations; and preventive measures for surgi-cal-wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Con-temporary epidemiologic inquiry ranges from investigation ofthe roles of prescription medications, nutrition, electromag-netic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identi-fication of the health benefits of cholesterol reduction,smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis.The epidemiologist studies the distribution and deter-minants of health and disease in populations. Theemphasis placed upon the investigative process hasTHE PROGRAMS 247inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a med- ical detective. Epidemiologic research incorporates useof statistical techniques and an understanding of envi-ronmental, genetic, and social characteristics impor-tant in disease development and spread. Although epidemiology is a relatively young disci- pline, this collection of investigative methods has become an integral part of public health; epidemiologic findings permeate all fields of human health. The effi- cacy and confirmed success of epidemiology guaranteean exciting future for those who meet the challenges ofthis advancing science. Program goals The Epidemiology Program: 1. Trains students to become professionals in epidemiology. 2. Fosters a spirit of collaboration among students and faculty by including students in research projects and as teaching assistants. 3. Provides practical research experience, including presentation of data, through field practice in apublic health department or other agency, or onone of the research projects within the University. 4. Conducts high-quality research, collaborates on research projects within the School of PublicHealth and Loma Linda University, and developsresearch collaboration with other academic andresearch communities. 5.Provides consultation services regarding research design; and analyzes and interprets results to other groups within the University, the community, andoutside agencies.

The program is designed to meet the diverse needs of professionals in gerontology and will accom- plish a number of objectives: To prepare students for positions in teaching, research, and aging administration at the local,state, and federal public levels; as well as in the private sector . To prepare students for careers in health and human services for older adults. To provide students with a thorough knowledge of social science theory and the application of theory and research to current problems in gerontology . To prepare students to conduct social research on aging and the effect of policies and programs on the lives of older adults. To provide students with a thorough knowledge of current issues in gerontology and the importanceof the relationship of gerontology to otherdisciplines and professions\u2014such as social work,psychology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, andpublic health. Program description All students must complete a two-year program consisting of 48 quarter units of course work. The 24units of foundation content required for all students are258 UNIVERSITY CATALOGfollowed by one of the two concentrations: administra- tion or clinical services. Students opting for the admin-istration concentration will study the economicdimensions of social policy, organizational theory, pub-lic administration, program planning, and policy analy-sis as they relate to geriatric population and services.The clinical services concentration provides students with both global and domestic perspectives on vio- lence, mental health, and drug-and alcohol-abuse issues. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtfulreflection about public philosophy and ethical issues ingerontology that will provide students with a deeperunderstanding of the logic influencing policy, adminis-tration, and practice issues affecting the field. Prerequisite preparation This master's degree builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation. The required prerequisite course work provides students with foundation concepts and/or skills in each of the following: Interviewing and counseling (3) Human growth and development (3) Cross-cultural issues (3) Introductory statistics (3) Unit values represent the quarter system of measurement. Admissions requirements This program follows the admission requirements of the School of Science and Technology, including: 1.Applicants must demonstrate satisfactory performance on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE).

Submission of a completed application, including a personal statement, application fee, all collegeand/or university transcripts, and three letters of recommendation (one from an academic sourceand one from a work supervisor preferred). CURRICULUM The 48-unit curriculum of the Master of Science degree in gerontology provides the mix of aca- demic, experiential, and research activities essential for M.S. degree students. Students must maintain agrade-point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a4.0 scale); and meet the knowledge, skill, and profes-sional performance competencies outlined by the pro-gram. Students must also maintain a B- (2.7) or betterin all required (core) courses, and a minimum of a C(2.0) in all selective courses. Courses with grades falling below the standards set for required and selec- tive courses must be repeated. Students are financiallyresponsible for the cost of repeating courses when grades do not meet these minimum standards. General overview The two-year, 48 unit program begins with core course work required for all students. Courses duringthe first year of study are divided into four professionalareas: social science theory; practice; religion, philoso-phy, and ethics; and social research methods. At theend of the first year, the student selects a concentra-tion area (administration or clinical services), requir - ing 13 units of concentration specific course work. Regardless of the concentration students choose, theyare given the option of either a thesis or a professionalpracticum experience. Students who choose the thesisoption complete 6 related units of research and 5 unitsof selectives. Students choosing the professionalpracticum option complete 9 units of professionalpracticum (requiring 540 hours of integratedpracticum and seminar) and 11 eleven units of selec - tives.

Welebir *ex officio Health care records are part of an integrated system of health information. The data provide a basis for patient care, quality assurance, legal defense, reim-bursement, risk management, accreditation, planning,and decision making. The health information depart- ment has assumed increased importance with the advent of prospective- payment corporate compliance and the necessity for diagnostic and procedural informa-tion. A career in health information management is likely to appeal to a person who has organizational and leadership abilities and who is interested in and hasaptitude for medical science, but whose talents aresuited for participation other than physical involve-ment in human illness. The health information admin - istrator (formerly known as medical record administra- tor) designs, develops, and maintains systems for stor-age, retrieval, and dissemination of information inaccordance with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This person works with the medical staff and other health professionals in research, administra-tive studies, functions relative to health information,and patient-care evaluation. The health informationadministrator in a health care facility will providemanagement leadership in planning and organizing thedepartment, motivating and evaluating employees, andproviding in-service programs for departmentalemployees or other personnel in the facility. Opportunities While many health information administrators are employed in various areas of acute-care facilities, others work in alternative-delivery health care systems, research facilities, quality assurance, data companies, industrial establishments, governmental agencies, med- ical departments of insurance companies, accountingfirms, or as consultants to skilled-nursing and otherfacilities. The multiplicity of new technologies, the advent of electronic health records, the demand for healthinformation, the emphasis on evaluation of care, thesurge in research, the emphasis on cost control, andother factors combine to require comprehensive knowledge and increased utilization of administrative talent and judgment.

MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY\u2014M.S. CANADIAN CAMPUS PROGRAM (This program is not accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education [COAMFTE], the accrediting body for the AAMFT) The Canadian campus program is an innovative ven- ture that combines the teaching expertise of the Loma Linda University California campus faculty, theCanadian campus program faculty, and adjunctinstructors and guest lecturers from the local profes-sional community. A clinically based program, coursesare taught on campus utilizing two methods of instruc- tion. Approximately half the courses are taught on an intensive basis. Typically, 2-unit intensives run forthree days, Monday through Wednesday; and 3-unitintensives run for four days, Monday throughThursday. Generally, there is one intensive scheduled per month. The remainder of the courses meet once a week (except during intensive weeks) for the full quar - ter. Courses are taught three quarters per year, mid- September through mid-June. It should be noted thatcertain courses cannot be offered on an intensive basis and require weekly attendance. Loma Linda University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (W ASC) in the United States, and the Canadian campus pro- gram is recognized by Alberta Advanced Education(Private Institutions) as a graduate degree-grantingprogram. The Canadian campus program is officiallydirected by the California campus and meets theWASC accreditation requirements. Depending on undergraduate preparation and the course work selected, students graduating from thisprogram may be qualified to become provisionallychartered as psychologists in the province of Alberta,or registered social workers with the Alberta College ofSocial Workers. Marriage and family therapy is anunregulated profession in Alberta. However, we doencourage students to become concurrent members ofthe American Association for Marriage and FamilyTherapy. This organization has collegial benefits to thestudent, long-term legislative initiatives, as well as a local chapter, the Alberta Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.

Loma Linda University Department of Counseling and Family Sciences offers the Ph.D. and the D.M.F.T. degrees in marital and family therapy. Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy The Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy (MFT) follows the scientist-practitioner model, inwhich students are expected to develop expertise bothin empirical research methods and clinical practice forcareers in teaching and research. The Ph.D. degree inmarital and family therapy is a 108-unit programrequiring three-to-four years for completion\u2014includ-ing two-to-three years of course work, a dissertation,and clinical internship. D.M.F.T. degree in marriage and family therapy The D.M.F.T. degree follows the practitioner-evalu- ator model and focuses on applied-skill developmentfor use in clinical practice and administrative posi - tions. The D.M.F .T. degree is a 108-unit program,requiring three to four years for completion\u2014including doctoral project and clinical internship. Interim master's degree The Ph.D. degree with interim master's degree or the D.M.F.T. degree with interim master's degreerequires 168 and 160 units, respectively. These pro-grams are for selected advanced students who have abachelor's degree, or for students whose master'sdegree is not in marital and family therapy (or equiva-lent). They take approximately five years to complete. Concentrations All doctoral students must complete a 12-unit concentration in a special area of focus of their choice.Examples include, but are not limited to: Families, systems, and health Family studies Professional consultation and systems relations Clinical mediation School counseling MFT licensure track (for students who have not previously met academic requirements for MFT licensure) Marriage and family therapy is established in California by law as a profession requiring state licen-sure. Persons who desire to enter the profession musthave the proper academic and clinical preparation andmust pass the written and oral licensing examinations.The doctoral degree programs at Loma LindaUniversity are designed to provide the academicrequirements to meet the California licensing stan-dards according to Business and Professions Code4980.38. The Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy and the D.M.F.T. degree offered by Loma LindaUniversity were awarded candidacy status in 2003 bythe Commission on Accreditation of Marriage andFamily Therapy Education (COAMFTE), the accredit - ing body associated with the American Association forMarriage and Family Therapy. Purpose and mission The purpose of the doctoral programs in marital and family therapy is to develop family therapy schol-ars who will advance theory, research, clinical prac-tice, community involvement and teaching in the field of marital and family therapy. Students will be pre- pared for research, teaching, supervision, administra-tion, and clinical training positions in health-care set - tings, in training institutes, and in institutions offeringgraduate degrees. The D.M.F.T. degree program offers the opportunity to expand clinical skills and preparesstudents with expertise in program-evaluation researchmethods. Ph.D. degree students develop expertise inconducting original research from both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Knowledge and skills promoted Students study the work of the original thinkers in marital and family therapy , as well as the most recent developments in the field\u2014such as social construc- tionism, narrative and solution-oriented therapies, andreflecting teams. They will develop a critical under - standing of the theoretical and philosophical founda - tions of MFT; critically examine the interrelationships between sociohistorical factors, family structures andTHE PROGRAMS 285286 UNIVERSITY CATALOG relationships and clinical approaches; be conversant in the current issues in the field; and contribute to thediscourse regarding them. Personal development The program encourages students to develop a clear understanding of themselves and to considerreflectively the impact of their personal values, socialpositions, and contexts on their clinical and scholarlypractices. Students are supported in the development oftheir strengths as they create an epistemological frame-work and ethical consciousness to guide their work. Practice and supervisory skills Students will apply a critical understanding of the- ory to the practice of marital and family therapy at thefamily, community, and societal levels, drawing on thecore modalities of the field. They will develop sophisti-cation in their personal clinical skills, supervisory skills, and skills for active multisystemic involvement. Research and evaluation skills Students will develop skills and a critical under- standing of the process of research and evaluation related to families and marital and family therapy. Thisincludes the ability to apply research findings to clini - cal practice and to utilize research findings in creativeways for the benefit of the general population.Students in the Ph.D. degree program will develop expertise in both qualitative and quantitative research methods, leading to publication in scholarly journalsand presentations at professional conferences. D.M.F .T. degree students will focus on evaluation of program performance and outcomes in practice-based settings. Core ideas guiding the MFT doctoral programs Relational systems: People are best understood within the cultural, spiritual, and relational systems inwhich they are embedded. Change, therefore, occursin the context of family , community , and interpersonal relationships. These programs focus on both the struc- tured relational patterns of communication and inter-action and on the systems of meaning that define andshape these patterns. Wholeness: These programs encourage wholeness by attending to the physical, mental, social, and spiri-tual dimensions of human experience. These dimen - sions reciprocally interact at every level. Social forces: The programs are guided by a belief that social contexts and processes influence meanings,values, and people's understandings of self, family, andothers. Particular emphasis is placed on research focusing on social forces relevant to the distinctive multicultural mix of families in the southern California region, the interrelationship between faith and family relationships throughout the world, the effects of the changing health care system and of medical technology; and collaboration among education, family, work, and legal systems. Healing power of relationships: As people become more connected to each other and their communities,the potential for growth and healing are enhanced, andthe opportunities for making positive contributions aremaximized. Students are encouraged to develop theirtherapeutic relationship and community-involvementskills so that they can cocreate an environment ofsafety, respect, compassion, openness, and community participation. Diversity: An appreciation of the importance of social forces requires interest in and respect for thediverse experiences and perceptions of human beings.Different social contexts such as race, ethnicity, reli-gion, gender, and socioeconomic status result in a wide variety of meanings and behavior patterns in mar- riages, families, and intimate relationships. The pro- grams seek to create a diverse mix of students and fac-ulty, and to challenge all who are involved to learnfrom the richness of multiple perspectives. Empirical process: The programs encourage clini- cal work and theory development grounded in anempirical understanding of human experience.Students are offered the opportunity to develop theircapacities to utilize inductive and deductive reasoning;as well as objectivity, subjectivity, and intersubjectivity in research and therapy. Education and prevention: Connections at family, school, and community levels are important compo-nents of resilience. The programs emphasize helpingindividuals and families access their relational compe- tencies as an important part of prevention, as well as the resolution of their current difficulties. Spirituality: These programs view spirituality as central to wholeness and healing. Students are encour-aged to integrate their practices of faith with their pro - fessional work. The programs place strong emphasison active demonstration of moral and ethical princi-ples as exemplified by, but not limited to, Judeo-Christian teachings. Worldwide focus: The missions of the programs reach beyond the local and national community to theinternational community. This includes our collabora-tion with people from other nations and cultures topromote mutual understanding, resolve problems, andstrengthen families.

Medical Scientist \u2014SM (M.D. with Ph.D.) ANTHONY J. ZUCCARELLI, Program Director FACULTY The Faculty participation in this program come from the biomedical science programs of the School of Medicine, from the clinical departments of the Schoolof Medicine at Loma Linda University, and fromresearch laboratories outside of Loma LindaUniversity. Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academicmedicine and medical research may wish to enroll inone of the combined-degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student' s independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides stu- dents with a broad educational base for the practice ofmedicine and medically related research. The pro - gram is administered by the School of Medicine. During the first three years of the program, students follow an integrated curriculum that includes medical courses, graduate education, and research training. The Medical Scientist Program integrates the edu- cational tracks leading to the Ph.D. and M.D. degrees. The first-year curriculum includes a course sequence, taught by interdisciplinary faculty , that inte - grates all the disciplines of the biomedical basic sci - ence areas\u2014moving from molecules, through cellular mechanisms to integrated systems. In addition, a sup - plemental course covers research-related topics\u2014such as scientific communication and integrity, informationhandling, and statistics; as well as successful grant writing. Students learn of new developments in the biomedical sciences through weekly seminars.Students gain presentation skills of their own in aweekly student presentation-seminar series. Duringthe subsequent years, formal courses continue tobroaden and integrate into a meaningful whole anunderstanding of the clinical consequences of cellularevents. Beginning in the fourth year and continuing for two or more years, students pursue full-time researchon a project of their own design within the graduateprograms of human anatomy , biochemistry , microbiol-292 UNIVERSITY CATALOGogy and molecular genetics, physiology, or pharmacol- ogy. Subsequent courses in the curriculum includespecialized areas of biomedical and clinical sciences.Research and dissertation are supervised by graduatefaculty of the basic biomedical sciences. Researchtraining within these programs is available in national-ly recognized research laboratories in the School of Medicine. After the Ph.D. degree, students return to the medical curriculum for the two years of clinical train-ing required to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree. Admission to Ph.D./M.D. Medical Scientist Program An application to the School of Medicine, processed through the American Medical CollegeApplication Service (AMCAS), should be completed byNovember prior to the year admission is desired. TheMedical Scientist Program admissions committee bases its recommendations upon academic criteria; personal interviews; scores from the GRE General Test andMCAT; and other measures of analytical potential, cre- ativity, compassion, and initiative. Accepted applicants are invited to participate in ongoing research in one ofthe biomedical science departments during the sum-mer preceding their matriculation. Curriculum The curriculum is innovative in content and sequence. It includes courses that provide a pervasiveresearch perspective, as well as those that providebasic instruction in clinical sciences. A three-quartercourse sequence in biochemistry, molecular biology,cell biology, and immunology taken during the firstyear emphasizes analytical thinking and problem solv-ing as a foundation for a research-oriented approach tobiomedical science and clinical medicine. Seminar ses - sions merge research and clinical approaches to med - ical problems and expand the perspective of the pro- gram to include organ systems and disease processes. Curriculum sequence The typical sequence of courses in the curriculum is outlined below, though several variations are possi-ble, with approval of the program director and curricu-lum committee. FIRST YEAR Biochemistry Molecular biology Cell biologyImmunologyBiomedical science seminarIntroduction to researchResearch rotations FIRST SUMMER Research SECOND YEAR School of Medicine freshman year Biomedical science seminar SECOND SUMMER Research THIRD YEAR School of Medicine sophomore year Biomedical science seminarNational board examination (USMLE Step I) RESEARCH YEARS Two or more years to complete research, graduate course work, and dissertations for Ph.D. degree JUNIOR YEAR School of Medicine SENIOR YEAR School of Medicine Advisement Admitted students are advised by the Medical Scientist Program director. During the second year,students select a basic science program (anatomy, bio-chemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, phar- macology, or physiology) in which they will pursue their subsequent research and graduate course work.After making that selection, they will be guided by thecoordinator for that graduate program and by aresearch guidance committee. Time limits Limits apply to the time allotted for the comple- tion of graduate degrees. Four years (between thesophomore and junior years of the School of Medicinecurriculum) are allowed for the completion of a Ph.D.degree; two years are allowed for completion of theM.S. degree. Completion within these limits is requiredto retain eligibility for further tuition waivers for M.D.degree course work. Students are expected to complete their graduate degree prior to resuming the M.D. degree in the junioryear. No additional financial aid will be provided formedical school tuition until the graduate degree iscompleted. Financial assistance Financial assistance to students in the Medical Scientist Program may provide: 1. Stipends during those periods in which students are most directly involved in graduate educationthe first year and the research years. The amountof the stipend is equivalent to that available toPh.D. degree students in the basic science graduate programs. 2. Tuition waivers for all graduate program course work. 3. Tuition deferment for the freshman and sophomore years of the M.D. degree curriculum. When a student completes an M.S. or Ph.D. degree, tuition deferred from the freshman and sophomoreyears is canceled. 4. A tuition waiver for two quarters of tuition during the junior or senior years in the M.D. degreecurriculum, upon completion of an M.S. degree. 5. Tuition waiver for both the junior and senior years of the M.D. curriculum, upon completion of aPh.D. degree.THE PROGRAMS 293Completion of the M.D. degree terminates the stu- dent's participation in the Medical Scientist Programand ends the availability of tuition waiver. Any tuitiondeferments then in force will convert to loan obliga-tions at that time. Medicine \u2014SM (M.D.) H. ROGER HADLEY, Dean, School of Medicine CURRICULUM The curriculum in medicine consists of four academ- ic years. Instruction is on the quarter system. The first six quarters are oriented to the sciences basic tothe practice of medicine; the remaining two academicyears are made up of clinically oriented core instruc-tion and up to eighteen weeks of clinical electives. THE FRESHMAN YEAR consists of the study of anatomy/embryology, biochemistry/molecularbiology/genetics, cell structure and function, under - standing your patient, fundamental principles of physi- cal diagnosis, evidence-based medicine and informa - tion sciences, and neuroscience.

Zumwalt UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Undergraduate curricula The sections that follow describe the undergradu- ate curricula offered by the School of Nursing (Bachelor of Science degree and the Associate in Science degree option) and list the courses each stu-dent must complete. Students are expected to operateunder the general policies of the University and school and specific policies of the degree program in which they are enrolled. The school reserves the right toupdate and modify the curriculum to keep currentwith trends in health care. B.S. degree /A.S. degree option The primary aim of the School of Nursing under - graduate nursing program is to prepare competent practitioners who are committed to excellence in prac-tice and to Christian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. However , in response to both societal and students' needs, an Associate in Science(A.S.) degree option is provided for students after theyhave completed all nursing and general education con-tent necessary to prepare for licensure as a registerednurse in California. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in nursing is consis-tent with the faculty belief that students should bebroadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis ofnursing knowledge and skills with knowledge and skillsfrom the humanities and sciences. Preparation forpractice includes experiences in primary , secondary , and tertiary health care with clients from various age and cultural groups and socioeconomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neuman Systems Model, which addresses stressors to the client system. Undergraduate program sequence The undergraduate program begins with four quar - ters of preclinical work, which forms the general edu- cation and science base for nursing. These quartersmay be completed at any accredited college or univer-sity. Following six quarters of clinical instruction, addi- tional general education, and cognate courses at Loma Linda University School of Nursing, the student is eli - gible to receive the A.S. degree and is prepared to write the state board examination. After completion ofanother two quarters, the student is eligible to receivethe B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nurs-ing practice at the baccalaureate level. The clinicalexperience develops the student's technical and theo-retical capabilities in a progressive manner and withinthe context of the nursing process: assessment, analy - sis, planning, implementing, evaluating. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper division,THE PROGRAMS 317where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components of upper-divisioncourses are leadership concepts and skills, research,health promotion, and activities which foster collabo-ration in planning health care with the family and allmembers of the health care team.

Prerequisites to the junior year Progression to the bachelor's degree program to become a registered dietitian requires completion of all the prerequisites for the bachelor' s degree. These include introductory chemistry with laboratory (full sequence),microbiolo gy, general psychology, and humanities\u2014 including cultural diversity/cultural anthropology. Thedietetic technician, registered, (DTR), should complete ayear of practice before applying to the bachelor's degreeprogram. NUTRITION AND DIETETICS\u2014B.S. Dietetics, a vital profession in the field of health pro - motion, focuses on the sciences of nutrition and management in feeding individuals and groupsthroughout the life cycle. The coordinated program indietetics combines supervised professional practicewith didactic curriculum to develop professional skillsconcurrently with cognitive and technical skills toenable the graduate to establish eligibility to become aregistered dietitian. Admission to the program is based on a selective process. To be eligible for consideration, the applicantmust meet the following criteria: completion of subjectrequirements, as indicated, at an accredited college oruniversity; a 3.0 G.P.A. or above; an interview; a letter of application; and recommendations. Opportunities Dietetic practice is the application of principles derived from integrating knowledge of food, nutrition, biochemistry, physiology, business and management, journalism, behavioral and social sciences, and thearts to achieve and maintain health, prevent disease,and facilitate recovery from illness. Members of the dietetics profession practice in a variety of environments, including hospitals and other health care facilities, schools and universities, govern-ment and community agencies, business, and industry. A growing number of dietitians are employed in physi- cians' offices, clinics, home-health care agencies, masscommunication, and many other entrepreneurial roles. By successfully passing the registration examina- tion for dietitians, practice opportunities as a specialistin medical nutrition therapy , administrative dietetics, nutrition education, community nutrition, or researchare available. There is increased recognition of theimportance of nutrition in the fields of medicine, den- tistry, and health promotion\u2014with emphasis on fitnessand optimal well-being. This indicates that the dietit-ian's scope of practice is steadily widening. Medical nutrition therapy The registered dietitian in medical nutrition thera- py applies the science of nutrition to the care of peo-ple through health promotion and disease preventionand uses medical-nutrition therapy in the treatment ofdisease. The effective dietitian must be aware of thecultural, social, economic, aesthetic, and psychologicalfactors that affect eating patterns. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitor- ing the nutritional care of patients. In addition, the RDmay serve professionally as a nutrition practitioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments ofhealth. Administrative dietetics The registered dietitian (RD) in management is accountable for the food-service systems. In a health care institution, the RD is responsible for the effective functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical staff, and personnel.The administrative RD may also teach; manage foodsystems in educational, public, or commercial facili-ties; serve as a consultant to health care or education-al institutions; or enter the field of research. Community dietetitian Community registered dietitians practice in diverse settings, translating nutrition science intoimproved health status. Challenges may include form-ing partnerships with various organizations, masteringtechnology, enacting regulations and policies that pro-tect and improve the public' s health, and creatively managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high-quality leadership and plan-ning skills, and many create positions that are entre - preneurial as well as financially rewarding. THE PROGRAM The Nutrition and Dietetics Program is established to prepare entry-level dietitians to join the profes- sion and contribute to the wholeness of mankind. Thegraduate is awarded the Bachelor of Science degreeand is eligible to write the registration examination of the Commission on Dietetic Registration.

Schwab Patricia Shiokari Su-Erickson Heather ThomasDonna G. ThorpeYvonne C. Christine M. WietlisbachDorre Y amashiro Zane RichardsonClarissa Saunders-Newton *ex officio The occupational therapist and occupational therapy assistant work with persons who find it difficult to cope with psychological or physiological dysfunction. The primary concern of both therapist and assis- tant is to stimulate those changes in behavior patternsthat will increase the patient's personal independenceand ability to work within his/her cultural and person-al milieu. T o accomplish this goal, the occupational therapist evaluates the patient; sets up treatment goals; and works together with the occupational thera - py assistant in selecting tasks from the gamut of nor - mal daily self-care activities, using them to assist the patient in gaining independent-living skills regardlessof disability or handicap. Essential to the role of occupational therapy is an interest in the behavioral sciences and a concern forthe individual's need to find proper adjustments to life's circumstances. A desire to teach and a back- ground or interest in medical science are beneficial.Those inclined to mechanical or scientific techniquesare suited to helping patients develop their capacitiesfor employment. Others find that they can use theirinterests in creative arts, crafts, music, and teaching towork with disabled homemakers, children, and retiredpersons. Opportunities Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants practice in general hospitals, rehabilitationcenters, pediatric or psychiatric clinics, schools, skilled-nursing facilities, home care, and outpatientcommunity-centered programs (including hand-reha - bilitation, work-evaluation, and adult day-care facili - ties). Occupational therapy professionals have a wide choice of positions (using varied therapeutic skills withindividuals of varying age and disability) and opportu- nities for advancement.

V ermeersch CALIFORNIA ST ATE UNIVERSITY SAN BERNARDINO FACULTY Aspart of a consortial agreement between the Departments of Psychology at Loma Linda University (LLU) and California State University atSan Bernardino (CSUSB), a select number of profes-sors whose primary appointment is at CSUSB have adjunct appointments in psychology at Loma LindaUniversity. These faculty members teach, mentor, andsupervise students in research and clinical practice onaregular basis: David V. Chavez Gloria Cowan Charles D. HoffmanMichael LewinFaith McClure Frederick Newton Edward Teyber The School of Science and Technology's Department of Psychology offers a combination of innovative training opportunities in clinical and experimentalpsychology. The Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) and theDoctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees are offered in thearea of clinical psychology and are APA accredited. The Ph.D. and M.A. degrees also are offered with emphases in a number of experimental offered. programs\u2014Ph.D./M.A. orPsy.D./M.A. degrees in biomedical and clinical ethics\u2014 are offered in coordination with the Faculty ofReligion. The Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology has been informed by the traditional scientist-practitionermodel, which emphasizes training in research andclinical practice. The Psy.D. degree, influenced by thepractitioner -scholar model, emphasizes training in clinical practice based on the understanding and appli- cation of scientific psychological principles andresearch. The Psy .D./Dr .P.H. combined-degrees pro - gram combines training in psychology and health sci- ences to prepare individuals who will be qualified inthe application of psychology to health promotion,preventive medicine, and health care; as well as forclinical practice and research. The M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in experimental psy - chology are designed to train a select number of indi - viduals for research and academic careers in basic aswell as applied psychology. Applications for the experi-mental Ph.D. degree are currently accepted in generalexperimental psychology ,per- ception, cognition and performance, and develop- ment); and applied social psychology (e.g., cross-cul-tural and health psychology). Additional areas willbecome available with the planned expansion of the faculty in coming years. The specific objectives of the AP A-accredited Ph.D. degree program in clinical psychology are to train its students to be scientist-practitioners which,according to the Loma Linda University Ph.D. clinical model, means that they will be given\u2014 asolid academic foundation, high-level training in the empirical methods of science so that they are capable of conducting independent and original research, and the skills to be highly competent clinicians from whom research and practice constantly inform each other. 366 UNIVERSITY CATALOGAmong the outcome measures used to determine the clinical Ph.D. program's success in achieving theabove-mentioned objectives are the following: 1. Academic foundations course evaluations and the comprehensive examination. 2. Training in empirical methods of science\u2014 second-year project or master's degree grants; research teachingassistantships; teaching positions in area colleges;and membership in scientific/professionalorganizations. 3. Clinical skills\u2014ongoing clinical evaluations; the quality and type of internships obtained; and thefinal clinical proficiency examination. The specific objectives of the APA-accredited Psy.D. degree program are to train students to be prac-titioner-scholars which, according to the Loma Linda University model, means training them with: a solid academic foundation, the highest level of clinical skills, and the ability to apply research relevant to clinical issues and cases. Among the outcomes measures used to determine the Psy.D. degree program's success in achieving theabove-mentioned objectives are the following: 1. Academic foundations course evaluations and the comprehensive examination. 2. Clinical skills ongoing clinical evaluations, the quality and type of internships obtained, and thefinal clinical proficiency examination. 3. Application of research the doctoral project; involvement in community-based programdevelopment, evaluation, and consultatIon; andmembership in professional organizations. The Psychology Program emphasizes research and practice based on the scientific principles and meth - ods of psychology and related disciplines. This empha-sis takes place within the context of an approach tohuman health and welfare, which is consistent withthe institutional motto, \"To Make Man Whole.\" A sys-tematic attempt is made, through the wholeness com-ponent of the curriculum, to promote an understand - ing of human behavior in relation to the psychological,physical, spiritual, and social/cultural aspects of being human. In this way the Psychology Program provides,in addition to the traditional training, a positive envi - ronment for the study of cultural, social, and spiritual issues relevant to psychological research and practice in contemporary American society and around the world.

Religion and the Sciences \u2014FR (M.A.) RICHARD RICE, Program Coordinator Astheacademic study of religion has developed over the past fifty years, the exploration of religion and science has emerged as a discipline of its own.Scholars in the natural sciences, the human sciences,and numerous applied sciences recognize the impor-tance of examining religion from their particular per - spectives. And religion scholars appreciate the impor - tance of the questions that the methods and conclu- sions of the sciences raise for religious belief and prac - tice. As a Seventh-day Adventist health-sciences uni- versity, Loma Linda University rests on the conviction that there is a positive relation between religion andthe sciences. Its commitment to a variety of healthprofessional programs reflects the belief that the natu - ral world is God's good creation and that human beingsare inherently part of the physical order of things. Itscommitment to higher education, including variousavenues of graduate study ,expresses the belief that alltruth is God's truth, and that the acquisition of truth calls for the diligent application of all our powers.These convictions support the attempt to bring scien-tific knowledge within the overarching perspective ofChristian faith. This Master of Arts degree is designed for several types of students: those who want a degree in religion and science before pursuing further graduate work in one or the other of these areas; graduate students in the natural and social sciences who would like to com-bine their other academic interests with a seriousstudy of religion; students in professional programswho also have an interest in the area of religion andscience; and individuals who wish to explore the inter-face of religion and the sciences within the context ofserious academic work. The Religion and the Sciences Program is admin- istered by the Faculty of Religion. It draws on resources from various sectors of the campus, includ- ing the Department of Earth and Biological Sciencesfaculty of the School of Science and Technology; theDepartment of Psychology faculty of the School ofScience and Technology; and the members of other faculties in the University ,as well as other scholars and professors with expertise in the area. The program is designed to encourage and assist students to\u2014 Understand the various ways people view the relation between science and religion. Appreciate the distinctive features of scientific and religious study . Appreciate religion and science as contrasting yet complementary approaches to truth. Participate in the ongoing conversation surrounding the relation of religion and thesciences.

School Counseling \u2014ST (PB certificate) IAN CHAND, Director of Clinical Training CHERYL SIMPSON, Program Coordinator for School Counseling Certificate and M.S. incounseling FACUL UNIVERSITY CATALOGGayle Helenski Sandra May-LeggittClaudia Ronaldson Lorraine Thompson SCHOOL COUNSELING CERTIFICATE TheSchool Counseling Certificate Program is one of two programs in the School of Science and Technology's Department of Counseling and FamilySciences, offered through the Department of Maritaland Family Therapy, leading to school counselor certi-fication. School counseling programs are accreditedby the California Commission on TeacherCredentialing within the California State Departmentof Education. Students enrolled in the M. S. degree in marital and family therapy must enroll for an addition- al 25 units and 600 hours of field experience in schoolcounseling. In addition, they must successfully com- plete all published program requirements to qualify forthe pupil personnel services (PPS) credential in school counseling. Students enrolled in department's Masterof Science degree in counseling may also qualify forthis credential. School counseling began as a profession in the early 1900s when vocational guidance emerged as aresponse to America's industrial revolution and to theadvisement needs of veterans with educational bene-fits. Over the next century ,school counselors became an integral part of the mental health community as more responsibility for at-risk children, adolescents,and young adults was shifted to educational institu-tions. T oday,more than ever ,students are in need of support as they maximize their potential to serve anever changing world. ACCREDIT ATION AND ADVISOR YBOARD The School Counseling Certificate Program is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and by the CaliforniaCommission on T eacher Credentialing (CCTC) gov - erned by the State Department of Education inSacramento, California. The program is also guided by an advisory board of professionals who are activelyemployed in local school districts and who serve as contract instructors as needed. THE PROGRAM General admission and program information Students are admitted in Fall and Winter quarters. With special permission, a student may be permitted to enter Spring or Summer Quarter. Program require- ments for admission are as follows: Applicants must be enrolled in Loma Linda University's M.S. in marital and family therapy degree program or graduated from an accreditedmaster's degree program in marital and familytherapy. Applications must be submitted to theDean of the School of Science and T echnology in accordance with published policies. Applicants must have a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution in any field. Candidates must have a minimum 3.0 grade point average (on a 4-point scale) for the last 45 quartercredits (30 semester units) of course work completed before applying for admission. Applicants must submit two letters of recommendation supporting admission to graduatework in school counseling. Letters will not be accepted from relatives or friends. Verification of state health and criminal clearance must be on file with the department prior toapplication for field placement. Candidates must take the California Test of Basic Skills (CBEST) no later than the second quarter following enrollment. A passing score on all sections is required for the Pupil PersonnelServices (PPS) credential in School Counselingand must be on file with the department prior tocandidate recommendation to the state. Candidates must apply for field experience and meet all prerequisites outlined in the fieldexperience manual prior to placement. Candidates will take a comprehensive examination. Institutional and interdisciplinary fit Guided by the University's mission of whole-per- son health care, California' snew standards for school counseling, and the expanding nature of professional collaboration in mental health, school counseling cur - riculum has been organized into the following threedomains: I. Educational foundations and belief systems, II. Theoretical and cognitive competence, III. Counseling competence and commitment to service. Graduate students are expected to combine the knowledge and skills learned in these domains with anunderstanding of the University's mission to formulateawell thought-out, clearly articulated personal belief system that embodies the student's ethical values.Development of this personal epistomology requiresthat the student examine his or her understanding ofthe sources of meaning, purpose, hope, and practice.These issues include the following: Beliefs about the nature, origin, and future of humans Equality and inclusion Honoring personal and cultural values with sensitivity toward diversity Relationships to transitions and communities of faith Integrity toward self and others Sources of strength and renewal Generosity of spirit Competence and conscientiousness CURRICULUM DOMAIN I: Educational foundations and belief systems Foundational courses in learning theory, educa- tional psychology, sociocultural competence, research,and statistics are considered foundational to buildingcompetence as a school counselor. These foundational courses include the following.

Another assumption is that compe - tence embraces the concept of service. Activities involving case study and field experience are designedto emphasize service and the development of altruism.By helping K-12 pupils sense the dimensions of per- sonal need and worth in others, candidates grow in their ability to respond with compassion and empathyand cultural competence. As educators, school coun-selors help K-12 students in their personal develop-ment, career preparation, and academic achievement in order to become lifelong learners.

ForresterKimberly FreemanRobert W. Gardner Frank Tetley Ignatius I. YacoubDebbie Wright The profession of social work centers on the improvement of the quality of life for people and the enhancement of human potential for full produc - tive participation in society .With this philosophy at its core, the master's degree in Social Work Program offered by the School of Science and Technologyemphasizes ecological systems, a perspective thatfocuses on the interaction of a person or system inrelation to his/her environment. Reflecting this stanceis Loma Linda University's philosophy, \"To Make Man Whole,\" and its heritage as an international leader in the delivery of services in health care and related facil-ities. It is the combination of these influences that hasguided the development of the foundation curriculum,professional concentrations, and selection ofpracticum sites for the Master of Social W ork Program. SOCIAL WORK\u2014M.S.W. Mission The mission of the Master of Social Work Program is to prepare competent, ethical, and compassionatesocial work professionals who will possess the knowl - edge, values, and skills to equip them for a dedicatedlife of advanced practice in health and mental health institutions and agencies. Goals The goals of the Master of Social Work Program are: To provide quality graduate social work education that instills in students the common knowledge, ethics, values, and skills of the profession; To provide a foundation curriculum to support students' development and application of a generalist practice; To provide quality graduate social work education that instills in students respect for diversity,populations at risk, and the promotion of socialand economic justice; Toprovide advanced curricula in behavioral health concentrations in clinical social work practice, and policy planning and administration;THE PROGRAMS 389 To strengthen the student's academic experience through strong collaborations with area agenciesand institutions; To be responsive in addressing the educational needs of social work in health and mental health institutions and agencies in the surrounding community; and To express through curriculum and co-curricular activities the University's mission of wholeness. Accreditation The Master of Social Work Program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education to providegraduate-level social work education. PREREQUISITE Graduate social work education builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation. The pro-gram assesses the liberal arts foundation of students applying to the M.S.W .degree program from two per- spectives: * 1. Foundation concepts and/or skills in each of the following: Interviewing and counseling (3) Human biology: (3) Human growth and development* (3) Cross-cultural issues (3) Introductory statistics (3)Unit values represent the quarter system of measurement. Content from multiple courses may be used to meet most requirements. 2. A balance of course work in four liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history ,philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) (20-24) English and communication skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) (8-12) Mathematics and natural sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, etc.) (12-16) Social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.) (12-16) Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete addi- tional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W.classes. Table 1 outlines the time frame for completion of pre- requisites. Note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before advancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the advanced curriculum). TABLE 1 SEQUENCING OF PREREQUISITE REQUIREMENTS Courses Time/place Interviewing and counseling Prior to SOWK 578 and 757A-C Human development Prior to SOWK 511, 512Cross-cultural issues Prior to SOWK 511, 512Human biology Prior to SOWK 511, 512 Introductory statistics Prior to SOWK 549 Admission requirements Following are the admission requirements for the Master of Social Work Program: Applicants must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited university or college (official transcriptsare evidence of courses completed). The depart-ment assesses the liberal arts preparation of eachof its applicants in two areas: (a) the balance of course work in four broad liberal arts areas, and (b) specific course work considered preparatory to the program's foundation (first year) courses(see also Liberal Arts Requirements in M.S.W. Student Handbook). Applicants must submit a completed application, including a personal statement, application fee, allcollege and/or university transcripts, and threeletters of recommendation at least (one from anacademic source and one from a work supervisor). Applicants must meet the minimum academic and professional compatibility criteria established bythe program, which includes: Applicants must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale) (special consideration may be given to applicants with grade point averages as low as 2.85 if the last partof their college work shows significantimprovement). Applicants whose cumulative gradepoint average does not meet the minimumrequirements stated above may receive furtherconsideration for admission to the M.S.W. programby providing a satisfactory GRE score, or two yearsrelated employment experience. W ork experience must be verified by employers' statements on official agency stationery . Applicants must show evidence of professional compatibility, personal qualifications andmotivation to complete a graduate program byobtaining a passing score on the admissionsinterview with the Department's AdmissionsCommittee. Evaluation criteria for the interviewincludes: verbal communication skills; critical thinking ability; values congruent with the social work profession; appreciation of human diversity evidence of reflective learning; and comportment. No academic credit is given for life experience or previous work experience for any part for theMaster of Social Work program (i.e., field practicum or courses in the professional foundation or advanced curricula). Curriculum The 78-unit curriculum of the M.S.W .degree pro - gram provides the mix of academic, experiential, and research experiences essential for M.S.W .degree stu - dents. Students must maintain a program grade-point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a 4.0 scale)and meet the knowledge, skill, and professional per -390 UNIVERSITY CATALOGformance competencies outlined by the program. The minimum acceptable grade for required (core) coursesis a B- (2.7). Grades in selective courses must be aminimum of a C (2.0). Courses with grades fallingbelow the standards set for required and selectivecourses must be repeated. Students are financiallyresponsible for the cost of repeating courses where grades obtained do not meet the minimum standards. General overview The program begins with the professional founda- tion content (first-year courses) common to all gradu-ate social work education. Courses during this first year of study provide content in human behavior in a cross-cultural environment, social welfare policy and services, practice theory and skills, social research,and practica. These content areas are strengthened by the integration of social work values and ethics; as well as knowledge of special populations (i.e., issues of gen-der, race, class, disability, and oppression). Program options Alternate program options have been designed to address the varying needs of students. As such, the program offers a full-time two-year option, a three-year part-time option, and a four-year part-time option. Advanced standing The M.S.W. degree program does not admit stu- dents with advanced standing. Rather, it recognizesthe knowledge and skills of individuals who havereceived a baccalaureate degree from an accreditedsocial work program. This recognition indicates thatthe candidate may have already met the proficiencyoutcomes expected of M.S.W .degree students who have completed the foundation curriculum. Such can - didates may transfer up to 30 course units of first-year course work and 280 hours of first-year fieldpracticum. Criterion for course transfers is availablethrough the department. The curriculum for studentswho are granted these transfers still requires two aca - demic years of residency. The students will have addi-tional time to complete their thesis or advancedresearch course work for socialization into the profes-sion, as well as opportunity to take advantage of the rich interdisciplinary options available at Loma Linda University .Students may petition to accelerate the completion of the M.S.W .degree with a minimum of four quarters in full-time residence. The unit load for each of these quarters cannot exceed 15 units, nor arestudents allowed to transfer foundation courses whencontent is required by California state law. In addition,students who have difficulty applying foundation skills in their practicum (regardless of their baccalaureate degree) may have course transfers revoked or denied. Transfer students Individuals transferring from other accredited M.S.W .degree programs may transfer units for didactic course work in accordance with University policy.Field practicum experiences are nontransferable. M.S.W. degree advanced curriculum The advanced curriculum of the program begins with course work that supports integration of the foun-dational first year with the program's advanced cur-riculum. As part of the advanced curriculum, studentstake core courses required of all students and then select one of two concentrations. PROFESSIONAL CONCENTRATIONS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The Social Work Program offers two concentrations for professional practice, which are the focus of the second-year study: clinical practice; and policy, plan-ning, and administration. The clinical-practice concentration requires mas- tery of advanced-practice roles, modes of intervention,and methods used in clinical health and mental healthsettings. Study includes the integration of clinical-practice theories, diagnostic assessment, problem-solv- ing skills and techniques; as well as the impact of poli- cy upon the availability of treatment, treatment modalities, and expectation of outcomes. Students' experiences and knowledge are expanded through theselection of practicum sites and selectives concerning special population and problem areas. These include,but are not limited to, children at risk, geriatric dilem- mas, mental disorders, substance abuse, and familyconflict. The integration of cultural diversity as a fac-tor guiding the analysis and intervention with clinical populations is incorporated into the totality of the con - centration. Policy, planning, and administration concentration The policy ,planning, and administration concen - tration is designed to prepare students for manage- ment roles in health and mental-health care organiza-tions. It focuses on giving students understanding andskill in: interdisciplinary practice; systems establishment and maintenance to assist individuals, families, and groups managing health and illness in context of the life cycle; social change promotion in health and mental health care organizations; and health and mental health policy analysis. In this way, students have an opportunity to inte- grate and explore health and mental-health practicesand policies from their underlying value base; and toexplore the impact of cultural definitions on health, ill - ness, and systems designs. CENTRAL ACADEMIC PROCESSES AND COGNA TES Professional practica Professional practica experiences (field practica) are regarded as an integral part of the M.S.W. degreeprogram because these offer students opportunities tointegrate and apply theoretical and research knowl-edge with social work practice and intervention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed (and selected) to provide maximum learningopportunities under the supervision of a qualified fieldinstructor. As such, experiences are patterned to buildupon one another ,presenting the increasing challenges present in the continuum of generalist to advanced social work practice. Students complete 21 units ofprofessional practica\u2014which includes 1,080 hours ofTHE PROGRAMS 391field work in a qualified setting and 120 hours of con- current integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours. Emphasis during SOWK 757A,B,C Professional Foundation Practicum and Seminar (9 professionalpractica units requiring 480 hours of practicum and 60hours of seminar) is placed on achieving generalistsocial work knowledge, values, and skills, including developing rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning- level psychosocial assessment and intervention capa-bilities. The content of the concurrent seminar furthersupports this perspective as it provides students withopportunities to integrate their practicum experienceswith their developing professional identity. The SOWK 787A,B,C Advanced Professional Practicum and Seminar (12 units of professional prac-tica units requiring 600 hours of practicum and 60hours of seminar) reflect students' choice of concen- tration and provide the depth and breadth of learning opportunities that underpin the acquisition ofadvanced-practice capabilities. More specifically,advanced professional practica experiences are expect-ed to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the pro - fessional foundation skills achieved during the firstyear of study . Research The M.S.W .degree program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually authored thesis option is available for students meet- ing program criteria. These study options aim to devel-op knowledge for the advancement of social work prac - tice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research applicable to a variety of professional andacademic settings. Guidelines for these options areprovided by the School of Science and Technology andthe department. Professional foundation processes and cognates Two academic review processes take place during the first year of the M.S.W .degree program. These are: 1. M.S.W. advancement G.P.A. The M.S.W. advancement G.P.A. provides an initial predictor used for gatekeeping. The first 12 unitscompleted towards the M.S.W. degree, includingunits acquired during nonmatriculation, must becompleted with a G.P.A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achieve at this level may be dismissed from school. Students receive orientation to the processand requirements of the M.S.W .advancement G.P.A. during the student orientation conducted prior to the Fall Quarter . 2. Qualifying review When all foundation course work is completed, students are required to pass the program'squalifying review .The intent of this process is to: assist faculty and students in assessment of strengths and areas for improvement; provide feedback; foster an environment of self-evaluation; and encourage heightened participation in individualized academic development. Ultimately ,the results of this review help both the student and faculty to develop learning objectives forthe concentration year. A specific orientation is held to explain the expectations, format, and scheduling ofthe qualifying review process. Advanced curriculum cognate\u2014wholeness portfolio All students complete a wholeness portfolio during SOWK 787A,B,C Advanced Professional Practicum andSeminar. This review of the student's individualizedobjectives and professional development during thesecond year of study\u2014combined with a discussion ofhis/her plans for employment and further growth\u2014is seen as a capstone academic experience that facilitates closure and the final stage of reflection and review in the development of a scholar-practitioner.

CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK\u2014PH.D. The School of Science and Technology's Department of Social Work and Social Ecology is an interdisci- plinary academic unit committed to the University' s mission of human wholeness and to the belief that one's fullest development is achieved when all aspectsof an individual's life are in balance. Both conceptuallyand pragmatically the programs in the Department ofSocial Work and Social Ecology are guided by an over-arching ecological (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) per-spective that employs scientific methods of problemanalysis and program design. A key component in thisframework is the importance of considering the rela - tionships among behavioral, sociopolitical, economic,THE PROGRAMS 393and environmental problems. The result is an interdis- ciplinary teaching, learning, and practice environmentdesigned to create interventions that will improve thefunctions of the individuals, families, groups, organiza-tions, and communities. As such, priority has beengiven to creating an academic milieu favorable to edu-cating competent, ethical, and compassionate profes- sionals and scholars who are capable of respecting and addressing the needs of diverse populations.

For the certifi - cate in Spanish Studies, an immersion language and culture program is required, as well as an internationalservice project with a Spanish-speaking population. The Christian-service course units are the two book- ends of the certificate. The first unit includes a theo-retical, theological, and philosophical basis for serviceand provides the outline for the portfolio. In the sec-ond unit, the student completes the portfolio that inte - grates and summarizes the entire experience. Spanish-language proficiency at the high-elemen- tary or low-intermediate level is required and will be assessed by examination. All courses except the cap-stone portfolio course are currently available on cam- pus. For students concurrently enrolled in an LLU pro- gram, all courses may be transferred in except forRELR 404 Christian Service and the 80 clock hours ofservice learning. Spanish language, Spanish literature and history, and diversity courses must be taken for a letter grade, with a minimum G.P.A. of 2.0 for the cer-tificate.

The Combined-Degrees Programs provide opportunity for especially well-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and toprepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching,or investigation of problems of health and disease inman. For admission to Combined-Degrees Program, stu- dents must have a baccalaureate degree; and must already be admitted to the schools offering their cho-sen combined-degrees programs. Students may be required to interrupt their pro- fessional study for two or more years (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until dis-continuance is recommended. The usual degree requirements apply Interested and qualified students may choose from the following combined degrees offered by theUniversity:Dentistry \u2014SD with Master of Science \u2014ST D.D.S./M.S. The D.D.S. / M.S. is a combined-degrees program leading to the Doctor of Dental Surgery and the Master of Science degrees. It is open to qualified stu-dents of dentistry. The student who is interested in establishing a broader professional base in science or who is looking toward a career in teaching or researchmay take an interim leave from the School ofDentistry after the first professional year, register inthe School of Science and Technology, and fulfill pro-fessional degree requirements subsequent to or con- current with completing course work and research for the Master of Science degree. Medicine \u2014SM with Master of Science\u2014 SMor Doctor of Philosophy \u2014SM M.D./M.S. or M.D./Ph.D. The M.D./Ph.D. Combined-Degrees Program is joint - ly sponsored by the School of Medicine and the School of Science and Technology and includes manyof the features of the Medical Scientist Program.Students in the combined-degrees program completethe first two years of the standard medical curriculum.This is followed by three or more years of graduatecourse work and research to qualify for a Ph.D. degree,or at least one year for an M.S. degree, before com-mencing the last two years of the medical school cur - riculum\u2014the clinical training\u2014for the Doctor ofMedicine degree. Majors are offered in anatomy, bio-chemistry ,microbiology and molecular genetics, physi- ology, or pharmacology. For the M.D./Ph.D. and M.D./M.S. Combined- Degrees Programs, the prerequisites and GraduateRecord Examination requirements are similar to those described for the Medical Scientist Program.

Maternal and Child Health \u2014PH with Social Work \u2014ST M.S.W. /M.P.H. The combined-degrees program in social work and public health reaffirms the heritage of these two professions working together .Simultaneously it addresses the requisite knowledge and skills increas- ingly needed by professionals working in maternal andchild health in low-income communities. As such, thecurricula of the M.S.W. degree and M.P.H. degree inmaternal and child health have been merged to offer acombined-degrees program with both depth andbreadth to address the myriad of intervention andcommunity issues affecting this population. Combined-degrees students must meet all the requirements of each of the participating programs. Ifcompleted separately, the M.S.W. degree is 78 unitsand the M.P .H. degree is 52 units, for a total of 130 units. In this combined-degrees option, 24 units of the 130 units are counted by both the M.S.W. and M.P.H.degrees programs; this reciprocity reduces the totalnumber of units required to 106. Interested studentsshould obtain from the department a curriculum plan showing the integration of the M.S.W. degree and M.P.H. degree programs. Medical Scientist Program \u2014SM/ST M.D./Ph.D. Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicineand medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined-degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student' sindependence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides stu- dents with a broad educational base for the practice ofmedicine and medically related research. The programis administered jointly by the School of Medicine andthe School of Science and Technology. During the firstthree years of the program, students follow an integrat - ed curriculum that includes medical courses, graduateeducation, and research training. In the first year the curriculum includes a course sequence\u2014taught by an interdisciplinary faculty\u2014thatintegrates aspects of biochemistry, genetics, molecularbiology, cell physiology, and cell and molecular ultra-structure into a rigorous survey of cellular biology. Inaddition to this foundation, students learn of newdevelopments in the basic sciences and biomedical sci- ences through weekly seminars and monthly correla- tive sessions. During subsequent years, formal courses continue to broaden and integrate into a meaningfulwhole an understanding of the clinical consequencesof cellular events. Beginning in the fourth year and continuing for two or more years, students pursue full-time researchon a project of their own design within the graduateprograms of human anatomy, biochemistry, microbiol-ogy and molecular genetics, physiology, or pharmacol-ogy. Research training within these programs is avail- able in nationally recognized research laboratories in the School of Medicine. After completing the Ph.D.degree, students return to the medical curriculum forthe two years of clinical training required to obtain theDoctor of Medicine degree. For acceptance into the Medical Scientist Program, graduation from an accredited college isrequired. Students must simultaneously submit appli - cations to the School of Medicine Scores on the gener- al test of the Graduate Record Examination arerequired. The Department of Biochemistry requiresand the Department of Physiology and Pharmacologyrecommends a basic course in calculus and two quar-ters of physical chemistry .Students who have com - pleted at least 8 units in biochemistry may qualify for reduced biochemistry course work in the MedicalScientist Program.
