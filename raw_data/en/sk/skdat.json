Researchers want to learn more about these reactions to provide guidance on who can safely receive the vaccines, including a second dose in people who had a reaction to the first. Objective: To study the safety of giving a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose to people who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose. Eligibility: People aged 16-69 who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Design: Individuals who have underlying health issues may need to come to the NIH for screening tests to make sure they are safe to receive the vaccine. People who are eligible to participate in the study will be admitted to the NIH hospital and stay for at least 4 days. They will give urine samples. They will have a nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 test. They will have an intravenous line placed in each arm. They will get the study vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) and one dose of placebo on different days. They will have breathing tests. They may have clinical photography if they develop a rash. Participants will have 4 follow-up visits - - 2 by phone and 2 in-person visits at the NIH campus . Recruitment Criteria | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||16 Years - 69 Years| |Gender||All| - - INCLUSION CRITERIA:In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria: - Ability to provide informed consent. - - Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures (including discontinuing medications as needed and availability for the duration of the study. - - Aged 16-69 years. - - Must have experienced a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or 3 reaction regardless of tryptase OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2 ng/mL] per modified CoFAR Grading Scale for Systemic Allergic Reactions Version 3.0) to the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. - - Must be at least 28 days out from their first dose of the Moderna vaccine or 21 days from their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine before proceeding with the placebo or vaccine challenge in this study. - - Have a primary care physician or other health care provider who will manage their medical care outside of this study.

Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use.

[View Trial Website](https://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/detail.cgi?B_000460-I.html) Study Description: This is a single-site study to determine the safety of administering a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine (Comirnaty) to individuals who experienced a systemic allergic reaction to their first full dose of the same vaccine or the Moderna mRNA vaccine, and to investigate possible mechanisms underlying allergic reactions. Objectives: Primary Objective: 1. Assess the proportion of participants who develop a systemic allergic reaction (Consortium for Food Allergy Research grade 2 reaction and above regardless of tryptase, or CoFAR grade 1 with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after previously demonstrating a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or 3 reaction regardless of tryptase OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to their first full dose of the same vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Secondary Objectives: 1. Assess the proportion of participants who develop a severe systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 3 reaction or higher regardless of tryptase) to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after previously demonstrating a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or 3 reaction regardless of tryptase OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to their first full dose of the same vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. 2. Assess the proportion of participants who develop a mild-moderate allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 1 or 2 reaction regardless of tryptase) to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after previously demonstrating a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or 3 reaction regardless of tryptase OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to their first full dose of the same vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. 3. Assess the proportion of participants with anaphylactic reactions (Levels 1-3) per Brighton Collaboration Criteria (see Appendix B) to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after previously demonstrating a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or 3 reaction OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to their first full dose of the same vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. 4. Assess the proportion of participants who develop a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 reaction or higher regardless of tryptase OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after previously demonstrating a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or 3 reaction regardless of tryptase OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to their first full dose of the same vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine compared to the rate of these reactions following placebo administration. 5. Compare the severity of allergic reactions to the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to the severity of the reaction following administration of a subsequent dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in individuals who experienced a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR grade 2 reaction and above regardless of tryptase, or CoFAR grade 1 with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to their first full dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Exploratory Objectives: 1. Assess the risk of having a systemic allergic reaction to a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in participants who previously demonstrated a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or 3 reaction regardless of tryptase OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2ng/mL]) to their first full dose of the same vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 according to baseline covariates. 2. Examine possible mechanisms of allergic reactions to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. 3. Assess innate and adaptive immune responses, including functional antibody levels, to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. 4. Investigate mental health characteristics of participants who experience an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. 5. Assess psychological impact of allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine and examine changes in stress levels over time. 6. Assess anxiety levels in participants and examine changes in anxiety over time. 7. Assess the proportion of participants who experience no reaction or only a mild reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or below) to a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after previously demonstrating a systemic allergic reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or 3 reaction regardless of tryptase OR Grade 1 reaction with elevated tryptase [1.2 X baseline plus 2 ng/mL]) to their first full dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and no allergic reaction or a mild reaction (CoFAR Grade 2 or below) to a subsequent (second) dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 8. Assess the development of autoantibodies after COVID-19 vaccination.
