He called the clinic in Merchantville, N.J., the only place in the country offering an \"ultrarapid detoxification\" treatment. For $2,500 he was put to sleep under a general anesthetic and pumped full of drugs designed to clear the heroin from his body rapidly--a process that would otherwise take 10 days. Although he describes the hours after he woke up as \"a living hell,\" his jitters quickly subsided and he was back at work within two days. Three hundred people have undergone the procedure at the Rapid Opiate Detox Treatment Center, the staff says. Some patients say it has helped them quit drugs; drug rehabilitation experts say ultrarapid detox is potentially risky and unproved. In a report issued in April, the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a division of the National Institutes of Health, addiction experts warned such a procedure involves a risk that is \"unacceptable\" considering the unproved nature of the treatment. The report does not represent an official position of NIDA. Dr. Lance Gooberman, head of the clinic in Merchantville, said calls to patients have determined 65 percent have stayed away from heroin or other addictive drugs. According to the NIDA report, the combination of large quantities of detox drugs with anesthesia may put patients at risk of choking as well as cardiac changes. The report noted \"detoxification is not a cure for opiate addiction,\" which can last for months after the drug is out of the body. In interviews, addiction experts likened ultrarapid detox to a quick-fix diet plan that peels off pounds that inevitably creep back. Gooberman said five patients undergoing ultrarapid detox were taken to the emergency room at Kennedy Memorial Hospitals-University Medical Center/Cherry Hill Division. He said two remained drowsy after the anesthesia because they had been taking the sedative Valium as well as heroin. One had aspiration pneumonia from inhaling vomit. A third had severe diarrhea. He took two others because their spouses wouldn't take them home. All were hospitalized and later released. An emergency room doctor who treated three patients said two were in bizarre mental states. One was \"yelling, screaming and disoriented. We watched this guy freak out.\" He said he also treated one who was having severe difficulty breathing. Gooberman, who administers the detox with the aid of a certified nurse-anesthetist, says the risks were justified, considering the high risk of simply being an addict. \"The literature says that heroin addiction has a 10 to 20 percent mortality rate,\" Gooberman said. His patients are told about the small risk of anesthesia, and for them, the speed of the process is worth it, he said. One patient, a 33-year-old financial consultant, said she considered the risk of general anesthesia minuscule compared to the risks she endured when she drove alone to North Philadelphia to score drugs. Gooberman, 43, who interned at Wilmington (Del.) Medical Center and did his residency in internal medicine at Cooper Hospital-University Medical Center in Camden, N.J., says ultrarapid detox works for heroin, painkillers such as Percocet and codeine, and methadone, used in heroin rehabilitation but is addictive. In principle, Gooberman's treatment is part of a new class of detoxification methods that emerged in the 1980s, using heroin-neutralizing \"opiate antagonists,\" shown to accelerate the detoxification process and its withdrawal symptoms. Variations of the ultrarapid treatment were first performed in Spain and Israel five years ago by psychologist Juan Jose Legarda. His organization, CITA, has clinics in Mexico, Italy and Puerto Rico. Neither Legarda nor Gooberman needs approval from the Food and Drug Administration because their treatments use approved drugs. Gooberman's patients leave with a supply of an antagonist, Naltrexone, he says, is designed for long-term use. It bonds to the heroin receptors, he says, so if a patient should relapse and use heroin, the drug would have no effect. He also steers them to the local chapter of Narcotics Anonymous. That isn't enough, says Dr. Robert Newman, an addiction specialist at Beth Israel Hospital in New York: \"Relapse is the rule rather than the exception.\" The financial consultant says she dropped the Naltrexone regimen but is trying Alcoholics Anonymous to inspire her to stay away from her drug. She says she is realistic about the rapid detoxification. \"You need to be ready and couple it with a program of recovery. It's not "}
