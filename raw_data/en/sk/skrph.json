(1) The goal of health education is to provide instruction that allows youth to develop and sustain health -promoting behaviors throughout their lives. The understanding and application of these standards will allow students the ability to gather, interpret, an d understand health information; achieve health literacy; and adapt to the ever -evolving science of health. The health education knowledge and skills should be presented to students in a positive manner to support the development of a healthy self -concept and responsible decision -making. The standards will help students reinforce, foster, and apply positive character traits. (2) There are essential skills that repeat throughout six strands and embody the interconnection of health literacy. These skills inc lude decision -making, problem -solving, goal setting, maintaining healthy relationships (with self and others), seeking help and support, and recognizing various influences on health (social, environment, media, genetic). These skills, developed early on an d reinforced throughout a student's education, will foster mastery of health concepts. (3) Students will gain an understanding of health information and skills through six strands: personal health and hygiene; mental health and wellness; healthy eating and physical activity; injury and violence prevention and safety; alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; and reproductive and sexual health. (A) Physical health and hygiene education helps to prepare the student for improved lifelong health outcomes. Learning about the body systems will lay the foundation for personal health and hygiene. Health literacy and preventative behaviors will empower the student to make informed choices to support self, family, and community. (B) The mental health and wellness strand recognizes that the knowledge and skills necessary to manage emotions, reactions, and relationships are essential to reaching one's full potential. Students will gain knowledge about social and emotional health, developing a healthy self -concept, risk and pr otective factors, and identifying and coping with mental health and wellness concerns. In the early grades, this includes developing fluency around emotions and self -regulation and understanding of the relationship between feelings, thoughts, and behavior. In subsequent grades, students learn and practice appropriate ways to solve interpersonal conflicts, work to develop a positive self -image, and develop healthy coping skills. (C) The healthy eating and physical activity strand addresses the importance of nutrition and physical activity to support a healthy lifestyle. The student will apply critical- thinking and decision -making skills to make positive health choices. The student will learn about the essential nutrients, food groups, portion control, govern ment nutritional recommendations, and the health benefits of being physically active. The student will evaluate the connection between physical activity and nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases. (D) By focusing on injury and violence prevention and safety, the standards promote student well- being and awareness of dangerous situations. Supporting the student's well -being and providing education on digital citizenship, bullying, first aid, and identifying safe and unsafe situations creates empowered and educated students able to make decisions that keep themselves and others safe. Beginning in kindergarten and continuing through high school, the student will gain knowledge and skills to support safety and wellness at school, at home, online, and in the community. (E) The knowledge and skills of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs focus on a number of protective factors that create empowered students who are able to make better -informed decisions, including understanding the impact of substance use on physical, mental, and social health. Through exploring the standards in this strand, the student will learn about use, misuse, and physiological effects; short - and long- term impacts on health; treatment; risk and protective factors; and prevention. These concepts introduce healthy alternatives and ways to ask for and seek out help from parents and trusted adults. DRAFT Introduction 2 August 2020 Health Education TEKS Review Final Recommendations(F) In the reproductive and sexual health strand, students will identify the characteristics of healthy and unhealthy relationships, how to use communication and refusal skills to set personal boundaries, and how to develop strategies for responding to sexual harassment and abuse. Students will describe the changes associated with adolescent development, explain the process of fertilization, fetal development, and the importance of prenatal care. Students will learn that sexual abstinence until marriage is the only 100% effective means of avoiding unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections as well as the legal, financial, and social i ssues associated with sexual health and reproduction. (4) Statements containing the word \"including\" reference content that must be mastered, while those containing the phrase \"such as\" are intended as possible illustrative examples.
