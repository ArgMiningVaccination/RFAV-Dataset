Ayurveda, for long sneered at by mainstream medical practitioners as a \"primitive\" system that treats patients with barks and roots, has finally come of age and is fast gaining the acceptability it always deserved. Inspired by New York-based practitioner Bhaswati Bhattacharya, who has devised a holistic system of treatment combining allopathy with herbal medicines, a group of doctors in Kolkata will soon form a panel of practitioners for the system. \"Allopathic drugs are often over-prescribed. Patients take them without realizing that the medicines are actually doing them more harm than good. Also, allopathic drugs merely check the disease without curing it. Ayurveda offers a long-term cure,\" said Bhattacharya, who heads the GoodMedicine Works Institute in New York. An allopath by training, Bhattacharya says she switched over to Ayurveda after discovering that most doctors were not \"honest about prescribing drugs\". \"We need good medicine, be it allopathy or herbal. I would like to see a combination of the two, that would really benefit the patient,\" she says. While ayurvedic relies on herbs, even some commonly prescribed allopathic medicines are based on plants. Few heart patients who have been on aspirin for years would probably be aware that the medicine they rely on is actually sourced from a herb, Salix alba (White willow). Or, that Reserpine the common drug used to treat blood pressure fluctuation is an extract from Rawlsina serpentina and that neem is used in several anti-ulcer allopathic medicines. There has been a 6% to 8% growth in the sale of herbal medicines in the city over the last three years, said industry sources. Combined sales turnover of manufacturers such as Himalaya and Baidyanath has crossed Rs 500 crore. Himalaya's Liv 52, the popular medicine for the liver, is now the largest selling drug in the country. Cod liver oil, that assists the brain, heart, joints and the digestive system, has been used for years. But probably very few are aware of the benefits of gulancha, methi and shilajit, herbs which are combined for an antidote to diabetes. Or that kuchila, dhatura and ama haldi can act as a joint pain reliever. Ajwain, kaala daana and nisoth are used in Kabz-har a popular laxative. Salix alba has been widely used for a long time to treat a range of diseases from diarrhoea, heartburn and fever to blood pressure. Aswagandha works wonders for those suffering from stress, say ayurveda practitioners. Now, even allopathic practitioners have started to recognize the healing effects of these herbal alternatives. In fact, some admit that many of these alternatives are often more potent than chemical drugs that merely treat symptoms rather than curing the disease. Neem, giloy and trifala are recognized as blood purifiers which are good for the skin. \"There has been a change in people's attitude towards ayurveda. It is no longer passe to go for ayurvedic treatment. In fact, many are seeking herbal alternatives to allopathic drugs which, patients have realized, are often toxic and fail to provide a permanent cure. Chronic ailments such as diabetes and breathing problems can only be cured through ayurveda,\" said Paresh Tripathi, a senior practitioner and teacher at the Institute of Post-Graduate Ayurvedic Education and Research. From diarrhoea, piles, joint pain, arthritis, arrhythmia, indigestion and hypertension to hairfall, acne, leukoderma and diabetes, ayurveda has a remedy for most diseases. And practitioners claim they are effective, albeit a little slow. \"Herbal medicines are targeted at the root of the disorder, rather than the symptoms, which most allopathic drugs do. Obviously, it takes longer to show results but the cure is permanent. More importantly, herbal medicines have no toxic effects. But few know about the herbal alternatives,\" said Tripathi. The revival of interest in ayurveda is attributed to an aggressive marketing by manufacturers, the belief that herbal drugs are not toxic and work better for chronic diseases. Experts, however, point out that these are only partially correct. \"Advertising has played a role in popularizing herbal drugs. But they do have some toxic effects, though much less than that of some allopathic medicines. It is true that chronic ailments are better addressed by ayurveda. But if it has to progress, there should be more academic research on herbs. Turmeric, for instance, has always been used for cancer in ayurveda but there has been no effort to give it a scientific basis. There are vested interests at work which have prevented ayurveda from gaining more acceptability,\" said Prithwish Bhattacharya, a practitioner and chief manufacturing chemist of Baidyanath. Allopaths admit that this traditional method could have been used to supplement the conventional system. \"Chronic diseases have no cure in allopathy. I often ask my patients to go for herbal drugs to treat high blood pressure, arthritis and even breathing trouble in some cases,\" said Debashish Basu, a specialist in preventive medicine. Manufacturers hold the drug control authorities for holding the system back. \"The rules don't permit us to use the ingredients that are needed to manufacture several key medicines. Swarnabhasma, for instance, requires cow excreta but that is not allowed under the good manufacturing practises norms. Unfortunately, allopaths are in charge of drug control and they have an inherent bias against ayurveda. Pharmaceutical companies have been blocking us as well,\" said a senior official of Baidyanath. A combined therapy could take ayurveda ahead, felt practitioners. \"Ideally, there should be a panel of allopaths, homoeopaths and ayurvedic doctors. Only then can patients be prescribed the best medicine. I'd love to be a part of such "}
