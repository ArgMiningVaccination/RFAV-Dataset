In 1900 Benedict Lust \"invented\" naturopathy, a practice that combined many natural therapies and therapeutic systems under the umbrella of a comprehensive philosophy based upon the European nature cure movement that flourished in the 1800s, the vis medicatrix naturae (healing power of nature) and other vitalistic principles. As such, naturopathic medicine has deep historical roots and represents a lineage of Western natural medicine that can be traced back to the Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian cultures, and conceptually, to many traditional and indigenous world medicines. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2004 Background Despite the growing use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by consumers in the U.S., little is known about the practice of CAM providers. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the practice patterns of naturopathic physicians in Washington State and Connecticut. Methods Telephone interviews were conducted with state-wide random samples of licensed naturopathic physicians and data were collected on consecutive patient visits in 1998 and 1999. The main outcome measures were: Sociodemographic, training and practice characteristics of naturopathic physicians; and demographics, reasons for visit, types of treatments, payment source and visit duration for patients. Result One hundred and seventy practitioners were interviewed and 99 recorded data on a total of 1817 patient visits. Naturopathic physicians in Washington and Connecticut had similar demographic and practice characteristics. Both the practitioners and their patients were primarily White and female. Almost 75% of all naturopathic visits were for chronic complaints, most frequently fatigue, headache, and back symptoms. Complete blood counts, serum chemistries, lipids panels and stool analyses were ordered for 4% to 10% of visits. All other diagnostic tests were ordered less frequently. The most commonly prescribed naturopathic therapeutics were: botanical medicines (51% of visits in Connecticut, 43% in Washington), vitamins (41% and 43%), minerals (35% and 39%), homeopathy (29% and 19%) and allergy treatments (11% and 13%). The mean visit length was about 40 minutes. Approximately half the visits were paid directly by the patient. Conclusion This study provides information that will help other health care providers, patients and policy makers better understand the nature of naturopathic care. The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 2006 Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine 2019 North American naturopathic medicine is a distinct form of practice that is woven into the larger fabric of integrative medicine; in a number of US states and Canadian provinces, naturopathic doctors enjoy a wide scope of practice, including the ability to make diagnoses, order tests, use medical technology, write prescription drugs, and perform minor surgeries. However, the basic premise of naturopathic medicine and its guiding principles-considering the whole person and supporting healthy lifestyle behaviors-is the unifying approach in clinical practice. In the 1970s, homeopathy-considered in many circles to be a hypothesis-driven, fringe form of alternative medicine-became embedded into the training and practice of North American naturopathic doctors. Since the earliest days of its theory (circa 1800), homeopathy has escaped, and continues to escape, biological plausibility; however, the persistence of this modality (and the insistence by both its consumers and practitioners that it provides benefit) speaks to the role of expectations, beliefs, values, agency, context effects, and the placebo-at-large. It is our contention that the progression of professional naturopathic medicine in the 21st century requires a major transition in how it approaches the subject of homeopathy. We propose that students should be encouraged to critically analyze the tenets of homeopathy, its lesser known history, and the idea of homeopathy as a biomedicine that simply awaits untold chemicophysical mechanisms. Furthermore, the modality of homeopathy should be incorporated into the larger context of placebo studies, narrative medicine, ethics, and psychotherapeutic techniques. 2011 Abstract Complementary medicine research, including naturopathic medicine research, is plagued with many methodological challenges. Many of these challenges have also been experienced in public health research. Public health research has met these challenges with a long history of multidisciplinary, multimethod, and whole systems approaches to research that may better resonate with the \"real world\" clinical settings of naturopathic medicine. In Naturopathy in South India - Clinics between Professionalization and Empowerment Eva Jansen offers a rich ethnographic account of current naturopathic thinking and practices, and examines its complex history, multiple interpretations, and antagonisms. INTERNATIONAL AYURVEDIC MEDICAL JOURNAL Health and well-being are a fundamental in enhancing the quality of life of the individual. Naturopathy is a way of maintaining good health and works as preventive as well as curative technique to either eradicate a disease or maintain well-being. Naturopathy aims at enhancing the overall wellbeing of the body and most of the techniques in it are aimed at enhancing the body's self-healing tendencies. Principles of naturopathic techniques include focus on healing power of the nature, health workers as teachers, treatment of cause of illness, preventive treatment, and focus on overall well-being of the person. In this paper all the naturopathic approaches like herbal medicine, messages etc. will be discussed in depth. There are various techniques of naturopathy such as Ayurveda, Unani medicine, Yoga and meditation, Chromo therapy etc. will also be discussed in depth in the paper. Naturopathy can be effective in curing various ailments such as various forms of allergies, arthritis, digestive problems, depression and other mental issues, infertility and reduced immunity. Despite the widespread use of complementary and alternative therapies by persons with cancer, little is known about how the understandings of complementary and alternative practitioners of these therapies compare with those of conventional physicians. The broad purpose of this research was, thus, to explore the beliefs of physicians and complementary and alternative health practitioners, their use of scientific and other types of evidence, and their counseling practices. The specific issue addressed was the beliefs and practices of oncologists and naturopaths regarding the role of diet in breast cancer prevention and treatment. A qualitative research design was used, involving in-depth semistructured interviews with 10 oncologists and 11 naturopaths. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using qualitative methods. The oncologists believed that there is little evidence of a role for diet in breast cancer prevention and treatment, citing the lack of evidenc... This book is the result of many minds, hearts, and souls who have shared a vision of healing with me. It would not exist without them. It began when Lance Sholdt, then at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, asked if I would work with him to put together a course in complementary and alternative medicine for the medical students. His careful construction of this course helped us outline the contents of the book. This book is the brainchild of Jeff Levin. He was the first to suggest that a textbook like this was needed and could be written. His heartfelt work and attention to detail kept things moving when I was bogged down. Janette Carlucci is the soul of the book, managing both the special features and the day-to-day contact with the many authors. To her, a special thanks on this journey. Ron Chez provided a much needed balance for the book. He was always ready and willing to assist with a critical eye and keep us anchored to how this book could be of benefit for patients. I would also like to thank the editors, Jane Velker, Beth Goldner, and Joyce Murphy, for understanding the complexity of the topic and for a commitment to quality over deadlines. And Tim Hiscock for finally saying that we were going to press\u2014 ready or not. I would just as soon have worked another three years on it as finish.
