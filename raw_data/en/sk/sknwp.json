Except as specified in subsection 2, a dedicated fund may not be commingled with other funds or otherwise used in normal operations. A dedicated fund will be considered eligible if it meets one of the following requirements: 1.The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance, or order to pay for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks and is funded for the full amount of coverage required under section 33-24-08-83 or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanism or mechanisms that provide the remaining coverage. 2.The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance, or order as a contingency fund for general emergencies, including taking corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks, and is funded for five times the full amount of coverage required under section 33 -24-08-83, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanisms that provide the remaining coverage. If the fund is funded for less than five times the amount of coverage required under section 33 -24-08-83, the amount of financial responsibility demonstrated by the fund may not exceed one -fifth the amount in the fund. 3.The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance or order to pay for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks.

The amount of each payment must be determined by this formula: TF - CF Y Where TF is the total required financial assurance for the owner or operator, CF is the current amount in the fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the pay -in-period, and: a.The local government owner or operator has available bonding authority, approved through voter referendum (if such approval is necessary prior to the issuance of bonds), for an amount equal to the difference between the required amount of coverage and the amount held in the dedicated fund. This bonding authority shall be available for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks; or b.The local government owner or operator has a letter signed by the appropriate state attorney general stating that the use of the bonding authority will not increase the local government's debt beyond the legal debt ceilings established by the relevant state laws. The letter must also state that prior voter approval is not necessary before use of the bonding authority. 4.To demonstrate that it meets the requirements of the local government fund, the chief financial officer of the local government owner or operator or guarantor, or both, must sign a letter worded exactly as follows, except that the instructions in brackets are to be replaced by the relevant information and the brackets deleted: Letter From the Chief Financial Officer I am the chief financial officer of [insert: name and address of local government owner or operator, or guarantor].

History: Effective May 1, 1994; amended effective July 1, 1996; September 1, 2000; July 1, 2002; April Law 38-08-04 43-02-03-15. Bond and transfer of wells. 1.Bond requirements. Prior to commencing drilling operations, any person who proposes to drill a well for oil, gas, injection, or source well for use in enhanced recovery operations, shall submit to the commission, and obtain its approval, a surety bond or cash bond. An alternative form of security may be approved by the commission after notice and hearing, as provided by law. The operator of such well shall be the principal on the bond covering the well. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. 2.Bond amounts and limitations. The bond shall be in the amount of fifty thousand dollars when applicable to one well only. Wells drilled to a total depth of less than two thousand feet [609.6 meters] may be bonded in a lesser amount if approved by the director. When the principal on the bond is drilling or operating a number of wells within the state or proposes to do so, the principal may submit a bond conditioned as provided by law. Wells utilized for commercial injection operations must be bonded in the amount of fifty thousand dollars. A blanket bond covering more than one well shall be in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, provided the bond shall be limited to no more than six of the following in aggregate: a.A well that is a dry hole and is not properly plugged; b.A well that is plugged and the site is not properly reclaimed; and 179c.A well that is abandoned pursuant to subsection 1 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-08-04 or section 43-02-03-55 and is not properly plugged and the site is not properly reclaimed. If this aggregate of wells is reached, all well permits, for which drilling has not commenced, held by the principal of such bond are suspended. No rights may be exercised under the permits until the aggregate of wells drops below the required limit, or the operator files the appropriate bond to cover the permits, at which time the rights given by the drilling permits are reinstated. A well with an approved temporary abandoned status shall have the same status as an oil, gas, or injection well. The commission may, after notice and hearing, require higher bond amounts than those referred to in this section. Such additional amounts for bonds must be related to the economic value of the well or wells and the expected cost of plugging and well site reclamation, as determined by the commission. The commission may refuse to accept a bond or to add wells to a blanket bond if the operator or surety company has failed in the past to comply with statutes, rules, or orders relating to the operation of wells; if a civil or administrative action brought by the commission is pending against the operator or surety company; or for other good cause. 3.Unit bond requirements. Prior to commencing unit operations, the operator of any area under unitized management shall submit to the commission, and obtain its approval, a surety bond or cash bond. An alternative form of security may be approved by the commission after notice and hearing, as provided by law. The operator of the unit shall be the principal on the bond covering the unit. The amount of the bond shall be specified by the commission in the order approving the plan of unitization. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. Prior to transfer of a unit to a new operator, the commission, after notice and hearing, may revise the bond amount for a unit, or in the case when the unit was not previously bonded, the commission may require a bond and set a bond amount for the unit. 4.Bond terms.

Definitions. As used in this chapter : 1. \"Telemedicine\" means the practice of medicine using electronic communication, information technologies, or other means between a licensee in one location and a patient in another location, with or without an intervening health care provider. The term includes direct interactive patient encounters as well as asynchronous store-and-forward technologies and remote monitoring. 2. \"Licensee\" means a physician or physician assistant licensed to practice in North Dakota. A physician assistant practicing telemedicine from another state is subject to the rules regarding physician supervision, except that supervision may be by a North Dakota licensed physician who is practicing telemedicine in North Dakota and need not be by a North Dakota licensed physician who is physically located in North Dakota. History: Effective January 1, 2018. NDCC 43-17 50-02-15-02. Licensure. The practice of medicine is deemed to occur in the state the patient is located. Practitioners providing medical care to patients located in North Dakota are subject to the licensing and disciplinary laws of North Dakota and must possess an active North Dakota license for their profession. History: Effective January 1, 2018. General NDCC 43-17, of care and professional ethics. Licensees are held to the same standard of care and same ethical standards whether practicing traditional in-person medicine or telemedicine. Therefore, the following apply in the context of telemedicine: 1. Scope of practice. Professional ethical standards require all practitioners to practice only in areas in which they have demonstrated competence, based on their training, ability, and experience. In assessing a licensee's compliance with this ethical requirement, consideration must be given to board certifications and specialty groups' telemedicine standards. 2. Patient-licensee relationship. A licensee practicing telemedicine shall establish a valid relationship with the patient prior to the diagnosis or treatment of a patient. A licensee practicing telemedicine shall verify the identity of the patient seeking care, and disclose, and ensure the patient has the ability to verify, the identity and licensure status of any licensee providing medical services to the patient. 3. Evaluations and examinations required to establish a patient-licensee relationship. Prior to initially diagnosing or treating a patient for a specific illness or condition, an examination or evaluation must be performed. An examination or evaluation may be performed entirely through telemedicine, if the examination or evaluation is equivalent to an in-person examination. A video examination that utilizes appropriate diagnostic testing and use of peripherals that would be deemed necessary in a like in-person examination or evaluation meet this standard, as does an examination conducted with an appropriately licensed intervening health care provider, practicing within the scope of their profession, providing necessary physical findings to the licensee. An examination or evaluation that consists only of a static online questionnaire or an audio conversation may not be considered to meet the standard of care. Once a licensee conducts an acceptable examination or evaluation, whether in-person or by telemedicine, and establishes a patient-licensee relationship, subsequent followup care may be provided as deemed appropriate by the licensee, or by a provider designated by the licensee to act temporarily in the licensee's absence. It is recognized that in certain types of telemedicine utilizing asynchronous store-and-forward technology or electronic monitoring, such as teleradiology or intensive care unit monitoring, it is not medically necessary for an independent examination of the patient to be performed. 4. Medical records. Licensees practicing telemedicine are subject to all North Dakota laws governing the adequacy of medical records and the provision of medical records to the patient and other medical providers treating the patient. 5. Licensees must have the ability to make appropriate referrals of patients not amenable to diagnosis or complete treatment through a telemedicine encounter, including those patients in need of emergent care, or complementary in-person care. History: Effective January 1, NDCC who has performed a telemedicine examination or evaluation meeting the requirements of this chapter may prescribe medications according to the licensee's professional discretion and judgment; however, licensees may not prescribe opioids through a telemedicine encounter. 216 Licensees who prescribe controlled substances, as defined by North Dakota law, in circumstances allowed under this rule, shall comply with all state and federal laws regarding the prescribing of controlled substances, and shall participate in the North Dakota prescription drug monitoring program. History: Effective January 1, 2018. 2018 CHAPTER 67.1-02-02 67.1-02-02-02.

Commingling of per capita funds, judgment funds, and interest and investment income earned on those funds, with other funds, results in loss of the exemption. 6.a.In determining the eligibility of an individual with respect to skilled nursing services, swing-bed, or home and community -based benefits, the individual will be ineligible for those medicaidMedicaid benefits if the individual's equity interest in the individual's home exceeds five hundred thousand dollars. b.The dollar amount specified in this subsection will be increased, beginning with 2011, from year to year based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers, all items, United States city average, rounded to the nearest one thousand dollars. c.This subsection does not apply to an individual whose spouse, or child who is under age twenty-one or is blind or disabled, lawfully resides in the individual's home. d.This subsection may not be construed as preventing an individual from using a reverse mortgage or home equity loan to reduce the individual's total equity interest in the home. e.This subsection applies only to individuals who made application for medicaidMedicaid with respect to skilled nursing facility services, swing -bed, or home and community-based benefits on or after January 1, 2006. 7.a.Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the assets of an individual must be disregarded when determining medicaidMedicaid eligibility in an amount equal to the insurance benefit payments that are made to or on behalf of an individual who is a beneficiary under a long -term care insurance policy that: (1)Covers an insured who was a resident of North Dakota when coverage first became effective under the policy; (2)Is a qualified long-term care insurance policy, as defined in section 7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, issued not earlier than the effective date of the state plan amendment described in subdivision b; (3)The agency determines meets the requirements of the long -term care insurance model regulations and the long -term care insurance model act promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners as adopted as of October 2000, or the state insurance commissioner certifies that the policy meets such requirements; and (4)Is sold to an individual who: (a)Has not attained age sixty -one as of the date of purchase, if the policy provides compound annual inflation protection; (b)Has attained age sixty -one but has not attained age seventy -six as of the date of purchase, if the policy provides some level of inflation protection; or 338(c)Has attained age seventy -six as of the date of purchase. b.This subsection applies only to individuals who have purchased a long -term care insurance policy described in this subsection with an issue date on or after the date specified in an approved medicaidMedicaid state plan amendment that provides for the disregard of assets: (1)To the extent that payments are made under such a long -term care insurance policy; or (2)Because an individual has received or is entitled to receive benefits under such a long-term care insurance policy. 8.Property that is essential to earning a livelihood. a.Property may be excluded as essential to earning a livelihood only during months in which a member of the medicaidMedicaid unit is actively engaged in using the property to earn a livelihood, or during months when the medicaidMedicaid unit is not actively engaged in using the property to earn a livelihood, if the medicaidMedicaid unit shows that the property has been in such use and there is a reasonable expectation that the use will resume: (1)Within twelve months of the last use; or (2)If the nonuse is due to the disabling condition of a member of the medicaidMedicaid unit, within twenty-four months of the last use. b.Property consisting of an ownership interest in a business entity that employs anyone whose assets are used to determine eligibility may be excluded as property essential to earning a livelihood if: (1)The individual's employment is contingent upon ownership of the property; or (2)There is no ready market for the property. c.A ready market for property consisting of an ownership interest in a business entity exists if the interest may be publicly traded. A ready market does not exist if there are unreasonable limitations on the sale of the interest, such as a requirement that the interest be sold at a price substantially below its actual value or a requirement that effectively precludes competition among potential buyers. d.Property currently enrolled in the conservation reserve program is considered to be property essential to earning a livelihood. e.Property from which a medicaidMedicaid unit is receiving only rental or lease income is not essential to earning a livelihood. f.Liquid assets, to the extent reasonably necessary for the operation of a trade or business, are considered to be property essential to earning a livelihood. Liquid assets may not otherwise be treated as essential to earning a livelihood. 9.Property which is not saleable without working an undue hardship. Such property may be excluded no earlier than the first day of the month in which good -faith attempts to sell are begun, and continues to be excluded only for so long as the asset continues to be for sale and until a bona fide offer for at least seventy -five percent of the property's fair market value is made. Good-faith efforts to sell must be repeated at least annually in order for the property to continue to be excluded. 339a.Persons seeking to establish retroactive eligibility must demonstrate that good -faith efforts to sell were begun and continued in each of the months for which retroactive eligibility is sought. Information concerning attempts to sell, which demonstrate that an asset is not saleable without working an undue hardship, are relevant to establishing eligibility in the month in which the good -faith efforts to sell are begun, but are not relevant to months prior to that month and do not relate back to prior months. (1)A good-faith effort to sell real property or a mobile home must be made for at least three calendar months in which no bona fide offer for at least seventy -five percent of the property's fair market value is received before the property can be shown to be not saleable without working an undue hardship.

(2)A good-faith effort to sell property other than real property, a mobile home, or an annuity must be made for at least thirty days in which no bona fide offer for at least seventy-five percent of the property's fair market value is received before the property can be shown to be not saleable without working an undue hardship. b.Property may not be shown to be not saleable without working an undue hardship if the owner of the property fails to take action to collect amounts due and unpaid with respect to the property or otherwise fails to assure the receipt of regular and timely payments due with respect to the property. 10.a.Any pre-need burial contracts, prepayments, or deposits up to the amount set by the department in accordance with state law and the medicaidMedicaid state plan, which are designated by an applicant or recipient for the burial of the applicant or recipient.

Checking accounts are considered to be commingled. (2)The value of an irrevocable burial arrangement shall be considered toward the burial exclusion.

(3)The prepayments on a whole life insurance policy or annuity are the lesser of the face value or the premiums that have been paid. (4)Any fund, insurance, or other property given to another person or entity in contemplation that its value will be used to meet the burial needs of the applicant or recipient shall be considered part of the burial fund. If an applicant or recipient's burial is funded by an insurance policy, the amount considered set aside for the burial is the lesser of the cost basis or the face value of the insurance policy. (5)At the time of application, the value of a designated burial fund shall be determined by identifying the value of the prepayments which are subject to the burial exclusion and asset limit amounts. (6)Designated burial funds which have been decreased prior to application for medicaidMedicaid shall be considered redesignated as the date of last withdrawal. The balance at that point shall be considered the prepayment amount and earnings from that date forward shall be disregarded. (7)Reductions made in a designated burial fund after eligibility is established must first reduce the amount of earnings. 340(8)An applicant shall be determined eligible for the three -month prior period when a burial fund is established at the time of application if the value of all assets are within the medicaidMedicaid burial fund exclusion and asset limit amounts for each of the three prior months.

This asset must be identifiable and not commingled with other assets. 13.Payments, interest earned on the payments, and in -kind items received for the repair or replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen exempt or excluded assets are excluded for nine months, and may be excluded for an additional twenty -one months, if circumstances beyond the person's control prevent the repair or replacement of the lost, damaged, or stolen assets, and keep the person from contracting for such repair or replacement. This asset must be identifiable and not commingled with other assets. 14.For nine months, beginning after the month of receipt, unspent assistance received from a fund established by a state to aid victims of crime, to the extent that the applicant or recipient demonstrates that such amount was paid in compensation for expenses incurred or losses suffered as a result of a crime.

An asset may be excluded under this section only if the asset is identified. 2.The assets described in subsections 2 through 5 and subsections 8, 9, and 11 through 2627 of section 75-02-02.1-28 are excluded. 3.A residence occupied by the individual, the individual's spouse, or the individual's dependent relative is excluded for medicareMedicare savings programs and qualified disabled and working individuals. A residence occupied by the community spouse is excluded for spousal 342impoverishment prevention cases. The residence may include a mobile home suitable for use, and being used, as a principal place of residence. The residence remains excluded during temporary absence of the individual from the residence so long as the individual intends to return. Renting or leasing part of the residence to a third party does not affect this definition.

This optional exclusion is not available to qualified disabled and working individuals or to community spouses. 7.Property essential to self -support is excluded. 343a.Up to six thousand dollars of the equity value of nonbusiness, income -producing property, which produces annual net income at least equal to six percent of the excluded amount, may be excluded.

History: Effective July 1, 2003; amended effective June 1, 2004; May 1, 2006; April 1, 2008; April 1, 2012; trust is an arrangement whereby a person known as the \"grantor\" or \"trustor\" gives assets to another person known as the \"trustee\" with instructions to use the assets for the benefit of a third person known as the \"beneficiary\". The assets placed in trust are called the \"principal\" or \"corpus\". The positions of grantor, trustee, and beneficiary occur in all trusts, but it is not uncommon for a single trust to involve more than one grantor, trustee, or beneficiary. It is also not uncommon for a grantor to establish a trust where the grantor is also a beneficiary or where the trustee is also a beneficiary. \"Trusts\" includes escrow accounts, investment accounts, conservatorship accounts, and any other legal instruments, devices, or arrangements, whether or not written, managed by an individual or entity with fiduciary obligations. A trust may have an effect on eligibility whether the applicant is a grantor, trustee, or beneficiary. 2.Review of a trust as a part of an eligibility determination includes efforts to ascertain the intent of the grantor. The grantor has no authority or power to determine eligibility or to require a particular outcome in an eligibility determination, and a grantor's efforts to do so may be disregarded. 3.Trusts may be categorized in many ways, but the revocability of a trust is a fundamental characteristic. A revocable trust is a trust that the grantor, or someone acting at the request, direction, or influence of the grantor, has the power to revoke, remove from, or otherwise end the trust. An irrevocable trust is a trust that may not be revoked in any way by the grantor or anyone acting at the request, direction, or influence of the grantor. The determination of trust revocability is not based solely on trust terms stating the trust is irrevocable. A trust is treated as revocable, regardless of its terms, if: a.The trust reserves a power to amend to the grantor, or grants a power to amend to some other person, unless the power to amend is limited to authority to terminate the trust for impossibility of administration, and the trust also provides for distribution of the trust assets to the primary beneficiary, free of trust; b.The grantor and the beneficiaries consent to the revocation; c.The grantor is also the sole beneficiary of the trust; d.The grantor of a trust and all trust beneficiaries are part of a medicaidMedicaid unit; 345e.The grantor is a parent, and beneficiaries of the trust include only the grantor, the grantor's spouse, or the grantor's minor children; f.The trust has been amended subsequent to its establishment, unless the trust was amended under North Dakota Century Code section 59 -12-11; g.The trust provides for termination and disbursement to the grantor upon conditions relating to the grantor during the grantor's lifetime; or h.The trust provides for revocation or amendment only upon order of a court. 4.In the case of a revocable trust: a.The corpus of the trust shall be considered assets available to the grantor; b.Payments from the trust to or for the benefit of grantor, the grantor's spouse, or the grantor's dependent child shall be considered income of the grantor; c.Any other payments from the trust shall be considered income or assets disposed of by the grantor for purposes of section 75 -02-02.1-33.1 or 75-02-02.1-33.2. 5.Once distributed or paid, a distribution or payment from a trust is not a trust asset, but is an asset of, or income to, the distributee or payee. 6.a.For purposes of this subsection: (1)\"Medicaid-qualifying trust\" means a trust established, other than by will, by an individual or the individual's spouse, under which the individual may be the beneficiary of all or part of the payments from the trust, and the distribution of such payments is determined by one or more trustees who are permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to the distribution to the individual. (2)\"A trust established by an individual or the individual's spouse\" includes trusts created or approved by courts or by the individual or the individual's spouse where the property placed in trust is intended to satisfy or settle a claim made by or on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse against any third party. b.The amount from an irrevocable medicaid-qualifyingMedicaid-qualifying trust deemed available to the grantor or the grantor's spouse is the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be distributed to the grantor, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or trustees for the distribution of the maximum amount to the grantor. For purposes of this subdivision, \"grantor\" means the individual referred to in paragraph 1 of subdivision a. c.This subsection applies: (1)Even though the medicaid-qualifyingMedicaid-qualifying trust is irrevocable or is established for purposes other than to enable a grantor to qualify for medicaidMedicaid; and (2)Whether or not the discretion described in paragraph 1 of subdivision a is actually exercised. 7.a.For purposes of this subsection, \"support trust\" means a trust which has, as a purpose, the provision of support or care to a beneficiary. The purpose of a support trust is indicated by language such as \"to provide for the care, support, and maintenance of . . .\"; \"to provide as necessary for the support of . . .\"; or \"as my trustee may deem necessary for the support, maintenance, medical expenses, care, comfort, and general welfare\". No 346particular language is necessary, but words such as \"care\", \"maintenance\", \"medical needs\", or \"support\" are usually present. The term includes trusts which may also be called \"discretionary support trusts\", so long as support is a trust purpose and the trustee's discretion is not unfettered. This subsection applies without regard to: (1)Whether or not the support trust is irrevocable or is established for purposes other than to enable a beneficiary to qualify for medicaidMedicaid or any other benefit program where availability of benefits requires the establishment of financial need; or (2)Whether or not the discretion is actually exercised. b.Except as provided in subdivisions c and d, the amount from a support trust deemed available to the beneficiary, the beneficiary's spouse, and the beneficiary's children is the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be distributed to the beneficiary, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or trustees for the distribution of the maximum amount to the beneficiary. c.A beneficiary of a support trust, under which the distribution of payments to the beneficiary is determined by one or more trustees who are permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to that distribution, may show that the amounts deemed available under subdivision b are not actually available by: (1)Commencing proceedings against the trustee or trustees in a court of competent jurisdiction; (2)Diligently and in good faith asserted in the proceeding that the trustee or trustees is required to provide support out of the trust; and (3)Showing that the court has made a determination, not reasonably subject to appeal, that the trustee must pay some amount less than the amount determined under subdivision b. d.If the beneficiary makes the showing described in subdivision c, the amount deemed available from the trust is the amount determined by the court. e.Any action by a beneficiary or the beneficiary's representative, or by the trustee or the trustee's representative, in attempting a showing under subdivision c, to make the department, the state of North Dakota, or a county agency a party to the proceeding, or to show to the court that medicaidMedicaid benefits may be available if the court limits the amounts deemed available under the trust, precludes the showing of good faith required under subdivision c. 8.a.For purposes of this subsection, \"other trust\" means any trust for which treatment is not otherwise described in this section or section 75 -02-02.1-31.1. b.The amount from an \"other trust\" deemed available to a beneficiary of that trust is the greater of the amount which must be distributed to that beneficiary under the terms of the trust, whether or not that amount is actually distributed, and the amount which is actually distributed. 9.An applicant or recipient who is a trustee has the legal ownership of trust property and the legal powers to distribute income or trust assets which are described in the trust. However, those powers may be exercised only on behalf of trust beneficiaries. If the trustee or other members of the medicaidMedicaid unit are not also beneficiaries or grantors to whom trust income or assets are treated as available, trust assets are not available to the trustee. 34710.Trusts may provide that trust benefits are intended only for a beneficiary's \"special needs\", and require the trustee to take into consideration the availability of public benefits and resources, including medicaidMedicaid. Some trusts may provide that the trust is not to be used to supplant or replace public benefits, including medicaidMedicaid benefits. Some trusts may contain terms which attempt to declare or make the determination of the availability of trusts assets for medicaidMedicaid purposes. If a trust contains such terms, the amount available to the medicaidMedicaid applicant or recipient is the amount provided in this section, assuming, for the purposes of making that determination, that the applicant or recipient is ineligible for medicaidMedicaid. 11.A trust is established, with respect to any asset that is a part of the trust corpus, on the date that asset is made subject to the trust by an effective transfer to the trustee. 12.This section applies to any trust to which section 75 -02-02.1-31.1 does not apply. Subsections 1, 2, and 3 apply to trusts described in section 75 -02-02.1-31.1. History: Effective December 1, 1991; amended effective December 1, 1991; October 1, 1993; July 1, 2003; April 1, 2008; April 1, 2010; Trusts established by applicants, recipients, or their spouses after August 10, 1993. 1.For purposes of determining an individual's eligibility under this chapter, subject to subsection 4, this section applies to a trust established by the individual after August 10, 1993. Subsections 1, 2, and 3 of section 75 -02-02.1-31 apply to this section. 2.a.For purposes of this subsection, an individual shall be considered to have established a trust if assets of the individual were used, by someone with lawful authority over those assets, to form all or part of the corpus of the trust and if any of the following individuals established that trust other than by will: (1)The individual;

(2)Whether the trustees have or exercise any discretion under the trust; (3)Any restrictions on when or whether distributions may be made from the trust; or (4)Any restrictions on the use of distributions from the trust. 3483.a.In the case of a revocable trust: (1)The corpus of the trust shall be considered assets available to the individual; (2)Payments from the trust to or for the benefit of the individual shall be considered income of the individual; and (3)Any other payments from the trust shall be considered income or assets disposed of by the individual for purposes of section 75 -02-02.1-33.1 or 75-02-02.1-33.2. b.In the case of an irrevocable trust: (1)If there are any circumstances under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual, the portion of the corpus from which, or the income on the corpus from which, payment to the individual could be made shall be considered available to the individual, and payments from that portion of the corpus or income: (a)To or for the benefit of the individual, shall be considered income of the individual; and (b)For any other purpose, shall be considered a transfer of income or assets by the individual subject to section 75 -02-02.1-33.1; and (2)Any portion of the trust from which, or any income on the corpus from which, no payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual shall be considered, as of the date of establishment of the trust, or, if later, the date on which payment to the individual was foreclosed, to be income or assets disposed by the individual for purposes of section 75 -02-02.1-33.1 or 75-02-02.1-33.2, and the value of the trust shall be determined for purposes of section 75 -02-02.1-33.1 or 75-02-02.1-33.2 by including the amount of any payments made from such portion of the trust after such date. 4.This section shall not apply to: a.A trust containing the assets of an individual under age sixty -five who is disabled and which is established for the benefit of such individual by the individual, a parent, grandparent, legal guardian of the individual, or a court, to the extent the person establishing the trust has lawful authority over the individual's assets, and if, under the terms of the trust, the department will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of such individual up to an amount equal to the total medicaidMedicaid benefits paid under North Dakota Century Code chapter 50 -24.1 on behalf of the individual; or b.A trust containing the assets of a disabled individual that meets the following conditions: (1)The trust is established and managed by a qualified nonprofit association that acts as trustee; (2)A separate account is maintained for each beneficiary of the trust, but, for purposes of investment and management of funds, the trust pools these accounts;

History: Effective October 1, 1993; amended effective July 1, 2003; April 1, 2008; January 1, 2011 ; April 1, General Valuation of assets. It is not always possible to determine the value of assets with absolute certainty, but it is necessary to determine a value in order to determine eligibility. The valuation must be based on reasonably reliable information. It is the responsibility of the applicant or recipient, or the persons acting on behalf of the applicant or recipient, to furnish reasonably reliable information. Because an applicant or recipient may not be knowledgeable of asset values, and particularly because that person may have a strong interest in the establishment of a particular value, whether or not that value is accurate, some verification of value must be obtained. If a valuation from a source offered by an applicant or recipient is greatly different from generally available or published sources, the applicant or recipient must provide a convincing explanation for the differences particularly if the applicant or recipient may be able to influence the person providing the valuation. If reasonably reliable information concerning the value of assets is not made available, eligibility may not be determined. Useful sources of verification include: 1.With respect to liquid assets: reliable account records. 2.With respect to personal property other than liquid assets: a.Publicly traded stocks, bonds, and securities: stockbrokers. b.Autos, trucks, mobile homes, boats, farm equipment, or any other property listed in published valuation guides accepted in the trade: the valuation guide. c.With respect to harvested grains or produce: grain buyers, grain elevator operators, produce buyers; and, for crops grown on contract: the contract. d.With respect to stock in corporations not publicly traded: appraisers, accountants. e.With respect to other personal property: dealers and buyers of that property. f.With respect to a life insurance policy: the life insurance company. 3.Real property. a.With respect to mineral interests: (1)If determining current value, the best offer received following a good -faith effort to sell the mineral interests. A good -faith effort to sell means offering the mineral interests to at least three companies purchasing mineral rights in the area, or by offering for bids through public advertisement. (2)If determining a past value for mineral rights previously sold or transferred: 351(a)If producing, the value is an amount equal to any lease income received after the transfer plus three times the annual royalty income based on actual royalty income from the sixty months following the transfer, or if sixty months have not yet passed, based on actual royalty income in the months that have already passed plus an estimate for the remainder of the sixty -month period. (b)If not producing, but the mineral rights are leased, the value is an amount equal to two times the total lease amount; or (c)If not leased, the value is an amount equal to the greater of two times the estimated lease amount or the potential sale value of the mineral rights, as determined by a geologist, mineral broker, or mineral appraiser. (3)In determining current or past value, an applicant, recipient, or the department may provide persuasive evidence establishing a value different from the value established using the process described in this subdivision. b.With respect to agricultural lands: appraisers, real estate agents dealing in the area, loan officers in local agricultural lending institutions, and other persons known to be knowledgeable of land sales in the area in which the lands are located, but not the \"true and full\" value from tax records. c.With respect to real property other than mineral interests and agricultural lands: market value or \"true and full\" value from tax records, whichever represents a reasonable approximation of fair market value; real estate agents dealing in the area; and loan officers in local lending institutions. 4.Divided or partial interests. Divided or partial interests include assets held by the applicant or recipients; jointly or in common with persons who are not in the medicaidMedicaid unit; assets where the applicant or recipient or other persons within the medicaidMedicaid unit own only a partial share of what is usually regarded as the entire asset; and interests where the applicant or recipient owns only a life estate or remainder interest in the asset. a.Liquid assets. The value of a partial or shared interest in a liquid asset is equal to the total value of that asset. b.Personal property other than liquid assets and real property other than life estates and remainder interests. The value of a partial or shared interest is a proportionate share of the total value of the asset equal to the proportionate share of the asset owned by the applicant or recipient. c.Life estates and remainder interests. (1)The life estate and remainder interest tables must be used to determine the value of a life estate or remainder interest. In order to use the table, it is necessary to first know the age of the life tenant or, if there are more than one life tenants, the age of the youngest life tenant; and the fair market value of the property which is subject to the life estate or remainder interest. The value of a life estate is found by selecting the appropriate age in the table and multiplying the corresponding life estate decimal fraction times the fair market value of the property. The value of a remainder interest is found by selecting the appropriate age of the life tenant in the table and multiplying the corresponding remainder interest decimal fraction times the fair market value of the property. Life Estate and Remainder Interest Table 352Age Life Estate Remainder Interest 0 .97188 (2)The life estate and remainder interest tables are based on the anticipated lifetimes of individuals of a given age according to statistical tables of probability. If the life tenant suffers from a condition likely to cause death at an unusually early age, the value of the life estate decreases and the value of the remainder interest increases. An individual who requires long -term care, who suffers from a condition that is anticipated to require long -term care within twelve months, or who has been diagnosed with a disease or condition likely to reduce the individual's life expectancy is presumed to suffer from a condition likely to cause death at an unusually early age, and may not rely upon statistical tables of probability applicable to the general population to establish the value of a life estate or remainder interest. If an individual is presumed to suffer from a condition likely to cause death at an unusually early age, an applicant or recipient whose eligibility depends upon establishing the value of a life estate or remainder interest must provide a reliable medical statement that estimates the remaining duration of life in years. The estimated remaining duration of life may be used, in conjunction with a life expectancy table, to determine the comparable age for application of the life estate and remainder interest table. 5.Contractual rights to receive money payments: a.Except during any disqualifying transfer penalty period as established by subdivision d, the value of contractual rights to receive money payments in which payments are current 356is an amount equal to the total of all outstanding payments of principal required to be made by the contract unless evidence is furnished that establishes a lower value. b.Except during any disqualifying transfer penalty period as established by subdivision d, the value of contractual rights to receive money payments in which payments are not current is the current fair market value of the property subject to the contract. c.Except during any disqualifying transfer penalty period as established by subdivision d, if upon execution the total of all principal payments required under the terms of the contract is less than the fair market value of the property sold, the difference is a disqualifying transfer governed by section 75 -02-02.1-33.1 or 75-02-02.1-33.2, and the value of the contract is determined under subdivision a or b. d.A contractual right to receive money payments that consists of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage is a disqualifying transfer governed by section 75 -02-02.1-33.2 of an amount equal to the outstanding balance due as of the date the lender or purchaser, or the lender's or purchaser's spouse, first applies for medicaidMedicaid to secure nursing care services, as defined in section 75 -02-02.1-33.2, if: (1)Any payment on the contract is due after the end of the contract payee's life expectancy as established in accordance with actuarial publications of the office of the chief actuary of the social security administration; (2)The contract provides for other than equal payments or for any balloon or deferred payment; or (3)The contract provides for any payment otherwise due to be diminished after the contract payee's death. e.The value of a secured contractual right to receive money payments that consists of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage not described in subdivision d shall be determined under subdivision a or b. For an unsecured note, loan, or mortgage, the value is the outstanding payments of principal and overdue interest unless evidence is furnished that establishes a lower value. 6.Contract values. a.The value of a contract under which payments are made to an applicant or a recipient and in which payments are current is equal to the total of all outstanding payments of principal required to be made by the contract, unless evidence is furnished that establishes a lower value. b.The value of a contract under which payments are made to an applicant or a recipient and in which payments are not current is an amount equal to the current fair market value of the property subject to the contract. If the contract is not secured by property, the value of the contract is the total of all outstanding payments of principal and past -due interest required to be made under the contract. c.If the contractual right to receive money payments is not collectible and is not secured, the debt has no collectible value and is not a countable asset. An applicant or recipient can establish that a note has no collectable value if: (1)The debtor is judgement proof which means a money judgement has been secured, an execution has been served upon the debtor which has been returned as wholly unsatisfied, and the debtor's affidavit and claim for exemptions exempt all of the debtor's property or as determined by the department ; or 357(2)The applicant or recipient verifies the debt is uncollectible due to a statute of limitations which may be shown, among other ways, by an attorney's letter identifying the applicable statute and the facts that make the debt uncollectible under that statute of limitations. History: Effective December 1, 1991; amended effective December 1, 1991; July 1, 1993; July 1, 2003; April 1, 2008; January 1, 2010; January 1, 2011; April 1, 2014; February 8, 2006. 1.a.Except as provided in subsections 2 and 10, an individual is ineligible for nursing care services, swing-bed services, or home and community -based services if the individual or the spouse of the individual disposes of assets or income for less than fair market value on or after the look -back date specified in subdivision b. b.The look-back date specified in this subdivision is a date that is the number of months specified in paragraph 1 or 2 before the first date on which the individual is both receiving nursing care services and has applied for benefits under this chapter, without regard to the action taken on the application. (1)Except as provided in paragraph 2, the number of months is thirty -six months. (2)The number of months is sixty months: (a)In the case of payments from a revocable trust that are treated as income or assets disposed of by an individual pursuant to subdivision c of subsection 4 of section 75-02-02.1-31 or paragraph 3 of subdivision a of subsection 3 of section 75-02-02.1-31.1; (b)In the case of payments from an irrevocable trust that are treated as income or assets disposed of by an individual pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph 1 of subdivision b of subsection 3 of section 75-02-02.1-31.1; and (c)In the case of payments to an irrevocable trust that are treated as income or assets disposed of by an individual pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision b of subsection 3 of section 75-02-02.1-31.1. c.The period of ineligibility begins the first day of the month in which income or assets have been transferred for less than fair market value, or if that day is within any other period of ineligibility under this section, the first day thereafter that is not in such a period of ineligibility. d.The number of months and days of ineligibility for an individual shall be equal to the total cumulative uncompensated value of all income and assets transferred by the individual, or individual's spouse, on or after the look -back date specified in subdivision b, divided by the average monthly cost, or average daily cost as appropriate, of nursing facility care in North Dakota at the time of the individual's first application. e. Any portion of the transferred asset or income returned prior to the imposition of the period of ineligibility reduces the total amount of the disqualifying transfer. 2.An individual may not be ineligible for medicaidMedicaid by reason of subsection 1 to the extent that: a.The assets transferred were a home, and title to the home was transferred to: 358(1)The individual's spouse; (2)The individual's son or daughter age twenty -one, blind, or disabled; (3)The individual's brother or sister who has an equity interest in the individual's home and who was residing in the individual's home for a period of at least one year immediately before the date the individual became an institutionalized individual; or (4)The individual's son or daughter, other than a child described in paragraph 2, who was residing in the individual's home for a period of at least two years immediately before the date the individual began receiving nursing care services, and who provided care to the individual which permitted the individual to avoid receiving nursing care services; b.The income or assets: (1)Were transferred to the individual's spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse; (2)Were transferred from the individual's spouse to another for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse; (3)Were transferred to, or to a trust established solely for the benefit of, the individual's child who is blind or disabled; or (4)Were transferred to a trust established solely for the benefit of an individual under sixty-five years of age who is disabled; c.The individual makes a satisfactory showing that: (1)The individual intended to dispose of the income or assets, either at fair market value or other valuable consideration, and the individual had an objectively reasonable belief that fair market value or its equivalent was received; (2)The income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid; or (3)For periods after the return, all income or assets transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the individual; or d.The asset transferred was an asset excluded for medicaidMedicaid purposes other than: (1)The home or residence of the individual or the individual's spouse; (2)Property which is not saleable without working an undue hardship; (3)Excluded home replacement funds; (4)Excluded payments, excluded interest on those payments, and excluded in -kind items received for the repair or replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen exempt or excluded assets; (5)Life estate interests; (6)Mineral interests; (7)An asset received from a decedent's estate during any period it is considered to be unavailable under subsection 5 of section 75 -02-02.1-25; or 359(8)An annuity; or (9) A motor vehicle. 3.An individual shall not be ineligible for medicaidMedicaid by reason of subsection 1 to the extent the individual makes a satisfactory showing that an undue hardship exists. a.An undue hardship exists only if the total cumulative uncompensated value of all income and assets transferred for less than fair market value by the individual or the individual's spouse is less than the total of all unpaid nursing care bills for services: (1)Provided after the last such transfer was made which are not subject to payment by any third party; and (2)Incurred when the individual and the individual's spouse had no assets in excess of the appropriate asset levels. b.If the individual shows that an undue hardship exists, the individual shall be subject to an alternative period of ineligibility that begins on the first day of the month in which the individual and the individual's spouse had no excess assets and continues for the number of months determined by dividing the total cumulative uncompensated value of all such transfers by the average monthly unpaid charges incurred by the individual for nursing care services provided after the beginning of the alternative period of ineligibility. 4.There is a presumption that a transfer for less than fair market value was made for purposes that include the purpose of qualifying for medicaidMedicaid: a.In any case in which the individual's assets (and the assets of the individual's spouse) remaining after the transfer produce income which, when added to other income available to the individual (and to the individual's spouse) totals an amount insufficient to meet all living expenses and medical costs reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the individual (and by the individual's spouse) in the month of transfer and in the thirty -five months (or fifty-nine months in the case of a transfer from a revocable or irrevocable trust that is treated as assets or income disposed of by the individual (or the individual's spouse) or in the case of payments to an irrevocable trust that are treated as assets or income disposed of by the individual (or the individual's spouse)) following the month of transfer; b.In any case in which an inquiry about medicaidMedicaid benefits was made, by or on behalf of the individual to any person, before the date of the transfer; c.In any case in which the individual or the individual's spouse was an applicant for or recipient of medicaidMedicaid before the date of transfer; d.In any case in which a transfer is made by or on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse, if the value of the transferred income or asset, when added to the value of the individual's other countable assets, would exceed the asset limits at section 75-02-02.1-26; or e.In any case in which the transfer was made, on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse, by a guardian, conservator, or attorney -in-fact, to the individual's relative, or to the guardian, conservator, or attorney -in-fact or to any parent, child, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, great-grandparent, great -grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew, whether by birth, adoption, and whether by whole or half -blood, of the guardian, conservator, or attorney-in-fact or the spouse or former spouse of the guardian, conservator, or attorney-in-fact. 3605.An applicant or recipient who claims that income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid must show that a desire to receive medicaidMedicaid benefits played no part in the decision to make the transfer and must rebut any presumption arising under subsection 4. The fact, if it is a fact, that the individual would be eligible for the medicaidMedicaid coverage for nursing care services, had the individual or the individual's spouse not transferred income or assets for less than fair market value, is not evidence that the income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid. 6.If a transfer results in a period of ineligibility under this section for an individual receiving nursing care services, and the transfer was made on or after the look -back date of the individual's spouse, and if the individual's spouse is otherwise eligible for medicaidMedicaid and requires nursing care services, the remaining period of ineligibility shall be apportioned equally between the spouses. If one such spouse dies or stops receiving nursing care services, any months remaining in that spouse's apportioned period of ineligibility must be assigned or reassigned to the spouse who continues to receive nursing care services. 7.No income or asset transferred to a parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, stepsister, stepbrother, great -grandparent, great -grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the individual or the individual's spouse, purportedly for services or assistance furnished by the transferee to the individual or the individual's spouse, may be treated as consideration for the services or assistance furnished unless: a.The transfer is made pursuant to a valid written contract entered into prior to rendering the services or assistance or in absence of a valid written contract, evidence is provided the services were required and provided ; b.The contract was executed by the individual or the individual's fiduciary who is not a provider of services or assistance under the contract; c.Compensation is consistent with rates paid in the open market for the services or assistance actually provided; and d.The parties' course of dealing included paying compensation upon rendering services or assistance, or within thirty days thereafter. 8.A transfer is complete when the individual or the individual's spouse making the transfer has no lawful means of undoing the transfer or requiring a restoration of ownership. 9.For purposes of this section: a.\"Annuity\" means a policy, certificate, contract, or other arrangement between two or more parties whereby one party pays money or other valuable consideration to the other party in return for the right to receive payments in the future, but does not mean an employee benefit that qualifies for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code or a plan described in the Internal Revenue Code as a retirement plan under which contributions must end and withdrawals must begin by age seventy and one -half. b.\"Average monthly cost of nursing facility care\" means the cost determined by the department under section 1917(c)(1)(E)(i)(II) of the Act [42 U.S.C. 1396p(c)(1)(E)(i)(II)]. c.\"Fair market value\" means: (1)In the case of a liquid asset that is not subject to reasonable dispute concerning its value, such as cash, bank deposits, stocks, and fungible commodities, one hundred percent of apparent fair market value; 361(2)In the case of real or personal property that is subject to reasonable dispute concerning its value : (a) If conveyed in an arm's -length transaction to someone not in a confidential relationship with the individual or anyone acting on the individual's behalf, seventy-five percent of estimated fair market value; or (b) If conveyed to someone in a confidential relationship with the individual or anyone acting on the individual's behalf, one hundred seventy-five percent of the estimated fair market value; and (3)In the case of income, one hundred percent of apparent fair market value. d.\"Major medical policy\" includes any policy, certificate, or subscriber contract issued on a group or individual basis by any insurance company, nonprofit health service organization, fraternal benefit society, or health maintenance organization, which provides a plan of health insurance or health benefit coverage including medical, hospital, and surgical care, approved for issuance by the insurance regulatory body in the state of issuance, but does not include accident -only, credit, dental, vision, medicareMedicare supplement, long-term care, or disability income insurance, coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance or automobile medical payment insurance, or a policy or certificate of specified disease, hospital confinement indemnity, or limited benefit health insurance. e.\"Medicare\" means the Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled Act, title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1965, as amended [42 U.S.C. 1395, et seq.; Pub. L. 92 -603; 86 Stat. 1370]. f.\"Medicare supplement policy offering plan F benefits\" means a policy, group, or individual accident and health insurance policy or a subscriber contract of a health service corporation or a health care plan of a health maintenance organization or preferred provider organization, other than a policy issued pursuant to a contract under section 1876 or 1833 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395, et seq.] or an issued policy under a demonstration project authorized pursuant to amendments to the Social Security Act that: (1)Is advertised, marketed, or designed primarily as a supplement to reimbursements under medicareMedicare for the hospital, medical, or surgical expenses of persons eligible for medicareMedicare; (2)Is not a policy or contract of one or more employers or labor organizations, or the trustees of a fund established by one or more employers or labor organizations, or combination thereof, for employees or former employees, or combination thereof, or for members or former members, or combination thereof, of the labor organization; (3)Is approved for issuance by the insurance regulatory body in the state of issuance; and (4)Includes: (a)Hospitalization benefits consisting of medicareMedicare part A coinsurance plus coverage for three hundred sixty -five additional days after medicareMedicare benefits end; (b)Medical expense benefits consisting of medicareMedicare part B coinsurance; (c)Blood provision consisting of the first three pints of blood each year; 362(d)Skilled nursing coinsurance; (e)Medicare part A deductible coverage; (f)Medicare part B deductible coverage; (g)Medicare part B excess benefits at one hundred percent coverage; and (h)Foreign travel emergency coverage. g.\"Relative\" means a parent, child, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, great -grandparent, aunt, uncle, -great-grandchild, great-aunt, great-uncle, first cousin, grandniece, or grandnephew, whether by birth or adoption, and whether by whole or half-blood, of the individual or the individual's current or former spouse. h.\"Someone in a confidential relationship\" includes an individual's attorney -in-fact, guardian, conservator, legal custodian, caretaker, trustee, attorney, accountant, or agent, and may include a relative or other person with a close and trusted relationship to the individual. i. \"Uncompensated value\" means the difference between fair market value and the value of any consideration received. 10.The provisions of this section do not apply in determining eligibility for medicareMedicare savings programs. 11.An individual disposes of assets or income when the individual, or anyone on behalf of the individual or at the request of the individual, acts or fails to act in a manner that effects a transfer, conveyance, assignment, renunciation, or disclaimer of any asset or income in which the individual had or was entitled to claim an interest of any kind. 12.An individual who disposes of assets or income to someone in a confidential relationship is presumed to have transferred the assets or income to an implied trust in which the individual is the beneficiary and which is subject to treatment under section 75 -02-02.1-31.1. The presumption may be rebutted only if the individual shows: a.

History: Effective October 1, 1993; amended effective December 1, 1996; July 1, 2003; June 1, 2004; May 1, 2006; April 1, 2008; January 1, 2010; April 1, 2012 ; April on or after February 8, 2006. 1.This section applies to transfers of income or assets made on or after February 8, 2006. 2.Except as provided in subsections 7 and 16, an individual is ineligible for skilled nursing care, swing-bed, or home and community -based benefits if the individual or the individual's spouse disposes of assets or income for less than fair market value on or after the look -back date. The look-back date is a date that is sixty months before the first date on which the individual is both receiving skilled nursing care, swing -bed, or home and community -based services and has applied for benefits under this chapter, without regard to the action taken on the application. 3.An applicant, recipient, or anyone acting on behalf of an applicant or recipient, has a duty to disclose any transfer of any asset or income made by or on behalf of the applicant or recipient, or the spouse of the applicant or recipient, for less than full fair market value: a.When making an application; b.When completing a redetermination; and c.If made after eligibility has been established, by the end of the month in which the transfer was made. 4.The date that a period of ineligibility begins is the latest of: a.The first day of the month in which the income or assets were transferred for less than fair market value; b.The first day on which the individual is receiving nursing care services and would otherwise have been receiving benefits for institutional care but for the penalty; or c.The first day thereafter which is not in a period of ineligibility. 5.a.The number of months and days of ineligibility for an individual shall be equal to the total cumulative uncompensated value of all income and assets transferred by the individual, or individual's spouse, on or after the look -back date divided by the average monthly cost or average daily cost, as appropriate, of nursing facility care in North Dakota at the time of the individual's application. b.A fractional period of ineligibility may not be rounded down or otherwise disregarded with respect to any disposal of assets or income for less than fair market value. c.Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this section, in the case of an individual or an individual's spouse who makes multiple fractional transfers of assets or income in more than one month for less than fair market value on or after the look -back date established under subsection 2, the period of ineligibility applicable to such individual must be determined by treating the total, cumulative uncompensated value of all assets or income transferred during all months on or after the look -back date as one transfer and one penalty period must be imposed beginning on the earliest date applicable to any of the transfers. d. Any portion of the transferred asset or income returned prior to the imposition of the period of ineligibility reduces the total amount of the disqualifying transfer. 3656.For purposes of this section, \"assets\" includes the purchase of a life estate interest in another individual's home unless the purchaser resides in the home for a period of at least one year after the date of the purchase. 7.An individual may not be ineligible for medicaidMedicaid by reason of subsection 2 to the extent that: a.The assets transferred were a home, and title to the home was transferred to: (1)The individual's spouse; (2)The individual's son or daughter age twenty -one, blind, or disabled; (3)The individual's brother or sister who has an equity interest in the individual's home and who was residing in the individual's home for a period of at least one year immediately before the date the individual became an institutionalized individual; or (4)The individual's son or daughter, other than a child described in paragraph 2, who was residing in the individual's home for a period of at least two years immediately before the date the individual began receiving nursing care services, and who provided care to the individual which permitted the individual to avoid receiving nursing care services; b.The income or assets: (1)Were transferred to the individual's spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse; (2)Were transferred from the individual's spouse to another for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse; (3)Were transferred to, or to a trust established solely for the benefit of, the individual's child who is blind or disabled; or (4)Were transferred to a trust established solely for the benefit of an individual less than sixty-five years of age who is disabled; c.The individual makes a satisfactory showing that: (1)The individual intended to dispose of the income or assets, either at fair market value or other valuable consideration, and the individual had an objectively reasonable belief that fair market value or its equivalent was received; (2)The income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid; or (3)For periods after the return, all income or assets transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the individual; or d.The asset transferred was an asset excluded for medicaidMedicaid purposes other than: (1)The home or residence of the individual or the individual's spouse; (2)Property that is not saleable without working an undue hardship; (3)Excluded home replacement funds; 366(4)Excluded payments, excluded interest on those payments, and excluded in -kind items received for the repair or replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen exempt or excluded assets; (5)Life estate interests; (6)Mineral interests; (7)An asset received from a decedent's estate during any period it is considered to be unavailable under subsection 5 of section 75-02-02.1-25; or (8)An annuity; or (9) A motor vehicle. 8.a.An individual shall not be ineligible for medicaidMedicaid by reason of subsection 2 to the extent the individual makes a satisfactory showing that an undue hardship exists for the individual. Upon imposition of a period of ineligibility because of a transfer of assets or income for less than fair market value, the department shall notify the applicant or recipient of the right to request an undue hardship exception. An individual may apply for an exception to the transfer of asset penalty if the individual claims that the ineligibility period will cause an undue hardship to the individual. A request for a determination of undue hardship must be made within ninety days after the circumstances upon which the claim of undue hardship is made were known or should have been known to the affected individual or the person acting on behalf of that individual if incompetent. The individual must provide to the department sufficient documentation to support the claim of undue hardship. The department shall determine whether a hardship exists upon receipt of all necessary documentation submitted in support of a request for a hardship exception. An undue hardship exists only if the individual shows that all of the following conditions are met: (1)Application of the period of ineligibility would deprive the individual of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities of life or would deprive the individual of medical care such that the individual's health or life would be endangered; (2)The individual who transferred the assets or income, or on whose behalf the assets or income were transferred, has exhausted all lawfulreasonable means to recover the assets or income or the value of the transferred assets or income, from the transferee, a fiduciary, or any insurer; and (3)A person who would otherwise provide care would have no cause of action, or has exhausted all causes of action, against the transferee of the assets or income of the individual or the individual's spouse under North Dakota Century Code chapter 13-02.1, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act, or any substantially similar law of another jurisdiction; and (4) The individual's remaining available assets and the remaining assets of the individual's spouse are less than the asset limit in subsection 1 of section 75-02-02.1-26, or if applicable, the minimum allowed under section 75 -02-02.1-24, counting the value of all assets except: (a)A home, exempt under section 75 -02-02.1-28, but not if the individual or the individual's spouse has equity in the home in excess of twenty -five percent of the amount established in the approved state plan for medical assistance which is allowed as the maximum home equity interest for nursing facility services or other long -term care services; 367(b)Household and personal effects; (c)One motor vehicle if the primary use is for transportation of the individual, or the individual's spouse or minor, blind, or disabled child who occupies the home; and (d)Funds for burial up to the amount excluded in subsection 10 of section 75-02-02.1-28 for the individual and the individual's spouse. b.Upon the showing required by this subsection, the department shall state the date upon which an undue hardship begins and, if applicable, when it ends. c.The agency shall terminate the undue hardship exception, if not earlier, at the time an individual, the spouse of the individual, or anyone with authority to act on behalf of the individual, makes any uncompensated transfer of income or assets after the undue hardship exception is granted. The agency shall deny any further requests for an undue hardship exception due to either the disqualification based on the transfer upon which the initial undue hardship determination was based, or a disqualification based on any subsequent transfer. 9.If a request for an undue hardship waiver is denied, the applicant or recipient may request a fair hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 75 -01-03. 10.There is a presumption that a transfer for less than fair market value was made for purposes that include the purpose of qualifying for medicaidMedicaid: a.In any case in which the individual's assets and the assets of the individual's spouse remaining after the transfer produce income which, when added to other income available to the individual and to the individual's spouse, total an amount insufficient to meet all living expenses and medical costs reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the individual and by the individual's spouse in the month of transfer and in the fifty -nine months following the month of transfer; b.In any case in which an inquiry about medicaidMedicaid benefits was made, by or on behalf of the individual to any person, before the date of the transfer; c.In any case in which the individual or the individual's spouse was an applicant for or recipient of medicaidMedicaid before the date of transfer; d.In any case in which a transfer is made by or on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse, if the value of the transferred income or asset, when added to the value of the individual's other countable assets, would exceed the asset limits in section 75-02-02.1-26; or e.In any case in which the transfer was made, on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse, by a guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact, to a relative of the individual or the individual's spouse, or to the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact or to any parent, child, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, great-grandparent, great -grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew, whether by birth, adoption, and whether by whole or half -blood, of the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact or the spouse or former spouse of the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact. 11.An applicant or recipient who claims that income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid must show that a desire to receive medicaidMedicaid benefits played no part in the decision to make the transfer and must rebut any presumption arising under subsection 10. The fact, if it is a fact, that the individual would 368be eligible for the medicaidMedicaid coverage for nursing care services, had the individual or the individual's spouse not transferred income or assets for less than fair market value, is not evidence that the income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid. 12.If a transfer results in a period of ineligibility under this section for an individual receiving nursing care services, and if the individual's spouse is otherwise eligible for medicaidMedicaid and requires nursing care services, the remaining period of ineligibility shall be apportioned equally between the spouses. If one such spouse dies or stops receiving nursing care services, any months remaining in that spouse's apportioned period of ineligibility must be assigned or reassigned to the spouse who continues to receive nursing care services. 13.No income or asset transferred to a parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, stepsister, stepbrother, great -grandparent, great -grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the individual or the individual's spouse, purportedly for services or assistance furnished by the transferee to the individual or the individual's spouse, may be treated as consideration for the services or assistance furnished unless: a.The transfer is made pursuant to a valid written contract entered into prior to rendering the services or assistance or in absence of a valid written contract, evidence is provided the services were required and provided ; b.The contract was executed by the individual or the individual's fiduciary who is not a provider of services or assistance under the contract; c.Compensation is consistent with rates paid in the open market for the services or assistance actually provided; and d.The parties' course of dealing included paying compensation upon rendering services or assistance, or within thirty days thereafter. 14.A transfer is complete when the individual or the individual's spouse making the transfer has no lawful means of undoing the transfer or requiring a restoration of ownership. 15.For purposes of this section: a.\"Annuity\" means a policy, certificate, contract, or other arrangement between two or more parties whereby one party pays money or other valuable consideration to the other party in return for the right to receive payments in the future, but does not mean an employee benefit that qualifies for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code or a plan described in the Internal Revenue Code as a retirement plan under which contributions must end and withdrawals must begin by age seventy and one -half. b.\"Average monthly cost of nursing facility care\" means the cost determined by the department under section 1917(c)(1)(E)(i)(II) of the Act [42 U.S.C. 1396p(c)(1)(E)(i)(II)]. c.\"Fair market value\" means: (1)In the case of a liquid asset that is not subject to reasonable dispute concerning its value, such as cash, bank deposits, stocks, and fungible commodities, one hundred percent of apparent fair market value; (2)In the case of real or personal property that is subject to reasonable dispute concerning its value : 369 (a) If conveyed in an arm's -length transaction to someone not in a confidential relationship with the individual or anyone acting on the individual's behalf, seventy-five percent of estimated fair market value; or (b) If conveyed to someone in a confidential relationship with the individual or anyone acting on the individual's behalf, one hundred , seventy-five percent of the estimated fair market value; and (3)In the case of income, one hundred percent of apparent fair market value. d.\"Major medical policy\" includes any policy, certificate, or subscriber contract issued on a group or individual basis by any insurance company, nonprofit health service organization, fraternal benefit society, or health maintenance organization, which provides a plan of health insurance or health benefit coverage, including medical, hospital, and surgical care, approved for issuance by the insurance regulatory body in the state of issuance, but does not include accident -only, credit, dental, vision, medicareMedicare supplement, long-term care, or disability income insurance, coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance or automobile medical payment insurance, or a policy or certificate of specified disease, hospital confinement indemnity, or limited benefit health insurance. e.\"Medicare\" means the Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled Act, title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1965, as amended [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq; Pub.

The presumption may be rebutted only if the individual shows: a. The compensation actually received by the individual for the assets or income disposed of was equal to at least one hundred percent of fair market value, in which case this section has no application; or b. The individual is competent and disposed of the assets or income, or directed the disposal if made by someone in a confidential relationship, with full knowledge of the motives of the transferee and all other facts concerning the transaction which might affect the individual's own decision and without the use of any influence on the part of the transferee, in which case the transaction is governed by this section. 19. An individual may demonstrate that an asset was transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid if, for a period of at least thirty -six consecutive months, beginning on the date the asset was transferred, the individual has in force home care and long-term care coverage, purchased on or before July 31, 2003, with a daily benefit at least equal to 1.25 times the average daily cost of nursing care for the year in which the policy is issued or an aggregate benefit at least equal to 1,095 times that daily benefit, and: a.For each such month during which the individual is not eligible for medicareMedicare benefits, the individual has in force a major medical policy that provides a lifetime maximum benefit of one million dollars or more, an annual aggregate deductible of five thousand dollars or less, and an out -of-pocket maximum annual expenditure per qualifying individual of five thousand dollars or less; and 371b.For each such month during which the individual is eligible for medicareMedicare benefits, the individual has in force a medicareMedicare supplement policy offering plan F benefits, or their equivalent. 20.19.An individual may demonstrate that an asset was transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid if, for a period of at least thirty -six consecutive months, beginning on the date the asset was transferred, the individual has in force home health care coverage, assisted living coverage, basic care coverage, and skilled nursing facility coverage, purchased on or after August 1, 2003, and before January 1, 2007, with a daily benefit at least equal to 1.57 times the average daily cost of nursing care for the year in which the policy is issued or an aggregate benefit at least equal to 1,095 times that daily benefit, and: a.For each month during which the individual is not eligible for medicareMedicare benefits, the individual has in force a major medical policy that provides a lifetime maximum benefit of one million dollars or more, an annual aggregate deductible of five thousand dollars or less, and an out -of-pocket maximum annual expenditure per qualifying individual of five thousand dollars or less; and b.For each such month during which the individual is eligible for medicareMedicare benefits, the individual has in force a medicareMedicare supplement policy offering plan F benefits, or their equivalent. 21.20.With respect to an annuity transaction which includes the purchase of, selection of an irrevocable payment option, addition of principal to, elective withdrawal from, request to change distribution from, or any other transaction that changes the course of payments from an annuity which occurs on or after February 8, 2006, an individual may demonstrate that an asset was transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaidMedicaid, if the asset was used to acquire an annuity, only if: a.The owner of the annuity provides documentation satisfactory to the department that names the department as the remainder beneficiary in the first position for at least the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the annuitant or the department is named in the second position after the community spouse or minor or disabled child, and that establishes that any attempt by such spouse or a representative of such child to dispose of any such remainder shall cause the department to become the remainder beneficiary for at least the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the annuitant; b.The annuity is purchased from an insurance company or other commercial company that sells annuities as part of the normal course of business; c.The annuity is irrevocable and neither the annuity nor payments due under the annuity may be assigned or transferred; d.The annuity provides substantially equal monthly payments of principal and interest , no less frequently than annually, that vary by five percent or less from the total annual payment of the previous year, and does not have a balloon or deferred payment of principal or interest; and e.The annuity will return the full principal and interest within the purchaser's life expectancy as determined in accordance with actuarial publications of the office of the chief actuary of the social security administration ; and f.

Factual information concerning future circumstances must be based on information by which the applicant or recipient demonstrates known changes or highly probable changes to the income, expenses, or circumstances which offset eligibility, from the base month to the benefit month. d.\"Processing month\" means the month between the base month and the benefit month. e.\"Prospective budgeting\" means computation of a household's eligibility and recipient liability based on the best estimate of income, expenses, and circumstances for a benefit month. 2.Computing recipient liability for previous month. Compute the amount of recipient liability by use of actual verified information, rather than best estimate, in each of the previous months for which eligibility is sought. 3.Computing recipient liability for the current month and next month at time of approval of the application. Compute the amount of the recipient liability prospectively for the current month and the next month. The income received or best estimate of income to be received during the current month must be used to compute the recipient liability for the current month. The best estimates of income to be received during the next month must be used to compute the recipient liability for the next month. 4.Computing recipient liability for ongoing cases. a.For cases with fluctuating income, compute the recipient liability using verified income, expenses, and circumstances which existed during the base month, unless factual information concerning future circumstances is available. Recipients must report their income, expenses, and other circumstances on a monthly basis to determine continued eligibility. 373b.For cases with stable income, compute the recipient liability using the best estimate of income, expenses, and circumstances. Recipients with stable income must report changes in income, expenses, and other circumstances within ten days of the day the recipients became aware of the change. A determination of continued eligibility, after a change is reported and demonstrated, is based on a revised best estimate which takes the changes into consideration. 5.Budgeting procedures used when adding individuals to an eligible unit. Individuals may be added to an eligible unit up to one year prior to the current month, provided the individual meets all eligibility criteria for medicaidMedicaid, the eligible unit was eligible in all of the months in which eligibility for the individual is established, and the individual was in the unit in the months with respect to which eligibility for that individual is sought unless the individual would have been eligible under the adult group. Recipient liability will be based on the unit's actual income and circumstances when adding each individual for retroactive periods. Recipient liability must be based on the unit's income and circumstances from the base month, plus the best estimate of each individual's income and circumstances when adding each individual to the current or next month, unless the individual would have been eligible under the adult group. 6.Budgeting procedures when deleting individuals from a case. When a member of an existing unit is expected to leave the unit during the benefit month, that person may remain as a member of the unit until the end of the benefit month. 7. Budgeting procedures when determining overpayments. When a household fails to report a change that results in a decrease in coverage, the maximum amount of the overpayment is: a. The difference between the correct amount of recipient liability and the actual recipient liability paid by the Medicaid household; b. The amount paid in error for all months the individual should not have been eligible under a fee-for-service benefit plan; or c. The amount paid for a premium under a managed care benefit plan.

History: Effective January 1, 1990; amended effective January 1, 1992; November 1, 1992; November 22, 1993; January 1, 1996; July 1, 1996; January 1, 1998; January 1, 1999; January 1, 2010; January 1, 2012; January 1, 2014; July 1, 2016 ; April 1, General 1.For each cost category, the actual rate is calculated using allowable historical operating costs and adjustment factors provided for in subsection 4 divided by standardized resident days for the direct care cost category and resident days for other direct care, indirect care, and property cost categories. The actual rate as calculated is compared to the limit rate for each cost category to determine the lesser of the actual rate or the limit rate. The lesser rate is given the rate weight of one. The rate weight of one for direct care is then multiplied times the weight for each classification in subsection 5 of section 75-02-06-17 to establish the direct care rate for that classification. The lesser of the actual rate or the limit rate for other direct care, indirect care, and property costs, and the adjustments provided for in subsection 2 and 3 are then added to the direct care rate for each classification to arrive at the established rate for a given classification. 2.a.For a facility with an actual rate below the limit rate for indirect care costs, an incentive amount equal to seventy percent times the difference between the actual rate, exclusive of the adjustment factor, and the limit rate in effect at the end of the year immediately preceding the rate year, up to a maximum of two dollars and sixty cents or the difference between the actual rate, inclusive of the adjustment factor and the limit rate for indirect care costs, whichever is less, must be included as part of the indirect care cost rate. b.A facility shall receive an operating margin of three percent based on the lesser of the actual direct care and other direct care rates, exclusive of the adjustment factor, or the limit rate in effect at the end of the year immediately preceding the rate year. The three percent operating margin must be added to the rate for the direct care and other direct care cost categories. 3.Limitations. a.The department shall accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by facilities. Statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations and incentives for efficiency and economy based on reasonable determination of standards of operations necessary for efficient delivery of needed services. Limitations and incentives may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs of providing services or on specific areas of operations. The department may implement ceilings at any time based upon information available. b.The department shall review, on an ongoing basis, aggregate payments to facilities to determine that payments do not exceed an amount that can reasonably be estimated would have been paid for those services under medicareMedicare payment principles. If aggregate payments to facilities exceed estimated payments under medicareMedicare, the department may make adjustments to rates to establish the upper limitations so that aggregate payments do not exceed an amount that can be estimated would have been paid under medicareMedicare payment principles. c.All facilities except those nongeriatric facilities for individuals with physical disabilities or units within a nursing facility providing geropsychiatric services described in North Dakota Century Code section 50 -24.4-13 must be used to establish a limit rate for the 394direct care, other direct care, and indirect care cost categories. The base year is the report year ended June 30, 20102014. Base year costs may not be adjusted in any manner or for any reason not provided for in this subsection. d.The limit rate for each of the cost categories must be established as follows: (1)Historical costs for the report year ended June 30, 20102014, as adjusted, must be used to establish rates for all facilities in the direct care, other direct care, and indirect care cost categories. The rates as established must be ranked from low to high for each cost category. (2)For the rate year beginning January 1, 2013June 1, 2017, the limit rate for each cost category is: (a)For the direct care cost category, one hundred fifty-oneseventy-eight dollars and nineteeneighteen cents; (b)For the other direct care cost category, twenty-fivetwenty-eight dollars and forty-sixfifteen cents; and (c)For the indirect care cost category, sixty-fiveseventy-seven dollars and thirteentwenty-nine cents. e.A facility with an actual rate that exceeds the limit rate for a cost category shall receive the limit rate. f.The actual rate for indirect care costs and property costs must be the lesser of the rate established using: (1)Actual census for the report year; or (2)Ninety percent of licensed bed capacity available for occupancy as of June thirtieth of the report year: (a)Multiplied times three hundred sixty -five; and (b)Reduced by the number of affected beds, for each day any bed is not in service during the report year, due to a remodeling, renovation, or construction project. g.The department may waive or reduce the application of subdivision f if the facility demonstrates that occupancy below ninety percent of licensed capacity results from the use of alternative home and community services by individuals who would otherwise be eligible for admission to the facility and: (1)The facility has reduced licensed capacity; or (2)The facility's governing board has approved a capacity decrease to occur no later than the end of the rate year which would be affected by subdivision f. h.The department may waive the application of paragraph 2 of subdivision f for nongeriatric facilities for individuals with disabilities or geropsychiatric facilities or units if occupancy below ninety percent is due to lack of department -approved referrals or admissions. 4.An adjustment factor shall be used for purposes of adjusting historical costs for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care under subsection 1 and for purposes of adjusting the limit rates for direct care costs, other direct care costs, and indirect care costs under subsection 3, but may not be used to adjust property costs under either subsection 1 or 3. 3955.Rate adjustments. a.Desk audit rate. (1)The cost report must be reviewed taking into consideration the prior year's adjustments. The facility must be notified by facsimile transmission or electronic mail of any adjustments based on the desk review. Within seven working days after notification, the facility may submit information to explain why the desk adjustment should not be made. The department shall review the information and make appropriate adjustments. (2)The desk audit rate must be effective January first of each rate year unless the department specifically identifies an alternative effective date and must continue in effect until a final rate is established. (3)Until a final rate is effective, pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivision b, private-pay rates may not exceed the desk audit rate except as provided for in section 75-02-06-22 or subdivision c. (4)The facility may request a reconsideration of the desk rate for purposes of establishing a pending decision rate. The request for reconsideration must be filed with the department's medical services division within thirty days of the date of the rate notification and must contain the information required in subsection 1 of section 75-02-06-26. No decision on the request for reconsideration of the desk rate may be made by the department unless, after the facility has been notified that the desk rate is the final rate, the facility requests, in writing within thirty days of the rate notification, the department to issue a decision on that request for reconsideration. (5)The desk rate may be adjusted for special rates or one -time adjustments provided for in this section. (6)The desk rate may be adjusted to reflect errors, adjustments, or omissions for the report year that result in a change of at least ten cents per day for the rate weight of one. b.Final rate. (1)The cost report may be field audited to establish a final rate. If no field audit is performed, the desk audit rate must become the final rate upon notification from the department. The final rate is effective January first of each rate year unless the department specifically identifies an alternative effective date. (2)The final rate must include any adjustments for nonallowable costs, errors, or omissions that result in a change from the desk audit rate of at least ten cents per day for the rate weight of one that are found during a field audit or are reported by the facility within twelve months of the rate yearend. (3)The private-pay rate must be adjusted to the final rate no later than the first day of the second month following receipt of notification by the department of the final rate and is not retroactive except as provided for in subdivision c. (4)The final rate may be revised at any time for special rates or one -time adjustments provided for in this section. (5)If adjustments, errors, or omissions are found after a final rate has been established, the following procedures must be used: 396(a)Adjustments, errors, or omissions found within twelve months of establishment of the final rate, not including subsequent revisions, resulting in a change of at least ten cents per day for the rate weight of one must result in a change to the final rate. The change must be applied retroactively as provided for in this section. (b)Adjustments, errors, or omissions found later than twelve months after the establishment of the final rate, not including subsequent revisions, that would have resulted in a change of at least ten cents per day for the rate weight of one had they been included, must be included as an adjustment in the report year that the adjustment, error, or omission was found. (c)Adjustments resulting from an audit of home office costs, that result in a change of at least ten cents per day for the rate weight of one, must be included as an adjustment in the report year in which the costs were incurred. (d)The two report years immediately preceding the report year to which the adjustments, errors, or omissions apply may also be reviewed for similar adjustments, errors, or omissions. c.Pending decision rates for private -pay residents. (1)If a facility has made a request for reconsideration, taken an administrative appeal, or taken a judicial appeal from a decision on an administrative appeal, and has provided information sufficient to allow the department to accurately calculate, on a per day basis, the effect of each of the disputed issues on the facility's rate, the department shall determine and issue a pending decision rate within thirty days of receipt of the request for reconsideration, administrative appeal, or judicial appeal. If the information furnished is insufficient to determine a pending decision rate, the department, within thirty days of receipt of the request for reconsideration, shall inform the facility of the insufficiency and may identify information that would correct the insufficiency. (2)The department shall add the pending decision rate to the rate that would otherwise be set under this chapter, and, notwithstanding North Dakota Century Code section 50-24.4-19, the total must be the rate chargeable to private -pay residents until a final decision on the request for reconsideration or appeal is made and is no longer subject to further appeal. The pending decision rate is subject to any rate limitation that may apply. (3)The facility shall establish and maintain records that reflect the amount of any pending decision rate paid by each private -pay resident from the date the facility charges a private-pay resident the pending decision rate. (4)If the pending decision rate paid by a private -pay resident exceeds the final decision rate, the facility shall refund the difference, plus interest accrued at the legal rate from the date of notification of the pending decision rate, within sixty days after the final decision is no longer subject to appeal. If a facility fails to provide a timely refund to a living resident or former resident, the facility shall pay interest at three times the legal rate for the period after the refund is due. If a former resident is deceased, the facility shall pay the refund to a person lawfully administering the estate of the deceased former resident or lawfully acting as successor to the deceased former resident. If no person is lawfully administering the estate or lawfully acting as a successor, the facility may make any disposition of the refund permitted by law. Interest paid under this subsection is not an allowable cost. 397d.The final rate as established must be retroactive to the effective date of the desk rate, except with respect to rates paid by private -pay residents. A rate paid by a private -pay resident must be retroactively adjusted and the difference refunded to the resident, if the rate paid by the private -pay resident exceeds the final rate by at least twenty-five centsone dollar per day, except that a pending decision rate is not subject to adjustment or refund until a decision on the disputed amount is made. 6.Rate payments. a.The rate as established must be considered as payment for all accommodations and includes all items designated as routinely provided. No payments may be solicited or received from the resident or any other person to supplement the rate as established. b.The rate as established must be paid by the department only if the rate charged to private-pay residents for semiprivate accommodations equals the established rate. If at any time the facility discounts rates for private -pay residents, the discounted rate must be the maximum chargeable to the department for the same bed type, i.e., hospital or leave days. c.If the established rate exceeds the rate charged to a private -pay resident, on any given date, the facility shall immediately report that fact to the department and charge the department at the lower rate. If payments were received at the higher rate, the facility shall, within thirty days, refund the overpayment. The refund must be the difference between the established rate and the rate charged the private -pay resident times the number of medical assistance resident days paid during the period in which the established rate exceeded the rate charged to private -pay residents, plus interest calculated at two percent over the Bank of North Dakota prime rate on any amount not repaid within thirty days. The refund provision also applies to all duplicate billings involving the department. Interest charges on these refunds are not allowable costs. d.Peer groupings, limitations, or adjustments based upon data received from or relating to more than one facility are effective for a rate period. Any change in the data used to establish peer groupings, limitations, or adjustments may not be used to change such peer groupings, limitations, or adjustments during the rate period, except with respect to the specific facility or facilities to which the data change relates. e.The established rate is paid based on a prospective ratesetting procedure. No retroactive settlements for actual costs incurred during the rate year that exceed the established rate may be made unless specifically provided for in this section. 7.Partial year. a.Rates for a facility changing ownership during the rate period are set under this subdivision. (1)The rates established for direct care, other direct care, indirect care, operating margins, and incentives for the previous owner must be retained through the end of the rate period and the rates for the next rate period following the change in ownership must be established: (a)For a facility with four or more months of operation under the new ownership during the report year, through use of a cost report for the period; (b)For a facility with less than four months of operation under the new ownership during the report year, by indexing the rates established for the previous owner forward using the adjustment factor in subsection 4; or 398(c)If the change of ownership occurred after the report year end, but prior to the beginning of the next rate year, and the previous owner submits and allows audit of a cost report, by establishing a rate based on the previous owner's cost report. (2)Unless a facility elects to have a property rate established under paragraph 3, the rate established for property for the previous owner must be retained through the end of the rate period and the property rate for the next rate period following the change in ownership must be established: (a)For a facility with four or more months of operation under the new ownership during the report year, through use of a cost report for the period; (b)For a facility with less than four months of operation under the new ownership during the report year, by using the rate established for the previous owner for the previous rate year; or (c)If the change of ownership occurred after the report year end, but prior to the beginning of the next rate year, and the previous owner submits and allows audit of a cost report, by establishing a rate based on the previous owner's cost report. (3)A facility may choose to have a property rate established, during the remainder of the rate year and the subsequent rate year, based on interest and principal payments on the allowable portion of debt to be expended during the rate years. The property rate must go into effect on the first of the month following notification by the department. The difference between a property rate established based on the facility's election and a property rate established based on paragraph 2, multiplied by actual census for the period, must be determined. The property rate paid in each of the twelve years, beginning with the first rate year following the use of a property rate established using this paragraph, may not exceed the property rate otherwise allowable, reduced by one -twelfth of that difference. b.For a new facility, the department shall establish an interim rate equal to the limit rates for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care in effect for the rate year in which the facility begins operation, plus the property rate. The property rate must be calculated using projected property costs and projected census. The interim rate must be in effect for no less than ten months and no more than eighteen months. Costs for the period in which the interim rate is effective must be used to establish a final rate. If the final rates for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care costs are less than the interim rates for those costs, a retroactive adjustment as provided for in subsection 5 must be made. A retroactive adjustment to the property rate must be made to adjust projected property costs to actual property costs. For the rate period following submission of any partial year cost report by a facility, census used to establish rates for property and indirect care costs must be the greater of actual census, projected census, or census imputed at ninety-five percent of licensed beds. (1)If the effective date of the interim rate is on or after March first and on or before June thirtieth, the interim rate must be effective for the remainder of that rate year and must continue through June thirtieth of the subsequent rate year. The facility shall file by March first an interim cost report for the period ending December thirty-first of the year in which the facility first provides services. The interim cost report is used to establish the actual rate effective July first of the subsequent rate year. The partial year rate established based on the interim cost report must include applicable incentives, margins, phase -ins, and adjustment factors and may not be subject to any cost settle -up. The cost reports for the report year ending June 399thirtieth of the current and subsequent rate years must be used to determine the final rate for the periods that the interim rate was in effect. (2)If the effective date of the interim rate is on or after July first and on or before December thirty-first, the interim rate must remain in effect through the end of the subsequent rate year. The facility shall file a cost report for the partial report year ending June thirtieth of the subsequent rate year. This cost report must be used to establish the rate for the next subsequent rate year. The facility shall file by March first an interim cost report for the period July first through December thirty -first of the subsequent rate year. The interim cost report is used, along with the report year cost report, to determine the final rate for the periods the interim rate was in effect. (3)If the effective date of the interim rate is on or after January first and on or before February twenty-ninth, the interim rate must remain in effect through the end of the rate year in which the interim rate becomes effective. The facility shall file a cost report for the period ending June thirtieth of the current rate year. This cost report must be used to establish the rate for the subsequent rate year. The facility shall file by March first an interim cost report for the period July first through December thirty-first of the current rate year. The interim cost report is used, along with the report year cost report, to determine the final rate for the period that the interim rate was in effect. (4)The final rate for direct care, other direct care, and indirect care costs established under this subdivision must be limited to the lesser of the limit rate for the current rate year or the actual rate. c.For a facility with renovations or replacements in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, and without a significant capacity increase, the rate established for direct care, other direct care, indirect care, operating margins, and incentive based on the last report year, plus a property rate calculated based on projected property costs and imputed census, must be applied to all licensed beds. The projected property rate must be effective on the first day of the month beginning after the date the project is completed and placed into service or the first day of the month beginning after the date the request for a projected property rate is received by the department, whichever is later. The property rate for the subsequent rate year must be based on projected property costs and imputed census, rather than on property costs actually incurred in the report year. Imputed census is based on the greater of actual census of all licensed beds existing before the renovation or ninety percent of the available licensed beds existing prior to renovation, plus ninety -five percent of the increase in licensed bed capacity and unavailable licensed beds existing prior to the renovation. Subsequent property rates must be adjusted using this methodology, except imputed census must be actual census if actual census exceeds ninety -five percent of total licensed capacity, until such time as twelve months of property costs are reflected in the report year. d.For a facility with a significant capacity increase, the rate established for direct care, other direct care, indirect care, operating margins, and incentive based on the last report year, must be applied to all licensed beds. An interimA projected property rate must be established based on projected property costs and projected census. The interimprojected property rate must be effective from the first day of the month beginning after the date in which the increase in licensed beds is issued by the state department of health or the first day of the month beginning after the date when the request for a projected property rate is made to the department, whichever is later, through the end of the rate year. The facility shall file by March first an interim property cost report following the rate year. The interim cost report is used to determine the final rate for property and to establish the amount for a retroactive cost settle -up. The final rate for property is 400limited to the lesser of the interim property rate or a rate based upon actual property costs. The property rate for the subsequent rate year must be based on projected property costs and census imputed as ninety -five percent of licensed beds, rather than on property costs actually incurred during the report year; and may not be subject to retroactive cost settle -up. Subsequent property rates must be adjusted using this methodology, except imputed census must be actual census if actual census exceeds ninety-five percent of total licensed capacity, until such time as twelve months of property costs are reflected in the report year. e.For a facility with no significant capacity increase and no renovations or replacements in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, the established rate based on the report year must be applied throughout the rate year for all licensed beds. f.For a facility terminating its participation in the medical assistance program, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the department may authorize the facility to receive continued payment until medical assistance residents can be relocated to facilities participating in the medical assistance program. g.At such time as twelve months of property costs are reflected in the report year, the difference between a projected property rate established using subdivision c or d and the property rate that would otherwise be established based on historical costs must be determined. The property rate paid in each of the twelve years, beginning with the first rate year following the use of a property rate established using subdivision c or d may not exceed the property rate otherwise allowable, reduced by one -twelfth of that difference. 8.One-time adjustments. a.Adjustments to meet certification standards. (1)The department may provide for an increase in the established rate for additional costs incurred to meet certification standards. The survey conducted by the state department of health must clearly require that the facility take steps to correct deficiencies dealing with resident care.

(1)A facility may receive a one -time adjustment to historical operating costs when the facility has been found to be significantly below care -related minimum standards described in subparagraph a of paragraph 2 and when it has been determined the facility cannot meet the minimum standards through reallocation of costs and efficiency incentives. (2)The following conditions must be met before a facility can receive the adjustment: (a)The facility shall document, based on nursing hours and standardized resident days, the facility cannot provide a minimum of one and two -tenths nursing hours per standardized resident day; (b)The facility shall document all available resources, including efficiency incentives, if used to increase nursing hours, are not sufficient to meet the minimum standards; and (c)The facility shall submit a written plan describing how the facility will meet the minimum standard if the adjustment is received, including the number and type of staff to be added to the current staff and the projected cost for salary and fringe benefits for the additional staff. 402(3)The adjustment must be calculated based on the costs necessary to increase nursing hours to the minimum standards less any operating margins and incentives included when calculating the established rate. The net increase must be divided by standardized resident days and the amount calculated must be added to the rate. This rate is subject to any rate limitations that may apply. (4)If the facility fails to implement the plan to increase nursing hours to one and two-tenths hours per standardized resident day, the amount included as the adjustment must be adjusted in accordance with the methodologies set forth in subsection 5. (5)If the cost of implementing the plan exceeds the amount included as the adjustment, no retroactive settlement may be made. d.Adjustments for disaster recovery costs when evacuation of residents occurs. (1)A facility may incur certain costs when recovering from a disaster such as a flood, tornado, or fire. If evacuation of residents was necessary because of the disaster, actual recovery costs during the evacuation period, net of insurance recoveries, may be considered as deferred charges and allocated over a number of periods that benefit from the costs. (2)When a facility has evacuated residents and capitalizes recovery costs as a deferred charge, the recovery costs must be recognized as allowable costs amortized over sixty consecutive months beginning with the sixth month after the first resident is readmitted to the facility. (3)Recovery costs must be identified as startup costs and included as passthrough costs for report purposes. Recovery costs are not subject to any limitations except as provided in paragraph 4. (4)If a facility evacuates residents, the ninety percent occupancy limitation may not be applied during the recovery period or for the first six months following the month the facility readmits the first resident. (5)Insurance recoveries relating to the disaster recovery period must be reported as a reduction of recovery costs. Insurance recoveries received after the first month of the sixty-month amortization period must be included as a reduction of deferred charges not yet amortized, except that the reduction for insurance recoveries may occur only at the beginning of a rate year. 9.Under no circumstances, including an appeal or judicial decision to the effect a rate was erroneously established, may a rate adjustment be made to any rate established under this chapter, unless the cumulative impact of all adjustments not already included in the established rate equals or exceeds ten cents per day for the rate weight of one.

Limitations may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services, or audited costs, and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs, on the costs of providing services, or on the costs of specific areas of operations. The department may implement ceilings at any time, based upon the statistics available, or as required by guidelines, regulations, rules, or statutes. b.For rates for continuing service providers who have an increase in the number of clients the provider is licensed to serve in an existing service: (1) Subdivision a of subsection 11 of section 75 -04-05-09 for the period until the increase takes effect; and (2) Ninety-five percent of the projected units of service for the remaining period of the fiscal year based upon an approved plan of integration or actual occupancy, whichever is greater. The department shall review, on an ongoing basis, aggregate payments to intermediate care facilities for the intellectually disabled to determine that payments do not exceed an amount that can reasonably be estimated would have been paid for those services under Medicare payment principles. If aggregate payments to facilities exceed estimated payments under Medicare, the department may make adjustments to rates to establish the upper limitations so that aggregate payments do not exceed an amount that can be estimated would have been paid under Medicare payment principles. c.When establishing the final rates, the department may grant nonenforcement of subdivisions a and b of subsection 11 of section 75-04-05-09 when it determines the provider-implemented cost-containment measures consistent with the decrease in units, or when it determines that the provider's implementation of cost -containment measures consistent with the decrease in units would have imposed a detriment to the well -being of its clients. (1) Acceptable cost-containment measures include a decrease in actual salary and fringe benefit costs from the approved salary and fringe benefit costs for the day service or group home proportionate to the decrease in units. (2) Detriment to the well -being of clients includes a forced movement from one group home to another or obstructing the day service movement of a client in order to maintain the ninety -five percent rated occupancy requirement. Provider agencies may not be reimbursed for services, rendered to a client, which exceed the rated occupancy of any facility as established by a fire prevention authority. 532 d. Provider agencies of residential services shall offer services to each client three hundred sixty-five days per year, except for leap years in which three hundred sixty-six days must be offered. Provider agencies may not be reimbursed for those days in which services are not offered to a client. e.

Statement of costs must be reviewed taking into consideration prior years' adjustments. The provider agency must be notified by facsimile transmission or electronic mail of any adjustments based on the desk review. A provider agency may submit information, within thirty days after notification, to explain why the desk adjustment is incorrect. The department shall review the information and make appropriate adjustments . b.A final adjustment will be made for a facility that has terminated participation in the program. c. A provider agency may submit a request for reconsideration of the ratefinal statement of costs review in writing to the disability servicesdevelopmental disabilities division within fifteen calendar days of the date of the final ratestatement of costs review notification. A request for reconsideration must provide new evidence indicating why a new determination should be made or explain how the department has incorrectly interpreted the law. The department shall respond to a properly submitted request for reconsideration within ninety calendar days of receipt of the request. The department may redetermine a raterevise the final statement of costs review on its own motion. d.c.If a provider is dissatisfied with the decision resulting from the request for reconsideration, the A provider agency may appeal the decision within thirty days after the department mails the written notice of the decision resulting from theon a request for reconsideration of the final ratereview of the statement of costs .

An assessment must be completed within ninety days or at the time there are sufficient qualified responders, for a client who has been determined eligible to receive developmental disabilities services and is receiving a service that requires an assessment score to determine payment. The assessment effective date is the first date the client began receiving a service. 2. A reassessment must be completed every thirty -six months for a client aged sixteen or older or every twelve months for a client under age sixteen, or more frequently if a life -changing event occurs. 533 a. A reassessment based on a life -changing event may be requested by a client, a client-authorized representative, or an employee of a provider agency. Requests for reassessment must be made in writing to the appropriate department regional office. b. The assessment effective date is reset upon completion of a reassessment as a result of a life-changing event. History: Effective April 1, Reported allowable costs will be included in determining the interim and final rate. The method of finalizing the reimbursement rate per unit will be through the use of the retrospective ratesetting system.The cost centers where direct and indirect costs are allocated on a provider agency's statement of costs may include: 1.Retrospective ratesetting requires that an interim rate be established prior to the year in which it will be effective. Providers are required to submit a statement of budgeted costs to the department no less than annually so an interim rate may be determined. The determination of a final rate for all services begins with the reported cost of the provider's operations for that fiscal year. Once it has been determined that reported costs are allowable, reasonable, and client-related, those costs are compared to the reimbursements received through the interim rate.Administration. 2.a. Settlements will be made through a recoupment or refund to the department for an overpayment or an additional payment to the provider for an underpayment. b. Interprovider settlements between intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities and day services will be made through a recoupment or refund to the department from the day service provider to correct an overpayment; or a payout to the intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, for the day service provider, to correct an underpayment. Indirect program support costs. 3.Limitations.Provider agency shall disclose to the department direct care costs for staff that provide direct care and nursing services separately for the annual statement of costs. Costs shall only include: a.The department shall accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by providers. Statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations for needed services. Limitations may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services, or audited costs, and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs, on the costs of providing services, or on the costs of specific areas of operations. The department may implement ceilings at any time, based upon the statistics available, or as required by guidelines, regulations, rules, or statutes. Direct care staff salaries and fringe benefits; and b.Providers, to maintain reasonable rates of reimbursement, must deliver units of service at or near their rated capacity. Upon a finding by the department that an excess idle capacity exists and has existed, the cost of which is borne by the department, the provider shall be notified of the department's intention to reduce the level of state financial participation or invoke the cancellation provisions of the provider agreement. The provider, within ten days of such notification, must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that the department should not invoke its authority under this provision, or must accept the department's finding. 534 c. Providers shall not be reimbursed for services, rendered to clients, which exceed the rated occupancy of any facility as established by a fire prevention authority. d. Providers of residential services must offer services to each client three hundred sixty-five days per year, except for leap years in which three hundred sixty -six days must be offered. Costs and budget data must be reported on this basis and rates of reimbursement will be established on the same basis. Providers may not be reimbursed for those days in which services are not offered to clients. e. Providers of day services must offer services to each client eight hours per day two hundred sixty days per year less any state -recognized holidays, except for leap years in which two hundred sixty -one days must be offered.

(1) Days of services in facilities subject to the application of subdivision d must be provided for a minimum of three hundred thirty -five days per year per client. A reduction of payment to the provider in an amount equal to the rate times the number of days of service less than the minimum will be made unless the regional developmental disability program administrator determines that a failure to meet the minimum was justified. (2) For purposes of this subdivision, the fiscal year of the facility will be used, and all days before the admission, or after the discharge of the client, will be counted toward meeting the minimum. h. Salary and fringe benefit cost limits, governing the level of state financial participation, may be established by the department by calculating: (1) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions, by program size and numbers served, and programs in and out of state; (2) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions in state government; (3) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions in the community served by the provider; or (4) Data from paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, taken in combination. By using private funds, providers may establish higher salaries and benefit levels than those established by the department. i. Management fees and costs may not exceed the lesser of two percent of administrative costs or the price of comparable services, facilities, or supplies purchased elsewhere, primarily in the local market.

The cost reportstatement of costs provides for the identification of the allowable expenditures and basic services subject to reimbursementpayment by the department. When costs are incurred solely for a basic service, the costs must be assigned directly to that basic service. When costs are incurred jointly for two or more basic services, and not able to be directly assigned, the costs willmust be allocated as follows: a.1.Personnel. The total cost of all staff identified in payroll records must be listed by position title and distributed to basic services subject to the approval of staff -to-client ratios by the department. Time studies may be performed for one week at least quarterly for allocation. When no time studies exist, the applicable units must be used for allocation. When there is no definition of a unit of service, the department willmust use the unit of service for billing purposes for residential settings. b.2.Fringe benefits. The cost of fringe benefits must be allocated to basic services based on the ratio of the basic service personnel costs to total personnel costs. Personnel costs on which no fringe benefits are paid will beare excluded. c.3.Equipment. The total cost of all equipment, whether rented, leased, purchased, or depreciated, must be distributed to basic serviceservices based on usage or applicable units. d.4.Real property expensecost. The total of all property costs, whether rented, leased, purchased, or depreciated, must be allocated based on direct square footage. When multiple usage of direct use area occurs, the allocation willis first be done by square footage and then by applicable units. e.5.Travel. The total of all unassigned travel costs must be included in administrative costs. f.6.Supplies. The total of all unassigned supply costs must be included with administrative costs. g.7.Food services. The total of all food costs shouldmust be allocated based on meals served.

The total of all such costs, except insurance costs representing real property expensecosts or vehicle insurance costs applicable to vehicles used for one or more basic services, must be included as administrative costs. i. Contractual services. The total of all contractual costs must be allocated based upon applicable units or, if appropriate, included as part of the administrative costs. j.9.General clientIndirect program support costs. Total general client expenses indirect program support costs, not including personnel and fringe benefits, must be allocated to basic service categories, exclusive of production, room, and board, supported living arrangements, family support services, and extended services based on actual units of service. When determining the day supporthabilitative ratio of general clientindirect program support costs, total day supporthabilitation units will beare divided by eightthirty-two and rounded to the nearest whole number. 536k.10.Administrative costs. Total administrative expenses may be allocated to all service categories, on time studies done in compliance with subdivision a. If time studies are not available, total administrative expenses costs must be allocated to all service categories, exclusive of residential habilitation room, board, and production, based upon the ratio of the basic service cost to total cost excluding administrative and production costs. The percentage calculated for residentialhabilitation services must be based on total costs for training, room, and board for the specific residential service , including room and board, with the allocation made only to trainingdirect care costs, direct program support costs, and indirect program support costs . 2. Identification of the means of financing is to be as follows: a. Budget reports require the disclosure of all revenues currently used to finance costs and those estimated to finance future costs, inclusive of the provider's estimate of state financial participation. b. Revenues must be distributed on the appropriate budget report by program. When private contributions are used to supplement or enrich services, the sum may be distributed accordingly. When contributions are held in reserve for special purposes, it may be described by narrative. c. The disclosure of contract income and production costs is required to establish a rate of reimbursement supplemental to, and not duplicative of, these revenues and costs. d. State financial participation in the habilitative costs associated with day supports shall not include production costs. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; June 1, 1995; July 1, 2001; May 1, 2006; cost and cost limitation. 1.ProvidersProvider agencies under contract with the department to provide services to individuals with developmental disabilities mustwho provide intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities shall submit to the department, no less than annually, a statement of actual costs on the cost reportto the department by October first of each year . 2.Providers mustProvider agencies shall disclose all costs and all revenues. 3.Providers mustProvider agencies shall identify income to offset costs when applicable in order that state financial participation not supplant or duplicate other funding sources. Income must be offset up to the total of appropriate allowable costs. If actual costs are not identifiable, income must be offset up to the total of costs described in this section. If costs relating to income are reported in more than one cost category, the income must be offset in the ratio of the costs in each cost category. These sources, and the cost to be offset, must include the following: a.Fees, the cost of the service or time for which the fee was imposed excluding those fees based on cost as established by the department. b.Insurance recoveries income, costs reported in the current year to the extent of costs allowed in the prior or current year for that loss. c.Rental income, cost of space in facilities or for equipment included in the rate of reimbursementpayment. 537d.Telephone and telegraphinternet income from clients, staff, or guests, cost of the service. e.Rental assistance or subsidy when not reported as third -party income, total costs. f.Interest or investment income, interest expense. g.Medical payments, cost of medical services included in the rate of reimbursementpayment as appropriate. h.Respite care income when received for a reserved bed, room, board, and staff costs. i.Other income to the provider agency from local, state, or federal units of government may be determined by the department to be an offset to cost. 4.Payments to a provider agency by its vendor will beare considered as discounts, refunds, or rebates in determining allowable costs under the program even though these payments may be treated as \"contributions\" or \"unrestricted grants\" by the provider agency and the vendor. However, such payments may represent a true donation or grant, and as such may not be offset against costs. Examples include when: a.Payments are made by a vendor in response to building or other fundraising campaigns in which communitywide contributions are solicited. b.Payments are in addition to discounts, refunds, or rebates, which have been customarily allowed under arrangements between the provider agency and the vendor. c.The volume or value of purchases is so nominal that no relationship to the contribution can be inferred. d.The contributor is not engaged in business with the provider agency or a facility related to the provider agency. 5.If an owner or other official of a provider agency directly receives from a vendor monetary payments or goods or services for the owner's or official's own personal use as a result of the provider'sprovider agency's purchases from the vendor, the value of such payments, goods, or services constitutes a type of refund or rebate and must be applied as a reduction of the provider'sprovider agency's costs for goods or services purchased from the vendor. 6.If the purchasing function for a provider agency is performed by a central unit or organization, all discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates shouldmust be credited to the costs of the provider agency in accordance with the instructions above. These shouldmay not be treated as income of the central purchasing function or used to reduce the administrative costs of that function. Such administrative costs are, however, properly allocable to the facilities serviced by the central purchasing function. 7.Purchase discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates are reductions of the cost of whatever was purchased. They shouldmust be used to reduce the specific costs to which they apply. If possible, they shouldmust accrue to the period to which they apply. If not, they will reduce expensescosts in the period in which they are received. The reduction to expensecost for supplies or services must be used to reduce the total cost of the goods or services for all clients without regard to whether the goods or supplies are designated for all clients or a specific group. a.\"Purchase discounts\" include cash discounts, trade, and quantity discounts. \"Cash discount\" is for prepaying or paying within a certain time of receipt of invoice. \"Trade discount\" is a reduction of cost granted certain customers. \"Quantity discounts\" are reductions of price because of the size of the order. 538b.Allowances are reductions granted or accepted by the creditor for damage, delay, shortage, imperfection, or other cause, excluding discounts and refunds. c.Refunds are amounts paid back by the vendor generally in recognition of damaged shipments, overpayments, or return purchases. d.Rebates represent refunds of a part of the cost of goods or services. Rebates differ from quantity discounts in that they are based on the dollar value of purchases, not the quantity of purchases. e.\"Other cost-related income\" includes amounts generated through the sale of a previously expensed item, e.g., supplies or equipment.

History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; January 1, 1989; August 1, 1992; June 1, 1995; July 1, 1995; April 1, 1996; August 1, 1997; July 1, 2001; May 1, 2006; July 1, 2012; - Return on investment. Repealed effective April 1, 2018. Effective August 1, 1995, the annual average percentage of existing debt divided by the original asset cost shall determine the annual return on the original cost of fixed assets. 542 1. For an annual average percentage of debt to annual average assets that is between fifty -one and eighty percent, a two percent return on the original cost of fixed assets must be allowed. 2. For an annual average percentage of debt to annual average assets that is between zero and fifty percent, a three percent return on the original cost of fixed assets must be allowed. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; August 1, of reimbursementpayment for provider agency costs require that payment for services include depreciation on depreciable assets that are used to provide allowable services to clients. This includes assets that may have been fully or partially depreciated on the books of the provider agency, but are in use at the time the provider agency enters the program. The useful lives of these assets are considered not to have ended and depreciation calculated on the revised extended useful life is allowable. Likewise, a depreciation allowance is permitted on assets that are used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. Depreciation is recognized as an allocation of the cost of an asset over its estimated useful life. If any depreciated personal property asset is sold or disposed of for an amount different than its undepreciated value, the difference represents an incorrect allocation of the cost of the asset to the facility and must be included as a gain or loss on the cost reportstatement of costs. The facility shall use the sale price in computing the gain or loss on the disposition of assets. 2.Special assessments in excess of one thousand dollars paid in a lump sum must be capitalized and depreciated. Special assessments not paid in a lump sum may be expensed as billed by the taxing authority. 3.Depreciation methods: a.A provider agency shall use the straight -line method of depreciation. All accelerated methods of depreciation, including depreciation options made available for income tax purposes, such as those offered under the asset depreciation range system, may not be used. A provider agency shall apply the method and procedure for computing depreciation on a basis consistent from year to year and shall maintain detailed schedules of individual assets. If the books of account reflect depreciation different than that submitted on the cost reportstatement of costs , a provider agency shall prepare a reconciliation. b.For all assets obtained prior to August 1, 1997, a provider agency shall compute depreciation using a useful life of ten years for all items except vehicles, which must be depreciated over four years, and buildings, which must be depreciated over twenty-five years or more. For assets other than vehicles and buildings obtained after August 1, 1997, a provider agency may use the American hospital association depreciation guidelines as published by the American hospital publishing, inc., in \"Estimated Useful Lives of Depreciable Hospital Assets\", revised 2008 edition , to determine the useful life or the composite useful life of ten years. A provider may not use an option other than the useful life methodology the provider initially chooses to use without the department's prior written approval.For all assets, other than vehicles and buildings, obtained prior to April 1, 2018, a provider agency's prior depreciation schedule must be used. A provider agency shall use a useful life of ten years for all equipment not identified in the American hospital association depreciation guidelines. c.A provider agency acquiring assets as an ongoing operation shall use as a basis for determining depreciation: 543(1)The estimated remaining life, as determined by a qualified appraiser, for land improvements, buildings, and fixed equipment; and (2)(a)A composite remaining useful life for movable equipment, determined from the seller's records; or (b)The remaining useful life for movable equipment, determined from the seller's records. 4.Acquisitions are treated as follows: a.If a depreciable asset has, at the time of its acquisition, a historical cost of at least five thousand dollars, its cost must be capitalized and depreciated in accordance with subdivision b of subsection 3. A provider agency shall capitalize as part of the cost of the asset, costs incurred during the construction of an asset, such as architectural, consulting and legal fees, and interest. b.A provider agency shall capitalize major repair and maintenance costs on equipment or buildings if they exceed five thousand dollars per project and will be depreciated in accordance with subdivision b of subsection 3. 5.A provider agency shall maintain records that provide accountability for the fixedcapital assets and other assets and also provide adequate means by which depreciation can be computed and established as an allowable client -related cost. 6.The basis for depreciation is the lower of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of purchase. If the provider'sprovider agency's cash payment for a purchase is reduced by a trade -in, fair market value will consist of the sum of the book value of the trade -in plus the cash paid. 7.For depreciation and reimbursementpayment purposes, a provider agency may record and depreciate donated depreciable assets based on the asset's fair market value. If the provider'sprovider agency's records do not contain the fair market value of the donated asset, as of the date of the donation, an appraisal must be made. An appraisal made by a recognized appraisal expert will be accepted for depreciation. 8.Provision for increased costs due to the sale of a facility may not be made. 9. If a provider finances a facility pursuant to North Dakota Century Code chapter 6 -09.6, the provider, subject to the approval of the department, may elect to be reimbursed based upon the mortgage principal payments rather than depreciation. Once an election is made by the provider, it may not be changed without department approval. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; June 1, 1995; August 1, 1997; July 1, 2001; May 1, 2004; May 1, 2006; January 1, 2013; under the program, interest must be: (1)Supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required; 544(2)Identifiable in the provider'sprovider agency's accounting records; (3)Related to the reporting period in which the costs are incurred; (4)Necessary and proper for the operation, maintenance, or acquisition of the provider'sprovider agency's facilities used therein; (5)Unrelated to funds borrowed to purchase assets in excess of cost or fair market value; and (6)When borrowed for the purpose of making capital expenditures for assets that were owned by any other facility or service provider agency on or after July 18, 1984, limited to that amount of interest cost which such facility or service provider agency may have reported, for ratesetting purposes, had the asset undergone neither refinancing nor a change of ownership. b.In cases when it was necessary to issue bonds for financing, any bond premium or discount shallmust be accounted for and written off over the life of the bond issue. 2.Interest paid by the provider agency to partners, stockholders, or related organizations of the provider agency is not allowable as a cost except when interest expense is incurred subject to North Dakota Century Code chapter 6 -09.6. 3.A provider agency may combine or \"pool\" various funds in order to maximize the return on investment. If funds are pooled, proper records must be maintained to preserve the identity of each fund in order to permit the earned income to be related to its source. Income earned on gifts and grants does not reduce allowable interest expense. 4.Funded depreciation requirements are as follows: a.Funding of depreciation is the practice of setting aside cash or other liquid assets to be used for replacement of the assets depreciated or for other capital purposes. This provision is recommended as a means of conserving funds for the replacement of depreciable assets. It is expected that the funds will be invested to earn revenues. The revenues generated by this investment will not be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense provided such revenues remain in the fund. b.The deposits are, in effect, made from the cash generated by the noncash expense depreciation and do not include interest income. Deposits to the funded depreciation account are generally in an amount equal to the depreciation expense charged to costs each year. In order to qualify for all provisions of funding depreciation, the minimum deposits to the account must be fifty percent of the depreciation expensed that year. Deposits in excess of accumulated depreciation are allowable; however, the interest income generated by the \"extra\" deposits will be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense. c.Monthly or annual deposits representing depreciation must be in the funded depreciation account for six months or more to be considered as valid funding transactions. Deposits of less than six months are not eligible for the benefits of a funded depreciation account. However, if deposits invested before the six -month period remain in the account after the six-month period, the investment income for the entire period will not reduce the allowable interest expensed in that period. Total funded depreciation in excess of accumulated depreciation on client -related assets will be considered as ordinary investments and the income therefrom will be used to offset interest expense. d.Withdrawals for the acquisition of capital assets, the payment of mortgage principal on these assets and for other capital expenditures are on a first -in, first-out basis. 545e.The provider agency may not use the funds in the funded depreciation account for purposes other than the improvement, replacement, or expansion of facilities or equipment replacement or acquisition related to client services. f.Existing funded depreciation accounts must be used for all capital outlays in excess of five thousand dollars except with regard to those assets purchased exclusively with donated funds or from the operating fund, provided no amount was borrowed to complete the purchase. Should funds be borrowed, or other provisions not be met, the entire interest for the funded depreciation income account will be offset up to the entire interest expense paid by the facility for the year in question. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; June 1, 1995; July 1, 2001; January 1, 2013; 1.Costs applicable to services, facilities, and supplies furnished to a provider agency by a related organization shall not exceed the lower of the cost to the related organization or the price of comparable reasonable costs of services, facilities, or supplies purchased elsewhere primarily in the local market. Providers must . Provider agencies shall identify such related organizations and costs in the cost reportstatement of costs. An appropriate statement of cost and allocations must be submitted with the cost reportstatement of costs . For cost reportingstatement of costs purposes, management fees will beare considered administrative costs. 2.A chain organization consists of a group of two or more service providersprovider agencies which are owned, leased, or through any other device, controlled by one business entity. 3.Home offices of chain organizations vary greatly in size, number of locations, staff, mode of operations, and services furnished to their member facilities. Although the home office of a chain is normally not a provider agency in itself, it may furnish to the individual provider agency, central administration or other services such as centralized accounting, purchasing, personnel, or management services. Only the home office's actual cost of providing such services is includable in the provider'sprovider agency's allowable costs under the program. Any services provided by the home office which are included in cost as payments to an outside provider agency will be considered a duplication of costs and not be allowed. 4. If the home office makes a loan to or borrows money from one of the components of a chain organization, the interest paid is not an allowable cost and interest income is not used to offset interest expense. 5. Payments, to related organizations, by the provider agency are limited to the actual and reasonable cost of the service received or the product purchased. 6. Provider agency shall document financial transactions between the provider agency and the related organization. The terms of such transactions must be similar as those obtained by a prudent buyer negotiating at arm's length with a willing and knowledgeable seller. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985 ; April 1, 2018. paid to a related organization. 1.A provider agency may lease a facility from a related organization within the meaning of the principles of reimbursementpayment. In such a case, the rent paid to the lessor by the provider agency is not allowable as a cost , except for providers subject to chapter 75 -04-03, whose. Provider agency's rent payments shall not exceed the actual cost of mortgage payments of principal and interest. The cost of ownership of the facility would, however, be an allowable cost to the provider agency. Generally, these would be costs such as depreciation, interest on the mortgage, real estate taxes, and other property expenses attributable to the leased facility. The effect is to treat the facility as though it were owned by the provider agency. Therefore, the owner's equity in the leased assets is includable in the equity capital of the provider agency. 2.In order to be considered an allowable cost, the home office cost must be directly related to those services performed for individual providersprovider agencies and relate to client services. An appropriate share of indirect costs will also be considered. Documentation as to the time spent, the services provided, the hourly valuation of services , and the allocation method used must be available to substantiate the reasonableness of the cost. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985 ; April1 Taxes assessed against the provider agency, in accordance with the levying enactments of the several states and lower levels of government and for which the provider is liable for payment, are allowable costs.

The following taxes are not allowable as costs: a.Federal income and excess profit taxes, including any interest or penalties paid thereon. b.State or local income and excess profit taxes. c.Taxes in connection with financing, refinancing, or refunding operation, such as taxes in the issuance of bonds, property transfers, issuance or transfers of stocks, etc. Generally, these costs are either amortized over the life of the securities or depreciated over the life of the asset. They are not, however, recognized as tax expense. d.Taxes from which exemptions are available to the provider agency. e.Taxes on property which is not used in the provision of covered services. f.Taxes, including sales taxes levied against residents and collected and remitted by the provider agency. g.Self-employment (FICA) taxes applicable to persons, including individual proprietors, partners, or members of a joint venture.

A calculation of the total number of employees necessary to meet staff -to-client ratios is made on the basis of a full -time equivalent employee. Assuming that a full -time employee has fifty-two working weeks of five days each, twelve holidays, ten vacation days, and ten sick days per year, the actual number of days worked is two hundred twenty -eight per year. Providers who grant fewer paid absences must use a full -time equivalent calculation which reflects a higher number of working days. 2. Assuming a two hundred twenty -eight day work year: a. Staffing for the three hundred sixty -five day service provided by a residential service provider each year requires 1.6 full -time equivalent staff members for each shift slot to be filled at all times (two hundred twenty -eight times 1.6 equals three hundred sixty -five). b. Staffing for the two hundred sixty days of service provided by a day service provider each year requires 1.14 full -time equivalent staff members for each staff required by the ratio (two hundred twenty -eight times 1.14 equals two hundred sixty). 3. To calculate the number of duty hours in a week, eight hours per day for five days (day services) and eight hours per night for seven nights (sleep time) are subtracted from the total hours of the week for residential service providers.

Principles of eligibility. 1.The process of determining an individual's eligibility to receive intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disabilities caseprogram management services involves the recognition of several criteria and an understanding of expected outcomes as each criterion is applied. Professional judgment is applied to determine the applicability of the provision of intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disability caseprogram management services in accordance with chapter 75-05-06. 2.The following criteria must be used as the frame of reference for a team of at least three professionals in the human service center, led by the developmental disabilities program administrator or the administrator's designee, for the determination of an individual's eligibility for intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disabilities caseprogram management services. History: Effective July 1, 1991; amended effective January 1, 1997; July 1, 2012; April for service eligibility - Children age three an d above. 1.An individual is eligible for intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disabilities caseprogram management services if the individual has a diagnosis of mental retardationintellectual disability which is severe enough to constitute a developmental disability. a.A diagnosis of the condition of mental retardationintellectual disability must be made by an appropriately licensed professional using diagnostic criteria accepted by the American psychiatric association. b.Determination of whether the manifestation of the condition is severe enough to constitute a developmental disability must be done in accordance with the definition of developmental disability in North Dakota Century Code section 25 -01.2-01. 2.An individual is eligible for intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disabilities caseprogram management services if the individual has a condition of mental retardationintellectual disability , diagnosed by an appropriately licensed professional using diagnostic criteria accepted by the American psychiatric association, which is not severe enough to constitute a developmental disability, and the individual must be able to benefit from 554treatment and services purchased through the developmental disability division on behalf of an individual who meets the criteria of subsection 1. 3.An individual is eligible for intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disabilities caseprogram management services if the individual has a condition, other than mental illness, severe enough to constitute a developmental disability, which results in impairment of general intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior similar to that of an individual with the condition of mental retardationintellectual disability , and the individual must be able to benefit from services and intervention techniques which are so closely related to those applied to an individual with the condition of mental retardationintellectual disability that provision is appropriate. Determination of eligibility for individuals described in this subsection requires the application of professional judgment in a two -step process: a.The team must first determine whether the condition is severe enough to constitute a developmental disability. North Dakota Century Code section 25 -01.2-01 must be applied in order to determine if a developmental disability is present. The presence of a developmental disability does not establish eligibility for services through the intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disabilities caseprogram management services system, but does require the team to consider all assessment data and apply professional judgment in the second step. b.The team must then determine whether services can be provided to an individual determined to have a condition, other than mental illness, severe enough to constitute a developmental disability. The team must have a thorough knowledge of the condition and service needs of the applicant, as well as a thorough knowledge of services that would be appropriate through the developmental disabilities system. When considering if intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disabilities caseprogram management is appropriate, the team must consider factors, including: (1)Whether the individual would meet criteria appropriately used to determine the need for services in an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities. (2)Whether appropriate services are available in the existing developmental disabilities service delivery system. (3)Whether a service, which uses intervention techniques designed to apply to an individual with intellectual disabilities, delivered by staff trained specifically in the field of intellectual disabilities, would benefit the individual. (4)Whether a service, designed for an individual with the condition of mental retardationintellectual disability , could be furnished to the individual without any significant detriment to the individual or others receiving the service. c.If the team concludes, through the application of professional judgment, that an individual's needs can be met through specific services purchased by the department for individuals who meet the criteria of subsection 1, aan intellectual disabilities-developmentaldisabilities - developmental disabilities caseprogram manager may be assigned. Services may be provided, subject to the limits of legislative appropriation. New services need not be developed on behalf of the individual. History: Effective January 1, 1997; amended effective July 1, 2012; April 1, service eligibility - Children birth through age two. 1.Service eligibility for children from birth through age two is based on distinct and separate criteria designed to enable preventive services to be delivered.
