The document provides information on how to advise allergic individuals according to their specific allergy history. This document provides guidance regarding f ive COVID-19 vaccines : mRNA vaccines (Cominarty (Pfizer-BioNTech), Spikevax (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna)), adenoviral vector vaccines (COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, Vaxzevria (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca)), and protein sub unit vaccine (Nuvaxovid (Novavax)). The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology statement on severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines is available for reference. This document relates only to questions about pre-existing allergic conditions that vaccinators might encounter during consent. Specific COVID-19 vaccine administration advice is covered in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. This document is not a guide on how to treat anaphylaxis. All registered vaccinators have completed anaphylaxis training. Q1. How common is vaccine related anaphylaxis? A. Vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is extremely rare. However, any vaccine can cause anaphylaxis. The estimated rate for all vaccines, pre COVID, was 1.3 per million vaccine doses. The risk of reaction is related to the components of the vaccine and the specific vulnerabilities of the individual vaccine recipient. Many so- called \"anaphylactic reactions\" to vaccinations are not allergic in origin. Immediate symptoms after vaccination are more likely to be caused by vasovagal episodes or anxiety. Q2. Is the risk of anaphylaxis much greater after COVID -19 vaccines? A.The incidence of COVID -19 vaccine associated anaphylaxis continues to be monitored worldwide. Initially reported at 11.1/million doses, COVID -19 vaccine related incidence rates are expected to revert to nearer the rate for other vaccines, as the number of vaccines administered increase s and surveillance data is less influenced by heightened reporting (ascertainment bias). In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority has reported 12 cases of anaphylaxis after mRNA vaccines and less than five cases of anaphylaxis after adenoviral vector vaccines out of a total of 7.3 million vaccines administered1. It is also worth noting that the criteria applied retrospectively to define cases of vaccine related anaphylaxis, are also prone to overestimation2. 1 Safety Update: COVID-19 Vaccines - Overview of National Reporting Experience - 9 December 2021 2 Hourihane J O'B, Byrne A et al. Ascertainment Bias in Anaphylaxis Safety Data of COVID-19 Vaccines. J Allergy Clin Q3. Can we predic t who is going t o have an anaphylactic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine? A. No. A definite trigger in every case has not yet been defined. The curren t contraindication s are: A history of anaphylaxis (syst emic allergic reaction) after th e COVID-19 vaccin e or any of its constituents (including PEG for mRNA vaccines and polysorbate 80 for adeno viral vector vaccines or the protein sub unit vaccine , Nuvaxovid) A history of anaphylaxis after another COVID-19 vaccine of the same platform e.g., mRNA or adeno viral vector Q4. What should I look for when asking a person about their report of previous anaphylaxis? A. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life -threatening systemic allergic reaction characterised by rapid onset (usually within 15 minutes but up to 2 hours, rarely longer). If previous anaphylaxis is reported, vaccinators should check for the following typical features: Two or more of the following after exposure to a likely allergen ( e.g., food, insect sting, medication): oSkin rash/hives, oDifficulty breathing (wheeze, stridor, heavy chest / tightness) oReduced blood pressure (BP) or suggestive symptoms ( e.g., dizziness, visual loss) oPersistent severe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Reduced blood pressure (BP) after exposure to a known allergen ( e.g., food, insect sting, medication) Acute onset of skin and or mucosal tissue involvement, airway compromise, reduced BP or associated symptoms, persistent severe GI symptoms, without an identifiable cause (unexplained or idiopathic anaphylaxis). Useful Link: Differentiating vasovagal episodes from anaphylaxis Q5. Many people report food and medication allergy. Are there large numbers of people who should not receive a COVID -19 vaccine? A. No. There are very few peopl e who cannot rec eive one of the current vaccin es du e to pre-existing aller gies or histor y of anaphylaxis . Wh ile it is important that avoidable allergic reactions to vaccine d o not happen, it is also important that vaccination is not avoided by persons because of unfounded concerns. Most people with a genuine/confirmed history of anaphylaxis can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Q6. What are the main potential allergens in COVID -19 vaccines? A. Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) and Spikevax (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna) both contain polyethylene glycol/high molecular weight macrogol (PEG), which is a known allergen found in some medicines and also in household goods and cosmetics. Anaphylaxis to PEG is extremely rare but would contraindicate receipt of these two vaccines. 3 Vaxzevria (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) and COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen and Nuvaxovid (Novavax) contain polysorbate-80, a high molecular weight polysaccharide also reported to cause allergic reactions including, rarely, anaphylaxis. Spikevax (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna) contains a buffer called TROMETAMOL, which has been implicated in one report of contrast medium anaphylaxis relating to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) used in MRI radiological studies. Patients with documented anaphylaxis to TROMETAMOL or to GBCAs should not receive Spikevax formerly COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna) (see Q16 for those aged 5-11 years ). Q7. How would I identify a person with a potentially unrecognised PEG allergy? A. PEG allergy should be suspected in people reporting anaphylaxis after: drinking oral laxative bowel preparations for colonoscopy procedures and laxatives such as Movicol, Mirilax, Dulcolax steroid joint injections (methylprednisolone acetate - Depo-Medrone) depot progesterone contraceptive (Depo-Provera) Teedex. People presenting with a history of anaphylaxis to multiple classes of drugs may also have an undiagnosed PEG allergy unless it can be established by history that they already tolerate PEG (see Q9). Persons that report anaphylaxis to PEG containing compounds should have vaccination deferred until alternative vaccine available. Consider discussing with an allergist/immunol ogist. For those aged 12-17 years of age with a history suggestive of PEG allergy, advice from an allergist/immunologist should be sought before vaccinating as adeno viral vector vaccines are not licensed as an alternative in this population. Cominarty (Pfizer-BioNTech) 10 micrograms is the only vaccine authorised for use in children aged 5-11 years. Q8. How would I identify a person with a potentially unrecognised polysorbate 80 allergy? A. Polysorbate allergy is very rare. Polysorbate 80 which is present in COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, Vaxzevria (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) and Nuvaxovid (Novavax) , is also a constituent of many vaccines, e.g., diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis containing vaccines, Hepatitis B, HPV, pneumococcal conjugate and zoster vaccines. At least 70% of injectable biological agents and monoclonal antibody treatments contain polysorbates, usually polysorbate 80. Individuals who have tolerated injections that contain polysorbate 80 (such as vaccines as listed above) are likely to tolerate COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, Vaxzevria (formerly COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca) and Nuvaxovid (Novavax). If an individual gives a history of an anaphylactic reaction to a biological agent or monoclonal antibody (Rituximab, Infliximab) they may be allergic to polysorbate 80 (se e Q12 & Q13 regarding influenza and HPV vaccines). Persons that report anaphylaxis to polysorbate 80 should not be administered polysorbate 4 80 containing COV ID-19 vaccines (Vaxzevria (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) , COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, and Nuvaxovid (Novavax)) unless it can be established by history that they already tolerate polysorbate 80 (see Q9). Consider discussing with allergist/immunologist . Q9. How do I establish whether a person, with a history of unexplained anaphylaxis, is not allergic to one of the COVID -19 vaccine components? A. Most cases of anaphylaxis can be explained by a detailed allergy focused history. A history will usually reveal if the anaphylaxis was related to food, medication, bee stings etc. In a case of unidentifiabl e medicatio n relate d anaphylaxis , try to estab lish if the individu al is tolerant to PEG and polysorbate 80 by inquiring about other medication they have taken. High molecular weight (MW) macrogol (PEG) is present in some laxatives e.g., Movicol and Dulcolax. Numerous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) contain both (PEG) and polysorbate 80, Nexium and Vimovo. Polysorbate 80 is also a constituent of many common vaccines (see Q8). This approach can also be taken for any individual presenting with a possible polysorbate 80 or PEG anaphylaxis. The summary of product characteristics of any medication can also be checked at https://www.medicines.ie/ . Idiopathic anaphylaxis is a term used when full immunological work up has not identified a cause. These people should be carrying epinephrine ( adrenaline ) autoinjectors and wearing alert bracelets, for example. This diagnosis is not a contraindication to receiving a COVID-1 9 vaccination. Q10. Who should be considered for referral to the Allergy/Immunology team? A. Consider referral of patients with a convincing history of anaphylaxis (see Q 4) associated with: a.A previous COVID -19 vaccine b.PEG containing medication unless review of medications indicates tolerance of PEG c.Polysorbate 80 containing medication or vaccine unless review of medications indicates tolerance of polysorbate 80. d.Multiple medications in different classes unless review o f medications indicates tolerance of PEG and polysorbate 80. Q11. If a person has had a mild allergic reaction to an unknown medication, is it safe to proceed with COVID -19 vaccination? A. Yes. Mild allergic reaction to drugs is not a contraindication itse lf to COVID -19 vaccination. Q12. Can a person who has had anaphylaxis to an influenza vaccine receive a COVID -19 vaccine? A. Yes, unless the influenza vaccine that caused the reaction contained polysorbate 80 e.g., Fluad, which is being used in 2021/22 for the first time in Ireland and may have been administered in other countries e.g., UK, US and Australia . These individuals should only be offered Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) or Spikevax (formerly COVID-19 vaccine Moderna) (see Q8 & Q9). 5 Q13. Can a person with a history of anaphylaxis to HPV vaccine receive a COVID -19 vaccine? A. Yes. However, any individual with a convincing history of HPV vaccine related anaphylaxis (see Q4) should only be offered Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) or Spikevax (formerly COVID-19 vaccine Moderna) because HPV vaccine contains polysorbate 80 (see also Q8 & Q9). Remember, most people who report a reaction to the HPV vaccine have had non-allergic reactions such as redness at the site or feeling faint. These adverse events are not a contraindication to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Q14. Some people report reactions to NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (e.g., Brufen), an d occasionally also to diclofenac (e.g., Voltarol and Difene); can these people recei ve a COVID-19 vaccine? A. Yes. Peop le allergic to NSAIDS are not at greater risk from COVID-19 vaccines. Q15. Can people with multiple antibiotic allergies receive a COVID -19 vaccine? A. Yes. A person with a convincing history of penicillin allergy or allergies to other antibiotics can be vaccinated. Q16. Can a person with a history of anaphylaxis t o intravenous contrast dye rece ive a COVID-19 vaccine? A. Yes. They should receive the vaccine, unless it was documented that it was a gadolinium- based contrast agent (GBCA, see Q6) during MRI scan. In that particular case, they should not be given Spikevax (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna). See Q25 for those aged 5-11 years. Q17. Can a person with a history of reactions or contact allergy with patch testing positive to nickel, perfumes, and cosmetics receive a COVID -19 vaccine? A. Yes. Q18. Can people with a history of anaphylaxis to a specific foodstuff receive a COVID -19 vaccine? A. Yes. Peop le reportin g immediat e (IgE) food allergy , includin g a history of anaphylaxis, delayed (non-IgE) mediated food allergy and food intolerance can all have COVID-1 9 vaccines. Q19. Can people with venom allergy receive a COVID-19 vaccine? A. Yes. People who have experienced large local reactions, but not anaphylaxis (as defined above) to bee or wasp stings do not need to be observed6 for longer than 15 minutes. Q20. Can people with chronic urticaria/angioedema receive a COVID -19 vaccine ? A. Yes. However, peopl e with th is condition may experienc e mild urticar ia after receiving the vaccin e as their rash es are often triggered by stre ssors. This should be considered before declaring them allergic to the vaccine. People with chronic urticaria should take their normally prescribed antihistamine on the day of vaccination. Q21. Can people with mastocytosis receive a COVID -19 vaccine? A. Yes. They should take their regular medication on the day of the vaccine. They should be observed for 30 minutes post vaccination. Q22. Can an individual on asthma medication receive a COVID -19 vaccine? A. Yes. Underlying asthma and/ or hay fever are not contraindications . Q23. Can a person who has had an allergic reaction to the first dose of a COVID -19 vaccine receive a second dose? A. Yes, most people who have had a n immediate \"reaction\" to the first dose of vaccine, have had non -allergic reactions such as redness at the site, feeling faint etc. These are not allergic reactions. Anyone who has had mild allergic signs such as localised urticaria should receive their second dose as normal. Persons who have had a confirmed anaphylaxis (see Q 4) to a first dose of a COVID -19 vaccine should not receive a second dose but should be referred to an allergist/immunologist for evaluation. Q24. What other conditions are not contraindications or precautions to COVID -19 vaccines ? The following conditions are not a contraindication or a precaution to COVID -19 vaccines . Persons with any of the se conditions should be vaccinated as scheduled. Non -anaphylactic food allergy Family history of allergy, including anaphylaxis Previous local reaction to any vaccine Hereditary angioedema Contact dermatitis to PEG containing cosmetic product Chronic urticaria7 The ARIA-EAACI statement on severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines is available at the following link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/all.14726 Q25. Are there any special allergic considerations for those aged 5-11 years? Contributing IAAI authors Aideen Byrne, Consultant Paediatric Allergist, CHI Niall Conlon, Consultant Immunologist, SJH David Edgar, Consultant Immunologist, SJH Jonathan O'B Hourihane, Consultant Paediatric Allergist, CHI Mary Keogan, Consultant Immunologist, Beaumont Hospital Khairin Khalib, Consultant Immunologist, Beaumont Hospital Car\u00edosa Consultant Immunologist, Galway University Hospitals Contributing NIAC authors Kevin Connolly, Special Advisor, NIAC Brenda Corcoran, Special Advisor, NIAC A. There are two COVID-19 vaccines authorised for use in children under 11 years of age. - Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) 10 micrograms for children aged 5-11 years - 50 micrograms for children aged 6-11 years. Atopy (eczema, asthma, food allergy) is very common in this age group. None of these conditions are a contraindication to receiving Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) 10 micrograms or The formulation of Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) 10 micrograms differs from the formulation for those aged 12 years and older and include s trometamol. The formulation of Spikevax 50 micrograms is the same as that for Spikevax 100 micrograms (recommended by NIAC for those aged 30 years and older) and contains trometamol. Children in this age group who have a history of anaphylaxis to gadolinium based MRI contrast media should have specialist allergy assessment, as there is no alternative COVID-19 vaccine for those aged 5-11 years.
