Immune deficiencies are health conditions that decrease the strength of this response. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to create a defense against a specific type of germ. Researchers want to compare immune system responses to COVID-19 vaccines in people with and without immune deficiencies. Objective: To learn about how people with immune deficiencies respond to COVID-19 vaccines. Eligibility: People age 12 and older with an immune deficiency who plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Healthy volunteers are also needed. Design: Participants will be screened with a medical record review. Participants will give a blood sample before they get their first COVID-19 vaccine. Blood will be drawn from an arm vein using a needle. Blood can be drawn at the NIH, at a local doctor s office, or at a laboratory. It may also be drawn through a fingerstick at home. Participants will also complete 2 online surveys about their health and COVID-19 history. Participants will give a second blood sample 2 to 4 weeks after they get the vaccine. They will complete 2 surveys about changes in their health and side effects from the vaccine. If participants get a second (booster) vaccine, they will repeat the blood draw and surveys 3 to 4 weeks later. Participants may give 3 optional blood samples in the 24 months after their last vaccine. They may also give saliva samples every 2 weeks while they are in the study. Participation will last from 1 month to 2 years after the participant s last vaccine. |Condition or disease| the Immune Response to COVID-19 Vaccination and Outcomes in Individuals With and Without Immune Deficiencies and Dysregulations| |Actual Study Start Date :||April 20, 2021| |Estimated Primary Date :||June particpants | Control participants will be healthy volunteers, and may include unaffected relatives of immunodeficient/dysregulated participants | Patients with immunodeficiencies and immune dysregulations | Affected patients with evidence of a primary or secondary immune deficiency or dysregulation - Change in S and RBD immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer from baseline depending on vaccine manufacturer and platform [ Time Frame: 14-21 days or 21-28 days, depending on vaccine manufacturer and platform ]To characterize the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination among immunodeficient and immune dysregulated individuals compared to healthy volunteers - Incidence of vaccine-associated AEadverse events experienced by immunodeficient individuals compared to healthy volunteers [ Time Frame: Throughout study ]To characterize the COVID-19 vaccine-associated adverse events among immunodeficient and immune dysregulated individuals compared to healthy volunteers Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
