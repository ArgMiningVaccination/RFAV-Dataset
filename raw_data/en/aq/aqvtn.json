Its founder was a German doctor called Samuel Hahnemann. Homeopathy is based on the principle of like curing like; meaning that a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms in a sick person. In fact Hahnemann was not the first to discover this. Hippocrates, the 'father of medicine', stated that cure takes place through the way of opposites or the way of similars, more than 2000 years ago. The word homeopathy comes from the Greek 'homeo' meaning similar and 'pathos' meaning suffering. A good example of the law of similars can be seen in the treatment of insomnia. Conventional medicine will use a drug which will induce sleep, which may be given in large and regular doses. Treatment by similars, as Hahneman called it, would be to give a minute dose of a substance, such as coffee, which in large quantities would cause sleeplessness in a healthy person. This will result in natural sleep. Another simple example is with the remedy which is made from onion. Onion can cause stinging, watery eyes and a running nose. In homeopathy the remedy Allium Cepa (the latin for onion) is used successfully in cases of hayfever with these symptoms. Homeopathy is a holistic system of medicine. A homeopath sees the mind and body functioning as an integrated whole. Disease is seen not as an isolated event but as an expression of disharmony within the whole person. Homeopathic treatment is aimed at restoring this harmony by stimulating the body's own healing ability. Just as every individual is unique, so too is each individual's experience of ill health. A homeopath will work to understand what that individual experience is, and to find the remedy which most accurately matches it. A homeopath enquiring about a particular symptom might ask exactly what it feels like and what makes it worse or better, about its history, and about any treatments or medications taken. Homeopathic medicines are safe and free from side effects. They are specially prepared in homeopathic pharmacies, using minute quantities, from plant, mineral and animal sources. Homeopathic remedies have been tested on healthy human volunteers in what Samuel Hahnemann called 'provings'. Provings are still conducted today as more substances are introduced into homeopathy. Essences Sheelagh also uses flower, crystal and animal essences alongside homeopathy, which complement the homeopathic remedies. Essences can be used to support any mental and emotional problems such as anxiety, grief, depression or any \"stuckness\" in a very gentle but often profound way. Rescue Remedy from the Bach range of flower essences is very well-known and is fantastic for use in any crisis situation - from grief, shock to sitting your driving test! Sheelagh uses the Bach range but also many others such as Alaskan, Bush and Indigo crystal range, often used with children, and chooses and makes up an individual combination for each client. A homeopathic session consists of an in-depth chat about your symptoms. As homeopathy is a holistic therapy the homeopath will ask about all aspects of your health in order to determine the best remedies for you. There are many homeopathic remedies for individual symptoms, but to determine the suitable remedy for you the homeopath reviews the, often copious, case-notes taken later, which can take a couple of hours depending on the complexity of the individual's symptoms. First appointments take around an hour and a half. Follow-ups, if required, take around 45 minutes with Lucinda (via Skype or FaceTime) and 60 minutes (at Calmblue or Skype) with Sheelagh. Sessions for acute illnesses or injuries take place on the telephone. For chronic problems or health issues that have been around for a long time, follow-up sessions every 4-6 weeks may be recommended. Payment accepted by bank tranfer or PayPal. If you need to cancel a booking, please let us know 48 hours before your session to avoid cancellation charges. Lucinda charges 50% of the fee, at her discretion, for missed appointments or sessions cancelled with less than 24 hours notice.
