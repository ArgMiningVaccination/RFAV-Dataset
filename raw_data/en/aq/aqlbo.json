If you knew a natural way to treat nausea, wouldn't you want to try that before turning to over-the-counter medicines? After all, there's nothing like a natural way of healing that benefits your overall health. Peppermint - One of the most natural treatments for nausea and its as simple as having a peppermint.

Some people find relief within minutes. Aromatherapy - Another way to help ease nausea is by aromatherapy. Certain scents, such as peppermint, ginger, and lemon, can help ease nausea better than others. This is a great natural remedy to try when you feel sick because all you have to do is take a whiff. You can use essential oils for this by placing a drop on a tissue and inhaling the scent. Massage Therapy - Aside from ingesting foods and inhaling particular scents, you can also try getting a massage when you feel nauseous. Plenty of people have found massage therapy helpful when they feel sick. Plus, there's nothing like a relaxing and de-stressing massage to change how you feel!
