[13](#_edn13) Triphala and Ayurveda: Traditional Uses Triphala is recommended and used more often than any other formulation made with [Ayurvedic herbs](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/plants/ayurvedic-herbs/). In Ayurvedic terms, it is said to have a beneficial effect on all three doshas. Triphala is most well-known for its gentle effects on the bowels, improving peristalsis and cleansing toxic build up of wastes; but Ayurveda also views triphala as a nourishing supplement with an ability to rejuvenate healthy tissues, allowing one to age gracefully. - The Caraka Samhita, one of the main texts of Ayurveda, describes haritaki as the remover of disease and promotes haritaki and amalaki for [rasayana](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/learning-ayurveda/glossary-of-ayurvedic-terms/), or rejuvenation of the body. [14,15,16](#_edn14) - For those with sluggish digestion and build up of [ama](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/learning-ayurveda/glossary-of-ayurvedic-terms/), triphala is said to kindle the digestive fire and help improve [agni](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/learning-ayurveda/glossary-of-ayurvedic-terms/), allowing one to get the most nutrition from one's dietary intake. [17](#_edn17) - Culturally, haritaki is given the highest respect for restoring health. The Medicine Buddha is often depicted with a haritaki fruit held in his hand\u2014it is said to give the blessing of long life, and along with amalaki and bibhitaki, will nurture you like a mother. [18](#_edn18) How to Take Triphala Determining the Best Time to Take Triphala As you incorporate triphala into your daily health routines, you may wonder exactly when to take triphala churna, and can triphala be taken daily? Here's our take, from an Ayurvedic perspective. When to Take Triphala In general, triphala should be taken on an empty stomach about 8-10 hours before the colon is naturally most active. For most people, this means taking triphala at bedtime, first thing in the morning, or both. We encourage you to experiment and find what works best for you. If you're wondering exactly how to take triphala churna at night or in the morning, these are a few common methods. Triphala Tea The most traditional way to receive the health benefits of triphala is by ingesting it as a tea. This method allows you to taste the herb fully, which is considered by Ayurveda to be an important part of the healing process. Taste activates the digestive process and sends signals to the body as to what to expect, initiating its own inner healing mechanisms. To take triphala as a tea, make a decoction by adding 1/2 teaspoon of [triphala powder](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/triphala-powder/) to a cup of hot water. Stir and allow the tea to cool, then drink. Alternatively, you can allow the triphala to soak overnight and strain the powder in the morning. If you're wondering, \"Will the strained liquid still have the same benefits?\", the answer is yes! Triphala contains five of the six tastes recognized in Ayurveda (sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, and astringent), only missing the salty taste. Perhaps because the Western diet is so lacking in bitter and astringent, these are the two most prominent tastes for most people, which can make drinking the tea somewhat unpleasant initially. Triphala is balancing for all doshas, but you may be asking, \"Will hot triphala tea aggravate my pitta dosha?\" Not necessarily\u2014while heat can be pitta-aggravating, triphala's cooling ingredients (especially amalaki) will help balance that heating action. You can also allow the tea to cool to warm or room temperature before drinking it. Triphala Tablets [Triphala tablets](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/shop/herbs/triphala/triphala-tablets-11/?product_sizes=278) provide a more convenient method of taking herbs, especially for those who travel a lot, have a shortage of time, or do not like the taste of triphala tea. Many Ayurvedic practitioners prefer to give their patients triphala tablets instead of triphala capsules as there is still a subtle tasting of the herbs that occurs, sending signals to the digestive system to get to work. Triphala liquid extract [Triphala liquid extract](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/triphala-liquid-extract-10/) provides an alternative method of taking triphala. It's convenient, easy to assimilate, and has a long shelf life. This extract is made from the same certified organic fruits used in making the herbal tablets and is extracted using non-GMO, gluten-free grain alcohol. A typical dose is a dropper full (about 30 drops) taken in 1-2 ounces of water or juice, one to three times daily, or as directed by your healthcare practitioner. Other Methods In addition to these methods, there are several other [ways to use triphala](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/blog-the-banyan-insight/details/the-many-uses-of-triphala/) to support your health. It can be used to create a triphala face mask, a hair wash, and even an eye wash. If you're curious to try a triphala eye wash, make sure the powder is strained well and we recommend seeking the guidance of a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner. Is Triphala Safe? Triphala Side Effects Triphala is a natural detoxifying formula. As part of the cleansing process, it is not uncommon for toxins to be released from the deeper tissues and enter the bloodstream on their way to being ushered out of the body. When many toxins are released at once, it can prompt what may be considered triphala side effects. For some people, this can manifest as a headache, a rash, or nausea, in addition to gas, upset stomach, and diarrhea. Since triphala supports healthy elimination, it is not uncommon to experience looser bowel movements than usual. All of these reactions can be byproducts of cleansing. If your cleansing experience becomes too intense, you can stop taking triphala until the symptoms subside or simply reduce the amount you are ingesting. If the symptoms persist, it is best to discontinue use and consult a practitioner. Contraindications Triphala is not intended to support chronic constipation, which can be a sign of an underlying condition and may require practitioner support. Contraindications can include diarrhea, dysentery, and if you are pregnant or nursing. There are no known drug interactions with the herbs that make up triphala. [19,20](#_edn19) Some studies do report findings that would advise caution in people taking blood-thinning medicines, [21,22](#_edn21) as triphala may affect platelet function. From an Ayurvedic perspective, if your stools are dry and hard, consider using [haritaki](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/haritaki-tablets-10/) in place of triphala. Modern Research and Scientific Studies on Triphala As the knowledge of Ayurveda has gained momentum in the west in recent years, it has led to a significant amount of scientific study on the properties of triphala and other traditional Ayurvedic herbs and blends.

Harvesting Banyan's Triphala and Certified FairWild Triphala Tablets The three fruits that combine to make triphala grow on trees that are relatively abundant in many parts of India. They can be found growing naturally in the wild and are also cultivated on privately owned farms. Harvesting and processing the fruits in triphala is labor-intensive. It includes the picking of the fruits by highly skilled tree climbers, then washing, drying, and removing the pits. Banyan strongly believes in maintaining socially responsible relationships with our sourcing partners. We are committed to [Fair Trade](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/banyan-herbs/fairly-traded/) principles and proud to offer [certified FairWild](https://help.banyanbotanicals.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059151972-What-is-the-FairWild-project-) Triphala tablets.
