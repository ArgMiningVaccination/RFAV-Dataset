For more information, visit [stonybrook.edu/immunization](/commcms/studentaffairs/shs/forms_new/) The COVID vaccine and booster is now widely available at local pharmacies such as Rite Aid, CVS, Walgreens, and Duane Reade. For a listing of vaccination sites, click [HERE](https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/). Submit your vaccination record through the Wolfie Health Portal using this [link](https://stonybrook.medicatconnect.com/). For instructions on how to upload your vaccination record, please review [this tutorial](/commcms/studentaffairs/shs/submit-immzs.php). In very special circumstances you may request a limited exemption from the COVID vaccination requirement for medical or religious reasons. Exemption requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. For more information about exemption requests, please visit the [Immunizations website](/commcms/studentaffairs/shs/forms_new/immunization_exemption_requests.php). If you are not vaccinated, you are permitted to enroll in online courses only (no in-person classes) and are not permitted to access any in-person campus services or facilities. No remote learning options are available for students who do not want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine outside of any courses already offered remotely that have available seats. Students may not request a change in course modality to avoid receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, and faculty may not accommodate such requests received. Please review the [academic calendar](/commcms/registrar/calendars/academic_calendars.php)so that you are aware of tuition liability and add/drop deadlines. If dropping your in-person classes results in moving from full-time to part-time status, please contact [Financial Aid](/commcms/finaid/)if you have any questions about your aid. You were identified as being covered by one or more policies or mandates, including [SUNY's COVID-19 Vaccination Policy](https://www.suny.edu/sunypp/documents.cfm?doc_id=900), the [NYS Department of Health Regulation](https://www.health.ny.gov/facilities/public_health_and_health_planning_council/meetings/2021-08-26/docs/revised_proposed_regulation.pdf), or federal [Executive Order (EO) 14042 - Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/14/2021-19924/ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors). Stony Brook University, Stony Brook University Hospital, and the Long Island State Veterans Home (LISVH) are all State-run facilities and are federal contractors. As such, we must comply with all SUNY, State, and Federal regulations. All religious accommodation requests are individually reviewed and consider the applicant's specific circumstances. This review looks at whether the applicant has a sincerely held religious belief and whether granting the accommodation would cause undue hardship. Requests are granted if both elements are met. The decision cannot be appealed; the determination is considered final. No, this would be considered an appeal and would not be accepted. All decisions were made by university officials who were tasked to review applications, consistent with applicable policies and mandates. The Office of Equity and Access then issued those decisions to applicants. We must balance your request for a religious accommodation against the University's responsibility to provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment for our faculty, staff, patients, and all members of the campus community. No. While federal courts have acknowledged that employees may request religious exemptions, they have not directed the manner in which employers determine the outcome of any given request. They have also held that exemption requests may be granted only in very limited circumstances, where reasonable accommodation is available. In most cases, no. However, if you are changing majors from a West Campus program to an HSC program or taking a class in the HSC for the first time, you must submit a supplemental review and be approved for a religious exemption before declaring an HSC major/minor or enrolling in an HSC course. Approved exemption requests are subject to change based upon developing case law, emergency regulations, or other additional relevant information. If you were granted an exemption while you were a West Campus employee you would need to submit a supplemental review in the event you wished to work at the HSC, Stony Brook University Hospital, or the LISVH exemption. If you are currently residing outside of the United States and do not have access to any COVID vaccine in your home country, or cannot complete your vaccine series before you arrive in the United States, you are required to obtain vaccination within 48 hours after arrival. You will be permitted to check into campus housing if you will be living on campus and may attend in-person classes. COVID Vaccine Booster [ ] We strongly recommend that you obtain a COVID booster, once you become eligible, and upload it to the [Wolfie Health Portal](https://stonybrook.medicatconnect.com/). You're eligible when: - It's been at least 5 months after completing your primary series (two doses) of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. - It's been at least 2 months after your Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine. If you were vaccinated outside of the United States, [other COVID vaccine and booster recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/people-vaccinated-abroad.html)apply to you.

Appointments may be required, so check with your pharmacy for details. Upon receiving your COVID vaccine booster, please upload this additional vaccination documentation to the [Wolfie Health Portal.](http://stonybrook.medicatconnect.com) You are eligible to receive your COVID vaccine booster once you complete a 5-day isolation period and your symptoms have improved, including being fever-free for 24 hours. Please review this [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html?s_cid=10482:can%20you%20get%20the%20covid%20vaccine%20if%20you%20had%20covid:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21). The CDC has updated [its guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html)regarding vaccination following receipt of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma therapy, and there is no longer any waiting period or delay in obtaining vaccination. Yes. The revaccination in the United States is now your primary series. Based on the last dose of the 2-part series, that will determine your eligibility date to receive the COVID vaccine booster. Per [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html), you are eligible (check the link for specific age requirements and vaccine options) to receive a COVID vaccine booster as follows: - If you received a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna at least 6 months ago - If you received one dose of J&J or other single dose vaccine at least 2 months ago If you were vaccinated outside of the United States, [other COVID vaccine and booster recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/people-vaccinated-abroad.html)apply to you.

Visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/people-vaccinated-abroad.html)for more information. As long as you are compliant with the other health requirements such as MMR and meningitis, we can provide you with a temporary grace period to become fully vaccinated. It is expected that once you become fully vaccinated, you will upload confirmation of your second dose of the vaccine to the [Wolfie Health Portal](http://stonybrook.medicatconnect.com)within 48 hours. You will then wait the time eligible per the CDC guidelines to receive the booster dose and upload proof of vaccination to the portal within 48 hours of receiving that vaccine dose. If you fail to complete either of these two steps within 15 days of becoming eligible, you will not be permitted to continue enrollment in in-person classes and will not be permitted to utilize any in-person campus services until you submit proof. If you live on campus, you will be required to move out of the residence halls until you submit proof of becoming fully vaccinated or receiving the booster. If you are deregistered from in-person classes or are required to move out of the residence halls for not submitting proof of vaccination, you will be held financially responsible for tuition, fees, room, and board. Please check the New York State site for appointment options: [https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/](https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/)Student Health Services is also offering the vaccination.

Quarantine and Isolation Protocols [ ] You must establish a plan to isolate for minimum of five days off-campus if you test positive for COVID (with or without symptoms). After this period, if you have no symptoms, you can return to campus and in-person classes. [Please see this link for more information on what to do if you test positive](/commcms/studentaffairs/shs/services/COVID_Testing/index.php). If you test positive for COVID, with or without symptoms, you will need to isolate for a minimum of 5 days and cannot attend in-person classes or activities. You can continue to participate in online classes as long as you feel well enough to do so. Leaving campus to isolate at home is strongly encouraged, so make plans ahead of time to isolate at home, including transportation as you cannot take public transportation while sick with COVID. If you cannot leave campus, you will isolate yourself in your own room at your residence hall or apartment following these guidelines: - Stay in your residence room for your isolation period. You should only leave your room to use the bathroom, pick up food, dispose of trash, or for a fire alarm or medical emergency. - If you have a roommate and/or suitemates, inform them of your status and plans for isolation. Include them when you report your close contacts to the Campus Health Response Team. - Everyone should wear a mask at all times when in the same room with you.
