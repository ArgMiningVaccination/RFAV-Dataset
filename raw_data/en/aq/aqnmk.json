For the majority of the poPulation,_entry to jobs is geared to educational qualifica-tions, with the more prestigious. secure, and -better -paid jobs being the rewards of thosewith higher levels of certification. Pupils in both secondary and tertiary sectors of educationare aware of the 'rules of the game': find out what the teachers/examiners want and putthat down. Interest and commitment to topics can be an irritating hindrance when thereis a long syllabus to coverll he notion that universities encourage indeperident andcreative thinking is a myth that needs to be cheeked against reality. Do students seethings that way? If itis true, that the apex of the education system is heavily committedto demands that Students sponge up predigested opinions, then it would not be surprisingto find the.same,rules operating down through the secondary schools. If the examinations-in higher-education and national qualifications are indeed saturated with response-basedlearning, this is, of Course, no indictment of examinations as such, only of examinationstaught foi-antimarked in certain ways. Neither is it appropriate to draw the impossible,'absurd, and inhuman inference that teachers should try to eliMihate all_, rewarding andpunishing from their interactions with pupils. What it does mean is that we need to checkconstantly that children are understanding what they are doing and saying, and that theyare nol learning primarilY to please us or to gain,other rewarda..Furthermore,_We need tocreate teaching situations, where this cante true Without cost to either pupils or teachers.Neither are we suggesting that response-based learnirip(is undesirable in all situations forall learning problems. As chapter 2 reveals, Piaget is given a lead role in the Production ofour play. At preient his is the best critical descriptioncof-theaequence (and content) ofthe intellectual deVelOpment of children. His story not only,describes what children can do,it also attemptSto specify what internal structures (operation::) a child must have in orderto achieve what he manages to do. It is, howeVer, a model of competence: what childrencan come to manage if they have interacted sufficiently with an environment upon whichthey have been able to act and generate the conflicts whose resolution constitutesintellectual: evelopment Properly nurtured and cared for, the child is en active, __motivattd aCquiretotknciwiedge-and-needt no-induCeinents to facilitate basic intellectual dc:velopment. Not all learning, hoWever, involves the acquisition of those fundarnental.r.orieept% and principles and.their application in problem new:under7standing. the learning of the lexicon and grammar of a foreign language-May involve theunderstanding of no.or, only a-few new. ideas and principles, but simply the assimilationof large numbers of units, structures; and rules for their combination and use. Appro-priateiy organised rote learning:in conjunction with practice in production and knowledgeof results, is likely to lead' to 'Much faster and efficient learning-than 'guided discovery'given that the learner wants to learn the language. The same will be true of the detail ofmuch of what is to be learned in schooli although again, wanting to learn canbe madeindependent of the reinforcement contingencies. HOwever, incentives applied to these .learning tasks are unlikely to lead recitsls of uncomprehended materials. Observing-.teachers and others actually enjoying some constructive use of their knowledge maylikewise serve as an incentive without an undue corruptioof understandiiii .Albeit the Value-judgement remains. Where the attainment of rewards and theavoidance of punishments become the focus of attention, much important learning islikely to become meaningless. Wanting to learn'appears to be an inbuilt characteristic ofour species, and it is silly to waste this attribtite.Unfortunately, thegeneral rriove towards the use of 'guided discovery' in recentyears probably took plaCe too quickly. 'Piaget' has come to ba hated name to many ofa generation of young teachers forced to-learn his stages by rote, while 'guided discovery'must now be synonymous:with!playing abouf_for.rnany teachers and parents. Weprepared.neither teachers nor parents for the change.Along with the inevitable misunder-standings consequent upon the general human tendency to assimilate, simplify anddistort the complex, there was a rush into a polarisation of extreme protagonists andantagonists.The recut acceleration in the enthusiasm for eSpousing a Piagetian tochild-development is bOrne of complex motives. As.the assessment-of government-sponsored reports in chapter 1 shows, the Hadow report of the 1920's was writing'.aboutthe advantages of _harnessing the natural curiosity of children. And have also beComeaware of the transience of much theoretical and factual knowledge in'science and tech- .nolog. While We might agree aboUt the necessity of teaching some of the basic skills tobe imparted to children and we would note that Much knowledge is durable, we havealso come to realise the value of educating children to, beIgeneral problem-solvers ratherthan mines of obSolete informatiorr: riexibility and the ability to assimilate rapid changeshave become essential ingredients in the make-up of technologists in an era of rapidchange. And there is a tempting similarity between the characteristics of 'the generalproblem-solver' and those of Piagetian man that does not obtain-with other theories ofchild development. If this concern is justified, then we need to find. out how to traingeneral problem-solvers, and this involves an understanding of questioning skills and .The second value-judgement about the characteristics of thklearner was expressed'as a preference fOr making one kind of error rather than another. We can decide that achild is not capable of learningwhen fie is; we can decide he isCapable when he is not. In .practice we have to assign priorities to our teaching: endeavours; we cannot spendlimited time and resources on one child at the cost of neglecting others. We may alsO ____ _deem it cruel and wrong to try topush individual Children beyOndfheir limits. HoWeVer,--if we pretend that the present standards obtained by-school-leavers reflect the potential of an ag :. group, we May be making a very serious error; that it is an error shared with a.number of eminent educators and psychologists does not reduce the seriousness.Both Jensen (1968k and Eysenck (1971) have interpreted the differential 10scores of Negro and white and working and middle ClaSS Children- in' terms of a heavydifferential, genetic endowment of intellectual functioning.Both have gone on to offercomments about the education of these groups. While the general premiss about thegenetic basis of individual differences in intellectual capacity is one which many who:,have worked.in the area and studied the literature may well feel obl4iii to share,comments about the possibility of a measure of intellectual inferiority in Negro and work-ing class children are arrived at via some strange reasoning. If we ignore the Methodologicalinadequacies of the studies reportecand the illegitimacy of the generalisations to the generalpopulation, we can still argue that theirfailure to specify the relationships between IQscores and the concept of 'intelligence', their assumptions about the relationships betweenIQ scores and'What can be.learned, and thei: blindness to the relevance of social psychology,sociology and a dash of history to children's development, has led them into a prematureand unjustified 'provisional' sympathy with the hypothesis inferio;:ity. While it iseasyto agree with the tenor of Eysenck's prediction that 'we will not succeed in changinghuman nature by refusing to face facts' (1971, pt 140) we must alsonremember that ourpresent beliefs rmy be ill- founded: Eysenck's writing is particularly pernicious because itisreadablei clear and has an air of scientific detachment and an apparent willingnets toconcede the proVisional nature of the conclusions. However, the inability to shift perspec-tive, the distortion of evidence and the occasional wild and dogmatic inaccuracy severallysuggest an authoritarian rather than an authoritative-approath to-the problems discussed.Unable pro tem to accept such a view of working class children, it is upon theircondition that we haVe tccused attention. They are the losers in the, eduCational system ona wide variety of indices of achieveMent Bernstein (1961, 1971) has developed 'a thesisattempting to explain part of the reason why working class children fail at school, andaccumulated evidence is consistent with his pronouncements about differences in languageuse It is difficult to see how,,we could disagree with the proposition that an adequatemastery of the representational function of language use and its units and structures-is anecessary condition of educational success and the evidence is that working clasSchildren are relatively deficient in this skill (see Robinson, 1972). The gambler's rule.>is to stay with a winning number, and there seemed to be no good reason to desert13ernstein's theoretical framework, and so we retained it.In chapter 1, we collate and compare the comments of various government-sponsored reports in order to set the work in its historical and contemporary socialcontext. We note the overt commitment to.an enthusiasM for extending and encouraging,,,,,the curiosity of children, but record the disparitybetween the sanguinity of the.tone of '- reports onprimary schools and the melancholy of those about the secondary sector. Weare puzzled by this discontinutiy. HOw can Plowden's cheerful zealot become Morton-,Williams' inert-misery?-Parenthetically, it is_worAh_mentioning that recent reports havecome to rely on sensibly collected evidence from all parties concerned rather than uponthe uncorroborated opinions of 'experts'.To set the work in the context of psychological research, we review, in chapter.2,ideas and evidence about both curiosity and questions and the link between them. Whatarouses curiosity and how dOes curiosity relate to learning? How can quktions be used tofacilitate learning? Towards the end of the first half-of-the-chapter we are -forced to. adrnitthe incompleteness of the picture, but put forward a weak attempt at completion. In the xii 04,,-,-second part of chapter 2.we.attempt to articulate the cognitive developmental andrcVnforcernent principle aPproaches to children's learning and to 'it curiosity, boredom,-i-r,c questions..intO the synthesis. We applY'the analysisHn Conjunction with Bernstein's .-ideas,.to the problems of wor,king and Middle class children and set out our expectationsabout differences that might obtain, in empirical investigations. We Wished.td aheck.andelaborate certain fundamental claims about determinants 'of curiosity and aboUtrelationships betWeen curiosity, questioning and learning. We made these checks insecondary .sthools, with mainly working class council 'eState catchment areas.. In chapter 3,the analysis linking perceived value, ielevance and surprisingness, via interest, to theamount of questiOning Suggests that pOpils! reports,,about topics are reliable and validindicators of their feelings and are. also useful predictors of their subsequent learningabout the topics. The Newsom report plays the recurrent themeof the importance of -.'relevance'. and 'value'; Duffy's work proVides empirical support. for the underlying :premisses. What is dOne to.ensure that secondary school pupils do see that what theyare doing is relevant and valuable? If whafthey arenot-managing-tO-learm has no likely. . \\ relevance or value, it should be scrapped. If it has, then.this, \\relevance and value needs 4obe communicated to and accepted by the Pupils? Time-constiming.this may be, butperhaps more attention to pupils' views and a dialogue of per uasion might have cut the'heavy early leaving rate of thelower working class. With the raising of theschool leavingage, the problem is exacerbated rather than reduced for both te*hers and pupils. Ourimplicitsuggestion'that if you want to know whether topics are interesting to pupils yOU:.should ask them may not be.profound, 'but it is unheeded. It is common to hear around.universities that students ought to.be interested and that it is.not Part of the teacher's jobto inspire some enthusiaim. Even if students should be enthusiastic,\\he observation thatthey are .not means that it isfutile (and irresponsible) to carry on regardless until they: can be persuaded that what is being taught is relevant, valuable or intsting. And why ,.should students or children be interested? It seems to be no more their duty to becomeenthusiastic than it is the responsibility of teachers to encourage the enthusiasm. Perhapswe should ask ourselves whether we fail to sell our subjects; because we ,dOnot see therelevanceand.value of what we.'are teaching and cannot justify what we are\\ Oing? Arewe bored, anxious'and.frightened as well as our pupils?FavOurablyimpressed by the ease with which results of Berlyne and hid colleagues.could be duplicated andlitxtendet we look in chapter.4 at a number of Problern\\s outside.the constraints of traditional classroom. experimentation. in the first section Wefook atboth sociological and social psychological associates of the incidence. and Comploikty ofyounger', Children's questions. the date enableus to construct a picture consistent with theideas mentioneciin the latter half of 'chapter 3 and at the same time permit amore precise \\ specification of the answering behaviours of others likely to be conducive to the develop-ment of questioning skills and the .aocumula.tion of knowledge.

The brief reports of conversations with working class teenagers are included toprovide a thurnbnail sketch of their views and .states of mind. The final section offers someevidence about the changes in types and-focus of questions with age and ability, with apostscript shoWing thafil a tradition is establish'ed-bru-skirig-questibns-about-sexual----7--- behaviour, then there is no evidence to supportfears that teenagers will treat such a situationas anything more than an bpPortunity to find-out some facts of which they are ignorant.Chapter 5 stands the problem of curiosity onits head. Chapter 2 showed that the .links between curiosity and questions cannot be so tight as to make it sensible to see eitheras implying the other. Boredom is in a happier State. We felt safe in suggesting that theexistence of boredbm does entail the absence of both curiosity and questioning. If we wishto locate the uncurious, we can do so in terms of boredom. We exploited the-generousprovision' of the data from the Young School Leavers report of Morton-Williams and Finchboth 0 locate the bored and to examine the antecedents andcontequences of boredom.The offspring of unskilled and semi-skilled workers are shown to be heavilY over repreisented among those bored by more than thirty :per.:cent of the-subjects they were studfingat school. Additional analyses enable us to construct a picture of a self-perPetUating cycleof boredom and low academic performance;While chapter 5 yields a Clear piCture of social class differences in reported boredom,chapter 6 does not yield a similar result for question's. Reasons for this are discussed.In chapter 7, the findings of social class differences in the effit:iency with whichindividual questions are posed obtained With seven to ten year old children are notrepeated with thirteen year Olds. Neither does the use of sequences of questions in adiagnostic task provide better than week support for the thesis that there are social classdifferences in these skills. Although the investigations were bedevilled by more_than asprinkling of cheating, this was not the main problem. We might have concluded that thereare no important differencei in the queitions latent in the heads of middle and workingclass adolescents. We preferred to conclude that our failure to find differences was relatedto the earlier sorting-out processes of the educational system along social class linAs, defects,in our techniques, and the general willingness of pupils to do what is asked of their: We arenot happy with this defensive retreat. It smacks of that very stubbornesSs to face factscondenined in the quotations of Eysenck. In chapter 10 we discuss these issues more fully.These failures to find important social class differences in the work reported inchapters 6 and 7 could have been pursued, but this pursuit would have required themounting of large-scale surveys to be performed outside schools in our immediate areaand the development of techniqUes for obtaining estimates of genuine questions.. The first --.was beyond our administrative capacities, the second beyond the limits of our intellects;we just could not think of satisfactory viable techniques and neither could those weconsulted.We chose rather to eXplore the relationships between curiotity, questioning andlearning within the working class as we have already indicated in our brief descriptionsof the content of chapters 3 and 4. In the Iasi section of chapter 7 we look at the use ofquestions in problem7solving and suggeit that a little training would greatly facilitate boththe exploitation of questions for the analysis of problems-and for problem-solving skillsin general. The initial performance of adolescents in the use of diagnostic interrogationstrategies seemed-unnecessarily-inadequate.In chapter 8 Creed looks at factors associated with theielection of persons to..whoM questions can be posed. Who would know the answers to questions and who-mightbe asked? The analysis shows that some teachers are more likely to be approached thanotheri and that it is possible to point to attributes relevant to this approach:.Finally, in chapter 9, we PosetwO basic problems. Does the posing of questions infact facilitate learning? Will. the teacher's questions encouragelearning as much as thepupilrfuivn queitioni? As Prosser pursUes his Poirot-like cOurse, wecorne that xiv Auniversal generalisations aboutothe between quistiOns and learning are unlikelyto be Valid.

We haveexamined what five different committees,and one survey have had to say about children's ,interest and curiosity in relation to their formal education, both Primary and Secondary.By comparing the reporti over time, it may be possible to ascertain the extent to whichthe recommendations of past reports have been acted Upon.The reports all make frequent mention of 'interest' and 'curiosity', although the-words are not specially defined, being used in their everyday senseand assumed to beuncleritoOd.The reports deai primarily with the power which interest and curiosity-haveto motivate people-to_learn. The feports.see satisfaction of interest and ciiiosityasthe&Of intrinsic reward which-thelearner' can achieve. They see the most effective learningas .heing that which is motivated by intrintic-rather than. extrinsic rewards. The reports alsodeal with interest and curiosity as goals of education. They-speak of the arousal of newinterests and the stimulation of existing ones as being very important functionrof educe-tion. It is important to emphasise that only these speCific aspects of the reports will be- ------OisCussed in the following pages. There are many Other aspects.:of education which areclosely linked with the use of children's interest and curiosity in their formal 'education,:such as training of teachers, pupil-Staff ratio, type of schools, ete. These are all coniideredin the reports th -mselves but will not be discussed here. 1.2,Primary EducationWe will consider two major reports on Primary School Education. Their terms of referenceare siMilar.but not identical. The studies were separated in time by a period of thirty fiveyears. The report of the Consultative Committee on the Primary SchOol was submitted in1981. The Committee was under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry. Hadow. Its terms ofreference were 'To inquire and report as to the courses of study suitable for children(otherthan children in.Infants'i Departments) up to the age of eleven in'Elementary Schools,with special reference to the needs of children in rural areas. The Report 'Children andTheir_Primary-SchoolsA-Report of the Central Advisory Council for Edudation(England)' was submitted in 1966. The Cominitiee was under the Chairmanship of LadyPlowdpn. Its terms ofreference were 'To consider primary education in all its aspects andthe transition to secondary school'.The terms of reference of the two reports are not so very different, althoogh thoseof the earlier report specifically exclude infant school children. However, the social andeducational milieus in which the twcf reports were submitted were different. Educationally,the aims of the primary schools before the 1931 report had to be different from those of r---,`the primary schoOIS of the 1960's: It must be Nmembered that when the Hadow repOrtwas written, most children did not receive a secoi:darY education. It has to be assumedthat what they were not exposed to in primary schoOl, they might never be exposed to.The report was written in the hopes and expectation that this situation would soon beremedied, and it wasIt is encouraging to compare the two because of the evident progress whichwas made.in the primary schools during the thirty fiVesyear interval which separated them.Both reports stresthe importancedf Using children's interest and curiosity in education.What the two committees had to say on the subject is not that different. However, one getsthe impression that when Hadow-madethe recommendations about child - centred learning,such recommendations were relatively revOlutiOnary in nature, whereas the PlowdenComMittee found that many of Hadow's recommendations were now accepted practices.The Plowden Report seems to be recommending changes which go further but in the samedirection. They say, in fact, 'We conclude that the iriedow emphasis on the individual wasright though we would'wish to take it fUrther.. Whatever. form of. organisation' is adopted,teachers will have to adapt their rnethods to individuals within a doss or school' (Plowden460). They add that, 'The gloomy forebodings of the decline of knoWledge whichfollow progressive methods have been discredited. Our review: is a report of progress and aspur to'more' (Plowden 461). ,`What then did the in '1931? They found that 'Hitherto the,general tendency has been to take for granted the existence of certain traditional 'subjects'and present these to the.pupils as lessons to be mastered' (Hadow x)iiii) and observed teaching by subjects.-does notalways correspond with the child's unsystematisedbut eager interest in the people and things of a world still new to him' (Hadow 101). Theysuggested that:..primary education would gain graatly in realism and power ofinspira- ..tion if an attempt were moregenerallY made-'to think of the curriculum less in terms ofdepartments of knowledge to be taught, and-More in terms of activities to be fostered andinterests to be broadened! (Hadow xxii-Xxiii) and that '. ...what is needed, therefore, is anew orientation of school instruction which shall bring it into closer correlation with thenatural movement of children's minds' (Hadow 101).Generally, one gets the impression that the HadoW Committee found schools whichwere rigidly set in their ways, schools which aimed to teach children certain subjects, schoolswhose prime concern was that their pupiii ill mastered certain skills and learned certainfacts..,In such schools learning was viewed as a more passive occupation than it is in mostp Imary schocils today. The Hadow Committee set out to change that, and judging by thefindidgs of the Plowderi Report, their hopes were realised. .PloWden Committee found that 'Despite overcrowding and large clasSes, manypo -war priry schools did, much to enlarge children's experience and involve them moreadtiv ly in the leing OroCess_the main themes of the 1931 report' (Plowdeni190). Infact, 'or a brief tim 'activity' and child-centred education became dangerously Fashionableand mis nderstandings o the part of the camp followers theiprogress made bYthe pioneers! (Plowden 190. owever, 'The mistinderstandings were as Widespread inthe schools as might have been Rposed by reading the press, and certainly did riot outweighthe gains which were specially note l in the English su_hjectslowderti9a191). Althoughthe Plowden Committee found that.pro .ess had been made in the direction recommendedby the. Hadow Committee, they did not fee hat the progress had gone far enough. Theysaid that 'Instruction in many primary schools ntinues curiosityin effec-tiveucation: In the Hadow Report one finds such statements as:'A child never works so well as when he is interested. It is accordingly most,important that the-teacher should take into account the children's ownnatural interests (Hadow 47-48)....it must remain importan to emphaSise the principle that no good can--coMe'froM teaching children things that have no immediate value for themhowever highly their potential or prOsPeCtive value may be estimated'(Hadow 92).------.0ther witnesses were equally yemphatic as to the 'curiosity of children ofthis age (7-11) it- s a 'ruling principle'' (Hadow 51).In the Plowden Report one finds such statements as'The intense interest shown by young children in the world about them,their powers of concentration: on whatever is occupying their attention,or serving their immediate pUrposes are apparent toboth teachers andparents. Skills of reading and writing or the techniques used in art andcraft can'best be taught when the need for them is evidentto thechildren' (Plowden 195).'Children's interest varies in length according to per'sdnality, age andcircumstances, and it is folly either to interrupt it when it is intense orto. flog it When it has decline' (Plowden 197).Both reports express views as to what the role of a good primary school should beThe Hadow Committee said 'A good schoOl, in short, is not a place of compulsory\"instruction, but a community of old and young, engaged in learning by co-operativeexperiment' (Hadow xvii). The Plowden Committee said, 'In any case, one of the main /educaiibnal tasks of the primary school is to build on and strengthen children's intrinsicinterest in learn ing'and lead them to learn for themselves rather than from fear of dip.approval or desire for praise' (Plowden 196). Thus, they bOth said that a goOd school ismarked by Children playing an active in' their education. As'the Plowden Report saidIfinding;outs.has proved to be better for children than :being told\" (Ploviiden 460):The viewsof the two committees on the aims of primary education.vvere ratherdifferent. This difference reflects the differences in British society, technology and theWorld at large in 1966 as compared with 'i931. The HadoWReport says 'It -(primarycineducation) should arouse in the pupil a keen interest in the:things of the mind and ingeneral culture, fix bertain,habits, and de'velop a reasonable social or team sPiriti (Hadow71)1 The Plowden Committee felt that they could not state specific aims of primarytusedUcation. However, they thought that it mast be of such a nature as to eriabie children tocope with the world when they were jadul'a the Committee telt that the only trulypredictablethli4Aout the world was that it would continue to be in a state of rapidchange. 'Therefore, theywill need above all to be adaptable and capable of adjusting to.Qtheir.changingenvifonment_: .They Will need throughout their adult life to be capableof being taught.and of learning, the riew:skills called kw by the changing economic scene'(Plowden 185). Thus, they wanted schools to help children to learn how to learn, and toass learn to' cope with change. This is a Markedly less static view than that expreised in the-Hadoiv Report. BUtwe may also note thatthe reasons look-to be concerned with-theeconomic 'needs' of society.rather than to educate the child as a human being.In spite of the differences in theims advocated bythe two Committees,_the_advice----as to what the schools should do in a general sense to achieve the, aims is remarkably similar. The Hadow Report says again and again thar... the currieulum is to be thoughtof ireterms,of activity and experience rather than of knowledge to be acquired and factsto be stored' (Harlow 93), and that, 'Thilundamental-idea-ofstarting,from a centre ofinterest and exploring in turn the different avenues which diverge from it is invoked, afterintellectual activity which is 11,0t merely formal or imitative' andat .'While the indispensable foundations are thor- \"ighly mastered, the work of the school.should be related to the experience and interest of the children' (Hadow xxiv). The PlowdenReport says that -':-..facts are best retained when-they are used and understoodi-when----:-right attitudes to-learning are created, when children learn to learn' (Plowden 195) and that,'Another effective way of integrating the curriculum is to relate itthrough the use of theenvironment to the boundless curiosity which children have 'about the world about them',(Plowden 198) and, 'If for example, children are alloped choice in what they do the choicemust be genuine and the alternatives interesting and worth doing. Boredom is a deadlyenemy' (Plowtlen 268). They warn of dangers and pitfalls: 'Any practice which predetermines the pattern rind imposes it upon all is to be condemned', (PlOwden 198) and,'Children can also learn to be passive from a teacher who allows them little rive inmanaging their own affairs and in learning. A teacher whO relies orilion instruction, whoforestalls children'S questions or who answers them too quickly, instealcOf asking thefurther questions which will set, children on the way to their own solution, will disinclinechildren to learn' (Plowden 196). :The two reports differ slightly in the specific tactics they recommend. This seemsto be the resultnatural progress due to trial and error. The Hadow Committee recom-.mended certain tactics; they were tried out to some extent although they were probablymisinterpreted frequently. The Plowden Committee was able to see how these recdmmenda- . tions had worked in practice and how alternative schemes had worked, so it would indeedbe surprising if they had not made some different tactical recommendatiOns. TheHadowCommittee recommended, the use to a large extent (but not exclusively and less is thechildren grit older) of the 'project method' of teaching. Thi!; takes the form'of raisinga succession of problems interesting to the pupils and leadingtheM to reach, in the solutionof these problems, the knowledge of principles' which the teachers wishes them-to learn'(Hadow 102). In its broader use 'Some\"centre of interest is selected and for awhile thechilVfen's studies alongmany lines converge upon it or radiate out from if (Hadow-103).the Committee said that 'Judiciously applied, and based upon more direct and intrinsickinds of teachings it may be expected to impart a meaning and a motive to school work,and to, afford the teacher a meahs of following the natural deirelopment of his pupils'interest? (Hadow 106). The project method did seem to have potential as a teachingmethod, but unfortunately it Is no always lived up to this in praCtice.The Plowden; Report said of it that 'At its best the project method leads to the useof books of reference, to individual work and to active participation ihlearning. Urifortunately, it is no guarantee of this and the appearance of text books of projects,. which.achieved at one time considerable popularity, is proof of how completely a good idea canbe misunderstood' (Plowden 1981. It advocateda variation of the project method knownas 'the centre of interest' method. In this method there are many centres of interest around.--:---whichlndividuals,-groups;-orthe class Wait.- This does not seem to differ greatly from the'centre of interest' method discussed in the Hadow Report However, the Plowden CoM-mittee seemed slightly more willing than the Hadow. COmmittee for the children rather than .the teacher to choose the centres of interest and the methods of pursuing the interests. ThdPlowden Committee advoc.ated use ofthe environment as a way of integrating the curricUlum.7 4.They spoke of the.biscovery method' about which they 'The Serise.of personaldiScovery influences the intensity of a. child's experience, the vividneis of his memory,and the probability of effective transfer of learning...At the same time it is true that:trivial ideas:andinefficlent methodsmay.be 'discovered': Furthermaore,time does notalloW children to.find their way by discovery to all that they havtO learn. In thismatter, as in all education, the teait'ler is responsible for encouraging children .. -enquiries which. lead to discovery and for asking leading questio.ns' (Plowden 201).The similarity oVe6i!'in the attitudes of the two committeeiis perhaps bestsummed up by a comparison of the two following statement: .is-generally recognised todaythat children can play a far more active,part in!their education than is possible under a predorninance of class .teathing.and that they differ greatly in theirpoWert and rate of learning.It is widely held that children should be allowed as far as possible toproceed at their own pace' (HadoW -152). .'We recommend a combiriation of individual, work andwelcorriethe trend towards indivithial learning' (Plowden294)The chief difference.is that the Hadow CoMmittee was saying that.they.agreed with widely.held opiniOns and thought theie opinions should be put into practice, whereas thePlowden ComMittee was saying that. they agreed with the current trend in praCticlialid---H---'thought it should be judiciously extended. This surely would seem to indicate thatprogress has:been made. :1.3 Seccihdary Education iWe.will now consider 'three reports on Secondary Eduiation which were written over athirtyseven year span. The three reports have different terms of reference, but all are:concerned with the education of at least some children between the age-of eleven and thetime they lea-veichool..The Report of the COnsultative Committee on The Education ofthe AdolesCent was submitted in 1926.,The Committee was under the\"chairmanship ofSir Henry HadoW. It considered the post-primary education of.those children who did notgo to the what were then Secondary schools. Atthat time such children were eduCatedalmost exclusively in elementary schools until-the time that, they left school at the age of\u00b0.foixteen: The Report of The COnsultatiVeCommittee on Secondary Education with C'Special Reference fo _Grammar Schools and Technical High Schools was submitted in1938.

The Report 'Half-Qur Future', A Report of the Central...Advisory.Councii for. Education (England) was submitted.in 1963: The Committee wasunder the chairmanshipof J.H.,1\\lewsom. It considered the education of.pupils betweenthe ages of thirteen and sixteen who were-of average or less than average academic ability:This meant that the report dealt only with Secondary Modern and Comprehensive Schools.Keeping,..in mind these great differences in time/milieu and terms of reference, let usexamine and compare what the three reportszhad to say about curiosity and interest andtheuse-whiCtitbn-be made of them to increase the effectiveness of Secondary EducatiOnoAt the outset we can say that alizthe reports stressed the need to engage the pupils'interest if the pupils were to make the best use of their educational. opportunities. We findunequivocal statements to this effectIn all the repOtts:'Moreover, with transitiodfrorn childhood to adolescence, a boy or girl is .. often conscious.of new powers and interests, If education is to act asa .'stimulusif it is to be lelt to be nOt.merely the continuence.of a routine,but a thing significant and inspiring -,-., it mist appeal to those interests andcultivate those powers'. (Hadow 75).. . ,,.'Sound teaching, it must based upon the pupil's interests;'...'.(Hadow 1,07). .'It is recognised today that he learns best .holearns.with interest and with,Purpose, or to put it in another way, he learns best who sees meaning andsignifiCafice inwhat he learns'. (Spens 78). arain theirjobs so boySand girls work best when theV are interested in their work andsee its purpose' (Spens 143). ...'We suggest that for a syllabus to be effectiVe it must succeedat every siege'in stimulating the interest and imagination of the pupils' (Spens 2451.''We consider that the group.of irnpulses broadly Recommendation 51). '''Only find.out what interests his pupils, and'he mustbegin, though not end, with that' (Newsom 153).. .'At the;bottom end of the scale it is aiatter of finding a very few thingsin which the pupils Show interest and can make progress and working Out- aWardsifrom them' (Newso,m 124). :. ..'Pupils atk-\"What's it all to 'do me'.'? Unless theyare sitisfied with theanswer, their interest sags'. (Newsom 111).It will be noticed that in thetw;;Iiesii.eportsitwas felt necessary to makeeXPlicit the premise that pupils learn.more efficiently if interested in what they.re learning. This idea is now so widelyaccepted as to be commonplace. The Newsomreport seems to bb dealing more with tactics than with policy. It seems to accept as giventhat it is vital to first get the pupils' interest. It then poses a problem 'How can we'engagethe pupils' interest?' and offers some suggestions as to the solutiOn of the problem. Thesuggestions centre around the concepts of relevance and participation. It expresses thiswhen it says 'We believe that these four mords practical, realistic, vocational, chOice:-provide keys which can be used to let eVen the least aolc boys and girls enter into an, s-educational experience which is genuinely sedondary' (NewsoM 114). The Committeeoperationally defined these words. By 'practicer they meant subjects in which the Pupil'swere doing something rather than sitting-eta desk. They included such subjects as ert,'',music, physical education, wood and metal work, rural studies, housecraft, and needleWork.-These can easily be seen to answer the requireMent for participation, and they felt that forless able pupils such sUbjeciS were also more relevant to their life outside of school. By'realistic', they meant teaching the more academic subjects in such a way_ that hallemeaning for less able adolescent pupils. This might mean relating mathematics to householdbudgeting or calculating taxes. It might,mean using specific community Problems as aspring-board for the study of !civics'. This answers the call for relevance and encourages /partactive participation on the pa of the pupils. 'Vocational' was inciuded becaUse most of thechildren thatihey studied would be leaving school as soon as they could, and it was fettthat well before that time they began thinking ahead to the time when they would be working and earning money. Many of the girls were already thi(ifking ahead to the, Whenthey would be married and keeping a house. EduCation wharfs seen by the pupils to be- O .of somee in the future.Will seem relevant to them.

':This, is fairly specific on ways of engaiiiaj the pupils' interest. It ;s not sovery different from views expressed in the 1926 Hadow report on children who fovo;ildprobably be leaving school at an early age. We find in the Hadow report suchstaterranta as:.'....the curriculum for older children habottoo frequently been divorcedfrom real life, and that many pUPils, in ionsequence, lose interestand .merely mark time in their last years,,gt Schbol .; .'.(Hadow 101), ','It was generaily observed that children during their last years at school: took the greatest interestin thoSe subjectswhich were most (Hadoiry fOrms must fill a larbe place ine ctirrictiltim.

However,it must be remembered that it dealt with onlY those pupils attending grammar schools andteChnicalhigiischools, and it is not surprising that it stressed the needo engage-thepupils' interest inintellectual probleins in a strictly intellectual way. In it we find suchstatements as: u'lf1 study (the Bible).provid ' a valuable intellectual discipline and quickensthe interest of many. young minds' (Spens 200);4. ..there are few pupils of normal intelligence whose imagination is notstirred, who_se!nterest is not awakened, whose powers are not engagedwhen theare brought, under wisely chosen conditions and by competentteaching, into contact with any of the great cultural traditions' (Spens157-158).However, the:,Spens,Report did say that puipils' interest would be greater for morerelevant aspects of subjects. For example, it sugy ted that 'Recent (as opposed to distantpast) Political and econorr is history affords in c sequencethe best introduction to aninterest in politics' (Spens xxiv), and it suggest vocational courses when it spoke ofthe gain from work which the pupa himsel eCognises as possessing value for the next _stage of his life, since.such work serves to hold an `to stimulate his interest, and ;5 likelyto reactfavourably on all hiS'work' (Spens xxv).Both the 1926 and the 1931 studies expresSed the worry that the schools theystudied did nor always take sufficient care to arouse the pupils' interest through ensuringthat theAcurriculum Was relevant. Thus; we find such statements as:'It appears from the replies that, where it was true, that the older pupils in\u00b0Elementary SchooIS had loSt interest in their work during the last years atschool, this result had often been due not only to inadequate'stering andthe absenee of proper equipment, but FASO to the fact that the instructiongiven appeared to the pupils to have little or no bearing:On the problem oftheir daily environment'. (Hadow 118):'The chargethat the school curriculum is out ottouch with theinterests of practibal life is a charge wejear ill- founded...:' (Spens163).The Spens.dommittee also expressed worries that iiieVivayin which subjects weretaught might teiiii'tO suppress interest rather than awaken it They felt, for example, thatthe studof set boPks intl. iterature, or the grammar in compositioncould inhibit the bupils' appreciatio'n for literature and their ability .for self-expression.....T e NeWsom 'Report expiessed the tvorry that 'their Children' were too frequently.A .charaerised by boredom in and out of schobl and work.

Vs .P .r.This is especially true if one considers only the.1926 and 1963 reports which are aboutmore similar sorts.of pupils although the 1926 report includes a wider range in terms ofboth age and academic ability than does the 1963 report. The qUeition is, of course, whydo these ttOgs still need to be said?...I t was partly to find nut WiCy these things All need to be said and how existingsecondary education and the propereel extra year of compulsory secondary eduCation canbe made meaningful to more pupils .teat the School's Council requested a study to. be doneof Secondary Education. In 1968, the\"Government Social Survey submitted a reportprepared for the Schools Council entitled 'Young School Leavers'. This reoort was pre-pared when it was thought that the school leaving age would be raised in 1970, and theproblems and opportunities caused by this proposed raising of the minimum school .leaving age -were considered in the report in addition to many other problems which werealso considered in the Newsom report. The important difference between the two rePoitsis that the Schools Council Enquiry obtained its information by going directly to pupils;ex-pupils, parents of pupils, and teachers. The pupils were from the thirteen to sixteenyear group as in the Newsom report, bux they came from-a cross-section of all maintainedschools. The ex-pupils included those in the fifteen to sixteen year group who had justleft school and alsO some from a sample nineteen and twenty year olds. In contrast, theNewsom Committee obtained its information about the schools, the.pupils,and theproblems from the Headmasters of a representative sample of Secondary Modern andComprehensive Schools. The two reports are interesting to compare since they wereprepared within a few years .of each other and are about many of thse same sorts of pupils,but rely on different sources ofcinformation.In the SchoOls Council Eriquiry (S.C.E.), youngsters between the ages of thirteenand sixteen who intended to leave or had left school at fifteen were asked how. important.they thought various functions of school. were. If Was. found that the vast majority ofthem felt that '.. : the main purpose of school in general was to provide the tools necessaryfor success in later life ..1 (S.C.E:32) and that 'This same broad picture was found what-ever the expected leaving age of the young person' (S.C.E.32). 'Aims concerned with.widening interests and broadening the mind were very generally rejected by all leaving\"agegroups (S.C.E.36). In fact it was noted that Itappears that thosewho expect to stay atschool until sixteen or older may have an even more narrowly functional idea of what themain aims of their edUcation should be than do the fifteen year old leavers' (S.C.E:37).This careers function of school was seen to be just as important to the nineteen and twentyyear age group, although they were not astoncerned as the youngsters were with schoolsteaching skillS.directly applicable to particular jobs. However, those nineteen and twentyyear Olds who had not gone on to any further education were more likely than were theyoungsters\"to feel that the school should teach things which would widen their interests.As for the parents of fifteen year old leavers, they '... alrhost universally saw as veryimportant functions of the schooli the teaching of things which would enable their childto obtain, as good a job 3s possible and. the imparting of the basic skills of being able to.write correctly and to speak and. easily...in gerieral the objectives concerned withWideWnd interests and increasing awareness were much.more widely vakied.by parentsthan youngsters' ($.C.E.38). The teachers, and especially the head teachers, placed muchless stresspn the importance otthecareers aspect of schools than did the pupils,.ex-pupils,and parents.,This great discrepancy between the views of the pupils and those of theleachersWould seem to be important., SuCh a conflict of aims could play havoc with attempts to \"11 H. .- engage the pupils' interest. That aspect of education which the pupils see as relevant is nothighly valued by the teachers. It isindeed curious that the Newsom Repormanaged toreflect quiteaccurately the pupils' views even though the CoMmittee's source of informa-tion wasthe Head Teachers. This may indicate that although the Head Teachers disagreewith the pupils as to the most important fUnctions of schools, they do know what thepupilt want from school. The teachers are of course faced with a dilemma; &they are toengage the pupils' interest, the eeucation must seem relevant to the pupils. However, ifthe education is made increasingly relevant in the pupils' terms, the teachers feelthat it is of little value. Clearly, the teachers must also seethe relevance of what goes on inschool if they are to be good teachers. One hopeful sign is that the teachers in the. SchoolsCouncil Enquiry seemed to agree with the recommendations Oirthe Newsom Committee'intheir endorsement of the idea that with the raising of the school leaving age the curriculumshould have a practical emphasis in terms of type of subject, active participation of pupils,and relevance tritheir out of school life..Youngsters whO were or would become sixteen year old.leavers were asked to rate'subjects in terms of their usefulness and how interesting they were Nearly.all of thoieasked felt that English and Mathematics were very Useful. However, they were much lesslikely to rate these subjects as interesting. Therefore, in terms of the Newsom Report, it-.woUld seem that these subjects were seen to be relevant but that the way in which theywerewas not, perhaps becausee , of the specific content or the manner of preientation: The SChools Council:Encoiry concludes that 'If a subject is seen as useful it is to beexpected that this would increase its chances of holding the interest also Although this istrue in general it is clear that there arsubjects which appreciable numbers of pupils see.as useful but not interesting and conversely as interesting but not useful' (S.C.E.58). Inother wordS, relevance is necessary but not sufficient to engage interest.The survey then went on to enquire what made a subject boring to Oupili. All theyoungsters who had named any subject as boring Were asked what it was about the subject,that made thernboring. sGetting.on for half the fifteen year old leavers (girls more than.boys) complained that they did not understand the subjects, they were not explainedenough and they were not good at them' (S.C.E.65)...'Approaching half were bored by, themonotony and repetitiVeness of subjects. Theylfelt that they were doing the same thingaltbibe time, there was not enough tiariety or lessons were taken too siowly' (S.C.E.66).SoMe complainedthatthey could not activelyparticipate in the lessons, some that thesubject was of no usethem, some that they did not like the teacher who taught thesubject, and some that the subject was old - fashioned. Although many of theseapparentshortcomings could be corrected by greater applicatiOr, of the four principles called for inthe Newsom Report, 'practical', 'realistic', 'participaforf and 'choice',: it is clear that theimportant. factor in keepingtheinterests of the Pupifs is the ability of the teacher tocorrectly assess their degree df Understanding of the various aspects of a given Subjectandhis further abilityto gear his teaching o this assessment. This implies the usefulnets ofmore individual work, as pupiii will have different problems:with the subject matterorskills they are learning.Youngsters were asked whet er they would like to be given the choice as to whichsubjects they did. Half the fifteen y ar old leaverS said that they would haveliked tachoose their subjects or to take subjects outside those already on their curriculum. A.._higher percentage 164%) of sixteen year old leavers would have such a choice, and aneven higher percentage (72%) of seventeen to eighteen year old leaveri would have likedto choose. Within the fifteen year old leaver group the less able pupils were more likely 12 than themore able pupils to think it was better for their teachers to decide which subjectthey should do. It would certainly seem that the amount of confidence which pupils had\\in their decision making ability played a large part in determining whether or not theythought they Should choose their own subjects. If This were not the case, it would be hard ------\\,----.:_older leavers to say that a higher prnoortion of their school subjects were useless andto explain the fact that although '... the fifteen year old leavers were more likely than i'-boring (S.C.E.69), they were less likely than the older leavers to want to chose their ownsubjects.This-would. seem to underline the point made in the Newsom Report-that it isimportant,fOr the average and below average pupils to learn how to make decisions. Itshould be mentioned here that the pupils' boredom was not confined to school. A sub-stantial number of them complained of being -often bored in their spare time This problemwas mentioned by the Newsom Report.. Teachers worried about their pupils' boredom, and this Played a large part in theirthoughts about the proPosed raising of the school leaving age. The report states that 'The ..majority of teachers, then, had reservations about the advantagei of keeping at least some,? of their pypils on at school. The \"most frequently mentioned reasc;ns for their doubts layin thepdpils' 'own attitude to school. These teachers did dot feel confident in their abilityto get through the pupils' apathy, boredom and lack of interest in anything to do withschool' (S.C.E.89). However, some teachers were more optimistic and saw`the raising Ofthe school leaVing age as an opportunity to develop their pupils' interests. The fact that .the majority of teachers still feel that the pupils exude apathy and boredom would seem\\ to'indicate.that progress in engaging.the pupils' interest in secondary education is not-going forward at an overwhelming pace. However, one optimistic sign is that many of theparents thought that the subjects taught at the time of the enquiry, were more interestingor uP-to7date than those taught when they themselves were in school. if they were correctin their assessment, this does indicate prOgress. Perhaps the baseline from which progressbeing made was so low thatit will take a great deal Of progress before startling results,'be seen irrterms of pupils' interest.Both reports stress the need to engage the pupils' interest, and in many ways theyagree on how this might be done. The area in which they do not agree so closely is in theanalosis of how much. progreis has already been made. The Newsom Report is perhapsmore cheerful irf its assessment of the current situation than is the Schools Council 1'EnqUiry. However, this difference may be due largely to the fact.that the Newsom Com-mittee set out to. make recommendations on how things should be, while the Schools.Counckl Enquiry by virtue of the way in which it was carried out necessarily found out\\-more about how things are now in the eyes of the various participants in the process of,eyesr:Secon ary. Education. 1:41 Primary and Secondary Educationehave now considered two reports on Primary Educationand four reports on Secondaryducation:All six reports have much to say about the useqf children's interest and.:.uriosity. It is interesting to compare the findings and recommendations of the PrimaryIducation with those of the Secondary Education reports. :A I the reports expressed theopinion that if education was to be effective theupils' inrest must be engaged. This has already been amply documented in the earlieres of tis paper. There is, however, a difference across age as to how difficult the tasko engagin thepupils' interest is seen to be 13 The Single most alarming difference which-strikes one immediately s that whilethe reports on Primary SehoOl speak of the great natural curiosity whi childar,en havewhen they first begin school, the reports on Secondary education stress the boredom withschool and with life in general which characterises children in the later years at school.One feels that something is very wrong if, after eight years of school, children have not onlyfailed to further develop their curiosity, but have lost what they had. If one of the func-tions of the school is seen as that of arousing pupils interests as it is seen to be in thereports studiedthen the schools are surely failing if many pupils move from a state .ofgreat curiosity at the start of their school, career to one of great boredom at the finish ofit. Based solely on the evidence of the reports, one gets theehilpression that the meta-morphosis from the interested pupil to the bored may take place in the first two years ofSecondary school If this is sO, then:why is it? Could it be the rigid compartmentalising ofall knowledge into subjects which have little meaning to the pupils? This is certainly onepossibility put forward by the various committees which studied Secondary Education.Could it be that for some pupils all Work is geared towards success at-exams while-thealternative is no threat of exams and a sure sense of failure? These and many more possi-bilities present themselves.However, there are three alternative possibilities which need careful consideration.Perhaps the Plowden Committee was a bit over - optimistic in its report. Perhaps most--children are already bored by the time they leave primary school. Maybe the stimulatingeducation which the Plowden Committee reported on is not nearly so widespread as theybelieved it to be. Another possibility is that most children are not bored when ',hey entersecondary school and are in fact still interested when they get to the last two years inschool, but that the education they are offered at that point is o irrelevant to them thatthey appear to have been bored from the start. Lastly, it would be unfair to the schools to:I.place all responsibility or them without even considering the pOssibility That there couldbe a natural decline in curiosity as children get older - perhaps based on their stage ofpsychosexual development, growing family and social pressures, or just the fact that asthey live longer less is new to them and they take more for granted. This last alternative isa possibility, bUt even so it should only present a challenge not an insurmountableobstacle.The Primary School Reports and. Secondary School Reports both stress the need.foreducation to be seen by the pupil to be meaningful and relevant to his life. In both casesthere.. is a suggestion that use should be made of the environment of the child. For theprimary school pupil, this is largely because he will have the greatest of difficulty in Under-standing concepts which cannot be related to his environment. For the secondary schoolpupilnit is because he is less likely to see the pOint in learning about something the furtherremoved it is from his environment In. the reports on Priniary Education there is morestress on how children can best learn as well as what they will learn with interest. Thereports on Secondary Education are more concerned with what the, children learn. Perhapsthis emphasis should be shifted a bit in vim of the findings we see in the report 'Young .School Leavers' in which the complaints made most frequently by the pupils are related cohoW the subjects are taught rather than which subjects are. ,..It seems ironic that at precisely:the stage in education (i.e.tat the secondary level)when most pupils are more able to find out things for themselves; because they havemastered the techniques of reading and simple arithmetic and beaause their powers ofreasoning are more developed, the emphasis on the idisCovery method' tends to be dropped.However, it is certainly true that less emphasis is put on it in the reports on Secondary' . 14 \" Education than in those on Primary Education. The reports on Secondary Education do,stress the importance of the-pupil participating actively in the learning process = but thisseems to be more in termsOtarnakingthings in the 'practical subjects!. One is left with theimpression that learning gets more passive in nature as the pupils get older and that itgets more Passive the pupils disengage themselves from the educational process.Pne is thenleft with teachers who are teaching but pupils who are not learning, or perhaps, morecorrectly; teachers whoare trying to.teach; but are not succeeding:It is not then'surprising that teachers are worried about how they will.handlepupils during the extra year at school. Many .pupils get little or kit extrinsic reward forapplying themselves at school so they will only be motivated to try if they get intrinsicrewards. 1.5 ConclusionThe general impression one gets is that the recommendations in the field of interest and7____Curiosity_have not changed much over the years, except to go slightly further in the samedirection. HoweVer, the desbriptions of how things actually were at the times of the various1:studies did tend to change:over time to some extent; this is especially true as regards theprimary school reports. A.This could lead to the feeling that all is well; however, as has been pointed out; alarge number of pupils are said to be bOred with schoOl and anxious to leave at an early age,well beforethe present school leaving age. We have already considered some of thepossible reasons for 'this, Whatever the reasons, there is clearly a need for effective-concern. 15 1.7 References Central-Advisory Council for.Eduction (England) (B.

Hutt distinguisheithree sources of novelty: with differing behavioureffects. It is thifirst of these with which we are mainly concerned here. Berlynecategorises novelty as 'complete', long-term' or 'short- term'. Most relevant empiricalstudies have attempted to manipulate the last of theSe by controlling the frequencyof occurrence, of stimuli within an experimental session. Using such a procedure; Berlyrie__and Parham (1968) had students rate a series_otcolourid shapes for novelty along aseven -point scale. Subjective novelty of stimuli declined over repeated exposures, andincreased following repeated exposures of a different stimulus. Also, the more respectsin which the new stimulin differed from:the mfamiliar one, the more novel it judged.(The other collative variables that have received experimental attention aresurprisingness and incongruitY. These, as Hutt points out, can be regarded as instancesof what Berlyne.terms 'relative', as opposed to 'absolute'i,novelty. of expectancies based,upon past experience, while incongruitwdependson a novel, and more or less improbable, juXtaposition of otherwise familiar stimulUe.elements or events. 2.1.3Collative variables and exploratory responseThe majority of the studies reviewed here have used two-dimensional visual stimuli torepresent varying leVels of collative variability, while their power to elicit attention(specific exploration) has generally been operationalised as the length of time Spent fixa-ting them, oras the choice of one stimulus to fixate in preference to another. However,numerous variations of these dependent variables have been employed, as well as, in somecases, physiological indices of attefitiOn. Studies involving infants, children and adultsas subjects are described in sparate sections, and.as far as is convenient, studies, usingcomplexity andnovelty are dealt with separately.- 2.1:3.(i)Infant mai'radices of curiosity have been used in infants: thetime a child will continue to attend t a stimulus and the amount ofslowing down inheart rate. Well over thirty studies have examined relationships between children's res-ponses and degrees of comPlexity or novelly and habituation to both. These cannot bereviewed in detail here,and while there are differencesin-resultsobtainedywith-the heart rate Measure, there seems to be *le doubt that 'intermediate' degrees ofcomplexity and novelty are associated with longer`fixation and that habituation tostimuli proceeds more yapidly in older children. Both 'complexity' and 'novelty' are .relational-rather than categorical tents in that they are \\joint function of the objective'complexity level of stimulation and the individual's already eiciOng knoWledge andinformation-processing capacity. Since this normally increase with age older childrentypically attend more tp increasingly.coMplex stimuli. This won is reviewed in detail byKagan (1971). It isOf insufficient immediate relevance to merit itision here2.1.3. (ii) AOult studies. The investigation of responses to collative ulation in adults 23 and children has on the whole been nforedirectly stimulated by Berlyne's theorising thanthe infant research referred to above.Berlyne and his associates have reported a series Of studies using a standard set of.Ivisual materials comprising stimulus pairt representing 'more irregular' (MI) and 'less.regular' (LI) valUeS of complexity and incongruity variables.

In morerecent studies, three further pairs of patterns have been added representing a higherabsr;ute leyel of complexity, in order to determine whether increased attention tohigher comPleXity reflects merely a arndency to avoid verysirriple stimulation. Thesepairs are described asXA. Number of independent unitsXB. AssymmetryXC. Random distributionDay;(1966).has found that the four levels of complexity definedly Berlyne onan a priori basis are rated as increasingly complex by adulti.In the first study.using these materials (Berlyne, 1957) subjects were allowed topress a button to give theniseIves as many'brief (0.14 second) tachistoscopic exposuresOf the figures as they wished before passiiig on to the next. MI members elicitedSignificantly More responses than their LI couriterpartsin each category. When thePairs were shown side by side on a screen (Berlyne, 1958 a; b), the MI members attracteda significantly greater proportion of the viewing-time allotted, whether it was tenseconds produced leis members of each pair in turn,and subjects were requiredto take a further ook at. one of them.:There was a tendency of MI patterns. to be' selectedwhen the initial exposure was brief (0.5 or one second), and LI patternswben it waslonger (three or four seconds). Using a three-second initial exposure, Berlyne and Lewis(1963) found that on average, subjects chose to prolong MI stimu'i just over:half of the:'time. Also, once exposed, the MI members of the three high complexity categoriestended to attract less lookim tha_n_theiii_Lcoiinterparts.:This_result_was replicated byBerlyne and Lawrence (1964)using l'free looking-time measure, and Day (1966 cb)using paired companion and free looking-tiMe procedUres respectively, suggesting thateven for adults, the relationship between complexititand perceptual curiosity arousalmay be curvilinearjather than linear.Otherp/exity effects.

In the case of adult* and olddr children, it is possible to estimate howoften Particular stimuli have been encountered, and thus to manipulate relative noveltyand familiarity on an a priori basis. Such a procedure was used by Crandall (1967)who found that pairs of words defined as 'unfamiliar' in terms of ThorndikLorgefrequency were more effective in holding subjects' attention than 'familiar' pairs, thelatter resulting in more fi:equent alternations of fixation, and more fixations away fromthe display.Other experiments have used procedures similar to thote of infant studies alreadydescribed with similar results Faw and Nunnally, 197.1; Leckart, 1966).2.1.3.(i ii)Child studies. A number of studies have investigated complexity and incOn-gruity effects, employing the button-pressing exposure task used by Berlyne.for example,PielstiCk and Woodruff (1964 ;1968) found pictures and diagraMs rated as 'complex' elicitedsignificantly more 2-second exposures than a corresponding set of 'simple' drawings inseven and eleven year olds, The later study also demonstrated sjgrificant effects forincongruous.photographs over their banal counterparts.Other studies of complexity effects. Cantor, Cantor and Dittrichs (1963) used a variantof the Berlyne (1958a;b) procedure with pre-school children. The sUbjects were shownsix triads of figures for one minute each Each triad comprised patterns of relatively high,medium and low complexity; and subjecti were told to look as long or as little as theywished at each member in the time allotted The high-complex paiternkattrattectsignit-----icantly longer fixationsthan the other two categories.Hogs, Miller and. Spitz 11963) report a series of experiMenls carried out with agroup of mental retardates with a mean chronologiCal age (CA) of 'fifteen yeartandmental age (MA) of eight, together with normal comparison grOutts of equal CA and. MA.Thirty itimulus-pairS, mainly taken from Berlyne's, and represen ng six complexity andincongruity variables were preiented for three seconds each, after which subjects were \"able to prolong the exposure of either member for up to thirty nine seconds. Overall, themean number of MI (more irregular) choices was 1033 out of the thirty poisible,although the equal CA subjects viewed their. MI.selections longer than their LI ones:Hutt and McGrew (1969) Similarly used both selection and .fixation measure,with the difference that their subjects. (five, eight and eleven yeir olds) were able toinitiate for themselves exposures of simple or complex patterns by pressing one twodifferent-coloured buttons. No significant differences appeared between the dumber ofcomplex and siMplestimuli exposed, even though the older subjects were award thattwo buttons produced different kinds of patterns and exposed their-complex,cheices*-..,longer than their simple choices. ,Other studies ofincongruity effects. Faw and Nunnally (1968) replicated the findings oftheir adult studies demonstrating a linear relationship between level of inconpruousjuxtaposition and fixation-time, under both paired-comparisons and utiPated looking'conditions, year olds./(/ Novelty effects. A series of studies by Cantor and,Cantor investigated habitation andrecovery oiattentionin kindergarten children using black-and-white or coloured draw!ings as stimuli. They demonstrated fiXation decrement over fivessUcCeeive exposures ofe. .stimulus sets and recovery to non-familiarised stimuli with greater.recovery after eighthabitiiption trials than after two (See. Cantor, 1969)..Lewis, Goldberg and Rausch(1967).and Lewis and Goldberg (1969) fOUnddecrements in fixation, in three year olds over six thirty-second exposuresOf patterns'and drawings, and recovery of these responses when variants of the stimuli appeared -oh., _.. a seventh trial. : .,:. A number of studies with. young children havi demonttrated etendency toapproach novel toys in preference to. familiarised ones. Mendel (1965) gave groups ofthree to five year olds an opportunity to play with one off We sets of eighttoys ..)f .which eil,.iix, four, two or more had been exposed previously. The sets were thus.considered to represent-0, 25, 50,.75,and 100 per cent relative novelty. Frequencyof choice was found to be linearly related to novelty. Harris (1965;1967), found asignificant:tenderiCy to choose an unfamiliar toy rather than one that had previoUilybeen:shoWn for four minutes, even &the novel toy was damaged. 6.\"Hutt (1966; 1970a) used 'a more complicated experiniental set-up to investigatehabitdation effeCt: Children aged between three and five years old were placed individ-ually in a 'playroorn.for six ten-minute periods. T,he room contained five. familiarisedtoys and a novel object, namely, a rectangular box with a leyer that could be moved infour directiont; certain movements could' ause lights to come on, belli to ring,,Orcounters to work, While other movements'had no particular contingencies...Inv igationof the object was foUnd to be more prolonged under more complex feedPack .. . ittons, \u00b0while with minimal or no feedback it declined rapidly after the first trial. 44,Age, intelligence and specific exploration in children. Experiments which have comparedfixation responses of children and adults to the same stimuli have produced inconsistentresults. Burgess (T956tin-his-replicatimotthe first Berlyne study, found that fiveyear olds exposed the stimuli more than five times as long as a group of adults. Thiscouldbe interpreted as signifying that the children, with their lower information processingcapacity, required longer to reduce uncertainty to, a threshold level. However, Faw,Nunnally and Ator (1969) found no differences between eight to tWelve year olds andadults in fixations of dot-patterns varying in uncertainty, while Faw (1970) foundadults looking significantly longer than ten year olds at incongruous drawings. It, ispossible that Burgess' results were dUe at least in part to the children deriving greaterpleasure than the adults from operating the tachistoscope!If children who are younger or less intelligent do require more time than thoseolder or more intelligent to take in the same amount of information, as is suggested byinfant habituation stUdies, then it may be predicted that they will shdiv longer fixationsto the same stimuli. However, Kagan and Livson hypOthesise more advanced-childrenshould be differentially responsive to higher levels of collative variability, and given theimpossipility of defining these levels, precise predictions seem to be ruled.out Contraryto the first hypotheiis, Pielstick and Woodruff (1964)-found that times werepositively relatedt'bofh age and intelligenceadongseven and eleven yaar olds. In'their later study (1968), te variables had no effect when a different set of complexitystimuli were used, but yoer children did show more attention to pictures varyingin incongruity. Ashton (1965) ancrMelchert (1969) found that brighter terrand.elevenyear olds looked longer at patterns and at photographs of museum objects respectively,while, LaCrosse (1967), using the Berle figures, found no differences between high andlow intelligence six and eleven year s. 26o. v The evide riddielraing to he second hypothesis shows more consistency; theredoes appear to be a gem/attend c'y for more cognitively advanced children to be moredifferentially attentive to more co olex, incongruous and unfamiliar stimuli. In theHoats; Miller and Spitz (1968)_atu ,Only the_equal._CA group looked at:their--- --MI than at their LI 'choices; for bo the retarded and the equal MAsubjects, Ml and LIstimuli were fixated equally. The VI ()difference was found by Flick (1976). betweengroups of.normal andstetarded childr aged between five and thirteen:While all but theoldest retardates showed shorter fikati n than their normal agep'eers. Hutt and McGrewfotuid that exposure times of simple a complex patterns tended to deCrease with age,but five year olds tended to fixate simp pattems.longer than complex ones while theopposite was true for eleven year olds. For eight year olds, there was no differende. Black,.Williams and Brown (1971.) presentedpairs of shapes, containing between fOur endtwenty sides to three and four year olds. A twelve Sided shape was most often ChosemfOr,prolonged viewing by four year olds, while the younger group tended most to thooseone with eight sides. This finding was replicated in alongitUdinal study.As regards nOvelty, Mendel reportethat older children in a three to five year oldssample, chose lessfamiliar toy -sets significantly more ofteh' than those younger; WhilePielstick and Woodruff (1968) failed to find'any age or ability effects on-the time spentinvestigating various objectirated for novelty, either in overall or differential terms.Collative variablesand fixatiorkiffie. Berylne (1960, chap. 6), discUssing his 1957experiment, reports that subjects' comments shoWed that they tended to-look at thestimuli as long as was needed for identification. Clearly, since complex patterns containmoredetail than simpler ones, they require more prolonged attention before they can be-,registered, but it is doubtful whether the same interpretation can begnade with respect toother collative variables. Although Berlyne seems to hold the view that all the Collativevariablet affect specific exPloration in the same way, he has, indifferent statements ofhis theoretical pcisition, emphasised different internal constructs mediating betweenthetwo of information,that motivates specific exploration, is what,we call 'curiosity'.', (1956, p. 25) with 'whatunderlies all the collative properties and //givesthem their common motivational effectsis conflict, by which we mean a conditjOrrin which incompatible, mutually interfering 1pattern of behavi. r are simultaneottily mobilised' (1964, p. 0).'Allowinif5f the possibility suggested. by Eisenman (1968) that 'complexity'effects may sometimes be mediated by novelty (in.any case, all, stimuli are more or lessunfamiliar), it seemsa priori that the 'inadequate information' interpretation maybe more applicable to complexity, the 'conflict' interpretation to Variables like_novelty,incongruity and surprisingness, Which involve aetrong discrepancy between past andpresent eXperience. An experiment by Greenberger; Woliiman and YourahaW f1967);supports the riotiorfthat the function of visual filation may vary according to the nature'of the stimulus: groups of subjects given a prior 'curiosity set' or 'set to remember!looked longer at collative stimuli significantly longer than a controlinstructions, but for the former, attention-was-prolonged -predominantly to incongruouspictures, while1Or the latter the effect stemmed Mainly from increased attention tohighly comploQatterns: Moreover, seventy per cent of the control subjects, whenquestioned afteeVie experiment, reported hiving developed 'a self-induded curiosity orremembering set, arl the same relationships obtained for them : 27 A. 2.1.4Cornpleity, novelty, exploration and/liking ., i-'/ lobielyes 'preferencee,i)ere seems toIbe no reason to infer that stimuli that attract longer fixations are 'liked' more than thosewhich are fixated less. However, over twenty studies have shown that stimuli rated asMore 'interesting' by subjects tend to be thcAie that attracflonger attention, i.e'interestingness' tends to increase with'coWexity, while judgements of highestpreference or 'pleasingness' tend to be accorded to relatively simple or intermediatelycomplex stimuli, though there is evidence for wide individual differenCes in the peak ofthe preference function. On the basis of such findings, Berlyne (1963;4967) hassuggested that expressed interest and preference are related to specific. and diversiveexploration respectively, 4e: whereas 'interesting' stimuli are those which tend to elicitspecific exploratory behaviour, 'pleasing' stimuli are those which would'have greaterreward value in a situation of low-information input. Studies that have subjectsexPosing' themselves to whateVer stimuli they liked, which would appear to be anoperational measure of liking (ag. Hutt and McGrew, 1969; Duke arid Gullickson, 1970),have not found any evidence consistent preference for complexfty.

Paz and Pien (1971), using adults and tento thirteen year olds as subjects, obtained similaTresults to Cantor's for both groups:unfamiliar drawings were rated more liked, regardless of whether they were meaningful orwhether a spaced or.massed familiarisation procedure was used. The authors suggest thatZajonc's restilts could haie stemmed froth his using stimuli that were initially difficult todistinguish from each other; reinforcement following successful discrimination wouldbe expected to have enhanced subjects' attitudes towards those stimuli.Berlyne (1970a) nid groups of students rate/coloured shapes (as Used by Berlyneand Parham in their subjective novelty study) on se lien-point scales for 'pleasingEass' andInterestingness'. Both were found to decline with repeated exposures, with 'interesting-ness' tending to fall off faster, and to increase with a change of stimulus. Ber lyneattempted to reconcile conflicting resulti by proposing that changes'in preference/following exposure depend on changes in the arousal-potential of the stimulus. On thisbasis, he predicted that relativelicOmplex stimuli, having an arousal-potential in excessof the optimal level, would become more liked as continued exposure produCed arousal-decrement, whereas. simple stimuli; having a sub-optimal level at the outset; would merelyincrease arousal further with continued exposure, resulting in increased negative affectIn a series of experiments, Berlyne found that complex paintings on the whole declined.-less in 'pleasantness' than simpler ones Over ten four-second presentations, While therewas some tendency for their ratings to rise when the familiarisation proc ure involvedthe interspersed presentation of several stimuli (as used by Zajonc and hi associates)rather than homogeneUus sequences. In .a further experiment, ratings Oficomplex paintingswere found to reach a peak after twelve presentations and then decline steadily withadditional trials, while those of tImple, paintings shoWed a monotonic decrease.Hutt's 'novel toy' studies (1970 8;1)) provide evidence in support of Berlyne's -.hypothesis that whether or not the reward-value of a stimulus: increases with familiaritydepends on how 'interesting' the.stimulus is initially. Shefound tht when complexfeedback from the object was available, the time that subjects spent in playing with it(i.e., diversbve exploration) increased and then decreased over hi*, as investigation of it(specific exploration) declined steadily; it was enhanced by widispacing of trials, but itdid not occur at'all under simple or no feedback conditions. 2.1BEpistemic curiosity' Epistemic' behaviour is defined 1966a) as a sub-class ofspecific exploration, particularly characteristic of humans, which is directed towards andreinforced by the acqUisition of knowledge, 'that is, ihforrnatiostored in the form ofideational structures and giving rise to,internal symbolic responses that can guidebehaviour an future occasions'. (.1966a, p. 31). The classes of behaviour listedby are epistemic which inciudes reading andquestioRasking.Such behaviour is thought to be initiated by and aimed at resolving, a state ofhigh arousal (' episteMic curiosity') resulting from nceptual conflict, ie. competitionbetween incompatible thoughts, conceptions. Berlyne categoriesof frOm exploratory.behaviour aimed at inty of the moment' (ibid.), the distinc- between the two would not 'appear-to be clear -cut if one accepts that explorationmay be directed towards. the formation of models or schemata Of stimulus-events.-Brurier (1966) has suggested that knowledge can be encoded in three different ways:by Means of 'enective', 'iltonic' or 'symbolic' representation. That is to say, one canknow about the world through the habitual actions that are used in coping with it,through imagery, or through linguistic and Other symbolic transformations of actionsand image. It may be the case that much perceptual exploratory behaviour liea.2.1ATserves the functiorcof acquiring ikonic schemata, particularly in young children whoserepresentational capacities are lirnited, While the types of response classified as'epistemic' are those which are aimed at forming,or modifying symbolic schemata.Two experiments by Berlyne (1954b; 1962) were designed to test four hypo-theses proposed by the author in the earliest statement of his theory (1954a). It waspredicted that conceptual conflict, and hence epistarnic behaviour, would increase asa function of:(1).the number of competing sy.mboliC response-tendencies(2)their total absolute strength.(3)-their nearness to equality of Strength, and(4)their degree of mutual incompatibility.In the first study, a group of students were given a questiOnnairecOnsisting of,fortkeight multiple-choice guestion3 about invertebrate animals, and were asked tomark the twelve questions whose answers they would most like to know. The resultsshowed that questions were more likely to be marked if(i)they. concerned animals rated as more faMiliar; this was taken as supportfor hypotheses (1) and (2), on the assumption that beliefs and ideas about morefamiliar concepts would be both more numerous and stronger;(ii)they had four rather than two alternative answers; this was taken-as---additional support fOr hypothesis (1);(iii)they were found surprisi eir predicates were judged to beinapplicable to thearAmals-i ved; this was considered' to support hypothesis (4):Ay was concerned with testing hypothesesil ) and (3), degree of ,\\conflict in this case being manipulated by Varying stimulus-uncertaintY. A group ofSixteen year olds/was presented with thirty quotations, each coupled with two or threenames purporting (incorrectly) to include that of the author; each name in turn wasCOtIpled with a number which was alleged to be how many experts out of a group ofa kindred had guessed it to be the correct name to match the quote. Uncertainty wasvaried further by varying the distribUtion'of'guesses' among the names; the more namesthere were, and the more evenly the guesies were distributed, the greater Was the level ofobjective uncertainty. The thirty, quotes werethus divided into high-, medium- andlow,uncertainty groups. Subjects were instructed to rank-order the twelve quoteswhose true authors they wbuld most,like to know, A 'curiosity score' of zero wasallotted to unranked quotes, while the score for each one ranked was calculated bySubtracting its rank from thirteen. It was found that the mean curiosity score washighest for, the high7uncertainty quotes and lowest for the low - uncertainty quotes,lending support to both hypotheses:A similar depeneent variable was used by Ashton (1965) to investigate the_effects of collative propertieS'on epistemic curiosity in ten and eleven year oldChildren. The subjects were asked to say which of the objects in a series of phOto-\\ graphs they would like to know more about. Ashton reportithat in the case of 'puzzle'pictures' (common objects viewed from unusual angles), frequency of choice wascorrelated with judged complexity and novelty,thoUgh more so with the former, whilewith photographs' of strange museum objects, there were no such correlations. Providinginformation increased frequency of choiae when it appeared to conflict with the contentof the picture, and decreased it when it merely defined or described the picture, thusreducing stimulus-uncertainty. Subjects tended not tochoose pictures about whoieidentity they had been able to formUlate a:large number of hypotheses, which.may beseen as an instance of conflict reduction through 'epistemic thinking'. 2.1.5The stimulation of questionstQuestion-asking, it has been noted, is defined by Berlyne as an instance of 'consultation',i.e. 'behaviour which exposes an individual to verbal stimuli issuing from other individuals',(p. 265). ll: Isaacs (Isaacs, 1930), in an essay on the 'why' questions of young. Children,stressed the role of conflict in motivating such questions, many of which, he suresied,could be classified as 'epistemic' why's (La occasioned by a sudden clash, gap o disparitybetween .our past experience and any present experience' (p. 295).......- Berlyne and Fronimer (1966) investigated the relationship between ccinflict-'arousal and question-asking in groups of children aged five, eight and eleven: The Subjectswere presented with pairs of items representing high and low ('plus'' and 'minus') valuesof collative variables, and were invited to ask questions about them. The stimuli consistedo_ f picturesAvaryingirrir.TCongruity); pictures with or.without explanatory 'Tories the numbea and respectiveprobability46 concerning'- Open questions were more frequent at all ages; Closed e*olanatory qUestions were onlythat the questioner has formulated a specific hypothe4s that he wants confirmed ore._ comes(surprisingness).

This category eliCited significantly more explanatory than factualquestions,overall, while the 'amount of information' and 'uncertainty' categories, asmight be expected, elicited more factual questions. In a pilot study employing slightlydifferent materials,.:;year olds asked` many more quistiOns than younger or olderchildren (a Mean of 230 against 3.7 and 9.4 respectively), while in the main experiment,the:number increased monotonically with age (means of 6.9; 16.8 and 17.8); thisdisparity was attributed to the fact that the oldest Children wore already familiar withthe stories used in the pilot study. Surprisingly, in both experiments, providing answersincreased ;the number of questions asked only for the intermediate age-group, this effectattaining Significancb in the main study.Duffy and Robinson (ibid) found that 'incongruous' drawings elicited significantlymore questions than their banal counterparts, although the absolute numbers were small(a mean of 1.33 agai7st 0.371. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation 31 _ (r = 0.40) between amount of questioning and intelligence-testscores (Raven's matrices);while social class had no significant effect. Evans (1970) invited his subjects to record any_questions they would like to ask about six paragraphs graded for complexity. More complex.paragraphrdid.not elicit more questions, but as complexity increased, the proportion ofsubjects asking \u00a7pen questions increased significantly, while the proportion asking closedquestions declin,ed. 2.1.6 Curiosity-arousal and learning .A test of the effect. of epistemic curiosity arousal on retention was carried out by Berlyne(1964h)1n a later phase of the study cited previously: After the experimental group hadseen, the pre-questionnaire described earlier, they and a control group who had not hadthe questionnaire were given a list of seventy two statements about inVertebrate animall,some of which were answers to the questions. This.was followed by a retention test con- /.listing of open-ended 1.rsions of the same questions in a re-randomized order. It was/ found, as predicted, that the experimental group scored significantly higher than thecontrols on the retention-test, and that statements which were recognised as answers toquestions were more likely to be retained. In addition, questions mostcuriosity were more likely to have their answers recognised and to be answered correctlyin the test. .1\\ Berlyne's interpretation of these results seem puzzling at first glance:'It had been postulated that the questions would generate epittemiccuriosity, which would be relieVed after sUbsequent exposure to thecorresponding statements and internal rehearsal of them, and thatreinforcement from the consequent curiosity reduttion would increase ,the likelihdod of recall whenlhe questions again dtiingthe test.Phase.' (1966b, p. 128)If knowledge-reheirsaffollowing epistemic behaviour does enable conflict to be resolved,then it should be expected to strengthen that behaviour. In fact, the experimental groupdid express More 'extended curiosity' than the controls at the end of the experiment:when asked to indicate which animals they would like to know more about, they. checkedoff more\\animals (but compare the equivocal evidence obteined by Berlyne and Frommer).-:Howe4er; Berlyne's account seems to assume that arousal-reductiOn strengthens both theepistetnic response and knowledge rehearsal. A more satisfactory interpretation may beone involving two-stage reinforcement process: conflict-reduction may act as the reinforcerfor knOwledge-rehearsal, while exposure,to answers, by providing the opportunity for ' :Conflict reduction, may reinforce the epittemic-response.-Itshould be.noted; however,thatatlifferent explanation has been proposed by Rothkopf suggests thatpre-questioning facilitates retention \\by eliciting linspecthie behaviours' which draW theleirner's attention to relevant information. Thii interpretation and research relating to itare discussed by Prosser (chap. 9).A further, investigation by Berlyne (1966b) used materials similar to those employedin his 1962 study. The subjects, eleven and twelve year old-girls, were presented withtwenty eight quotations together with names of possible authors andiexperts' guesses as towhich was the correct one. Again, uncertainty was Manipulated, by varying the number ofpossibilities and the distribution of guesses. FOr the pUrPosel of the experiment,,_ one-was assigned to be the 'correct' answer for each of the quotes:-subjectiwere given thisanswer following exposure to the quotes,-after \"Which theY.received a retention test pre- 32. senting the quotes in .a.re-arr'anged order. Contrary to prediction, neither retention nor,extended curiosity scores were affected by the two uncertainty variables, but retentionScores were significantly correlated.with both extended curiosity arid intelligence testscores (r = 0.22 in each case): fierlyne suggests on the basis of this that retention may bea joint function of intelligence and the individual's charaCteristic level of curiosity. Havingto guess the answer for each quote before being given the 'corrects answer significantlyimproved recall, as did a delay between exposure to the quotes and receipt of the answers.The reason for this latterfinding is not at all clear, but the 'guess' condition might have,been expected to increase response - competition and thus raisethe level of epistemiccuriosity. Further evidence.for the facilitating effect Of prior guessing on learning isreported by Berlyne, Carey, Lazare, Parlow and Tiberius (in press).A similar experiment toBerlyne's was carried out by Nicki and Shea (1971) whopresented nine'to eleven year old children with a series of twenty questions coupled with__the correct answer or with two, three or five atternativesi-oneOfwhidhWis correct. Therespective_probabilities-ottlifinswers were determined by the frequency'with which theyhad been given when the questions had been presented in open-ended form to 'a differentgroup of children. The procedure was basically the same as that followed: y Berlyne:after the questioni had been pretented, the children were told the correct answers, andthen Underwent a recall test either imMediately or twenty four hours afterwards. UnlikeBerlyne, Nitki and Shea found a significant relationship between uncertainty and retentionscores, although overall it tended to be curvilinear, recall scores being highest for questionswith three alternative answers. This effect was more marked for immediate than fordelayed recall, and more marked for middle- than for wOrking-clasi children. Overall, theworking-class scored lower than the middle-class, but the performances of the two groupswas equal at the highest level of uncertainty.Paradowiki,:(1967) hasalso demonstrated improved retention,following curiosity--arouial, using a completely different.procedure. HePresented groups of students with tenpicturet, five depicting 'strange', and five 'familiar' animals, together with a paragraph ofinformation about each: After inspecting the pictures and paragraphs Or thirty secondseach, the subject were given a recall test. Retention of kith the information in the pare,graphs and the settings and borders of the pictures was significantly superior for the groupshoWn the''strange' pictures. In a similar, but simpler experiment, Pielstick and Woodruff -(1968) tested for.recall of ObjettS rated 'novel' and.'familiar' by seven and eleven year olds,both immediately and .five weeks after the objects had been seen in ariekploration study.Younger subjects retailed lignificantly more novel objects in both tests, while the olderchildren showed some tendendy to recall familiar objects better, even though both groupshad initially ipeht longer in investigation of the novel objects. . .It has been noted that on Berlyne's hypothesis, that uncertainty-reductionstrengthens both knowledge and the:response that Produces it The exPeriment by Nicki(1969) cited earlier, suggests that uncertainty,reduction may reinforce_any-respobie uponwhich it is contingent. A similar effect watderitonstrated-bOifittman and Terrell (1964);they diVided a sampleof Six-yea-re:Ads into three groups on the basis.of the numberofcorrect-restiOnses (zero, fourteen or twenty nine) they were required to make ine discrirnina-tiOn task before the identity of a dot could be made known to them. The groupwhich had to wait longest made significantly fewer errors than the:other two, while thegrOup told the identity of the drawing at the outset made most errors. It thus appears thatuncertainty-reduction was a sufficient inCentive toenhance discrimination performanceeven though the relationship between the two was arbitrarily determined by the experimenters. 2.1.7 Epistemic curiosity: a re-interpretationSimilar ideas about epistemic behaviour and its relationship to learning have beenexpressed in different terminology in the theoretical formulations proPOsed by Piaget(1936) and Ausubel (1968), the former 'concerned with cognitive develOpinent inchildren, the latter with meaningful verbal learning in the educational context. Bothassume that the indiVidual's knowledge of the world cons is of hierarchically organisedinternal representations of experience generally referred to 'schemes' or 'cognitivestructures', and that the acquisition of new knOwled invomodifications of thesesystems. However, Piaget is like Berlyne and unlike Au I. in that he is interested inmechanisms of knowledge acquisition, stressing that organisms adapt actively to theirenvironment; both see confliCt as a basis of change. Ausubel'is concerned lesi withwhence.and-how-potential knowledge comesnto the organism's orbit of experience,but whether or not it can be assimilated once it is there, viz. what is relevant to theintegration of knowledge, particularly that presented in verbal form. He says nothing.about 'accommodation' except that it may be impossible.Both Ausubel and Piaget write in terms of internal representations being cognitivestructures, loading the organism with interpretive schemas. By contrast Berlyne hOnourshis commitment to learning theory by writing in terms of response tendencies andproblems of antagonism among these; conflict is a conflict abotit what to dm FOr Piaget'.conflict is a problern about what and how to think. 'According to. Piaget's biological model, each new cognitive transaction with theenvironment involves two compleMentary processes, 'assimilation' and 'accommodation'.'Assimilation' refers to the interpretation of an object or event in accordance with thechild's existing cognitive structure, while 'accommodation' refers to the process by whichunassimilablproperties of that objecf or event change internal representations allowingsubsequent incorporation into those structures. In these terms; the types of behaviourlabelled 'exploratory' and 'epistemic' can be regarded as different niocloj accominoda-ting to new experience& A similar interpretation is suggested by Ashton (1965, chali 5),when she deicribes questiOns as:behaviour 'designed to remove obstacles in the path ofassimilating objects into past experience'. .Piaget supposes that cognitive structures, oncegenerated by the child's experience, haire an intrinsic need to continue functioning, andthat atcommOdatory acts are continually being extended tosnew and different featuresof the environment. A newly accommodated-to feature will be asiimilated to an existingstructure; once assimilated, it will modify that structure, and make possible...further-7accommodations. This process, together with spon anioms-re-organisation of assimilatorystructures occurring input, makei passible a series ofprogressively-rroilstable states of 'equilibriUth' between the child and the environmentas his internal representationi become- an 'increasingly satisfactory match to rein*.This equilibration process is assumed to be an autonomous 'wired-in' one (asimilarview is proposed by White, 1959). It has been pointed out by Berlyne(1960,chap. 11) and Ashton that the drive.to attain higher levels of equilibrium would appearto-stem from the individual's awareness of the inadequacy wci'l his present knowledge in thefate.of some new input, and theattainment of a higher !eve( functions-to resolve conflictsarising out of perceived discrepancies; to use term, Piaget's regards 'trouble' to bethmainspring of development. HioweVer, while this concept is used to explain majortransitions in the course of intellecturaldeVeloPment the modification of cognitivestructures clearly occurs at a molecular rather than a molar level the child does notattain maturity in one single step. The gradualness of cognitive advances is explained by the hypothesis that one is only able to assimilate information for which one has beenprepared by previous assimilations: An event whose .interpretation requires a radicalre-organisation or extension of existing Structures cannot be succeSsfully accommodatedto, .and hence assimilated,' or in Ausubel's terms, the assimilation of new material dependson the availability of appropriate concepts to act as 'subsumers' for that Material.As Berlyne (1970a) points out, the model that Piaget proposes may have generalitybeyong the developmental sphere:'It seems reasonable to account suppose that similar factors will account for theinitiation of a speCific piece of thinking as well as the adoption of newoverall strategies of thinking and the construction of the comprehensivesystems of thought elements on which every speCific thought proCessdepends.' (p. 968)AUsubel makes a similar point, though with a rather different emphasis:' A moderate amount of discrepancy, incongruity or gap between existingknowledge and a new learning task is most effective in mobilising attention,particularly when the learner is dissatisfied with what he knows. In.J. Piaget's terms, a child is most attentive to new learning tasks when theyrequire some degree of accommodation on hit part before they can beassimilatedwhen existing schemas are not wholly adequate for under,standing or problem-solving and require some but not too much modifiCation.'(1968, p. 371)What Ausubel is proposing here would appear to be an instance of a discrepancy hypothesis;not only is theindividUal's ability to assimilate new material determined by its 'remoteness'from his existing knowledge, but his desire to do so is also. If this is' the caie, then it maybe predicted that the likelihood of epistemic behaviour being elicited by any given material'will, be. a curvilinear function of its remoteness. However, the problems of defining amountof discrepancy in operational terms are likely to be at least as great, as they are withrespect to exploratory behaviour. 2.2 Curiosity as Behaviour : EicOloration and Questions:.xpioratoryllehaviour in ChildrenThe studies of exploratory behaviour cited in the previoUs section were concerned primarilywith manipulating stimulus variables: Although subject variables were also taken intoaccount, they were considered mainly with respect to differential attentiveness to stimuliof high and low collative variability. Thresearch to be described in this section pikesgreater emphasis uponpersonal antecedents of exploration,and partiCularly upon aspectsof Mother-child interaction. Alio,*they tend to operationalise exploratory behaviour inmore global terms than mere visual fixations of specific stimuli. In some cases, the amountof investigation exhibited by subjects in an experimental situation has been regarded as anoperational measure of the trait of curiosity; the extent to which this assurription isjustifiable will be discussed in the following section (3.3). 2.2.1 Factors influencing-exploratory behaviourPersonal adjustment. 'As described earlier, evidence on the relationship between measures ofanxiety and responsivenesS to collative stimuli is, equivocal, despite the theoretical groundsfor supposing that this relationship shoUld be a negative one McReynolds, Acker andPietila 119611, onthe basis inhibit the assimilation of new percepts to perceptual schemata, and this in turnwould inhibit exploratory behaviour. The procedUre of their experiment was similar tothatused by McReynolds (1958) with psychiatric patients. The dependent variable wasthe number of manipulations of thirty five small objects; twelve of these were presentedsingly, and twenty three were presented in an ensemble for ten minutes. The subjects,eleven year olds, were rated by a teacher on six-point scales for 'psychological health'and'for five aspects of 'maladjustment'. Exploration scores correlated 0.45 with PsY-chological health and from -0.27 to -0.5n with the maladjustment ratings.However, Medinnus and Love (1965) found no relationship between teacherratings on six aspects of 'security' and exploratory behaviour in four year olds. Thedependent variable in this case was the amount of manipulation of twelve small toysarid objects, and the number of times subjects chose an unseen toy in preference toa visible one on eight trials. Saxe and Stollali (1971) found teacher-ratings of anxietyto be unrelated to six measures of exploraticin in a free play situation in five year old .boys.Maternal attention. Rheingold (1961) compared the visual and manipulatory resP0P-siveness to a novel toy (a rattle) of three monthold institution- and home-rearedbabies. Prior observation revealed that the home-reared more maternalattention, Whiletheinstitutiongroup received attention from a largo-number ofdifferent handlers. There were no significant differences between the two groups infour measures of exnleration, although the institution babies were more responsivesocially. .-- .Rubenstein (1967) hypothesised on the basis of .Ftheingold'sand other findings,that the period between thretand_a_haltancraMonths of age is a critical one fOr theemergence of a relatiorith-en levels of environmental stimulation.and exploratorybehaViout. Accordingly, she distinguished three groups, judged to be receiving high,medium and .low levels of:maternal attentiveness, on the basis of home obsentatiOnsmade when the children were five months Old. Measures of exploration; obtained atsix months, consisted of the time spent looking at and manipulating a bell presentedalone for ten minutes, and.following this, ten novel objects pairedWith the bell for.\".one minute each The high-attentiveness group were significantly. superior to thelow-attentivenesS group on the first test; and to both other groups on the second.However, Rubeinstein's hypothesis is put in question by the results.Of an experiment byWhite and Castle (1964), iii.which.the attentiveness variable was manipulated experiment-ally. A group of infants froth an init:tutionwere given two .minutes extra handling aday,during the first five weeks of life. They subsequently exhibited greater genera-visual attentiveness than a non-handled group; the largest difference occurred at aboutsix weeks ofage, after which the performance of thetwo groups became more siMilar.:This enhancement effect was apparently not mediated by supeHority there were.no differencesbetween the two gains in weight, or in general health: In this study, the independentvariable was defined.precisely.as the amount of physical. contact between mother andchild, whereas in the Rheingold and Rubenstein Studies, this variable was confoundedWith the general level.f. environmental input with.which the child was-provided. Itseems likely that these two factors may effect subsequent.exploratorybehaviourdifferentially, and also may Interact differentially with time of occurrence.'Parental attitudes. Moss and Robson 11968) had raters assess expectant mothers on two nine-point scales, relating to the degree to which they saw their babies in a positive senseand their interest in affectionate contact with infants. Scores on the two scales predictedthe amount o face-to-face contact between mother and child at one and three monthsof bge, but they failed to predict the length of fixations shown to geometrical patternsand facial represehtations at three and a quarter months. At the same time; girls' fixa-tionsto the facial stimuli were significantly correlated (r = 0.61) with amount of face-toface contact at three months.Using the McReynolds ettest, and projective-tests designed to tap children'sperceptions of parental, behaviour, Pangrac (19691 found that nine year old girls whoscored low on exploration, significantly more than those who scored high, tended toperceive their parents as high on love and autonomy-granting, and low on hostility andcontrol. Similar tendencies were found for boys, but not to a significant extent.Exploratory behaviour was to intelligence; social class, an's family size, butfirst-born girls apPeared in the high exploration group significantly more often than later-borns. Given that the effecti of parental attitudeSon 6hild behaviOur are probablymediated through the parent's behaviour towards the child, the results of this study' seemdifficult-to reconcile with those of the studies described above. And it seems to beimpossible to come to any conclusions about these more distal antecedent's of exploretory behaviour. 2.2.2; Children's questiOns..If asking questions is a response to discrepancies between past and present experience,it should be possible to find relationships between patterns of questioning and such'developmental' variables as age, IntelligenCe and sex. Some evidence for such relationships is available,from the Berlyne-based studies described in the previous section,; butthe ability and disposition of a child to seek knowledgiin any situation should b_ eexpected to depend upon the complexity of the situation or relationship about whichknowledge-is sought and his capacity to appreciate this complexity.The classification of questions: Plaget and Isaacs. Piaget (1924, chap. 5) collected nearly1,000 spontaneous questions asked by a six year old boy over a ten month period,.mostly recorded in the course of afternoon walks with a nurse. The object of this wasto uncover the boy's transition from pre - causal to causal thinking. At first, only 'why'questions were reccirded; these were categorised in terms of What sort of informationwas requested, the principal categories being causal and final explanation, huthanmotivation, and justification, of customs and rules. In later sessions, other types ofquestions were also eCorded; these were Classified as questions of causal explanatiOn,reality and history, human actions and riles. Piaget'S scheme was applied to..the dataof 'a number of the early studies of individual differences in questioning described below.Unlike Piaget, N.Ilsaacs119301iimphasised the functional similarity of 'why'questions across agelevels. He suggested an alternativkclassificatory system for YOungchildren's Why's in teims of their motivational antecucents rather than their reference.Mention has already been made of tfife class of 'epistemic' whys, which were seen asaimed at reducing conflict and preventing its recurrence. Isaacs also distinguished'affective and expressional' (i.e.'apOarently not requiring an 'why' Clearly, the two schemes, approaching questionsfrom different viewpoints, are.not necessarily mutually incompatible- 37 Studies of spontaneous questions. Fahey (1942) has reviewed a number of early studies,usually involving fairly informal observations of a single child and concerned with the age ofinitial appearance of various interrogative forms. In general, they seem to indicate that'why' questions emerge later than other open forms, but as Fahey points out, manyquestions in early childhood are requests for goods and services rather than forinformation, and the results of thee studies are likely to reflect the order,in which thesedemands appear rather than cognitive maturational processes. Some of the studiesreviewed also traced age-changes in the proportion, of children's conversation devotedto questioning, or noted the age at which questions were most frequent; the overallindication is thatamount of questioning increases up to a maximum at about fouryears of age, after which it gradually declines. Summarizing these results, Stern (1924)distinguished two developmental phases; the first, commencing in the second year,`'was considered to be characterized by questions of name and.place, the second, lastingfrom the age of three to seven Years, by questions of time and cause.1Two larger-soale studies were carried out in the 1930's. In the first of these,Davis (1932) had mothers record fifty consecutive questions from three to twelveear olds. While very large- individual- differences- appeared the time taken to collectth questions ranged from thirty minutes to over fourteen hours 'age had no signifi-cant effect on tate of questioning, though the main length of questions did tend toincrea, asdid the frequency of questions about human actions and intentions, andquestiorequesting corroboration and approval. Boys asked questions ate faster ratethan didrls, while those-that the gicls did ask were longer at all ages. Boysasked moreopen. quests ns, more 'why' and moriquestions about definitions and causal relation-ships, while gi Is aske 1More about social relationships. Davis reported that eightyeightper.cent of au tions'seemed to stern from the immediate situation, eleverrper centfrom remote eve ts; she also concluded that while a novel. ccurrence seemed mot1\\- 1 likely to elicit a long series of'questions, any ordinary situation might serve as a /starting-point .;\\Smith (1933) do served children aged from one and a half to six twosituations; namely alone with adults and playing with peers. Her results tended toconfirm earlier findings: t e proportiOn of conversation occupied by questions wasgreatest at four years; 'wha and 'where' questions declined in frequency With age,While 'how', 'when' and 'Whyncreased steadily from year to year Also, the relativefrequency of closed questions increased. At two years, about a half were open, whileby five years only a' third were T ere were nol,,sr..1ifferencesjn questioningfrequency Overall, though girls ask nearly .vice as many as boys at two years. Asimilar differente at thiSsage level w ; reported by McCarthy (1930), and might IA:atiributabIA to earlier speech in girls (see Maccoby, 1967,p. 334-336)Significantly more questions my ask of adults than of other children, though thedifference tended to decrease with age. McCarthy alsb compared questioningfrequency among nursery-school children bf high and low socioeconomic status, andfound that the 54rcentages of conversation devoted to questions were fourteen andseven respectivfily:\\ -Elithed questions. A number of experiments have involved,subjects being presentedWith some materials and invited or instructed to ask questions about them. The incidence and types of questions asked have been measUred against subject variables; butin view of the wide variety of elicitation procedures Used, consistent resulti would not be expected. .Twoearlyinvestigations cited by Fahey, by. Mau 11912) and Finley (1921),were concerned with sex and age differences respectively. Mau USW nature study materialsto elicit questiOns from kindergarten and young schoof chilcht; and fOund that boysasked more thah girl's, nearly all questions being concerned with\\the names anti' activitiesof objects. Finley elicited more than 8,000 written questions fro( i children aged betweeneight and thirteen by showing them a 'mud-piippy' (a seciis of salamander) in theirclassroom& He &varied a decrease with age in the numbers of teleologioal.questionsasked, with a, corresponding' increase in the incidence of questiOns'about structure.Attempts at classifying the animal Were rare, especially among the youngest children.Finley also found that children'remembered best those points about which they hadasked most questions. .Berlyne (1970b) cites an experiment by Stirling (1937) in which preschoolchildren were exposed individually to a variety.of pictures and stories, about which theywere invited to ask questions:Older children aiked more questions, andrequestedinformation about a larger number of items; tfiey asked more abOut purpOSes, times and ..place& and, fewer about names and attributes of objects. The incidence of questions wasalio positively related to indices of intelligence and social crass. IYamamoto (1962) gave TOrrarice's (1962) 'Ask-and-guese test to subjects agedfrom five to seventeen, and also to a group of adults. The test involved showing subjects .pictures illustrating nursery rhymes, and instruaing them to think of as many questionsabout them as they could that were not answered in the pictures. It waslfound that thenumberof question's asked tended to increase with age, though sharp dips occurred atabout nine and twelve years:. Categorising the questlons according to the interrogative,word used, Yamamoto found that between five and eight years of ige;!why',accountedfOr sevehty per cent of allresponses; their relative frequency dropped sharply at nine,remaining stable thereafter at about thirty percent, still the largest single categor0tthe Same time, 'what' rosfrontless-than ten per cent to more than twenty, perent, .!how!, 'wher:_e_and !who'ihovved the same tendency, but to a lesser-a-tent. Closed ques-tions increased steadily with age. These results were interpreted as inchcating a transitionfrom 'global' through 'specific'to 'definitive' questioning: young children ask urispacifiedquestions in lieU of,,or in preparation fOr, making specific hypotheiesdi later, they testpartially-formed hypotheies by asking- specific questions, and finally, they try to confirmhypotheses by asking definitive questions. It was suggested.that the two dips that werefound reflect transitions. between stage& AlthOugh this: developinentel-hypothesisseemsto be a plausible one, Yaniainoto's results cannot be taken as reliable eYidence in supportof it, since the subjects were asking questiens as a task requirement rather than to reduceuncertainty. It is not surprising that their capacity to. ask 'deeper' questions increasedwith age; Mosher and Hornsby Chap. 3) have Shown; that older.o.and more intelligent children are better able than those younger and less intelligent toframe appropriate 'yes-no' questions to solve problems in a 'Twenty qUestione situation.'A study of. Aikaiva and Horiuchi (1962) was concerned with the topics of 'why'questions solicitedfrom 1,000 children aged between 'oven and fourteen. au ions abouthuman life increased in frequency with age, while questions about things, animals.plants decreased. The total nUmber.asked reached a peak at eleyen, after which it declined.Within, a single age-group, Ashton (1965) found that children who asked many 'questionsalso asked high proportions of closed relative to open questiOns,' and of questions with 39 w. ?conceptual rather than perceptual content. Questioning patterns were, hoWever,unrelatedto intelligence..To the went that the results of these studies are comparable, they'show a fairly'414 consistent picture with respect to developmental changes in questioning; the. findings ofSmith and Stirlingtre consonant with the idea of two 'questioning ages' in early child-hood, while those of Finley and Yamamoto lend some suPpOrt to the notion thatchildren become responiive to moracomPlex discrepancies as they beCome older.The tendenty for hoys to be more inquisitive than girls may stem from Sex-role develop .ment ratherthan from purely cognitive factors; in Yarnamoto'S study, where askingiluestions was merely Set as a problem for subjects to work at, no consistent sex differ-ences appeared. .. .Two studies by Torrance have. inaolvedattempts to enhance questioningperformance in structured situations-In one (1970a), groups of five year olds compris-ing four, sig -twelve or twenty four members were iiked to prOdUce as many questionsas they could in a 10-minute period in respcinse to 'Ask-and-guess' items. The twosmaller groups asked significantly more questions, more 'discrepant event' questions,and fewer repeated questions than the two larger .groups:. Later (197013),. six-Member_groups of six year olds were presented with various toys, .and instructed to ask a largenumber of oUestioni about them. Groups who were given an Opportunity to manipulatethe toys exceeded those for Whom the toys,were mery demonstrated in the rrimbers .of questions asked and also in the numbers of 'good' questions,i.e. whose answers were..not immediately obvious.Classroom questions.

Again, little consistency offesuits is to be expected, for in addition to all the uncontrolled variables that necessarily'<frobtain in.the classroom, the conditions under Which data were collected vary a great -deal from one study to another: in some cases, apparently spontaneoui inquiries wererecorded, while in others, the classroom situation was manipulated in such a way as toelisit or encciurage questioning. All the Investigations reviewed here were carried outireAmericari sthools.It appears that the proportion of pupils who ask questions in class is small. Faheyand,Corey 11941) had observers record all the questions asked by children in a numbei'of high school classes inthe course of a year A third of the sample asked leis than sixduring theyear, and many of these asked almoit none; four per cent of pupils accountedfor twentylive percent of the questions. More recently, Davis (1971) found that onlythirty eight per cent of fourth and sixth grade pupils asked 'questions in social studies'discussions; in a typicafclassroom, she reports, three accounted for half ofthe questions, While five accounted for more than three-quartersrSome of the studiet cited by. Fahey concerned individual differences in frequencyof questioning. PoINIck (1924) c011ected3;500queitions about general, science, andcompared those asked by high and low stream thirteen year olds; he reported that the'interest-van' of the former was seven per cent greater' that of-the latter,.while theinterest-span of girls was ten pc! cent greater than that of Gatto (1929) collectedover 4,000 questions asked by 400 children; half of these requested repetitions ofpreviously presented facts, twenty per cent requested new facts, and per cent implied 4.some causal reasoning.

Pupil variables bore no significant relatiowship to types of questions (in terms Of Piaget's categOries) or to their judged complexity:-More recently, Dorn (1967)\\ found that children in, two kindergarten, schoolsasked very few qUestions of their teachers, most of those that were asked being inquiriesequests for new information. Middltclai childrenwho evidenced a greater need for names of,about matters Of routine rather. thanasked more than working-class childreobjects.Pritchard .(1970) reported,high rrelations between in scores and the numberand quality of questions asked in sixth Grade social studies diicussions. 'Evaluative'-and'analytic' questions were most strongly correlated wit.zi intelligence, while the numbers' of-;'creative' questions' ere cuniilinearly related to it 23 CuriOsity as a Personality Trait It has. been widely assumed that curiosity can be conceptualised as an organismic variableor djsposition, having generality across situations.' (Livson,,1967;p. 73). Thus,,individuals may be described as being characteristically more or less 'curious'than others. 'Curiosity' may be used to, refer to behaviour directlY or to a motivator(disposition, i.e persons may differ with' respectio the frequency withwhich they mani-,festly exhibit various kinds of curiosity behavioursorthe suppoied level of some un-observable drive or desire to seek information :or knowledge. The distinction is'implicitin Ashton's definition of a more curious perion as one whose curiosity is more easifypMvoked and who seeks more information about the same stimuli.

The possibility <1f ageneral personality factor of and personality.correlates of measured curiositywill also_dikussed. 2.31 Behavioural measuresAshton's study was concerned with the as well as the eliditation. of curiosity.Her test was kdeve 'opnierit of one used earlier by Was (1959) and Alabi (1959), in whichchildren were presented With twenty Museum,objgots together, ith varying amounts ofinformation and 'asked to rate how much more information they'would like to have abouteach one Maas had found these scores were related to ratings of 'interest' in some ibpics.Ashton used-photographs of museum objects as stimuli, and four behavioural measures:,time spent looking at the photOgraphs, thenUmberNaf hypotheses offered about theidentity of the objects, the number of photographs about which -further inforrnatiOnwaSrequested, and the nunber'of questions asked about them. Scores among these were positively correlated, though in some cases only Moder tely so. In addition, children withhigh scores on the four measures tended to give more r atons of difference from, ratherthan similarity to, past experience for their choices i Ashtori's terms, they were'curious' rather than 'interested' and they made mOre\\coMparisons of both similarity.:and difference between pairs of pictures. It was hypothesisedhat a high level of curiosityWas related to good concept-fOrmation, narrow categorycwidth\\ and an analytical, asopposed to a global node of perceiving and thihking, in turn presumed to be dependentupon that cognitive style described by Witkin (1962) as dep endency'. Only 10 andlooking time were in fact associated. Ashton suggested that lookingend hypothesiiingreflected the ability to integrate new information; the primary process of information-seeking, as measured by the other two respohse measureS was considered to be independ-ent of intellectual capacity. The evidence with which Ashton supported her ideas aboutthe origins and nature of curiosity is too detailed and complex to be discussed here.While these,appear to merit further empirical study, the validity of her test as a measureof curiosity must be doubtful on account of the abience of relationships to external'criteria., 2.3.2 Teacher ratingtA number of the studies cited above have attempted to evaluate their behaviouralmeasures of children's curiosity by haVing teachers rateor ranktorder the children for thesame trait. Medinnus and Love 09654 Maas (1959) and Alabi .(1959) found no relation-ship between such ratings and other .:-Aablei; in Alabi's study, they were strongly relatedto IQ scores. On the other hand, Malleynolds eta! (1961) reported a correlation of 0.37with their exploration measure,and Day (1968) found that pupils ranked in the topquartile scored signifidantly higher on the specific curiosity test than those ranked in'thelower quartile:In a long series of studies, W.H. and E.W..Maw have made extensive use of,teacher-ratings, in conjunction with peer- and sometimes self-ratings, with.samplei of,children of about eleven years of ace. These, studies have involved etternpts to validatetests assumed to measure curiosity, and to discover whit other personal characteristicsare itlated to curiosity. Since the. Maws' is worthdeseribihg in son16'detail, Teachers are first presented with a glObal definition of'curiosity', derived from everyday and psycholdgical usage and dictionary definitionsAccording to this; a child manifests curiosity to the extent that he(1).reacts positively to new.Strange, ir4ngruoLisor mysteriouselements in his environment. by mO0,g towards them, byexploring them,. or by Manipulating th m;(2).'exhibits a need or desire to know more bout himself and hisenvironment;(3)scans his surroundings seeking new experiences;(4)persists in examining and exploring stimuli to know morethem.0 The teachers are told that themoryof these activities a child exhibits, the more curioushe is; they are instructed to rank-order the_thrildren in their class, tarting?with the'highest, then the lowest, then the second highest, and so on Maw 0968) reports areliability coefficient for teacher-ratings of 0.77. To obtain:peer-ratings, chi dren are presented with paragraphs, four describinghigh-curiosity and four low-curio ity characters, and they are asked to indicate whichchildren in their class wyuld be vest suited to' play each part: The scores assigned to eachchild is the weighted sum of the number of times he is listed. Maw and Maw (1964) reporta correlation of 0.64 between these scores and teacher-ratings.Pooled teacher- and pr-ratingi are associated with by sex (boys' tending to berated higher than girls) and I (r.=1).36); these variables have been controlled far by thefollowing proced re:(1).Children are divided into groups by sex.(2)Teacher- and peer-ratings of each sex group are correlated withintelligence/scores.(3)iRegression'eqUationsfOr ratings on If) are calculated for each group.(4)Groups of boys and girls whose scores fall at least one standard error 'above or below the regression line.; on both sets of ratings are selectedas the criterion groups.In tv7b validation studies reported by Maw and Maw, high curiosity, relative tolow curiosity children have been found to express greater interest in (though not greaterliking for) oiymmetrical rather than symmetrical patterns (1962a), and greater preferencefor various/types of investigatory activity 111 items(1965b). / 2.3.3 Self-rating scales7-Maw and Maw (1968) tested a self-report inventory based on their definition of curiosity. 1It listed/forty one items, and children were required to mark on a 4.point scale (never/sometimes/often/always) the extent to which tacii item reflected their own behaviour. Thescale had a split helf reliability of 0.91. High-curiosity criterion groups scored significantly\\ higher than low-curiosity groups, but also, boys scored consistently higher than'!losenshield (1968) carried out an extensive validation study of the test with ten andeleven/year old boys, comparing the performance of subjects scoring in the upper and\\lowerlquartiles on a number of behavioural measures In summary, his results indicated \\tht high-scorers, relative to low scorers(1)were more willing to expend energy in various activities,(2),/would spend more time in trying to solve problems;(3)/showed a greater preference for complex shapes;.(4).did not offer more ideas concerning the nature of an un_object;1clid not-ask more questions about various topks;/(6)did not show more readiness to give up a preferred object for anunknown one, but did indicate more willingness to part with avalued possession in order to acquire various items about whichsmile information was provided;(7)expressed a greater desire to learn about things with which theywere unfamiliar.It is noteworthy that two of the measures which failed to produce significant differences((4) nd (5)) were among Ashton's criteria of curiosity.Penney and McCann (1964) devised a 'reactive curiosity' (AC) scale for use withchit ren aged from nine to twelve. Following Berlyne, reactive curiosity is defined as a 43I tendency to approach and explore relatively new stimulus-situations and incongruous orcomplex stimuli, and to vary stimidationinthe presence of frequently experiencedstimulation. The scale consisted initially of ninety 'true or false' statements, together Witha ten-item lierrejkale; arevised version comprised the forty items which pper and lower quartiles. Two-week test-tetest reliabilities ranging froin0:65 to 0.78 were found for various subgroups in a sample of nine and eleven year olds.Scores were not significantly affected by, age or intelligence, but conaary to the Maws'findings, girls scoredsignificantly higher than boys. On the assumption that curiosity is-related logically and emPiricaliv to,originality of thinking, the authors tested the scale'sValidity against scores on the Unusual Uses Test (Torrance, 1962), which requires subjectsto write down as many uses aspossible for a number of everyday objects. For the,olderchildren, RC scores correlated 0.32 with numbers of appropriate responses given on theUUT, and 0.44 wth originality of responses. NO such correlation appeared for the youngergroup; this the authors attribute to writing difficulty: Paters and Penney,(1966) report afurther validation study in which high and low RC groups were instructed to draw a linedown the alley and into either arm of a pictOrial maze. The high group were found toalternate arms significantly more often than the low group..Penney and Reinehr (1966) have alio developed.a wascalled and consisted of 100 'trueor false' items hased on the same definition as the RC scale. It had One-month test-retestreliabilities of 0.84 for males and 0.87 for females. Scores were unaffected by sex, butwere moderately correlated with 101for males. High scorers were found to be moresensitive to the-autokinetic effect; and the test correlated with both fluency andoriginality scores on 41e UUT (r = 0.47 and 0.27 respectively). In addition, Penney andReinehr report a study in which subjects were left individually for fifteen minutes in aroom containing objects rated ailoW, medium or high in their curiosity-arOusing potential.SVSS scores correlated 0.59 with time spent inspecting low-rated objects, '70.55 withinspection-latency, and +0.59 with total exploration ti .Pearson (1970) suggested that 'novelty-seeking', ich the Penney scales purportto measure, is not a unitary dimension. Accordingly, she de iseci four scales, each con-sitting of twenty 'like-dislike' items, designed to measure diff eat aspects of the trait..These were described as(a)Laernal sensation: a tendency. to like active physi I participMonin 'thrilling' activities;(b)Internal sensation: a tendency to like the experience of u usualdreams, fantasies or feelings;(c)External cognition: a tendency to like finding out facts, how t mriswork, and learning how to do new things;:Internal cognition: a tendency to like unusual cognitive phenomena,which are locutted on explanatory principles and cognitive schemeS.Pearson also constructed a ten-item 'desire for novelty' scale, which related to 'the'wishfcie,new experience and acknowledgement of the boring nature of the status quo'.Rehabilities for the five scales ranged between 0.76 and 0.87. The EC scale correlated 0.36with the IS scale and 0.50 with the. IC scale; otherwise, no significant interrelationshipsappeared. WIC,: these findings cast some dOubt on the general validity of global measuressuch as Penney's, it should bei,noted that of Pearson's scales, only EC and IC appear to:.relate to curiosity as defined for example, by Maw and Maw, and these were positivelycorrelated with each other. 2.3.4 Relationships among measures of curiosity ,The eVidence reviewed above lends little support to the commonly held notion thatcuriosity can be characterised as a unitary dimension of Personality.-This negative con-clusion is borne out by the results -of a detailed study by Langevin (19711-in which a widevariety of curiosity measures were compared. Langevin developed a set of materials relatingto forty experiences: which had been selected out of a pool of 155 by a sample of elevenyear olds as dime which they would most wish to have. The original pool of items wasselected so as to represent as far as possible each sense modality and each area of academicstudy. To these forty, the seven least selected experiences were added to provide a checXon validity. A list of these forty seven experiences was presented to a new sample of elevenyear olds, who were instructed to rate their desire for eachpne on a three point scale (verymuch/somewhat/not at all). NeXt, each subject was given an, opportunity individually toihvestigate and ask questions about the five items rated highest by him, plus three itemsselected at random, which were added to provide unbiased norms.Thus, the test yielded three scores for eachsubject, 'experiential curiosity' (EC),ekploration-time and number of questions. six-week test-retest reliability of0.57, exploration -time and of 0.62 and 0.67respectively. Langevin tested for correlations among scores on these three measures, scoreson four previously used,Curiosity measures, and scores on, two intelligence tests. The othertests used were: : .(1)Specific curiosity scale (D\"ay, 1968b);(2)Reactive curiosity scale (Penney and McCann, 1964);(3)Teacher-ratings of curiosity, following the Maws' (1961) procedure;(4)Test of specific curiosity (Day, 1968a;(5)Otis Mental Aptitude Test;(6)Raven's MatricesThe main results obtained were as follows: EC correlated with the Day and Penney scales(r = 0:35; 0.39); the two behavioural measures, exploration-time and of questions,faiied to correlate with any of the pencil-andrpaper measures, a slightly eachother whichwere more strongly associated 'with intelligence test scares t with any of the curiositymeasures (r = 0.35 with Otis, 0.32 with Ravens, 0.20 with ihhDay scale; TSC correlatedonly with the Penney scale, which was itself quite highly co elated with: the Day scale(.521,this being attributable at least in part to a considerabl item-overlap; apart from beingassociated with EC, the two inventories. were also correlat, with Otis scores (0.31; 0.221..Other findings of interest were that older children explor longer and asked more questions, , ,and that gig Is expressed a broader range of interests in the 5C-test, but asked fewerquestiont than boys.Factor analysis of the correlations yielded two weak curiosity factors, labelled'Breadth of interest curiosity' with it's highest loadings on he Day and Penney scales andEC, and 'Depth of interest curiosity', with highest loadings on exploration-time and numberof questions: Teacher-ratings loaded highest on an Intelligence factor. TWO main points ofinterest emerge fromthese results. The first is the marked discrepancy betweenthebehavioural and, the self-report measures. Although self-report measures have been validatedagainst behavioural criteria whenextreme-scoring grdups have been compared, their abilityto predict behaviour reliably appears to be extremely limited. SeCondly, the results confirmthat teachers are strongly influenced by the 'intelligence' of their pupils when assessing their curiosity. This is hardly surprising; brighter children ,;could be better equipped toexpress interest in the school curriculum, and studies of classroom questioning generallysuggest that they do. It does not seem justifiable to conclude; as Langevin does, that,teachers.misidentify the brighter child as the curious.One' 369), since there is no firmevidence that the 'curious' child exists.Although a general factor of 'curiosity may exist, the overriding impression gainedfrom this study and the others reviewed here is that the psychometric apprOach tocuriosity has not proved to be a very fruitful one. It may not be too extreme to say thatthe statement 'A is more curious than B' is meaningless unless one specifies what he ismore curious about. 2.3.5 Correlates of measured curiosity.., Bearing in mind the qualifications mentioned above, and that the various measuresdescribed at best measure different aspects of curiosity, the present section reviewsinvestigations aimed at finding personality correlates and ..clevelopmental antecedentsof individual differences in curiosity. These are discussed under the three headings ofcreativity, personal and social adjustment, and parental attitudes.CreatiVity. Recent years have seen a rapid growth of interest in 'creative ability' con-ceived of as a trait distinct from general intelligence, and in the practical desirability offostering creativity as an educational objective (for a general review, see Butcher, 1968,chap. 4). At the same time, numerous instruments have been developed which have beendesigned to: measure such traits (Golann,1963; Arasteild968). AlthoUgh thesetbilities do not appear to form a unitary dimenSion,or to be altogether indepihdent of the abilities measured by intelligence tests (Ausubeland Robinson, 1969, chap. 17), it has been suggested (e.g. by Day, 1968b) that one Ofthe pre-conditions for creativity is a high level of curiosity. Indeed, Torrance's Ask-and-guess test, designed as a test of 'creative thinking' (Torrance, 1962), includes a question-asking task, and is rather similar to Ashton's curiosity test. However, it has already beennoted that Pielstick and Woodruff (1968) found it to: be unrelated to measures ofexploration.It seems quite feasible to suppose that individuals who are disposed to seek novelexperiences Should be better able to produce novel outputs, and a study by Houston andMednick (19621 lends some support to the notion. They distinguished high and lowgroups in terms.of scores on the Remote Associates Test, in which subjects are presentedwith three apparently unrelated words, and required to fi one further word linking themall together. The two groups were presented with a series of lord -pairs each consisting ofa noun and a non-noun, and asked to choose the word they preferred. The choice of a'noun was follqwed by the presentation of a word which was an uncommon association tothat noun, While non-noun chokes produced common associatib\\ns.:The proportion ofnoun choices significantly increased over the series for the high group, while the low'group significantly increased in their frequency of non-noun choices.The Barron-Welsh Art Scale has been used widely as a measure of creativity;preference for more compleX and asymmetrical figures has been found to predict originalachievement in arts and sciences (Barron, 1963), and Golann(1962) found that highscorers also scored high on a questionnaire test of 'creativity motivation'. Eisenman(1969) found correlations of 0.27 and 0.38 scores and fluency andoriginality scores on the UUT, which Penney and McCann found to be related to reactive ..curiosity. There is no firm evidence that complexity preterence is related to exploratorybehaviour (Day, 1966b), but Day (1968a), in two studies found it to be slightly correlated(r = 0.22; 0.14) with interest -in- complexity scores on the TSC.Weintraub (1968) selected a:sample of twelve ten:year oldboys, six at each extremeof the curiosity scale in terms of the Maw end McReynolds criteria. He reports that thehigh curiosity boys were 'consistently judged more creative and flexible in their thinkingby both teachers and parent& Maw and Maw (1965a) found high curiosity children toscore higher than loW curiosity children on the UUT and on originality of word associa-tions. In a later factorial study employing a word association test and a battery of person-ality inventories (1970b), they found positive' loadings for high curiosity boys on'restrained' and !impulsive' creativity factors; low curiosity boys showed negative loadings.on these, but showeda weak positive loading on a 'concrete' creativity factor.. However, inview. f the limitatiOns of both curiosity and creativity criteria, such conclutions'must bet eated with caution.Personal and social adjustment To add to the confliCting evideiice relating to explorato ybehaviour and anxiety, Penney (1965) reportithat high ReactiVe Curiosity scores wereassociated with low scores on the Children's'Manifest Anxiety scale, while Penney andReinehr found no such relationship between the adUlt versions of the two scales. Wei traiibfound that high curiosity boys, although rated as.less anxious by parents and teacher ,didnot obtain lower score on the C AS.The, high curiosity boys in Weintraub's study were alib judged by parents, t chersand peers to be more socially skill ,and to, exert more leadership than low curiosi y boys,a finding corroborated by Maw and MaW (1965a), who used a variety Of pencil;an -papertests to measure various aspects of personal and social adjustment. The California est ofPersonality; the Behaviour Preference RecOrd, the Chldren\".s.Personality Questio naireand the.Institute of Child Study Security Test were used to yield several scores each; tomeasure one variable each the authors used the Cassell Group Level of Aspiration Test; a;social attitude scale, a social distance scale, a descriptive word test to measure morality,the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, the General Anxiety Scale fOr Children, theChildren's Anti-DeMocratic:Scale, and an intolerance of ambiguqylest.Overall,high-curiosity children tended to score higher on-these Measures, butdifferenCes were not always consistent across the sexes, with high - curiosity boys differingin many ways from their female counterparts. The Maws summarize the curiosity= groupdifferences as folloWs: high curiosity children (both boys and girls) have a higher level ofself-accept., ice, seem to be:More self-sufficient, tend to feel mOresecure, to be more.. ,dependable and honestend to shOW a higher level of group loyalty, exhibit a healthier .participation in group activities, show a higher level of social skill auerasoonsibility forgroup welfare, and shoW better overall social adjustment; highcuriositi k,'giils.have ahigher leVel of aspiration and show a higher degree of responsibility; high-curiosity boysshow a higher leVel of.emOtional maturity, are more free froth social Prejudice, feel thattheir discipline. is more fair, and are better in their overall adjustment./ -In a later study (1970a), Maw and high-Curio:ratty boySscoredhigher.than low-curioSity boys a number Of measures of self-esteeM. This finding wasinterpreted in terms of the hypothesis that children high in curiosity are those who haveachieved 'comoetence'/(White, 1959), through successful interaction with their envirim-ment,.and have developed good self-concepti as a result. HOwever, it.is imposlible toconcludefrom such correlational studies whether satisfactory adjustment is a by-product of successful cognitivC activity, or on the other hand whether poor such activity. Parental AttitiidesResearch. to the mothers and fathers of200 children fer whOi4h.cdrisi4Yratings were available. The fathers of high-Curiosity boys scored significantly 'thanthose high-and low-curiosity girls. In summary, the authors canciiidethat the parents of high-curiosity boys are more likely-to reward and enCOUrage curiosity,to be more accepting of their children's behaviour, and to be more deMocratiC in theirrearing practices. It seems quite likely that these differences could bemediked by thesuperior adjustment shown by high-curiosity boys. 2.3,6 Evaluation and Conclusions (W.P Robinson) .6u t why has the psychometric approach to curiosity failed?

We can continue-to expect that som sets of persons will be chronicallyexposed to factors that will lead them to be comparatively ignorant or uncurious aboutcertain topics, especially if we have some theoretical grounds for derivingthese ideas.That we may have some is suggested in, section 2.4. 2.4 Imniediate Implications for TeaChing view Of the relationship that has been demonstrated between curiosity and learningperformance, the possibility suggests itself of promoting and exploiting curiosity in order- to enhance learning in the schOol. In this brief section, three 1:oad types of.approachthis problem are discussed; these are suggested by the.three colnceptionsTO curiosity .motivational; behavioural organismic --- which have delineated above: They can\\ be described briefly as follows:(1)SUbject-thattercan be taughtin such a way as to arouse perceptual andconceptual conflict, and this can be utiliied on an incentive for learning;(2)Children can be trained in question-asking as a skill, .SO that their,knowledge-seeking proficiency is .icreased;(3)Measures can be taken to raise cflildren'Sgeneral curiosity-level, or theycan be taught in a manner appropriate to their existing level.CurioSity as an incentive. Educationalists have commonly supposed, that children arenaturally disposed to learn for its own sake, but thatfor some reason, this motivation isdissipated in the course of, schooling. Such a view is expressed very forcibly by Holt (1964).:'To a very great degree, school is a place where children learn to be stupid .Children come to school curious; within a few years most of this curiosity is'dead; or at least silent. Open a first or third grade to qUestions, and you willbe delUged; fifth graders say. nothing Curiosity, queStions, Speculationi these are outside school; not inside.' (p. 156)Responses of junior and secondary school curiosity' .that children's interests become.more specificilfy channelled sChoolYears; i.e. whereas young children tend to be.curious about anything which is unfamiliar,older'ehildren tend to' be interested only.in a narrow range of subjects. Ausubel (1968,. chap: 10) cites evidenee from Jersild and Tasch suggesting stems from theemphasisplaced in.schools upon extrinsic \"incentives. for ..1 learning, such as obtaining high marks and qualifications, anxiety-reduction and competition,asI well as short-term rewardt and punishments. The feasibility of this hyp thesis is borneout by an experiment by Dett (1970), who. found that students' interest performingintrinsically interesting tasks, solving mechanical puzzles and writing head) nes for collegeI letVtil )aliers, tell off after they had been prOvided with monetary rewards f r doing them.n is worth noting, by contrast, however, that Skinner, 41969) recommends he systematicapplication of positive reinforcement schedules topromote classroom learnisome success for the use of token motivation' subsumes three comport' ents, namely,'cognilive drive', or the to know for the sake of knowing, 'ego-enhanceMent drive',or the desire to gain status and self-esteem through superior achievement; and 'affiliative . 49 drive', or the desire 'extrinsic' epistemic curiosity: knowledge maybesought as an end in itself, or for the sake of some extraneous reward that it brings.'Intrinsic epistemic curiosity' appears to be equivalent to 'cognitive drive', which Ausubel,while not denying a role to extrinsic incentives, suggests is 'potentially. the importantkind of motivation in Meaningful learning' (p. 367), since such learningprovides its ownreward (see sec. 2.6). .Although cognitive drive is.seen mainly as a by-product of successful learning,Ausubel and Robint.ori (op. cit., chap. 12) Make sometentathie suggestions as tohowteachers Might utilise discrepancies and apparent contradiction in curriculum content togenerate.conflict and thus arouse pupils attention and interest. Berlyne (1965b) has alsodiscussed the possibility of capitalising upon irrthe classroom; parti-'milady in relation to 'discovery learning', which he sees as'consisting essentially of twophases in which Motivating conflict is first induced, and then relieVedby means of theresponse patterns that are to be learned: As an example, Berlyne cites Suchman's (1961)'Inquiry Training' procedure. Thisstarts-with a short film demonstrating a novel orphysical.. phenomenon; for instance,- a brass ball that is just small enough toslip through a ring sits on the ring after being heated. Pupils are then invited to ascertainthe cause of the phenomenon by putting 'yes-no' questions to the teacher, and tc lrmu-late hypotheses and .meansof testing them. In a validation study, a group of childrenexposedtO this method fora fifteen week period were significantly superior toe controloup in the number of appropriate questions asked.in a test situation. However, Ausubel(chap. 14)pointsout that Inquiry Training.has not been. shoWri to produce a superiorgraSp of the concepts involved, and he questions generally the supposed superiority of.such !guided discovery' methods over expository teaching in .generating and exploitingIntrinsic motivatiOn (see also.chap. 9 ibid:). .Relevance and curiosity. In general .terms; the role of reinforcement, be it reward, punish-ment or Conflict-reduction, into make.the learning of new responses or information.Northwhile for the learner. It seems reasonable to assume that, even in the absenCe ofdirect externarincentives,':children will be most likely to want knowledge Which is per-ceive0 as worth having,, or somehow relevant to themselves. Among a sample of Arrierica !col lege.stlidents surveyed by Young (1932), the reason most often mentioned fOr loss of .intervst in high school studies was. theinabilitY to see any need for the subjects studied.Although the stimulation orsuch a need would appear potentially tohave 'con-.sio:!rabie incentive value, this area has received little experimental attention. The onlystudy whiCh has attempted to Manipulate intrinsic relevance of course material is:one byHovey, Gruber and Terrell .(1963)., in whichtwo university classes in educationalpsychology were subjected to two different teaching methods: one class was taughtexclusively by lectures (three per week), while a 'self-directed study' (SDS) teChnique,invoNing small group discuSsion and only one lecture per week,,was applied to the other.I t Was assumed that this latter conditiOn was likely to enhancestUdents' active:involvementin.coUrse materialsanand thereby their attitudes towards them. A pencil-and-paper 'curiPsitytest' given ten months after the start of.the course comprised three groups of five items,relating to 'question-raiiing behaviour'; 'interest in educational psychology% and'desireto get more information about educatiOnal psychology'. The SDS class was found to be,slightly superior on all five items in the first group,.and.on four out of five items in eachof the second and third grOups. Atthetame time,..the two classes did not difter significantly in their retention of course material: How far these results can be generalised is open todoubt, however, especially since they could easily be attributable to a 'Hawthorne effect',i.e., the SDS group may merely have been responding to their awareness of participatingin an experiment and receiving a 'special' treatment..Training in question asking. Results reviewed in the previous section indicate that studiesof questioning bypupils in the classroiim is limited both in extent and-depth, andTOrrance (19704-arnong-others,:has suggdted-that it tends to be diScouraged by teachers.Oh the assumpticirls that asking appropriate questions facilitates learning and is itself alearnable skill, a number of attempts have been made to trainchildren in questioning,independently of any assumptions as to what input variables might affect itOne such attempt, cited by Fahey,.was by Helseth 0926), who encouraged a .small group of twelve and thirteen year oldS to ask questions with a view to improvingtheir thinking in Amerin history classes. This grbup, it. was reported, as a result askedmore and betterqueStins, participated mare fully in clasSdiscussion, and exceeded normson standardized tests.ore recently, Pritchard (1970)-encouraged questioning in socialstudies classes, and frid that pupils who aiked most tended to make the greatest gainsin class position over he training period. This effect was more rnarkx1 for less intelligentchildren.. .Blank and Covington (1965) describe their training procedure more explicitly.Three groups of eleven year olds were presented with verbal descriptions of situations in-which someone has to make a choice between alternative courses of action. An experiMental .group underwent an auto-instructional programme aimed at training them to tell when aquestion cannot be completely answered without-aUditional information, and to seektheadditional items by formulating suitable question& A second group received an abbreviated.form of the programme in which they were simply told that certain kinds of informationWere needed, while a control group received no Programmed material at all. All Subjects weregiven pre- and post-tests consisting of both oral and written.Problerns. These showed asignificant rise in the number of questions asked only for the experimental who alsoscored higher than theothers on a scienceachievement test, and were rated by'teachers assuperior in class discussions about science. Similar proCedures have been described byScOvel (1969)who succeeded in improving questioning performance, but doe&not report \\\\Iwhether. their subjects learned better as a,result: It might be noted that Suchman's 'Inquiry.training' did not appear to achieve this latter result'..It is also important to point.out that the in retention found by Blankand Covingtonand Helseth was non-specifiC; i.a, there was no direCt carrelation.betweenthe content of the material.that was learned and the questions that wereasked. This may becontrasted with Finley's 'mud-puppy' experiment, in which the prints that pupils recalledbest were, Those about which they had asked questions. Again, any en.1haim ...:.nent of perform-,lance. followingan intervention programme may be the result. of. Hawthorne effeets rather :than of the. programme itself...Measured curiosity and school achievement Two studies. by MaW and Maw appear to havepossible educational relevance. The first of these (1962b) was concerned With readingc`omprehension: two samples, of.high-curiasity children were significantly better thantheir low- curiosity. Counterparts at spotting verbal absurdities which occurred ambngawrit S of twentytwo sentences. In the second (1963),. two high groups scored higher on atest of gin eral knowledge consisting of items taken from children's encyclopaedias. In .Weintraub's study, high-cUiiOsity.boys were judged by teachers. O be'higher in achievement an.1 achievement motivation, and to have better study habit\u00a7 than low curiosity boys,Ahile parents and teachers indicated that they preferred non-fiction books and read.L' Ater.The Maws have stressed the need for schools to attempt to enhance thei pupils'.\\ curiosity level (1962b; 1970a), and to maximise teaching efficiency by taking curiositylevel into account (.1962a; 1970b). They have made, no explicit suggestions, howeer, asto how these aims may be achieved. Ari opposing vieiiv.is taken by Friedlander (196),who argues that curiosity may operate only marginally as an incentive for Classroomlearning. As reasons for this assertion he suggests that (1) curiosity is often unsystematicand noncumulative; (2) it may be very immediately and easily satisfied; (3) it may besatisfied by partial or incomplete information; (4) it may not relate to the school curri-culum; (5) individual differences in its content and amount would make it difficult toharness for teaching purpose& Ausubel (chap. 18) eXpresses similar doubts about thefeasibility of attempting to exploifchildren's' 'free-floating' curiosity in the .classroorn... .'Even if a general factor of cuiosity could be identified, it probably wouldhave little psychological significance, since it is the level of curiosity inparticular subStantive areas that affects thiproductivity or creativity ofan individual's work.' (p.' 559)2.5 Some Limitations of the Material Reviewed (W.P. Robinson) The majority of the studies mentioned have involved experimental manipulationi withinthe confines of the laboratory. This is a statement of limitation not an adVerse criticism.Two small points may be speedily noted and passed over; a third and larger,one willdemand more attention. Within laboratOries we like to have simplicity, and so the experi-ments have rnost often been concerned with subjects looking at diagrams of four-leggedchicken rather than.seekirig universe; theemphasis has bee on the paredAown perceptual rather than on thecomplicated con::ceptual and Confined to visual material within the perceptual domain. Additionally,attempts have been made to discount individual differences in previous experience by 1.defining the value of factors intended to induce subjective uncertainty within the 9Onfin0of the experiments, e.g: expoiing a shape for thirty trials means it is less novel than oneexposed for ten trials. The imposition of these constraints will tend to allow the cynicaloutsider to view tne work as trivial and icreleVant. ThiS would involve a mistake. Life maybe more complicated outside than inside a laboratory, but the same laws and principles ofbehaviOur apply; they are not suddenly suspended or reversed as soon as a subject winto a room with the label 'lab' on it.-'-'1And when the con f/icts are not happily resolved? In the light of the-evidence presentedwe would have to concede that. Berlyne's story aboUt the operation of curiosity doescortespond tO what we currently know andis abetter account than any other so faroffered. However, there is: another constraint of more 'serious )Ievance. Presumably whenthe subjects. have been human, ethical considerations have dictated a bias towards attemptsto arouse curiosity and satisfy it, this has been socially accePtable: But what about theinductiOn of boredom and the punishment of behaviour...associated with' curiosity. These'problems are treated but scantily and hence the Picture prejented it only one half jof a:7 -portrait; :vcrehtearned-sernewhat about Dr. Jekyll, but where is Mr. Hyde? Whet'happens when conflicts are not resolved by the.oeherationbr gift of an answer? Does thearousal dissipateor leak,away until some other internal. or external stimulibecome strong 52 enough to command 'attention and does the absen::e of/the positive reinforcement of ananswer decrease the organisini's'search-and-solve oehaviours? This we do not know;More important still it might be thought, would be the provision of externalpunishment both for Wrong and right answers. That children or adults !hould be punished \\for resolving conflicts' with right answers may at first sight seem strange, but consider thefollowing questions:..'Are; you bein nasty to me just because you are in a bad m:nd?' ,'What happen if I. stick this pin into my baby brother?''Why is it all r ght forh/Ou to swear and not forme?''Why don't Archbishopi giVe away all they have to the poor?''WoUldl really be arrested ifI stole from Woolworth's?'There is a Wholejange ofquestions &tour both' the physical world and the social orderwhere people might fi d answers that satisfied, but either the means of obtaining these orthe answers themselvwould evoke a punitive response. And in the long run we mightexpect punishments to have a decremental effect n the,curiosity state and behaviOur. ,\\The second category would be conceptu I conflicts in which the failure to resolvethe conflict is directly Punished: In some sense, this mu t apply to all test item or question-ing experiences which excite a subjects curioity, but fo which his inability to answer ismet with,di approval of significant others O/ other forms of punishment. It is not clearjust how repetitions of this sequence wou/ld affect the subject. One interpretation wouldsuggest that anxiety would becomwconditioned to the behaviour state and all othercontiguous variables (classrooms1 teachers and school?), and move back in time so thateven the*possibility of questions being asked wouldserve to re-evoke it. Its evocationtshould diminish the cha ces of obtaining a satisfactory answer4See Eysenck, 1957) and itsvictim loop!) ofanxious incornpetence. Another interpretaA n would be that the early stages of the story I are the same as those just mentioned, /but that defences against chronic anxiety will belbrought into action.Withoutsuggesg how_such a situation might come about, we could\\ conceive of the child developing an our Plating for such situations, a shield preventingthe full operation of thedistressing stimuli, behind which he can be relaxed and unrespon-sive:a.7,,,Regardless of whether each, both or.some.other explanatio r are appropriate forthe interpretation of failures at conOct resolutions and punisi4rentS or either successorfaire., it is clear that more attention needs to be paid to thissside of a, irs. Halt (1964)has argued that children become 'bored' becaUse we encourage them to:,a stupidly(p. 169): i'We adults destroy most of the intellectual and creative capacity of childrenby the things we do to them make-them do. We destroy this capacityabove all by making them afr \\id, afraid of not doing what other peoplewant, of not pleasing, of making mistakes, of failing, of being wrong.'(op. cit, p. 167) ..',1 IThat we cannot state with supportive evidence what the long term effects of theseex1 periences are may mean that the wOreboredoM' is currently used to;coyei)diverse Mood2:. 1 For Berlyne and/OynonotanoUS pattern of-\\ I,1 hi!lhly,predictable external stimulation which alloWs a state of high internal-arousal to \\ ,Il I\\ develop.

However, we also refer, to such a sequence of 1.events by saying that 'He fellasleep because he was bored'. Ought we to refer to both. !these stcates by the same term? The confusion seems to.have arisen because of theemphasis. upon the similarity of the conducive stimuli rather than on differencetinyespontes by 'the-person. Let us' compare three situations all involving monotonous .stimulation. In the first situation, the becoming bored person gets out of the situationto do.sOmething interesting, in the seconlisitUation he rejects this.

To make some assessmint of hoW'theseinteract WeShall have to widen the Scope of .our enqUiry, to. setiintrinsitmotivation' in in more general analysii of child development..:But before this can be done it Maybe useful to consider bri, ly the relatiOnthipbetween curiosity and questions. The issues are posed in threeligUr (Fig: 2.1, Mendcuriosity Table 2.1). Figure 2.1 is intended to provides summary of Berlyne's analysis of curiosityq arid queitions.-While yve would claim that Figure Z2 and Table 2.1 are an impraVament\\ - an--Berlyne's coritributiOn, itis right to stress that they cot.ild not have been producedwithout.Berlyne's theoretical and emPirical contribution as the fOundation, and we wouldhope that.they aresierfai attempts to complete rather than reorganise.'\\The omissions !n Berlyne's piCture are highlighted in the figure: No co ectionsbetWeen perceptual and Conceptual conflict are given, nor connections betwee eitherof the.and boredom. We haVe already mentioned the omission of comments aboutunresoiYed conflict& Although qUestions are cited as inducers of conceptual onflici(Berl yri1960, p..289) no other factors arecited as playing the same role, and there isno'attemot at distinguishing either betWeen questions as determinants and q estions assymptoms of curiosity or between questiOns which are related to curiosity d those whiChare not Several of these points. may be seen as not a typical of models bas onSRanalyses: sovhow the environment generates stimuli to which the organis responds;.While responses are left hanging.in the air.;Figure 2:2 attempts to make good' these Omissions. All actions of e persont aredrawn as feedinOack stimuli to the organism for the '0 tside Eyents'and 'Intervention by Other People' are employed to show that the perso is not purely an.,agent and Self-arganizirg.system, but is object andrvictim as welLWe hay included:events'such as rumbling tummies, Parched throes and rampant adrenaline as fo ms of internallygenerated distracting stinuli, while alk:wing outside intervention a simil r role:. The .1. assimilableunderstandingcoping action sequence handles the.non-problematic, theeventual consequences of resolving conceptual conflicts, and stimuli that might be thrownup during diversive exploration. We have abandoned the distinction-between perceptualand conceptual conflict Berlyne was right.to emphasise the perceptual sequence for twore-aims. In the first place much of his validating experimentation has relied on visually .preserited materials so that variations in the collative properties of stimuli could be- .clearly controlled and measured. Secondly, it may well be misleading to describe theactivities of infants as involving 'conceptual conflict'. Howexer, with more maturesubjecti, we might prefer to say that perceptual conflict can only arise out of conceptualconflicts. Pictures of four- legged chicken evoke attention becaute the concepts ofchicken, and four-leggedn'ess do\u00b0 not have an immediately assimilable intersect. We escape`the issue by using 'uncertainty' as a su itilte for all conflicts. Although, we Wave not\u00b0read what, if anything, philosophers ve to say about 'curiosity', we suspect that every-day usage would enter it as a class of uncertainty', -- not alt uncertainty is a sign Of,curiosity, but all curiosity implies u rblinty. Itmay be the case that where uncertaintyis induced by the environment and here decisions and actions are required by the environ-meht and other persons, 'curiosity' is not the normal word to use Is it only when oneis not under duresso find out, but neverthelett-wants to do so that 'curiosity' is theappropriate word to use/ This would mean that a state of uncertainty is only one of4 ',curiosity' whenthe person actively wants/to eliminate uncertainty becaiise he wants toThis does not imply that it is a residual*category to be employed solely when no otherreasons for wanting to find out, can be disc:ovsred. Quite the reverse perhaps! We willwant to find put except when other, forces act to,rrevent us Such a position would beconsistent with the cognitive deielopmental approach. While such an analysis is a cari-cature of what is really required, it suffices tei Lcate curiosity as a class of uncertainty.The epistemic behaviours areBerlyne's. Reasoning appears half in the.person aihalf out because, although we re able to devise situations in which we can 'observe theproducts of thinking, We do t always do so and might not be able to do in the facean uncooperative, unwilling,- incapable thinker. 'Observation' is intended to rangefrom Berlyne's simple, inspection through to the elaborate experimentation of professional.scientists. ... iI Overt poting of questions can occur in any of the lypet of ep;itemic behaviour.Questionscan be covertly posed in Reasoning and Observation( We must therefore reOlisethat in any. situation where we observe questions, those overtly elitited mayOnly be ,.tub-set of the questions that the perton in fact has. We must also distinguish betweenquestions the person asks because he is curious and those which are posed to him. InChapter 9 Prossiir elaborates.this distinction, and is particularly concerned to isolatethe differential consequences for learning of questions provided by other persons andi..t- , CluestiOns generated by theiubjeCt himself./ 7 .On this. nalysis, the expresan of a question.is not a necessary Consequence of..his being curious:; Questions are but opeiaossible symptom of curiosity and one means ofattempting to satisfy it. v;- --The list of. theinctioris and determinants Of questions in Table 2.1 may be.unsophisticated, but isuffices to. make the point that the occurrence of a question doesnot enableus to infer that a state of curiosity exists.

Robinson) It is fitting that the last four sections should have been permeated with both thetheoretical and empirical contributions of Berlyne. While he has persistently pointed tothe power of intrinsic motivation as a mainspring Mr the acqulsition of knowledgeand he has argued for+the value of perceptual and conceptual conflict as the source oflearning new structures of thinking, he has consistently expressed his ideas in the 5-Rterminology preferred by neo-behaviourists (Berlyne, 1960;1965). His work hasbeen eclectic, in the better sense of that Word.What follows is consistent with Berlyne's implicit preference for looking at allthe facts rather than selected samples The basic premiss is that optimally efficientteaching annot be based on false theories about the characteristics of the learner. Every-.one can se that it is stupid to feed hay to a car to nourish it or to shout instructionsat it in order to make itmove To control or instruct a piece of machinery successfully, 2.you rely upon rule-of-thumb, techniques justified by previous empirical success or uponsome accurate knowledge of how the system works. The structural and functionalcharacteristics atthe machine define and delimit what is possible. And so it must bewith children. The limitations of their capacities and dispositions define their possibilities.It is of no-avail tilhave explicit educational objectives, a clear speCification of possiblemeans of achisiing these along with an impressive array of material and human resources,if the means do not fit in with the characteristics of the learner.What are these Characteristics? The crudest dichotomy currently aivailable 'empty and the 'fully programmed versions' of human nature:A caricature of these views might contrast the following emphases. The 'empty, black,box' view stresses the significance of experience for shaping behaviour, i.e. extrinsicmotivation. The patterns of rewards and punishments will control the retpon es andhabitS children develop. Primary rewards and punishments refer: to-activitiet. nd eventsassociated with reductioni in biologically based drive states. On the one hand animalswill learn responses associated with reductions in hunger; on trite other, they Will learnhow to escape, and later avoid, pain. As Skinner has neatly phrased the idea, 'The bestreason for learning is the consequence of not doing -to': To the extent that such ideasare valid we are products of our environmental pasts.The tfully pre-programmed' view will a;sert the importance of innate factors asdeterminants of behaViour -- what we become is hardly dependent upon the enVironmentat all. While extreme rationalism has not influenced the edUcational system, the 'cognitivedevelopmental' approach has This stresses the importance of the interaction of.organismand environment, but suggests that almost any 'normal' environment will serve to allowintellectual-development. The organism actively explores and processes its environnient,coostructingrules of procedure that facilitate adaptation. DeVelopment occurs whenconflicts arising between rules are resolved with some new, more adaptive, rule of action.If we adopt an extreme commitment to these beliefs our education will consist of makingsure that environments suffice to allow children to develop without indue hindrance; ifwe follow' the 'empty black box', it has to be,a highly structured programme withappropriate deployment of sanctions. The cognitive developmental approaches emphasiseintrinsic motivational factors, the 'empty black box' extrinsic ones.But are these views contradictory? Or is it merely that they are both validapproaches focusing-upon different aspects of the developmetal process. We will arguethat the main deficiency of each view is made good by the articulation of it with theother.:Iteasier and more appropriate to begin with the cognitive developmentalapproach and articulate the reinforcement view with it rather than the other way roundPiaget is notoriously difficult to expound with clgrity and simplicity, as evenPiaget himself appears to find (Piaget and Inhelder, 1969). (Because we are not or he isnot conceptually sophisticated enough to understand it? Because our language is short ofappropriate technical terms, and we have not had sufficient practicein using thoseiNailabie?).At least the essente of his system can be given in brief.The human organism has problems of adaptation to its environment, and it is.designed in such a way that it will continue to expand and elaborate its knowledge ofthis environment. The well-fed and watered human being is notquiesCent His brainbegins to fall apart if either excessively over or under-stimulated throughithe varioussensory modalities; however, there are optimal qualities of stimulation that lead to learnt 61. ing as well as confirmatory behaviours of various sorts. Piaget discusses some of theproblems of modes of adaptatiOn by invoking concepts of processes (e.g. assimilationand accommodation) and structure (e.g. schema and environment). Schema refers tosomething in the brain of the organism and is somewhat like a plan of action or a set ofrules for processing and acting upon a certain stimulus input. It is an internal represent- -ation by means of which the organism is able to act in its environment. When a stimulusinput corresponds sufficiently closely to an already available set of schemes, assimilationoccurs, the new experience being integratedinto the appropriate sets of rules whichthemselves remain unchanged. Alternatively no set of rules may be adequate for theproblem in hand or different sets of rules with mutually incompatible outcomes aresimultaneously engaged, in which case there are possibilities of accommodation. Theorganism may simply fail to adapt to the input, but if it succeeds by changing one ormore of its rules of action, accommodation is said to occur. Accommodation involvesa structural change in the rules, assimilation will extend only the domain of coverageof a particular rule.Schernas can, according do Bruner(1966), represent knowledge in three possibleways: enactive, ikonic, symbolic. Enactive schemes are action-based. Knowledge ismanifested by performance. Most of us will have a compidx set of schemes that enableus to ride a bicycle, but this 'know-how' is not available for effective expression in anydetailed symbolic form. Developmentally, the child's first knowledge is in the form ofenactive schemes only, but later some of these are reorganised at an ikonic and yet laterstill at a symbolic level. Other later knowledge can be acquired directly at ikonic orsymbolic levels. Piaget argues for an invariant sequence in the deireloUrnent of majorchanges in the structure of the child's thinking and behaviour. To date the empiricalevidence is fundamentally supportive of the heuristic, value of the cognitive developmentalapproach, and even if much of the theoretical terminology, were to be abandoned, theaccumulated facts would remain to be explained.Piaget's approach has a number of.important features to which attention maybe paid. In tine with other more recent work it argues for a cognitive basis to motiva-tion. A lack of novelty or challenge in the environment promotes action, action givesrise to discrepancies among schemes or between schemes and reality as tested,accommodation is required. This picture 9f an active knowledgeseeking explorerdoes not have to invoke a biological basis for learning in terms of primary and secondarydrives, discrepancies alone'suffice to motivate. Knowledge accumulatet 4t all levels ofrepresentation, becomes organized.and systematized and re-organized, correspondingmoreclosely.to a valid construction of the world. The levelr '!iemselves differ inpotential generality, ehetractness and power 4or solving new problems:But we may legitimately ask, Whatever happened to Piagetian man ?' Where didall the enthusiasm and power of intellect go 7 long time ago? How much sound know-ledge has accumulated? Are adolescent childrereally functioning at the level of formaloperations, having developed a true mastery of a conceptual system that can be usedto represent all manner of abstract and hypothetical contingencies? Are'we?Any why not How does it come about that most of us experience so few,fleeting and fragile realistic interactions with the world?,We would argue-that Piagefs model of dev_elopment is primarily a mode l .ofcompetence rather than performance; he has been interested in what children andadults can manage under optimal conditions with simplified materials. To this extent, 62 he presents an ideal to which the conceptual system ofman may aspire rather than asummary of how particular sub-groups of humanity perform in their everyday surround-inds. (And his ideal is tarnished to the extent that Genevan schoolchildren fall shOrt ofthe eventual possibilities of mankind). Further he has been interested inthe develop-ment of, the fundamental operations of thinking as a process. He has not been interestedin the mass of information we acquire:only how we can use it. He has not gar inter-ested in the 20,000 words in vocabularies, each with many meanings, but only withgeneral understanding of the systern.If we we interested in performance as well as possibility and in what goes on asa matter of natural history, we may note some assumptions in the Piagetian account that.may not then be warranted.Firstly, he plays down the relevance of.,the environment. It is assumed that whatis made available for children to learn is, by and large, idequate in quantity and qualityfor development to occur. Secondly he implies that unlimited generalisation of operationsand their applicationt will eventually occur that the principles underlying thinking inmathematics will generalise to social, behaViour, for example. Thirdly, he plays down therole of language in development. Fourthly, he ignores the fact that we are often reqUiredto act quickly with insufficient time for a coMplete analysis of the inforMatiOn releVantfor the deCisionito act. Fifthly, he ignores the relevance of sanctions to behaviour;generally he igriorks rewards and pUnishments, specifically he ignores the consequencesof failures at aceeAmodation.That sanctions can be used to control behaviour has been known. fora long timePrecisely what constitutes a reward or punishment and the details of their relationship tolearning .remain a little mysterious, but their efficacy is a fact. That reinforcement intraditional terms may be neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for learning tooccur is irrelevant. Unfortunately, experts on reinforcement principles are liable topresent, their: arguments and evidence in misleading ways,-and thosenot claiining to beexperts are liable to reject versions of reinforcement theory which they have alreadysimplified and distorted. As Skinner has repeatedly demonstrated, the precise timing andlocation of appropriate rewards and punishments are relevant to the building up ofcompound and complex response patterns behaviour can be shaped. That Skinner mayhave overgeneralized his position'to incorporate features of behaviour to which reinforce-ment contingencies may be immaterial one popular contender being die developmentgrammatical competencedot not detract from the facts: that food for.hungry, butnot t6op hungry, rats not only appears to Speed up rates of acquiring sets of responses,but also to be critical for their performance: As with Piaget, so with Skinner.- He sets this case a theoreticafframeworkebout 'schedules of reinforcement' andthen examines how far such, a system can take the inquiries. It is irrelevant whetherSkinner genuinely views the human organism as an empty 'black box' with a finitenumber of biOlogically based needs whose reduction is-linked in some way to-learning.The question is how far can such a model take us.Currently it would appear to have limitations,: particularly in relation to the 01dimelopMent of thinking.

Thequantity: qu:aiitY, timing and frequencykof rewards and punishments shape behaviour.Are schedules of reinforcement relevant to the nOn-appearance-of Piagetian man? If for the sake of argument we allow Paget to be fundamentally right about the sequence andlevels of development, can schedUles of reinforcement accelerate, slow down or even .prevent 'normal' development? .2.7 Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation (W.P. Robinson) 2.7.1 School Achievement, Social Class and Use of LanguageHow these two sets of factS and ideas may be articulated and shown to be complementaryrather than mutually incompatible is most easily clarified through an extensive illustration.'Social class' comes to occupy a dOminating position in our work and, it is therefore a topic -aboUt which it is apposite to achieve such a *thesis. We shall nOtConcern ourselves withthe definition of social class and will mention\"Only briefly the substantial documentationof social differences in. educational attainment. We can then enter into a short interpretationof class differences in langklage mastery that may be causally associated with differentialachievement. It is only after these issues have been set out that the framework generatedwill enable us to return to a consideration of the development of intrinsic and extrinsicmotivation and how these maycliffer by social class.Reports across countries (Husen, 1972) and within Britain (see, for example,Douglas; 1967; DoUglas; Ross and Simpson, 1968; Divie, Butler and Goldstein, 1972;Mortorr-Williams and Finch, 1968) record with persevering unanimity the underachievement of working class relative to middle class children. The differences remain, regardlessof the index of attainment used and regardless of whether or notone controls for variationthought by some to be heavily influenced py genetic factors, viz intelligence test scores.We need not concern ourselves too precisely with what we mean by 'social class'. (Somecritics Specialise in first treating class as a unitary diMension, then expOsing that it is not,and then denying its value as a concept What is the social class of a man who left schoolat fourteen, working his way through to becoming a director of a large industrial combine,Who,- after receiving his honorary degree from Leeds, takes up bricklaying?) There is asubstantial minority of people whose incomes, prestige status of occupation, educationalhistory, standard and location of housing, diverge sufficiently to pretlude unequivocalplacement in a class category: There are-many 'borderline' jobs:-However, there are alsorough nodeS about which people cluster and the labelS of lower and upPer working class,-- lower, middle and upper middle class and upper class are usefikreference points forcapturingSubstantial proportions of variation between people in our society across manyaspects of behaviourIn the search for sources of working class under'achievement in the edUcationalsystem, Bernstein pOinted to the possibility of a differential useandComMand oflanguage. This does not deny the pOssible importance of. many Other factor's, it onlyServes to specify one such factor. In a.sueicession,of papers (see Bernstein; 1972 for analmost complete collection), he has develOPed ideas of 'restricted' ancrelaborated Codesof language;use.'Wflile early writing stressed botksyntactic andiexical leV*oflingUistic hatemphasiied that thecode generates particular- 1 *These adjectives are used so frequently LWC,UWC(WC); LMC; MMC, UMC, (MC); UC.wo, istic meanings that are severely context bound. As Lawton (1968) has pointed outrestricted' has been variously used to refer to a limitation on the number and type oflinguistic units, and structures that can be deployed, a limitation on thenumber of peoplewho share the,dode, and a 'restriction of the range of social contexts from which issueappropriate linguistic structures' (Lawton, 1968; p. 99). it has been proposed that whilethe middle class has access to both codes, the lower working class is generally confined toa 'restricted' code, and in the papers refer:act to by Bernstein elaborates relationshipsbetween codes, social structure and education.Here the issues will be simplified, and we will follow the recommendation that afunCtionalistructural apProach be adopted fOr the study of the relationships between .language use and social differences in behaviour (Robinson, 1972a)l Of the many functionsof language we will concentrate upon aspects of two: language is used for the socialfunctions of controlling the states and behaviours of other people and for the representationof knowledge. We can issue and receive orders and threats which may or may not be carriedout By such verbal Means, non-verbal and verbal behaviour can be regtilated. As well asusing language as a direct means of changing present behaviour, we can use it to.mark the.state of a role relationship or define rote appropriate behavioUr. In the forms of address,we use we signal who has more power in a relationship or that we-are equal; and if we areequal, whether the relationship is CohesiVe and interdependent or not. The recognizedright to issue orders is a.mark of a power differential, while the use of assertions. like'I love you' can mark the existence of a .cohesive relation hip. We can also make verballyexplicit what behaviour is expected of another person. Written contracts may specify suchrights and obligations and can give them legal force, but social norms transmitted orallyand apparently casually. can have as much effective power.It will be argued subsequently that LWC mothers (and other transmitters of theclass culture) emphasise these uses of languageirt their-socialization practices at the expenseof the development of the representational function of language.We use the units and structures of language to form sentences which can be usedto make statements. These statements can beevaluated.in terms of truth or falsity. Dothey correspond to some reasonable construction Qf reality, more commonly if lessaccurately..referred to as; the facts of the matter? The truth-value of statements is con-strained by. what the world Is like and so can be tested in ways in which 'Good Morning,Sir!, 'Hurry Up!' or 'Little boys don't pick their noses!' cannot. For the last, the smilingson who announces to his mother that her statement is false, because he does pick hisnose, is likely to discover that she.was not putting forward an hypothesis. It is through therepresentational function that we can communicate,about events and ideas remote frompresent perceptions by virtue of time, space, generality or abstraction. That whole accumula-tion of our aultural wisdom aV knowledge stored in writings about geography, history,chemistry, engineering, sociology;education,' law, in fact is ail.empirical knowledge, bothaboutthe natural and thesuperi4(al,and all knowledge of logics relies on the representa:tional function of language. rAnd'it is\\not `knowing that' thus represented, butalso 'knowing how'; it not onlYthe transmission of such knowledge from person to personthat is involved, but the storage, analysis, processing, and synthesis of one's personal ration.While, we may pause to remind ourselves of Bruner's suggestion (1966) that knowledgerepresented in symbolic fOrM is only one forth, and that en'active and ikonic representationare also involved in human existence, we niust concede that a high proporsion'of the knoWledge transmitted in the edubational process is (and has to be?)in verbal forms. All suchknowledge then requires not only an exercise of the representational function of language, 65 but a mastery of the units and structures in apprvpflate ccirrespondence .te the nen,verbal world,the systemization of knowledge and the generation of theory, generaland abstract descriptions and explanations are constructed from the particular andconcrete observations. This information is transferred from one person or source toanother by emploYing units andstructures that are not so implicit in their reference asto allOW a vagueneis and ambig ity that renders the messages useles. How far anyfailure to develop-s4h.facilitiet ith language affects other intellectu& developmentwill not be argued her-e, but it is vident that the aCcumulati^n of knowledge in manyschOol subjects can be adversely ffected by deficiencies ire the command of thisfunction of language.Members of the lower working class, it is suggested, suffer from such a deficiency,and the evidence available from number of investigations is generally consistent withthis point of view (Lawton, 19681i Robinson, 1972a pp. 148-185). Adverse criticismshaVe been made (see Williams, 1970) which sometimes refer to the. MC normsthat mayhave governed the contexts of speech collection (Williams end Naremore, 1969) and atother times to the fundamental linguistic competence of 'disadvantaged' groUps (e.g.Labov, 1970). The study which has so far produced the best summary description of thedifferences between MC and WC speech was meihodologically weak (Schatzman andStrauss, 1955), butthe analogy employed merits repetition. To sum up the characteristicsof WC speech of eyewitnesses asked to report about a tornado, Schatzman and Strausssay that it would seem that WC witnesses have acted like film Cameras. What they haVeseen has been largely determined by passive attention deiermined by changes in thestrength of stimuli ,in the immediate environment. Whenasked about the tornado, it is asthough they play the film back and commentate upon it to the interviewer, at the sametime assuming that he can see the film-The account is therefore particular and concrete,'references are not made explicit, there are no concessions to the listener's pessibledifficuities of understanding, and the film has'hot been- edited to 'make sense'. By:contrast, the MCinterVievyees have been trying to make sense of events while they, havebeen watching, actively organizing their material to gain as objective, general and abstractan account as possible, as well as recording stZecifics. This means that at a later:point in_time they have a variety of peripectives_froich the story can be narrated and anumber of. levels of abstraction al which it an4lbe pitched. Reference is explicit .attemptS are made to link the,story to the interviewers categories of eXperience. Thisunderstanding of and ability to exploit the power of the represeritationat-lunction ofJ langua,is what is supposed to charaCterise MC speech and writing. There has never beenany evidence to sugest that theiniddle class are at all incompetent in the social functionsof language. zfIf we turn to dataabout sOcialization practices, we can begin to see how suchsocial class differences might come about and how thesewould relate to intrinsic andextrinsic .motivation. , 2.7.2 SoCial Class andPatterns of Control and ComMunication inSocializationThe datafacus upon discipline problems and queition-answer exchanges which we maytreat as contrastive in that the former appears to encourage the mother towards 'control'of behaViour while the latter has a presSuile towards the 'communicatioh' of knowledge:.Here we concentrate on corrective and 'preventive rather than constructive aspectsof control. Bernstein has distinguished three Categories.of control by 1,:vtii\\ch Motheri can'< reprimand children, get them bed; r shoot and handie the multitudinous other pro-blems they encounter.

With this reminder that not ell may be as it seems to be with MC children ;Indtheir education, we can return to summarise the fate of the 'intrinsic motivation' df hisLWC peer. 2.7.4.Lower Working Class Children and their. Socialization: Summary1.The family is the primary:source of knoWledge about the world for young children.Relative to the MC family,,,the LWC family is not providing as much knowledge, it,is less forthcoming in amount and. accuracy.' It is not providing the means toacquire and make independent evalUation of knowledge, nor is it encouraging thintrinsic motivation for any of these activities:2.The enquiry behaviours of LWC children are not rewarded either extrinsically byincentives or.intrinsicallY by the filling of gaps in knowledge Absence of reward isnot the whole 4tOry,'however. Hess and Shipman (amking Many otiers) haveobserved a higher incidence of punishment in 'learning' situa tions Yvhichpresumablyacts both to suppress relevant enquiry, behaviours, and in the Icing run perhaps,,,--the motivation to enquiry. In Fiagetian terms,4ittempts at glaptat on through,accommodatibri become less likely. In Berlyne's terms, extrnisic otivation not toenquire is more likely to become dominant over any intrinsic mot vation t4 do So.Boredom is safer than punishment Furthermore, we have seerithat-ait wcivgiyento both empirical and moral questions are likely to be presented is the receiveddoctrine of the culturcthe social order Will be presenietand reprduced.3..The knowledge acquired by LWC children is less likely to be orderd into systems.Categories of experience, are not articulated to ern:qv-rage the development ofsymbolic control over the objects Ofi thinking. The MC children look to be receivingknowledge tailored for progression through Piagetian stageaof development4.One significant discriminating feature lies in the differential. command of therepresentational function of language. The LWC child is characterised by a relativeinability to represent knowledge symbolically (logical, empirical,.rnoral, aestheticand metaphysical), thereby restrictingiposlibitities of efficient verbal communica-tion to others, except in simple presqiptions oidescriptioris of a concreteI;andparticUlar,yariety, and reducing the chances of the generation of internal co ceptualconflicts and gaps which can then.be resolved or filled by restructuring avail leevidence or acquiring new evidence. Skills in the verbal formuiltion of proble s`N:as questions and skins in the generation and evaluation of ansuers are likely to be..depressed.With such a cloud of witnesses testifying to the pattern of results rePOrted, wemay LW thought uncharitable in doubting their authenticity. But we also felt obliridto respond to the Clarionzall of modern primary educational theory: 'I hear,1 forget;I see, remember; I If Wecignore the presumptive inaccuracy of its'literal meaning, we can still catch thispitit of the maxim and engage in a little doingas well as readingHence, we decided to replicate some of the basic dAgns, elaborating them totease out relationships among'surpries, relevance, value;interest, questioning, compre-henlion,.and learning, and to skirmish briefly with social class (Chapter 3).Duly convincedin additiciin'\\ persuaded that curiosity is positively associatedwith learning, we could turn to the examination of social class differences in boredomWhich would be predicted on the basis of,the ideas expressed in section 2.7A.

DUFFY) 3.1 General Introduction Three experimental studies were conducted into an examination of possible determinantsof question asking, all within the framework of Berlyne'S.approach to curiosity. The firstexperimental study was run when we Were still optimistic about the feasibiAty of makingsocial Class comparisons, but the facrthat we had to obtain our MC and WC boys for thesefrom different schools Was one Of the early signs that sociatclass was note feasible com.plex of variables to use with children of this age in our area. Since we had no practical\"experience of looking at 'collative properties of stimuli' in relation to inspection times,qu,eStion asking.or hypothesis generation, we weren part concerned simply to try ourhand. However, we introduced twosvariatiOns into the standard situations mentionedearlier (see chapter 2). First, cif the three types of oddity used, two were social rasyCho-logical rather than physiCal. While thhiaseof4:ictures-presented objects with oddattributes (gran pillar lib*); thefirst two offered, respectively, pairs of people playing thereverse of their customary, roles (teacher in desk, child by blackboard') and individuals ., whose emotional expressions were in conflict with the role being perfOrmed (nUrse:looking angry and pulling a patient's hair). Each incongruous picture had a normal sibling,and We.wished to see whether the incongruity affected the time spentlookinget eachpicture and the :slumber ofAuestions asked about it. We combined this witifan hypothesisderived from. Bernstein's (1970) views about-child development. He has argued for relativelyrigiddefinitions of roles in the lower working class.. If this is true then LWC subjects,shouldexperiencemore conflict and hence look for longer: What should happen withquestions isdifficult to predict. if children are asked to explain anomaly, then MC childrenshould have a' greater facility for integrating the odd itywithin the bounds of normal,.6experience. \u00b0We should have liked to follow up this Initial investigation with other stimulusMateriali and more satisfactorily differentiated groups of subjects, but the local absenCeof the latter forced .1.Nto abandon the project -1111.1 N to be regretted because the discovery..of social class differences with such-materialsinight have had implications for the teachingof such subjects as.history, human geography and social studies.Instead, we decided to look at one general asPect of determinants of questionasking: whether children's ratings of interestcould be used to predietthe number of.questions they .Would ask. If we assume (but we need to examine) that the number andtype of question's \"7:hildren haVe could enable of effortthey would invest in the exPlOration,of a topic, then we Would have isolated one techniquefor relying onintrinsic rather than wholly extrinsic motivation for facilitating their pursuitof knowledge; they would be finding. out about topic because they wanted to rather thanbecause theywoulcfbe in-trouble etc. if they did not.l.f children's ratingstheir own interest were to .bear no) relation to :their Okiestioning behaviour, then the search would have to begin again; if they were to,.then such ratingscould flemployed as a guide to the likely effort and 'enthusiasm they would invest. Thefirst study in. fact showS relationships between interest and questions asked..From whatdoes this interest stem? The second study looks at two poSsible determinants of interest,surprisingns and value. and is supplemented by an analysis of the relationships between . these variables and comprehension and. retention. 3.2 Study 1: The Relationships of RoleReversal, Role-BehaviourConflict and Inappropriateness of Attributes to Duffy) .3.2.1. IntroductionAccording to Berl yne's stimulus - response theory, curiosity behaviotir is a con-sequence of perceptual or conceptual conflict arising from competing symbolic responsesaroused by 'coitative' properties of- stimulation, that is to say, profierties which lead theorganism to compare present with past experience. Examples of such collative propertiesare novelty, incongruity, surprisingness and uncertainty. Berlyne's own research has .indicated that manipulation of the values of these variables does arouse puriosity7arousing potential of stimuli, when curiosity is measured in terms of time spent ininvestigation or number of questions asked. Berlyne and Lawrence (1904) found thatadult subjects chose to spend significantly longer looking at tachiscosconieally'pregentedgeometrical figures having high values of Complexity and incongruity than at figureshaving correspondingly low values.- Berlyne and Frommer (1966) presented childrenaged from five to eleven with orally related stories, pictUres, stories withepicturei, andmagiC'tricks at differing values of novelty, surprisingness and incOngruity, and invitedthem to ask'questions after each item; the number of questions asked was found to begreater for higher values of these variables.The pr..,Sent:e4eriment wasdesigned to test the effect of incongruity:on curiosityin fourteen and fifteen year old boys, the stimuli consisting of draWings depicting odd orunusual objeCts and situatiohs, and_curiOsity being measured in terms of length of \"..inspection-time and numbers of questions. Two possible sources of subject, differencesin curiosity were also examined. namely tested non-verbal intelligence and social class.We 'aisol intended to test a hypothesis derived from Bernstein's.(1970) theory concerningthesocial origins of 'elaborated' and 'restricted' linguistic codes of langUage use, associatedwith the middle class and lower working class respectively. Bernstein postulates that MCfamiiies tend to be of the 'Person-oriented'type. that is tet'saY, the status of each memberis not rigid)y aseribed at the outset, but depends on his'indiVidual qualities rather thanon his formal ascribed status, while LWC families tend tote of the 'positional' type,where roles- are rigidly ascribed on the baSis- of individual's formai sociological status;e.g. age, se:c position ja _family, etc., and each member has little opportUnity to'behavein any way which is not recogniSed as being appropriate to his status in the family. Thissuggests that MC families forte. a less regid attitude as to what constitutes 'normal! and'alifiermar behaviour, and it may be hypothesised that MC boys wOuld,be more likely totake incongruity in their stride, partictiiarly if the incongruity involves apparently role . _ inappropriate behaviour, as slidtwo-thirds of the drawings used in the presentexpertrnent. To test this hypothesis, subjects were invited to offer explanations of the incen-.gruout features of the drawingS; it would be predicted that the MC subjects would-tendto construe the incongruities as being explicable in 'normal' terms. If we were concerned * Acknowledgemen!: We would like to. thank D.A. Young, Senior Lecturer in. Sociology, .West Ham College of Technology, foi his contribution to ihe ideasin this investigation. d- about inspection times however, we might expect WC boys to look longer thari_MC .,9boys at incongruous pictures, since they should have greater difficulty accommodatingthem.in addition, from a study of the curiosity. of ten and eleven year old childrenusing pictures of museum objects as stimuli, Ashton (1965) proposed that offeringup hypotheses about the nature of the stimuli is an index of curiosity, on the assump-tion that a' curious personwill attempt to provide answers to his own questions when,information is not forthcoming. it was therefore decided to examine the relationship .between offering explanations and the two measures of curiosity used: 3,2.2. MethodMaterials. Two complementary sets of freehand drawings, measuring 14 inches x 10 .inches and mounted on cardboard; one set eexper!mentall depicting one of three sortsof incOngruity, 'role-reversal', 'role-emotion conflict' or 'conjunction of inappropriateattributes', set depicting the corresponding 'normal' situation orobject. The drawing showed: Experimental Control Role-reversal1.Schoolroom: teacher in desk; child at front. Reverse2.Street: thief chasing policeman. Reverse3.Street: woman with dog in pram; child on lead.

They were divided into tsocial -class groups on the basis of selected from .a different school.fromthe two WC groups. To control for the effects of inteliigericetet scores, each subjectwas matched wih.one in eachof the other groups onthei..of scores on Raven's.1v)or StandardProgressiveatreces (Sets A-E),whichwere administered shortly before the/.:experimentwas carried out, Since he MC group were tested eten.earlier stage in theschool yea'ethan the oth,_)r two grOdps, their ages were substentially lower.

Inspection of the data revealedno clear relationship between the total time spent looking at the experimentalicturesand the Clumber of questions asked about them, nor between the time spent lookingat each picture and its probability of eliciting a question. Likewise, no clear relation-ships appeared between the number of questions asked the freque4y of any of thefour types of explanation. . .3.2.4Discussion--The results confirm the hypo is derived from Berlyne's theory that incongruitystimulates curiosity, at least thriosity is measured in terms of question-askingo However, while the experimental pictures did elicit twice et many questions as thecontrols, thenumber of questions was very small the-twenty-four-subjet.produced a total of only forty two. Contrary to the findings of Berlyne and Lawrence,incongruity had no significant effect on inspection time; for none' of the-groupi wasthere a significant difference between the times spent looking at the two sets ofdrawingS. We shall return to these points later:There was weak evidence for an effect of social class on Measures of curiosity;with the WC boys, looking longer. Intelligence test scOreswere not found to affectinspection-time, but did appear to have Some negative relationship to the number ofquestions. These results are apparently-contrary to those of AsMon, who found thatinspection7time was the only measure of curiosity to be correlated with intelligence.For explanations the MC group provided more odditydenying responses than-theWC groups. This lends support to the Bernstein hypothesis. There was sometendency for Mole intelligent subjects to offer agreater number of explanations.It would appear from the small number of questions asked, either that thesubjects were:low in-curiosity-(astuming Berlyne'-s-theory to be'true)-,-or else that the-',particular stimuli used were somehow not adequate to elicit it, perhaps not beingsufficiently interesting td the subjects. :There are some grounds for aCcepting this latterhypothesis, if only rather tentatively.The failure to find eny difference in inspection time between, the normal andincongruous pictures: 'Day (1966) found that bOth the time spent looking at a set ofpiotures and designs and judgementi of 'interestingness' were distributed as the sameinverted U-function of comPleiity, which suggests that stimuli maybe looked at foras long as they are interesting. If this is correci:then it: appears' that the incongruouspictures. were found no more ihteresting fbr the subjeCts than the normal ones.Since the subjects were adolescents and the drawings were essentially cartoons with asolitary odd featUre, we were Perhaps over-optimistiC about. the efficacy of ourmaterials.The negative relationship between intelligence test `scores and dumber ofqUestions asked suggests the poSsibility that the stimuli used may be more appropriatefor eliciting curiosityirrless-cognitively -Maturesubjects,BerlYne andfoL,i'ncl that the incidence of questions to their stimuli rose between -five and eightyears but declined between eight and eleVen years.

Therank order for the four groups IV High, I High, IV Low, I Low ,T; was the same asfor variables which one shoUld\"expect to be related to intellectual maturity: as wellas asking few questions overall, the younger and less intelligent subjects askecka verylow proportion of closed questions, and were much more restricted in the type ofinfOrrnation which they sought nearly half the questions asked by the low-streamfirst years were 'of the type 'Why did the experiment turn out as it did?' In addition,they were able to offer relatively few explanations for the outcomes of the experiments..These findings may be taken to indicate that the stimulus materials were closerto the optimal point of discrepancy for the more Cognitively advanced subjects; whilefOr the less advanced, they were too remote for a great degree of, accommodation to bepossible: particularly notable was the almost complete absencein the low ability groupsof 'manipulation' and 'generality' that 'go beyond' the informationpresented. . 0..However, despite these differences in expressed curiosity, all groups professedan equal degree of interest in the materials. This suggests that discrepancy as defined heremay have a cognitive rather than a motivational influence of questioning, a possibilitythat requires further investigation. Also, the findings that subjects were reliably consist-ent in their interest judgements and that these judgements predicted amount of questioning imply ink they were tending to 'channel' their curiosity, on the basis of the samecriteria. A second task is,to discover what these criteria are 3.4. Study III: Curiosity in relation to Assimilabitity; Surprise andPerceived Relevance 3.4.1.Introduction . 101 sThe relationship found between patterns of question-asking and intellectual maturity inthe second study was taken as indirect evidente for the hypothesis that the expresSionof curiosity is dependent on the individUal's capacity to relate new material to the conceptswhich he already possesses. However, while this can account\" for the differences betweenthe groups, it appeared that the way in which subjects distribute their questions amongthe various experiments may be determined by other factors. Two Suggestions may bemade as to what these factors are likely to.. be.The first of these is the degree to which the information in the materials violatesthe subject's expectancies, or comes into direct conflict with his existing ideas. This istheoga'sudden clsh, gap or disparity' that Isaacs referred to, and that previous evidence._ ._has shown to be a particularly potent instigator of epistemic curiosity, whether generatedby 'improbable',dueitions ikerlyne, 1954b), pictures Fromn,ler), or incongruous drawings (Duffy andRobinson). It can be, regarded as a form of discrepancy qualitatiVely different from thatdescribed in the previouS chapter.The second factor that may be sugg6ted is tile 'rtleyancel of the material to thesubject, or in other words, theieXtent to which he thinks,'ihat information about it isworth having. Berlyne (1960, chapter 11) makes a distinction between 'intrinsic' and'extrinsic' epistemic curiosity: knowledge may be sought is an end in itself, or for thesake of some external reward that is contingent upon it. Nevertheless, even if the reiolu-tionottonceptual conflict is a.sufficient incentive for knowledge-seeking, it is reason-. able to suppose that a person:Will be more likely to ask questiqns if he feels a need forinfOrmation on some other grounds. An attempt to enhance su6h a need in an educationalsetting, without recourse to any direct rewards, was made by Hovey, GruberSnd:'Terrell (1963): two university classes in educational psychology were subjected to twodifferent teaching methods; one class was taught exclusively by lectures (three per week)While a 'self-directed study' (SDS) technique, involving small group discuSsion and onlyone lecture per week, was applied:to the other. It was assumed that this latter condition 'sWould enhance students' active involvement in course material and thereby their viewsof its relevance to themselveS. A pencil-and-paper 'curiosity. test' giVen ten monthsafter the start of the course comprised three groups of five items, relating to 'question-raising behaviour', 'interest in educational psychology', and 'desire to get more inform7ation about educational psychology'. The'SDSclass was found to be slightly superioron all five items in the first group, and on four out of five items in each of secondand third groups. At the same time, the two classes did not differ significantly in theirretention of course Material How far these results can be generalised is open to doubt,however, espeCially since they could easily be attributable to a 'HaWthorne effeet'sThe investigation to be reported here employs.basically the same m%terials asthe first one, and is designed to find out whether interest' and questioning increase asa function of hoW surprising and how 'valuable' subjects find the experiments, and totest the prediction that the assitnilability of the material will affect interest ratingsand nurnbers of question's differentially.

For each subject, there were two booklets containing the same eight descrip-tions of psychological experiments used in the preliious study, except that Piaget'sconservation of volume experiments was substituted for Perky's study of imagery,.which was used as an instructional example.The first booklet (see Appendix III) contained cOmprehension tests,on eachof the experiments, consisting of four questions, each with four multiple-choiceanswers, and three five-pOint rating scales regarding how Surprising the outcome ofthe experiment was, how interesting it was, and how valuable it was to kndw abutit. There was also space for subjects to write reasons for their jUdgements of 'interand 'value'. The second booklet contained spaces on each page to write questionsabout theexperiments.Subjects. The procedures were carried out with the fiat to sixth streams of the thirdyear of a girls' comprehensive school. Since streaming was roughly on the basis ofability, the six streams may be considered as crudely representing a high-to-loWintelligence continuum. For the purpoies of analysis, subjects who had not completedboth halves of the experimerit or had not correctly folloWed instructions wereomitted; leaving a final sample of 136. The numbers used from each'stream weretwenti-nine, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, fourteen;-twenty-one and The median- age 'of the subjects, was 14A, with a range of 13, 10 to 14,10.Procedure.. Each stream was see separately on successiik days, the comprehension testand ratings being completed on th ifitday-Tand-the-question form on the-second.Both sessions lasted approximately 8a'ininutes. In the first, subjects were glien ageneral introduction to thematerials as before, after which they completed the exampleand went through the rest of the experiments in their own time. Instructions forthe question writing task were the same as before; questionS were answered about twoweeks after the completion of the procedure, together with a demonstration of the -Lee (delayed auditory feedback) effect.14.3.ResultsDifferences between streams. Although numbers of questions varied significantly withstream (Tables 3.4.1 and 34.2), it can be seen that there was no obvious pattern:little difference appeared between streams one, three, four and five, which each askedconsiderably more than streams two and Six.

DiscussionThe failure to find apositive relationship between ability level and incidence of questions,despite the faCt that the former was related to comPrehension of the, materials, is atvariance with the results of the first study; and suggests that the disposition of the subjectsto.write questions may have been affetted by situational factors such as the social -atmosphere prevailing in the classroom. However, as no specific variables canbe pointedto which are likely to have raised or depressed the amount of questioning, this mustremain purely speculative. .Nonetheless, the picture ernerging from the intercorrelations among questions,..and the three rating scales. is a reasonably clear one, though the possibility exists thatthe positive correlations-between the scales were in part a function of carry-over effects,and would not have been so high had the subjects not been required to complete them,-consecutively. Both surprise and value significantly predicted_ interest ratings and were more .strongly related to interestthan to each other. Interest significantly predicted numbersof questions. .Bearing in mind that these relationships may haVe been considerably differenthad different sets or types of, stimulus materials been used, these findings can beinterpreted as being consistent with the notion that the unpredictability and perceivedrelevance of new information influence its potential to provoke curiosity. This conclusionis reinforcedthe reasons That subjects gave for their judgements of interest andvalue; Nearly half (forty.fiVe per cent) of the reasons given for high'ratings of interestreferred to the'unexpiCted nature of the experimental results, -while almost all lowratings (eighty five per cent) were iustifed i'rt,terms of their predictability; the reasonsmost frequently: given for high value ratings referred to general principles that couldbe derived from the experiments (thirty four per\\6ent) or to possible practical applications of their findings .( thirty per cent). , . .Although reasons of unekPecteclness were rarely given for ludgements of value,and though there seems to be no logical relationship bOween whether information isunexpected and whether-it is worth having on extrinsic grounds, the positive correlationbetween surprise and value suggests that these are related psychologically. If thiscorrelatiOis not attributable entirely to a carry-over effect, the most probable'explanation is that subjects. were not judging value merely iptermsof how valuable itwas to knbw about\u00b0 given experiment, but rather in terms of how valuable it wqs tofind out, about itIn other Wordt, at least a minimal leyel of unpredictabiiityis pia-,requisite f6r information to perCeived as relevant: ' .There was some support for the hypothesis that the assimilability of materialis related ill' a cognitive ratherthan a motivational way to questioning; despite the fartthat the comprehension test proved to bevery insensitive instrument, in that very fewerrors: were made on it at all, scores were more closely correlated with numbers ofquestions than with expresSed interest; although the evidence from this study is not very 106 clear,.-it may tentatively Suggest that!cognitive discrepancy! has a-limiting effect on theability to express:, curiosity rather than a deterrnining effect on the desire to do so.In 'summary, then, it.rhay be concluded that While 'conflict resulting pf may be from preViousiknowledge.nor perceived extrinsic relevance are Itshould be noted; however, that some ability on the individual's part to relate newmaterial to his existing concepts is a necessary condition for it both to generate conflictand to.be seen as having value. ..Th livels of interest expressed in, and comprehension of, the experimentshave been interpreted onthe basis'of the present findings as indicating, respectively,subjects' willingness and ability to seek and acquire more information about them.

IntroductionBerlyne's theory, redicts, and empirical stUdies have demonstrated, that informationwhich enables subjects to resolve previously-aroused conflict is retained particularlyWell, whether it does so by answering questions provided to the subjects (Berlyne, 1954b)or otherwise reducing uncertainty (Berlyne, 19660; Nicki and Shea, However,in the studies by Paradowski (1967) and Pielsti& nd WOodruff (1968) also describedin Section 2, subjects showed strongest recall for stimuli which were relatively strangeor unfamiliar, i.e.. those that were likely to induce rather than reduce conflict on Berlyne'stheory.If learning can be enhanced for information that elicits, as wellas answersquestions, then it should be expected that subjects' retention of the experirriehtalmaterials will be positiiiely related to the degree of curiosity that they arouse..lt wasfound in the previous investigation that ccmprehension of the experiments tended topredict amount of qUestioning rather than judgements of interest. On the presenthyPothesis, it should be expected that if the multiple- choice questions employed tomeasure comprehension are used as a recognition task following exposure to thematerials, the ability to answer them will be more closely related yd.-interest, since thisWill now reflect motivational in addition to cognitive Processes. Moreover, if this relation-ship is mediated by conflict, retention scores shoUld also be related to ratings of -surpriseindependently of value. 3.5.2 MethodMaterials, Three sets of booklets were UsedI-he 'ratings' booklet contained the same'eight descriptioni used in the previous study, each cotIpled with.the-ttiree five-pointscalekfOr'surprise; interest and value. The 'retention' booicle-tf contained the first sentenceofeacKdescript.r.)n together with the multiple - choice questionsusedin the previousstudy to measure comprehension. The 'questione_bopklet was thessame as that used .before.-Subjects. The sample consisted of the second and third streams of the third yearof a 107 bciys' comprehensive school .(N = 45). Thd median age of the sample was 13.1, with arange of 12.6 to 13 6.Procedure. The experiment was carried uut.over two days. The sample was divided asnearly as posiible into.twO equal groups, with twenty-two boys completing the Wingsand retention tasks on the first day, and twenty-three writing qUeStions on the second.The procedure and instructions for the ratings task were basically the same asthose used previously, except that instructional example was omitted. When allthe subjects had completed the ratings, the retention booklet's were distributed, andthe following instructions were given:'Next I'd like to .see how well you can remember the experiMents. In thesebooklets, you'll find four questions about each experiment. I've given thefirst sentence of each description, just to remind you which experiment thequestions are about For each,question underline what you think is the right'ansWer.

Go through the questionsfairly quickly; there's no need to take too much-time over this Remember,this, isn't a test to see how bright you are; Itm not interested in seeing whocan get the most answers right'In Order to counteract any possible position effects on retention, half of thebooklets commenced at experiment 1 and half at experiment 5 for both ratings andretention:On thesecond day, the new group were.given the question-writing task. 3.5.3.

The most likely interpretation may be thafthemore interesting experitnentsfrnobilised from the subjecti;this is inline With Ausubel's sUggettion quoied in chapter 1, and also with ar hypothesis proposedby Fiothkopf (1965) that pie-questioning proCeddres like that used by fierlYne (19514,itfacilitate learning by indueing.'inspective behaviour', in any case, it seems very probablethat the more strongly a subjat attends to:a particular experiment;the Oeiter is thelikelihood that he these studies was to examine the notion that curiosity behaviour ismotivated by a discrer3ancv between thelptiividual's existing knoikledge-structure.fand present ixperience, and that it is evoked most strongly by an intermediat levelof discrepancy. Previous empirical studies had attempted to test such a discrep ncyhypothesis in the field of perceptual exPloraticM'or attention. aAusubel, was concernedWith symbolic material, .namely, accounts of psychological experirnents in:secondary school children. _Oh a 'weak'.form of the hypothesis, it predicted that patterniof question- .-'asking about the psychology experiments described would vary systematically with ageand intelligence. Older and more able boys in a sainple Of elevento-fifteen year olds\\were found to.request moth informition than their younger and less able counterparts,and also to ask More varied and more 'mature' questions. These results wers:takin toindicate that,the materials were more readily asiimilable for them, and closer to their'optimal' discrepancy level. HoweVer,. all 'groups expressed an approximately equaldegree of interest in the material, and the relative amount of interest expressed in theindividual experiments was predictive overall of the numbers of questionsthat wereasked about them.This suggested that the more cognively largeli because they were morecapable of doing so; they were better'able to relate, the material to -their existing conceptual systems, either becaOse thesesystems were morefullly- developedor because their capacity to process new informationwas superior.: The actual motive or incentive to express curiosrty seemed to stem fromother factors. On the basis of Berlyne's,theory and previous research, the roles of twopossible detigminants were examined; these were,lirstly, how far the information inthe accounts conflicted with-the previous knowledge.or ideas of the subjects-and e. second, how relevant it was perceived to.be. It was found that levels of interest in andquestioning \"about the experiments were positively related to judgements of 'surprisingness'and !value' in a sample of fourteen year old girls, while the relative assimilability of theexperiments, measured in terms of subjects' ability to answer comprehension questionsabout thrird, tended to predictamount of questioning but not how interesting they, werejudged. The disposition to seek knowledge, it was concluded, is determined by a combina-tion of intrinsically and extrinsically motivated needs to reduce uncertainty, while thecapacity to do so is influenced by the individual's ability to relate present and past experienceto each other.Since seeking knowledge is a prelude to integrating it, it was predicted that variableswhich affected the former should also affect the latter; interest in the experiments waspositively related to immediate retention of their content in a group of twelve year old boysthough this wles not attributable exclusively to either conflict or relevanCe. It was suggestedthat both of these are likely to enhance learning by mobilising the learner's attention.As with all research, one must recognise the problem of how far the present concli .lions can be generalised, given the restricted nature of the experimental arrangements.Although the materials and proCedures used do appear to have provided a fairly realistic andeffective: means of exciting the subjects' curiosity, it is necessary to bear in mind that thechildren were behaving in a structured situation; they were given:specifiOinstructions andwere attending to specific stimulukmatter, In 'real-life' situations; on the contrary, curiositytends to occur Spontaneously; and is not hecessarily correlated with identifiable stimuli,though some degree of structure may exist, for instance, in the classroom. AnOther reasonfor caution is the faCt that the.correlerons demonstiated here among question-asking,comprehensiiin, retention and ratings-were based on group rather than individual data, andalthOugh intri-group agreement was usually statistically reliable, it was not very high.FUrthermgre, there was considerable variation among the results the individual streamsin the second investigation o.Clearly, then, the conclusions drawn here must be regarded as tentative starting,pointelfor further research sampling a wider variety of situations and employing more....:._refined methods, but in the meantime, some discussion is called /for concerning generalissues raised by the present studieg.Types of DAscrepancy. The results of the second investigation (Section 3.3) indicated thatquestion asking was influencedby two distinct types of discrepancy. One of these, indexedby the comprehension measure, appears to be. equivalent to 'complexity' as defined in 'Studiesof exploratory behaviour, in that it involves merely-an extension or`additiOn to the individual'sevious experience: The type indexed by ratings of surprise, on the other hand, depends ona direci clash with previousexpeiience, and thus seems equivalent to 'incongruity': while theindividualsu'tly familiar with the basic elements of the new material to relate themtofisting ideas. the relationshiPsbetween the elements !e.g. aninials enjoytrig electric,shocks) are strange and unexpected. BOth types of discrepancy can baubsuMed under thecategory of 'novelty'.Obvigusly,some degree of novelty is a pre-requisite fOr curiosity,one cannot accommodate to what h already been assimilated -- and as Hutt (1970b) pointsout,-it is probably impossible to isolate novelty and compleXity empirically. It is suggested,however, that whereas surprise can instigate information-seeking autonomously by generatingconceptuallconflict, mere ;remoteness' may only be operative in doing so when a need for '.figther'informatiMiii felt on some external 'grounds. If this it the case, then some doubt isCast on Berlyne's assumption (e.g. 19666),that all collative variables affect curiosity in the same manner.,A study relevant to this point is ssepormted by Greenberger, VVoldman andYourshaw (1i967). They found that a prior 'curiosity set' or 'setto remember' both looked longer at collative stimuli significantly longer than a controlgroup given 'neutral' instructions, but for the former, attention wa:; prolonged predomin-antly to irkongruous Pictkires, While for the latter the effect stemmed mainly froMincreased attention to highly complex patterns. Moreover, most of thcontrol subjects,when questioned after the experiment, reported having developed a self-induced curiosityor remembering set, and the same relationships obtained for therm It seems, then, thatsubjects tended to look longer at highly complex stimuli when they thought that therewas some extraneous reason for.identifying or registering them; whereas attending toincOngruous stimdli did not require an additional incentive.It is notable that Berlyne, in different statements of his theoretical position, hasemphasized different internal constructs mediating between collative variables and specificetploration. Compare, for example 'the condition of diScomfort due to inadequateinformation, that motivates specific exploration, is What we call 'curiosity'', (1966a, p. 25)with 'what underlies all the collative them their common motivationaleffects in conflict, by.which we meana condition in which incompatible, mutually inter-fering patterns of behaviour are siMulteneously mobilised.' (1964, p: 23). On thepresentargument, the 'inadequate information' interpretation is more applicable to complexity(whether ikonic or symbolic), with the rider that the subject must have some reason forfeeling that his information is inadequate, while the 'conflict' interpretation is moreappliCable to incongruity or surprise. It also seems reasonable to suppose that.'novelty' asdefined in the habituation-recovery paradigm owes its effect to conflict, since the changestimulusihould be expected to violate expectancies generated by the repeated exposUresof the habituated one.The discrepancy hypothesis. The present studies, like those generated by Kagan's (1967)hypothesis, have not shown curiosity to, be related in a curvilinear fashion to either of thediscrepancy parameters: interest and questioning appeared to increase monotonically bothwith the 'proximity' of the material and with the degree of conflict it aroused. This maybe attributable to the fact that the materials did not sample a sufficiently wide section ofthe discrepancy continuum, but in any case, as pointed out above,, discrepancy in thesense of remoteness from previous experience, at least within the fairly narrow limitssampled here, seemed to act at a cognitive rather than a motivational level. While an, inter-mediate level of novelty, or 'the old-in the new', probably does provide the optimal pre-conditions for curiosity,one does not want to find out either what one knows alreadyor something entirely disconnected frorkprevious knowledge- what mot vates knowledgeseeking in the absenCe of external incentives is the conteadiction between the old and thenew; as Berlyne's experiment (1954b) showed, curiosity can be at its highett whenextremely familiar concepts, i.e. those about which one has the strongest beliefs andexpectations, are presented in an unfamiliar context. Similarly, while it is to beexpectedthat the time spent exploring stimuli will be an inverted-U function of their coniplexity-level (as for example in Berlyne St Lewis, 1963), thereis no reason to suppose, as Far\"(1970) does, that it should be similarly related to their level of incongruity.The measurement of curiosity. It was observed ,in chapter 2 that the psychometric approachto curiosity has not proved to be a very fruitful one. If the expression of curiosity isdependent upon an interaction between the individual and what he is seeking informationabout, it is not- appropriate to assume, at some researchers have, that a subject who, for 0 example, shows more prolonged exploration or asks morequestions than another in a testsituation is more 'curious'. There may well be stable differences--between individuals inthe disposition to seek information or knowledge, and these may be linked to traits suchas creativity (Mnw & yaw; 1970), or to more denerai aspects of cognitive style (Ashtein;----op. cit., chapter 7). However, curiosity is necessarily expressed about something, and thedeterminin6 role of the cognitive and motivational factors outlined above is likely to beat least as great as that of a general curiosity trait. To cite an illustration of the confusionthat can follow from ignoring this point, the fact that teachers' ratings of children'scuriosity are consistently correlated with intelligence test scores (e.g. Maw 81, Maw, 1964).has led Langevin (op. cit.) to conclude that 'teachers misidentify the brighter Child as the.curious one.' (p. 369). On the present argument, the brighter child will tend to be thecurious one in the classroOrn; he should be expected to be better equipped to expressinterest in curriculum content, and studies of classroom questioning (e.g. Fahey & Corey,1941; Pritchard, 1970) suggest that this is generally the case. Another point that shouldbe made in thiS regard is that curiosity should be influenced by specific as well as 4eneralinformation-processing capacity, with the result that individuals be differentially .curious about different subject-matter areas, though this could also stem from differentviews of what is worth knowing.RelevariceNotions of 'relevance' or 'value', based on external factors, have been distinguished fromconflict as a source of motivation for seeking and assimilating information: subjectsapparently expressed interest partly because they considered information aboUt the.experi-ments to b.e we :tif having. Ashton similarly noted a distincticin between 'curiosity' and'interest': children asked questions about her museum objects either because they werestrange and unfamiliar or.because they were similar to things which had interested thempreviously.In very general terms,, any form of motivation or reinforcement owes its effectsto making learning worthwhile; an experimental animal, for example, will acquirejhoseresponses which are relevant to the satisfactiai of hunger or the termination of pain, justas schoolchildren, as Skinner (1969) observes, will learn in order to avoid tho consequencesof not doing so. However, the children in this study did not stand to gain rewards or avoidpunishment as a result of seeking and acquiring information about the experiments: ideasof relevance related dinctly to the content of the materials, and were thus not whollyextrinsic:It is possible that different types of extrinsic incentive may interact with the purelyintrinsic one of conflidt-reduction in different ways. In the present research,.they appearto have operated in a complementary way, and indeed were probably not completelyindependent froth each other.Ausubei top. cit. chapter 10) recommends that schoolsshould exploit extrinsic incentives for learning ;--- competition,:the desire for approval andachievement, rewards and punishments in conjunction:with attempts to foster'cognitive drive', i.e. the desire to know for the sakeof knowing. However, he also stiggoststhat the frequently reported decline in children's curiosi:.y over the school career maystem from an over-emphasis on extrinsic at the expense of intrinsic incentives (see chapter2, section 2.7); in other words, the child develops the attitu0 that the only things that areworth knowing are those which bring about some direCt external benefit for him.The feasibility of the idea that the two sources of motivation can be mutuallyantagonistic is borne out by an.experiment by Deci (1970) who found that students' 113 interest in performing intrinsically interesting tasks solving mechanical puzzles andwriting headlines, for college newspapers -- fell off after they had been provided withmonetary reWards for doing them. Ausubel argues that since meaningful learning canprovide its'own reward, cognitive drive is 'potentially the most important kind ofmotivation in meaningful learning' (p.-367). Although it is seen mainly as a by-product ofsuccessful learning, Auiubel and Robinson (1969, chapter 121 make some tentativesuggestions as to how teachers might utilise discrepancies and apparent contradictions inBcurriculurn.contentlto generate conflict and thus arouse pupils' attention and interim.But how far 'disinterested' curiosity arising from conflict can co-exist with externalreinforcement contingencies, and under what conditions it is incompatible with them;are problems that require further empirical consideration. 114 References Ashton, P.M.

One of these lines was equal in lengthto the line on the first card, one was much shorter, and the other was much longer. Thesubjects were then asked to say which of these three lines was the same length as the firstone.However, all except one of the group had been secretly told by the Experimenterto give a wrong answer, so that the other subject (the genuine one) would find himselfdisagreeing with all the other members of his group.About one in three of all the genuine subjects ended up agreeing with the rest of _their group,-even though it was quite clear that the answers they were giving were wrong. .Do you find this very interesting/quite interesting/only sightly interesting/dull/very dull /1_ (Tick the one that is true for you) Your questions:1.(Space was left for ten questions) 10. Experiment 2Infant monkeys. were reared intages without their mothers, but each cage wasprovided with two imitation mothers, one made out of wire netting with a wooden blockfor the head, the other made from a big block of wood, and covered in sponge andtowelling cloth. Either one of the imitation mothers could be fitted with a feeding bottle,which could be placed in the centre of its breast.It turned out that the infants would always spend much more of their timeclinging to the cloth-covered mother, even if they could only get fed by the wire oneSometimes, when they wanted to be fed, they would even cling to the cloth mother, andlean over and suck at the bottle attached to the wire mother. Experiment 3Subjects were asked to sit in front of a white screen, and asked to imagine apicture, say, of a banana being displayed on the screen. Then, without the subject knowing,a very faint picture of a banana would be projected onto the screen with a slide projector.All the subjects, who were university students, said afterwards that the picturewhich they saw on the screen was the one which-they had imagined; none of them realisedthat there was in fact a real picture on the screen.Experiment -4Hungry chimpanzees were taught how to put a counter into a slot-machine to getout a grape or a raisin, and they were then given the chance to pull very heavy boxes Intotheir cages in order to get counters which were hidden in them. 117 The chimps would pull in these boxes even if they.were not able to use thecounters in the slot-machine immediately; they would hoard large numbers of them,patiently waiting for the chance to spend them.Later, the Experimenter taught the chimps to use a red counter to get food, a blueone to get water, and a white one to get out of their cages and have a run round. Then,the chimps would work hardest for whatever colour counter would satisfy their greatest Experiment 5A subject speaks into a microphone connected to a tape recorder. The taperecorder ps the speech back to the subject through a pair oearphones, but before itdoes so, it stqres it for a fraction of a second, so that there is a short delay between thetime the subject speaks a word and the time he hears itAs a result of this delay, the subject falters and stutters in his speech, and he mayeven be forced to stop speaking entirely. Experiment 6A method often used by psychologists to study the brains of animals is to drill atiny hole through the animal's skull in order to stick a very fine length of wire into itsbrain; a weak electric current can then be passed, through the wire.A psychologist in Canada did this with some rats, and foundthat if the wire wasstuck into a certaii: part of the brain, thr rats seemed to enjoy receiving this slight electric'shock.The rats seemed to enjoy it so much that if they were put into a cage where they.were allowed to press a lever which would switch on the current for a fraction of a second,they wouldpress the lever over 5,000 times in an hour. Some would even go on pressingthe lever non-stob for twenty hours, until they finally dropped from exhaustion. Experiment 7The Experimenter shows a six yearold child two beakers of the same size, eachfilled to the top with water. He asks the child, \"Is there the same amount of water in thetwo beakers?\" The child'agrees that there is. The Experimenter then pours all the waterfrom one beaker-into-a long, thin bottle, and all the water from the other beaker into a-short, fat bottle. He then asks the child, \"Suppose you are very thirsty and want to drinkthe water in one of the bottles. Is there just as much water in each bottle?\"The child answers that there is more water in the !Ong, thin bottle becatue it isbigger. Another six year old says that there is more; in the short, fat bottle, because it isbigger. No six year old realises that there is actually the same amount of water in bothbottles. Experiment 8----A- number of.coikroachei were kept in separate cages,.and if they went to a certaincorner of their cage, they would be given an e:ectric shock through the floor. They soonlearnedhot to go into that corner. Next, half of the cockroaches were placed in a dark,danip passageway where they remained quite still for 24 hotirs, while the other half wereleft in dry, brightly-lit cages. 118 When they were tested again, the cockroaches who had been kept in' the passagewayremembered not to go into the corner of-the cage where they had received the shock, whilethe other half had to learn this all over agamti Experiment 9Albert was an 11 -month old child who was very fond of animals. When he was showna white rabbit, he was delighted and made no effort to get away from it. Later, he wasshown a white Mouse, and at the same time, somebody suddenly banged .a gong behind him.This had the expected' ffect he shrank back in fear. This happened a few more times.Then, he was shown the white rabbit again.. But this time he was scared of it andtried to get away from it. Later, he was shown other white furry objects: He was frightenedby all of them, even by a man with a white beard. Experiment .10The Experimenters set up a wooden madel of a duck and by remote control madeit move around a track, making quacking' noises. They then showed the model to newly-hatched ducklings for ten minutes.If the ducklings were shown the model between twelve and seventeen hours afterthey hatched, they would follow it round the track as if it was their mother. If they wereshown the model a little earlier or a little later after hatching, they were not so likely to dothis. Sources of the descriptions1..Asch, S.E.

Open question's are those which areintroduced by an interrogative word and which may receive a large variety of differentanswers, while closed questions are those requiring a yes or no answer.2.What sort of information they request Eight referential categories were used,and those are labelled according to an initial letter as follows:E.Requesting an explanation of the results of the experiment.P.Requesting information about the purpose of the experiment, or whatit proves or demonstrates..J.Requesting a justification of the experimental procedure, or part of it.D.Requesting more detailed information regarding the procedure orresults.'C.Requesting information about the consequences of the experiment fcrthe subjects.M.Suggesting a manipulation or modification of the independent 'variables.-G.Requesting information,about the inter- or intra-species generalittofthe results.S.Registering surprise at, or some affective response to, some aspect ofthe experimentTo obtain a check on reliability, the responses of eight subjects two from eachgroup -- were coded by two scorers.

When we conduct investigatiOns under laboratory conditions we horsetrade, accepting the advantages of stricter control in exchange for effects of the unnat-uralness of the settings on people's behaviour. Whether to observe natural variations ormanipulate them is a false dilemma, weakly resolved by. arguing 'it all depends .strongly resolve&by requiring that both be done and consistency of results achieved.If Berlyne's theory applies only to babies staring at geometrical shapes, it is less immed-iately relevant to educational practice than if it can be proved robust enough to survivethe hurly-burly Of the classroom. To supplement and complement the investigations weconducted' with specially designed materials administered in controlled settings, weput out enquiries about ongoing special activities, with questions, we sough.: to evalyatethe consequences of attendance on courses, and we talked-with teenagers.There are snags about Ahese pursuits. Many more such ventures are likely tobe launched than will sail. The effect of the high mortality rate is accentuated by ahigh incidenCe of shipwrecksduring the voyage, stemming from administrative muddlesand losses of crucial information which then marr otherwise satisfactory investigations.We advertised in 'Dialogue', we asked around, and managed to carry through tocompletion the investigations reported in this chapter. No replies at all cane from ourplea in 'Dialogue', but word of mouth produced mare response. Six activities are covered.The question-answer exchange in the home (4.1) was thought to be significant for thetheory edvanced in chapter 2 and to have direct possibilities of transfer to educationalsettings. The evaluation of, the two courses (4.2, 4.3) both involved children undertakingunfamiliar experiences, and seemed to be admirably suited to our interests. In neithercase were the organisers primarily interested in curiosity, although' both were hopingin part to cultivate and direct interests: Our informal conversations (4.4, 4.5) wereoriginally intended to servn as breeding grounds for ideas of investigations to conduct.We hoped that such contact would help to foment subtle methods of measuringboredom and eliciting or stimulating questions. This forlorn hope is transmuted intosuch general pointS of interest as were thrOwn up in the settings.The Head of a Science Department wrote in to say he had instituted questionanswer sessions in his department. Periodically pupils would write out individualquestions on slips of paper. These would be handed in and he would endeavour toanswer them on the spot The original idea had been to provide pupils with ananonymous context in which to ask questicits about Health. Education, particularlyabout sexual matters, but this activity had broadened into the realms at generalscience. Since these sessions had become part of the woof warp of teiehing, theymay be considered relatively natural, and we conducted some analyses of these Ka 4.1. Early Experience in the Home (J. Arnold & W.P. Robinson) 4.1.1.Children's Questions and MOtherS' Answers: Study IIntroduction and Method.The study of goings -on at home was not covered by .our terms of reference, but whenan opportunity of obtaining a large, if biased, sample of mothers presented itself, itwas easy to think of sound reasons for moving beyond the school environment. The laws and explanations of behaviour that psychologists pursue are not specific to confinedenvironments. The factors relevant will operate in the same fashion both at home andin school. The relationships obtaining between the behaviour of mothers and questionsposed to them by their children will obey the same principles as those which govern theteacher-child situation. Given our general ignorance about the determinants of theincidence and quality of children's questions, and the administrative difficulties ofinvestigating some aspects oftheprOblem in schools, the opportunity of gaining.theco-Operation of several hundred mothers through an appeal on the BBC 'Woman'sHour' programme was too good to miss.We asked mothers to Complete diaries of thirty nine successive 'wh' questionsasked by their children along with the answers they gave. With the aid of somequestionnaires we hoped to achieve the following;1.A descriptio;1 of the incidence and type of questions asked by children ofseveral age and social class groups. A subsidiary consequence of this analysisshould have been'some indication of the major areas of interest of childrenof various ages.2.An analysis of correlates and possible determinants of the questions childrenask.Three levers of examination, were envisaged in.terms of:Variations in maternal strategies of answering questions asked._NIIndividual differences in maternal attitudestowards child rearing.(iii)Sociological based differences.For the first and second or these, we had no previously validated measuringinstruments that could be included in the study, andwe had to construct what we hopedwould be useful indices from the data collated.The aim of the project was to collect and examine examples of the qUestion andanswer exchange between children and their mothers within the home. Nearly twohundred and fifty mothers returned varied amounts of information of whom two hundredand seventeen had recorded one question or'morelfrom their children of primary schoolage. Respondents had been asked to record a total of thirty nine questins threeinstances each Of questions beginning with 'where', .tiut many scripts were incerriplete. Thiswas understandable in view of the nature of the operation which required the writing downof spontaneous questiOnt and answers with no/controlover the time or place that a questionand answer exchange might'occur and only our written instructions as a guide. Althoughmothers had also been asked to note times and dates of questions, this infOrmation was ,so incomplete that we had to abandon hopes of finding out anything about the rate atwhich different children were asking questiOns,Respondents were also asked to provide background information about their workand education, and to indicate their views/oil 1.;Iree.different questionnaires designed toasseistheir attitudeS to child rearing, inclUding their expectations for the development ofselfgeliance in their children and the importance they placed upon the role of language in.bringing up children. This information was asked for because it was hoped to relatematernal attitudes to child rearing to the quettions askedby children and with the answersgiven by mothers.As several mothers had sent in question and answer diaries for more than oneChild, examples of questions-had come from three hundred and three cNidren altogether, 128 of whom one hundred and sixty nine were boys and one hundred and thirty four girls.Nearly 6,000 initial questions beginning with the specified interrogative words had been ,Lrecorded, and on many occasions further questions arose in related dialogue. A pre-liminary examination of these records showed that the majority of questions had comefrom younger children, particularly the five to seven year old age group.While all the records were of interest, the sheer number of questions, the agerange of the children asking the questions, and,the variation in the number of questionsrecorded per child, posed problemS for the analysis, of these data. It was thereforedecided to select a sample of fifty question and answer diaries where thirty or_morequestions had been recorded, and as, far as possible to maximise the similarity of ageof the children concerned. The analysis was conducted in two stages:1.All questions from a sample of fifty children aged five to seven wereexamined and categorized together with their mothers' answers and anyrelated dialogue.2.The scores on the three attitude sched6les of the fifty' mothers of thesechildren were submitted to a co. rrelational analysiS in an attempt toidentify and correlate specific attitude clusters to yarious aspects of bring-ing up children. Comparisons were then made between the records ofdiffering groups of respondents according to the attitudes expressed,the children's questions, and the mothers' answering behaviour. .7\"-ResultsQuestions andAnswers.The children's questions. The total number questions recorded for thissiample offifty children was 2,127. Wherfstudying these questions we were interested, in threemain characteristics: the form of th\\e question, the focus of the quesAon, and theapparent purpose of the Child in posing each question. Every question was categorizedas sirriple or complex in its grammatical structure, a simple question, being expressed,in one main clause, while a complex question contained more than one verb. The .-majority of questions (72%) fmm this sample of fifty children were simple in form,though not necessarily in content (e.g. Who made God?). Examinations of the focusof the content of qbestions shoed that more than half the questions were concernedwith the immediate environment,#parently stimulated by people; objects or activitieswithin the home or within the here-,and-now situation of the child. A further quarterreflected interest in matters outside 'the child's own experience, often relating togeneral knowledge, while about half i is number again were categorized as abstract,referring to theoretical ideas and, princi ,let,Abstract questions were more numerousthan self-centred questions indicating perhaps that this age group is moving away-fromthe self-centred stage of development; becoming less concerned with themselves anddisplaying more interest in less tangible matters. However the, immediate environment :-remained the predoMinant foCus of questioning (see section 4.6. for further informationabout this topic), Each question was categorized according to the'apparent -purpose of the child in asking it.-While it may be true that children sometimes usequestions in -a manipulative fashion to gain attention, suill intentions could not beclearly inferred from these data. The.porpose ascribecrio each question was derivedfrom the content of the questiOn itself. It appeared that the predominant purpose ofthese children in asking questions (90%) was to seek information. The range of 129 information sought was extensive, from the comings and goings of daily life (e.g. Who wasthat on the phone?) to questions of general knowledge (e.g. Which is the fastest thing inthe world ?). The remaining ten per cent of questions reflected other purposes, such asseeking advice, instruction, action, opinion, reassurance, or expressing protest.Naturally occurring questions would seem to provide examples of a childinitiating a conversation with another person. -If, when he asks his rhother'questions,he becomes accustomed to receiving answers which satisfy him, and/or stimulate himto further thought, he may be more likely to use questions as instruments of learningrather than just a means A gaining attention. He may learn to direct his questions withincreasing precision, providing himself with a useful tool for solving problems.The mothers' answers.The context of asking as well as the content of questionspresumably affected the answers given by mothers, but as this could not be assessed inany way, the question aild answer exchanges were analysed in isolation, ignoring thissource of variation.The two main aspects of answers considered were the tactics mothers adoptedin.response to their children's questions and the occurrence of certain features in theiranswers. A childwilLneed answers of_orderend clarity to help him to build up andConsolidate representations of experience and knowledge, and the majority of theseanswers (70%) were definite and clearcut. But not everything in the world can be neatlyordei-ed and explained on all occasions, and answers were sometimes couched in morehesitant terms, using tokens of uncertainty such as 'I think' or 'perhaps', white conditionalanswers illustrated the dependence of one fact, processor idea upon another. Inevitably,mothers cannot always answer their children's questions, their lack of specific knowledgepossibly being one main 'limitation; in several instances mothers admitted ignorance butwent on to offer tentative answers or suggest wayi of finding thernout.The featurei of answering behaviour noted were intended to reflect what amother was tryng to do with her answer. The most frequent response to a question wasto provide the speCific information requested, but mothers would often attemtp toextend their children's interest and knowledge, going beyond the immediate demandsof a question. They could also add meaning to their answers by relating them to theirchildren's previous experience and knowledge, or by explaining the existence of under-lying principles. In such ways they could suggest a synthesis of information rather than,simply offering a collection of arbitrary fem. It may alto assist a child's understandingif his obseryations of speCific phenomena can be linked together with other things,dernOnstrating the operation and interaction of processes. An interesting example of ananswer containing three different features occurred in answer to the question 'What isa shadow?' 'It is a sort of gap in the sunshine. Look: See the sun shining on this book.If I put my hand over it the sun shines on my,hand but not thrOugh it So There is ahandshaped space in the sunshine under it, and that is a shadoW\"...Attempts to control children's behaviour directly also appeared in answers, andwhile these might be regarded as-inhibiting for a child, such instances often-prdVided\"examples of-the way in which disCipline situations can offer Children opportunities forlearning, especially when reasons rather than unsupported corrimands'are gnien forconstraints upon behaviour. Another feature noted was the encouragement given bymothers to independent thought, action- or observations, in providing' hildien withstimulating answers rather than simply-satisfying ones. 'zWhile the tactics employed and the features present in an answerdepended upon. the nature of the question; they also reflected a mother's willingness to answer and .illustrated her ability to do so. Appropriate and explicit answers to a child's questionsmay help him to build up a store of knowledge about the physical and sodal worldwhich he can relate to whatever circumstances present themselves. He may learn to usehis questioning ability to try to fill gaps in his knowledge and integrate new experiences.Relationships between the attitude questionnaires, the children's questions and theanswers given by mothersAttitude questionnaires. The various questionnaires filled in were about children'sself-reliance and achievement, the importance of language in bringing up children, and anumber of more general beliefs about child rearing. When we looked at the latter to seehow these attitudes went together the simplest (and over-simplified) contrast was betweenwhet we might cal! child-centred and good behaviour-centred attitudes.* Child-centredattitudes were made up of a laissez-faire approach, flexibility, preparedness to admitmistakes and allow disagreements, giving maximum freedom for the individual child todevelop. The 'good behaviour' approath emphasized the need to bring order andstructure into the child's life, initially creating as simple a world as possible for him toadjust to.It appeared from comparisons among these questionnaires that mothers whowere more child-centred were more likely to stress the importance of language whenbringing up children, and expected their children to join in adult conversations and makedecisions about their own affairi at an earlier age. But at the same time they had lowerexpectations about their children achieving early self-reliance and doing well at school.Maternal attitudes and answering behaviour. When we looked to see whether motherswho expressed contrasting attitudes on the questionnaires also differed with respect tothe answers they gave to their childiten's questions we found very few differenom Thegroup of mothers expressing more child-centred attitudes were more likely to go beyondproviding the specifiC information required by questions, attempting to extend theirchildren's interest and knowledge. Mothers who stressed the importance of language inbringing up children had recorded more related dialogue folloWing initial question andanswer exchanges, and had also provided more answers explaining hOw things worked.The group of mothers expecting earlier self-reliance from their children had recordedmore examples in their answers of the encouragement of independent thought or action,turning a question back on a child to think of an answer, or suggesting he seek his ownanswer, often providing guidance as to where this might be found.Maternal attiiudes and children's question& Children of mothers who stressed early selfrelian'ce tended to ask more, questions focused upon themselves and the immediateenvironment, and fewer concerned with the wider environment or abStract matters, Theyalso asked more qUestions expressing protest than the children of mothers who hadreported less concern for early self-reliance; these children had asked more abstractquestions as well as more questions relating to general knowledge. Similarly mothersstressing the importa*Cdflanguigiliad-Childffri-CMiciseiiiiiitialisTWireriiiiii likely tofocus on problems beyond the immediate situation. 'We of course pass no judgement. Any label we select may be taken by readers to implythat something is good or load, but that is not our intention. 131 Answers of mothers and questions of children. While all the mothers in this sample had infact answered their children's questions in accurate and appropriate ways, it was possibleto separate out those who, had offered comparatively fuller and more informative answers.We selected a'group of mothers whose answers more often contained one or more of thefollowing features: attempts to extend a child's interest and knowledge, the relating of-answers to a child's previous experience, the encouragement of independent thought.action or observation, and the demonstration of underlying principles or processes inoperation. Mothers whose answers contained a higher proportion of theiifeatures hadchildren whO asked more complex questions and who were more likely to ask questionsseeking advice or instruction.If we turn this problem round and lOok at how the answers of mothers differed forchildren who asked many as oppOsed to feW complex questions had mothers who more .often attempted to extend their Children'S interest and knOwledge, relating answers to:their ehildrcres previous experience, and demonstrating underlying principles and pro-cesses in' operation. These mothers Were alio more likely to offer hesitant or conditionalanswers, suggesting perhaps areas of doubt to be explored.Tliis finding illustrates the relevance of a mother's answers to her child's-questioningability. It would appear, that the ways in which mothers answered questions provided.better evidence for prediction of their children's questioning behaviour than the attitudesthey expressed on the questionnaire& From a child's point of viewitmightbe suggestedthat the more often a child'S.OUestion initiates a discussion with his mother or anotheradult, the more opportunities he will receive for expressing hii own skills in langUage andquestion asking, and the more experienCe he will gain in listening to and making sense of\"the replies he receives. Now attitudes are related to such behaviour we have yet to fin Iout. DiscussionA number of the initial goals had:tobe abandoned in the light of the data obtained. Anyexamination of correlates of the rate of question-asking was precluded for the reasonsstated. No analysis of social class differences could be made, because insufficient WCmothers volunteered. No-analysis of age differencei could be made for because only thefive to seven age group was represented in sufficient numbers.Give these limitations, however, we have, een able to show relationships betweenchildren's questions, and mothers' answers. But is this a causal relationihip? theattemptrtoeXtend knowledge, the attempts to relate answers to the child's previousexperience, etc. that cause the child to ask more complex questions? While thii'mightbe the most obVious guess, it is also possible that it is the child who has set the pace; hisindefatigable questioning stimulating mothers to offer a wider range of answers of'causingmothers to adapt to his needs if they are to enjoy reasonable peace and quiet More likely,the two are interdependent and interact. To provide a setof empirically-based answers..........:_teasing-out:the-causal-network-would-require-a-number-of-furtherinvestigations-Jn-themeantime,: we might feel constrained to take theiiieW,that answers given do influencesubsequent questions.To transfer the results tolhe school situation, the implication would be thatteachers wish to increase the questioning skills of their children, they should answer thequestions posed along the lines outlined above. The sampled underlyinj attitudes ofmothers seem to have less relevance to,children's questions than do thqir answeringtactics. It may be that we failed to tap the relevant attitudes or that our instruments for 132 measuring these were inadequate. A second possibility is that thereptay be a'sufficientdegree of.cliscontinuity between attitudes held and behaviour manifested to renderattitudes poor predictors of performance. If this is so and one is interested in developing .questioning skills in children, then it would seem sensible to concentrate on teachinganswering skills rather than certain types of attitudes Attitudes without associatedopportunities and skills, are of no significance to the behavioUr of others.If the preferred interpretation of these resuits is satisfactory, then we cannotclaim to have done much more than substantiate what mythical commonsense wouldhave told us before'We set out HoweVer, it is doubtful that adult answerers of children'squestions, be they teachers or mothers, observe the principles as much as they might; 4.1.2 Children's Questions and Mothers' Answers.: Study IIOur .follow -up of this study was instituted to examine, this question-answer exchangefurther. How do aspects of maternal answering relate both to children's quettioningand to their answering? Can we build up a portrait of the strategies which optimise thechild's development? Following upon the last study and the arguments adyanced inchapter 2 (section 2.7.4), we had to expect that LWC children would ask fwerquestionsof a more elementary nature (concrete, perceptual attributes, simple structure) and. offerless knowledge in their answers.. Method.Subjects. The school at Which arrangements were made was able to furnish only UWCchildren in sufficient numbers and of such ability for matches with MC children to befeasible. Ten UWC boys and ten girls were interviewed with their mothers and werethen given Raven't Progressive Matrices. A Predominantly MC school wet tlien contactedand 'en MC boys and ten MC girls were selected on Raven's Progressive Matrices to givematched groups (not pairs). They were then interviewed with their mothers. Refusalswere few, co-operation warm.Material& A model Cash Register containing new and old money was selected because thenew coinage had just been introduced and was therefore topical. Pairs of objects (Avocado:pear, banana; eggtirner sandglais; pinger; African drum, horse chestnut conker, cedar cone)were used to encourage the mothers to make comparisons, both of similarity and differ-ence. One of each pair was assumed to be familiar to all,the other less So. A large colour-.fur Picture depicted characters from some nine nursery rhymes, each playing somecharacteristic aspect of their appointed roles. It was expected that all children would beacquainted with a sufficient number of these to make it viable as a discussion object, andthat they would-be sufficiently unfamiliar with others for there to be gaps in their know-ledge.that their questions might attempt to fill. The original Question/Answer game wehad:in mind proved unviable. In the end we had a set of questions which'we first askedchildren and then tried to get them to refer onto their.mothers.The foregoing okijects and activities were not intended to be such that.MC childrenand mothers-would be more familiar with them; but we included a Family Allowance .Book as something more likely to make a weekly and significant appearance in WC than-MC faMilies, and a Bingo Card as a WC rather than a MC leisure pursuit The ColouredProgressive Matrices of Raven were usesil to provide intelligence test scores. 133 Procedure: The precise procedure is described in our extended account (Robinson & Arnold,.1973), and since the details differed for each task, a summary is best made by reference to theprinciples rather than the specifics of the administration. The interviewees first problern wasto'prevent the developmentof an atmosphere of 'formal testing' for either child or mother.The project was presc.,:itM us an enquiry into the sorts of questions children ask .and theirreasons for assking them rd this was justified'in,terrris of the knowledge being of posiiblevalue inrendering school work both more interesting and productive. After a preainblethat funnelled down to the specific tasks, certain rules governed the 'administration: a naturaland.easy flow of speech and activity was the primary goal; children.were encouraged to say.what they knew. ,and to play with the objects; they were told to direct questiontthey hadtO, their motheil. The interviewer intervened only when necessary. A final set of demo-graphic questions, was. posed to mothers; All speech was recorded and notes were made ofrelevant non - verbal acts..Treatment of Results. Speech. was transcribed and the incidence of relevant categories notedfor both mothers and children. In view,of.the nature of the scoring, categories and.thewide variation in-their incidenoe-of occurrence,' non- parametric statistics were used. ResultsChildren's Questions. While there were no social class differences in the number of questionsasked by children `overall,Ihe questions of the MC chit ren were more complek; morevaried and longer. Analysis for each task,separately sh wed up,nothing more Of majorinterest..Children's StaLments. MC children uttered more task-related statements, were more likelyto answer questions addressed to them by their mothers, and were more likely to confesstheir ignorance on the CaSh Register topic..Contessions of ignorance, total output, correctlabelling, and 'other commentewere more frequent among them on the Pairs of Objectstask. In the Answering Questions, they gave fewer disjointed and only weakly semanticallyassociated answersarid more appropriate answers. To the Nursery Rhyme picture theyuttered more words And indulged in more specific labelling. On two tasks they used moretokens of uncertainty.This greater display of knowledge by the MC children did not occur for the Bingo,Card _and Family Allowance book; the trend was in the reverse direction.-Mothers' Behaviour. Analyses were conducted within and not across tasks, but with theexceptions to be mentioned, the following differencei we're found. MC mothers weremore generous in their provision of cognitive meaning; they'made more informativestatements and these were more likely to be related to the child's previous experienCe,mOre.iikely to extend his kno:Medge and interest, and more likely to involve comparisons.They posed more questions to their children. They proVided more, correcting and en-couraging feedback. They were more likely to maintain a theme for more than fourutterances. UWC mothers were more likely simply to repeat things their children hadsaid, and their children were Morejikely to echo their mother's remarks.With the Bingo C :rd Family AllOwanCe Books; statements than did MC mothers.ftelationships beiviven Behayiour of Mothers and Children, .For both MC and UWC Child/mother pairs separately and for the totai sample, there were significant correlations._between children's:statements and children's questions on the one hand and &Summary U134-_ indeX of mothers' provision of cognitive meaning, corrective feedback and erauragingfeedbaCk. For children's questions the correlation overall was.0.69 (N = 40, p G .001),for statements it was 0.67 (N = 40, p < .001). Question-asking by mothers was nassociated with the questions and statements of their children. 4Evaluation and ConclusionsAlthough the results Pbtaine-d-testify to the usefulness of the coding categories used andthe theoretical framework underlying them, there arboth procedural and theoreticalworries outstanding. .-,- -Our decision to include 'working class materials' answers some qustions, butposes others. A detailed inspection of results showed that UWC mothers provided moreinformation for their children on these tasks than did MC mothers. However, there was noevidence of a difference in the two other aspects of 'provisibn of cognitive meaning', thesetting in past, experience and the extension beyond the present question. For 'askingquestions of the child', the general class differences were preserve& Our weak conclusionmust be that certain class differences in mothers' interaction's with their children aretopic-independent; bUt that others are not; one instance of the latter is that whereknowledge is available and its transmission deemed appropriate, it will be provided byUWC mothers. Clearly, what is needed is a speCific attack on this problem, possiblyinvolving differential and systematic teaching olknowledge to mothers followed by, anexamination of their teaching and its efficacy. From the point of viewof this problemthe weakness of the Hess and Shipman study (1967) lay in their reliance upon only two simpletasks both of which had a middle class flavour, while the weaknesi here lies in not testingmothers for their knowledge and attitudes before we looked at what they passed ontotheir children.Another procedural worry was our decision to meet deadlines bY'continuing withan upper working class saMple rather than by hunting out the lower working dais. Wealso failed to control intelligence test scores as dosely as we would have wished andalthough the inter-group differences were norksignificant, such variation in scores wasadding to within-group variance on other comparisons. In. particular, it is unclear howfar social class differences in socialisation practices reed to be analysed separately foreach sex .a Our results did fail to confirm our main prediction of a lower rateof questioningamong WC children. We have no ready answer. An argument that this was because wehad UWC rather than LWC mothers and-children cannot be sustained becauie we did findsome of the social class differences in maternal behaviour that werethoUght to berelevant to the developrhent and maintenance of curiosity in children as expressed inquestioning, and thesocial psychological analysis gave high correlations (substantiallyhigher than we would have expected): inspection of individual protocols of childrenrevealed very wide individual differences; four children asked two,Or fewer question'sfour.asked more than forty. TwoC boys were very high on questioning, the only MCchild who was very low was' not so much incurious as very withdrawn. A different taskmight point to differentials in knowledge about-the topics; because MC children knewmore about the topics, there were fewer features for them to.ask queitions abbut? Itmight be the case that the curiosity of children is relatively resilient toinadequate answers,but that the long-term effects of differential provision of knowledge and feedback Will-result in a lower curiosity among WC children. However, this was not apparent hemIf these weaknesses reduced the value of the results at a sociological level of 135 analysis, they were not releYant to the very strong associations between the behaviour of'mothers and children at:the social psychologiCal level.' Here the results were impressive.Although there were social class differentes in Muthers' behaviour, but not in the number'of questions asked by their chiidren, these two were highly correlated' With each question-aiking torelate to the:children's behaviour helps to bring differentiation into the situation and thepresent preferred interpretation would be as follows: 'the development of children'sknowledge is achieved by 'pulling' rather than 'pushing\": If we conceive_of the mother asan initiator of activity and a source of knowledge that. can be tapped, it is the latterrole which is relevant to the child's acquiiition of knowledge. The Categories of maternalbehaviour. relevant to the child's knowledge and questions werethote that allowed thechild to decide what to do with it althoUgh knowledge was also made assimilable byrelating it to past experience:its production by the child was.met with correction orconfirmation, and it was extended. Maternal pushing and testing did not relate to thechildren's behaviour. This is not tosay that mothers cannot engage the interest of theirchildren is one activity rather than anOther, bit it does make it seem likely that althoughmothers may be able to lead them there, the children decidewhat to drink. Educational Implications .Cursorily we may remind ourselves that in these tons the 'attitude' measuresprovided much weakercorreiatas-ofchi dren's behaviour thandid..the reports andobservations-olVhat mothers did. By analogy, studies of Classroom interaction would beexpected to relate more closely 'to pupil behaviour than would Measures of the attitudesof teachers.Social class acted as a strong separator of both mothers and children along thelines anticipaied for the quality of questions and quantity of statements 9ffered,bychildren and the strategies and tactics adopted by mothers. The single exception isivZOretically awkward, but socially reassuring. The number of questions children askedis unrelated to social class, as in Heber's study OM. Although this is inconsistentWih the specific predictions made, it is not immediately damaging to the cognitivedevelopmental /reinforcement amalgam proposed as a Mode/ of child, deVelopment. Wecould \\ uggest, that the intrinsic. motivational factors were still strong enough to be uniriflUenby the reinforcement schedules belieyed to exist in WC homes. While a wish. toconfoto the demands of the ex0erinenter may have been a factor in Heber'sinvestigatither'e was no sign of its intrusion into ours: Our children were UWC ratherthan LWC.far as educational practice is concerned, we are forced to conclude, protem, that ther are no social class differences in the prope.nsity to ask questions at ageseven; the valuef relying on intrinsic rr,tiipaiion to telp children learn can be treated asclass independent.Noting the a ose associations between certain aspects of the mothers' behavioUrand the children's ctuioning and answering we strategies'approach leerng opportunities. The situationsdiffer in importarit ways, but itmay be helpful to pOint o the apparent irrelevance of the rnotheiV questioning. A highincidence of maternal'que doffing was not associated with the children'S behaviour. Wecannot be sure of the intent'on of the, motheri in.asking questions in our sitUation, onePresumably was to draw atte Lion, another to excite curiosity, a third to check what thechildren knew. Without furthe and finer analysis. we must be careful in drawing con-clusions, but we can ask about t e high incidence of the teachers' questions in classrooMs.O Firstly; in a pilot study Barnes (1966) found that factual questions from to hers out-numbered reasoning questions by four to.one. With a topic controlled set o letsons infifteen schools using tenth and twelth grade pupils, Bellak, Khebard, Hym ri & Smith'(1966) found that forty seven per cent of the teachers' ads were 'Solicitations' (mostcommonly questions and commands) and thirty per cent Were 'reactions' to the pupils'responSesiThat is, over eighty per Cent of acts centred around question, answer,evaluation episodes. Even at this late stage, only eleven pier cent nt of the pupils' behaviourwas Made up of 'solicitations'.Dbes this very high incidence of teacher questioning have an educational value?.-Or rather, does it have as much or more than alternati4 activities? Certainly the differ-ences between classrooms and kitchens should .not be Underestimated. Children at homedo not need to be kePt awake by the possibility of a question coming their way; neitherdo other ch;ldren generally have the benefit or otherwise from hearing their replies. But /the critical .queStion of the relationship between teac ere questio.nS and pupils\\ learningis an empirical_ issue that ought to be investigated in atural settings. We ask aboutquestions as an aid to learning in chapter 9, but this was within constraints not normallyoperative in the classroom.In the meantime we can argue that answers to questions, which relate this answerto the past experience of the child, that:not only saver the question posed, but gobeyond it, that move towards explanation in term of principles and processes are /associated with P. higher incidence and greater co plexity of children's questions./Cor-reCtiOn and encouragement of children's stateme tiwaS pOsitively associated with bothquestioning end knowledge exhibited by the children.' ''As we remarked at the end of the section devoted to Study. I, the nature of theseresults may not cause great surprise, but are these principles applied in our interactionswith other people, in particular when we are in a teaching role? . 4.2 A Weak-end of Cross-CultUral Sttidiet IntrOduction--The Newsom .Group adviser of the LEA, and the headmaster of a.local neighbourhoodcomprehensive school arianged_ for about thirty fifth formersto spend Week-end in acountry.

With only five boys in the experimental group we decided to .confine our analysis to, girls. This is not inconsistent with decisions taken in otherstudies where social class comparisons are sometimes based on very small numbers. Inthose studies, flexible indiVidual interviews rather than group administered structuredquestionnaires were used.Certain preliminary steps had to be taken before data could be processed. Item9 on a Fate which contrasted 'life being O.K. (their phrase not ours) as it is with lifebeing better if what we ought to do were more precisely specified' seemed to be differentin' substance from most d, the other a Fate items; it does not contrast fate with personal&introl and responsibility. It was dropped. Items 3 and 7 were,scOred 1 for the hostileand 0 for the friendly choice and added together to give Q. Hos. Fatalistic choices on allother items were scored 1 to give a Q. Fate score.To obtain a measure of conformity to group norms and therefore presumedconcern with these, a count was made of all choices of each option for all girls on();Norm.

They were also classified, but the incidence ofoccurrence. was too low overall 'fir this to be useful. .The questions were counted and clasiffied for each topic, although only thoseabout India, Pakistanis, RuSsians and Biafrans were in fact used. Five attributes ofquestions were recorded:1.Hostile: Any question With an explicit derogatory premiss.2./Ethnocentric: Any question that was posed either from a British perspectiveI or assumed that some British custom was more natural or proper.3. /General: Any question that assumed that a single attribute could be appliedto all members of the group identified.LtSimple Genuine: A requestfor information rather than an implicit protest5.Informed: A question could contain accurate knowledge about the topic./ 6.Cultural: Where the question did not focus on a particular person or a waretc., butasked about the cultural norms and problems and resourcesof thatculture, this category was scored. Results./Rfliability of Instruments. To cut down on the number of calculations to be performed( nd the complexity of the write-up), we combined the experimental and control gorupsf girls and correlated scores at t1 with those at t2. Any differential change in the groupswould therefore lead to underestimations of reliability. All correlations were significantand all except that for the two items Q. Hos. indicated a fair measure of stability:O. Fate, r = .70, p < .005; Q. Hos., r = .30, p < .05; O. Norm, r = .54, p < .005;Q. AdV. ( item 4), r = .65, p< .005; a Fes., r = .62, p < .005 (N = 32).Withthese consistencies established we can enquire into the antecedents andcorrelations of both friendliness and other Oink: groups and variations in the rate andtypes of questions. Friendliness to Other Ethnic Groups 1 _.Pre-course Differences between Experimental and Control Groups. Only one instrumentshowed up a difference: Group E was'more fataliatic than Group C (X E = 4.67, XC = 3.5;U -= 63, z = 2.12, p = .034). That this was not .a freak result is supported by thefindingthat this same difference emerged in the post-test measures. Neither the questions Q.,Ou. nor the willingness to stay witha Persian family showed differences.Changes between Pm- and Post-course Measures. It was suggested in the introductionthat two coMparitons might be made in responses; both Et2 Eti and Et2Ct2allowed estimates Of course effectiveness: To simplify.the comparative process a thirdcombinatory tactic was used; namely E (Et, t.1)E (Ct2t1). That is, each person'sdifference score was calculated. None of the questionnaires yielded any differentialchange. O. Adv. showed nine GrOup E, but only four Group C girls becoming Moreadventurous (X2 = 1.32, N.S.). Since forty seven per cent of the girls were alreadyhappy to stay for a fortnight with a Persian family on the first administratian, to haveexpected any differential change on this single item would have been overly optimistic. 143 On the post-test measure of approach tothelndianfamily neadoor Group Egirls wen.; more.'friendly' than those of Group C (RE XC = 1.16; ,U = 69, z = 2.21,p = .027)..Group E also foresaw more difficulties in 1.3, XC F 0.3;U= 79.5, z= 2.22, p.026).These results encouraged. us to believe. that the course had indeed had someeffect, but perhaps we could go further, and find out who in.Group E had'been mostsusceptible to change. Accordingly, scores on each of the questionnaires were dividedinto high andlOw sets, high being defined as above a cut-oft levelwhich included fiftyper cent or -fewer of thesample. The question was.then posed as to whether these groupsdiffered in their responses on Q.. Ind.0. Fate, Q. Norm and Q. Fas..were not associated with Q. Ind., but thosegirlswho made low scores on Q. Hos. were more friendly on Q. Ind. than those who madeLigh ones (U = 10, n, = 5, p2 = 12, p < .05), While those high.on Q. Adv. were M 14, p.< .05). Group C only- Q. Adv. began to be sociMedwith 0. Ind. (U = 11.5; for U = 11.5,p < .05). QuestionsThe numbers of questions asked about India, Russians, Pakistanis and Biafrans on hetwo oc:asions were similar (r4.1.63, Nt-- 32, p < .005), and there was likewise a geti although weaker consistency across the-four topics, girls who asked more about onetopic asking.more about other topics (see Table 4.2.2.).When we sought for associations between these scores and others our initialoptimism quickly flagged. As table 4.2.3. shoWs there was no difference betWeen GroupE and C prior to the week-end course. Table 4.2.2. Rank Order Correlations between Number of Questions askedabout Four Topics (N = 32).

Q. Adv. did not, but 'friendliness to the Indian family' did (iJ = 78, n2 = 15,n, = 17, z = 1.90, p = .057) at did independence from group norms (U = 61, n, = 15,'n2 = 17, p < .02).This unimpressive array could not be improved by eliminating various odd categoriesof question from the total count. 144. Table 4.2.3. Mean Numbers of Types of Question as a Function Participation on a Week-end Course that the mzi ss-media may havebeen relevant to some of the variations in the types of question asked. For example,questions about Biafrans were almost wholly sympathetic, reflects g the bias of themedia at the time .- the war was still in progress. By contrast the uestions aboutPakistanis reflect;; the views of anti-immigration politicians whi h were currentlyreceiving wide coverage in the press and on television. DiscussionAs far as the main manifest objectives of the course were cons ned, the organisers.0 . can be reassured of the worthwhileness of their investment: weeks after attendingthe course, girls expressed a greater vs,illingness and enthusiasm for interacting withIndian neighbours than did girls who had not participated in the activities. That theywere also aware of more difficulties in the interaction substantiates the idea of thecourse having been informative. This is not the whole story, because it was possible toadd that those girls who viewed human nature as beneficient (Q. Hos.) and weremore generally adventurous (Q. Adv.) were the ones most favourably disposed tointeract, Since neither of these questionnaires related to variations on Q. Ind. in thecontrol group, the most simple interpretation would be that the course shifted thewillingness. of those already predisposed to be friendly. Just having the dispositionand iad.,enturousness are insufficient on their own; the course was least effective forthose vrho were more hostile and less adventurous: All three were necessary, no onesufficient, to produce a change.The failure of the more general attitude questionnaires Q. Fate and Q. Fas.)to predict change or reflect may be a consequence of their greater generality. Reflect-ing philosophies of life as they do, it is a little optimistic to expect change in twodays) In the introduction we equivocated about the relevance of peer groups normsto hostility to other ethnic groups. Since such scores were unrelated either toindividual variation or change, it might be safe to conclude that there is no strong_per group norm demanding either acceptance or rejection of other ethnic groups.While.the LEA can be satisfied, the Schools Council Project cannot. Although 145 the questioning was stablcacross topics and time, we were not able to specify correlates.The courte did .not succeed in stimulating interest and curiosity manifested in the.numbeior type of questions asked.Neither did total, questions, infornied questions or genuine questions relate toindividual differences on Rotter's fE Scale or the F scale. Expectations that fatalisticOr authoritarian world-views would inhibit questioning were not fulfilled. Generaladventurousness was not-reflected in wanting to know more about peoples end countries,although for reasons unknown, the expressed Willingness to i'neract with In Indianneighbour was.. One interpretation of the- -relatiOnship between independence of groupnorms and questioning would be that thereis a norm: whilh requires some optimalminimisf.tion of productivity in classrooms, so that only those who were uninfluencedby this hit free to write more questions. Another poisibility would be that those whoask more questions are more liktiy have questionedend then rejected the basis ofpeer group constraints upon behaviour; they are more likely to have thoughtthingsout for themselves.The failuriof the attitude questiOnnaires in this study is reminiscent of their.weakness in the study of mothers (section 4.6.14 and reinforces the idea mentionedthere that they are too general. and dikel from immediate behaviour to havisimplepredictive power.\" 146 4.2 Appendixla.

Robinson) ......freoft In his researchei into the nature of curiosity, Berlyne (1960) suggests that the wide-variety of stimuli that arouse curiosity behaviour have certain properties in common.These, it is argued are typically not properties intrinsic to the stimuli themselves;are relational properties existing between the stimuli and the attending Organise.Berlyne used the phrase 'collative variables' as a generic term describing such relationalstimulus-organisrh properties. Specifically, it is suggested that stimuli that arousecuriosity bear one or more of the following ?elationshipsito the organism: novelty,change; complexity; conflict; surprisingness; and uncertainty. We reviewed workrelevant to these issues in chapter 2.._However, collative variables as described Could refer not only to specific, static; --stimulus objects, but equally to aspects of activities that a pelon might perform, for'activities may obviously vary in their noveltyand.complexitY eta, according to thenature and past experience of the person performing them.It became 'possible to observe a group of school boys as they were exposed toand asked to perform a set of largely novel activities.

We met at thehouse of a market researcher. They were slightly surprised that anyone should pay themto talk, but this they duly did, and,at length, through .a coffee - punctuated smoky haze.They remained anonymous. Wesaid we wanted to find out how interesting schoolwas, what was boring and why, andwe used our interventions to keep the conversationroughly on this theme. . ,Some enjoyed a varietyi/of school subjects, but those boys who were Closest tothe sociological-criteria marking 'The Young School Leaver' of Morton-Williami andFinch (1968) spoke like caricatures of the descriptions offered by these:writers. Theircomments are worth reporting, because they went beyond what was tapped in 'TheYoung School Leaver' frame of reference. They stressed the importance of subjectsbeing vocationally relevant, practically and concretely presented; there were sparks ofenthusiasm for teachers who had derived mathematical problems from real-life setting's. t.They did not appreciate similarities between abstract and concrete probleins; theywanted to see a carpenter actually measuring wood and not just imagine onelThe more general picture was gloomy. Adult-Society was a sham. Teachers andpoliticians were noted/as special examples of dupliCity: People in power claimed, to havethe welfare of others:at heart, bUt this was simply hypocritical. They thought that \u00b0 1teachers commonly despised their pupils and were interested neither in teaching theirsubjects to others nor in' the subject per se. 'It's not surprising we're bored if they are,is it?' Their cynicism was supported with examples of :Phoneyness and insincerity.Whether or not their perceptions were veridical. is in part irrelevant Given that they /themselvei were,not maliciously intentioned and they seemed quite otherwise/their teachers were not su'ccessfUl salesmen of themselves, their subjecti or society. ,nour systematiclinvestigations, we did not pursue the issue of_whether children find/subjects boring because teachers themselves are bored. We would probably have found ...this administratively impossible, school teachers being almost as sensitive as their! 157 university cousins about any evaluation of the way they conduct themselves and withmore justification. The teacher's genuine interest in his subject was mentioned as aninspiration to them to be interested, and although such invcilvement is unlikely to bea sufficient condition of arousing and maintaining the pupil's interest, it may generallybe a necessary condition.\\Other aspects of schools cited as contributory causes of boredom weremuddlesabout timetables, odd switches in subjects being studyetaea resultrof promiltion anddemotions (French in Year I, German. in Year II, French in Year ill and 'German in.Year IV), 'options' which emerge as compulsory, the dullness of textbooks fInd theirpointless exercisesa number Of items that might be summedlup 'Streaming', 'type of school', these were not mentioned.About teachers, the pupils referred to their dislike of laissez faire styles, their .dislike of weak authoritianism. Respect was frequently mentioned as important, and thiswas facilitated by commitment to subject, commitment to teaching it, willingness todiscuss subjects, ability to enforce authority. The boys were also concerned that theirteachers should like them and take an interest in them as poisons as well as learners. Anabsence of:these attributes was liable to lead to them being bored./We did not, ask the, boys what they were prepared to do to render their teachers'activities more productive and satisfying, but it is perhaps worthy of note that, nobodyvolunteered comments about the pupils' responsibilities.That the boys were genuinely uninterested in school activities and not justsubscribing to a norm that required such subscription from ':hem is implied by their tconfessed boredom with extra-curricular activities. Pop music and, hanging about coffeebars did not appear to have positive attractive power; they were simply not as bad asother things. Aga'n this is consistent with the portrait drawn by Morton-Williams andFinch (1968) and Bone (1972). Teenagers bored in schciol are generally bored; trappedin a closed circuit, iMpOtent to break out and engage in activities, Participation in whichmay be a necessary condition of escape:What our discussions did not reveal was hoW to set about investigating eitherboredom or the questions that pupils have. Our efforts to tap the boys for suggestionsmet only with good-willed shoulder-shrugging. 4.5 Youth Club Visits (M.G.'Duffy) One of the interests of the Project 'was to investigate the decline in academic motivationalleged to occur among secondary school pupils, and especially among working classchildren. It ras decided that youth clubs Might provide a suitable opportunity to make ,'informal Observations of such childreff: these clubs attract only a third of their potentialmembership, and this third is composed predorninantly of working class early schoolleavers. . _1.The two clubs visited were both,on council housing estates but in most respects,they were very different from each other. Linton Youth Club had the use Of. a schoolhall two evenings a weel:, and had only fairly meagre facilities small coffee bar withan old television;lable-tennis,'hadminton; the schoOl playground was sometimesavailable for games. The prevalent atinosphere'of the place was dreary: Leak Youth ClubOn the other hand, was hela in a prupose-build clubhouse adjoining a school and had .correspondingly superior facilities,. including a discotheque, a games room and a colour television; members alsO had access to the school's hall, playing fields and, swimmingpool. The dubs were visited regularly and weekly in term time for over a year.The estate on which Leak Club, was situated was more modern and prosperousthin that of Lindon Club, and this difference was reflected in the memberships of thetwo clubs. At Leak, many of those boys who had already left school were apprentices,while their counterparts at Linton were either doing unskilled jobs or were unemployed.Thus they appearedio differ in the extent to which they had benefited from theeducational.system. The Leak members alSo appeared to be more articulate and approach->--able; they wereouite happy to talk in small groups about their experience of andattitudes towards school. They generally professed some degree of-interest at least inpart of. he curriculum, usually eXpressing the wish that it was more relevant to theirpresent or prospectiveneeds. None Of the members spoken to, however, seemedto have had academic ambitions at any point in their school careers. Athong those whowere working, some regretted not having paid more attention to subjects which would ,have been useful to them in their jobs. .In contrast, the Linton members seemed unable or unwilling to talk in this waywhen approached directly. As far as I could gather, their attitude to school was one of :complete apathy. A particular problem here was therobvioui resentment felt by a numberof the boys towards the nearby lliiiversity, and in particular towards students. At thetime of my Arrival; funds to the club had been cut off by the local authority as part ofan economy.drive, and this had the effect of accentuating the disparity between therelatively privileged status of one group and the deprived statui of the other. Thisattitude of resentment reflected itself in hostility and occasional agression toWards mefor some time Aggressive behaviour was quite commoir,, and indeed a measure ofpetty viOlence and.vandalism was regarded as the iksvtq.by the club leader. Nevertheless,/ .the police were fairly frequent visitors to the clUb. It seemed to me that aggression,'was partly a response to boredom stemming from the lack of alternativiattiViiifzavailable; and it is interesting to speculate more generally. as to what extent thebehavioural differences between the two clubs were afresult of the different environ-ments provided.. :Lackingas I did any specific terms of reference, the visits may have producedsomething more fruitful had I initially been assigned some definite role in the clubsother than that of an outside observer. This would possibly have produCed-more readyacceptance at Linton, though probably little more information, while-at Leak, membersmay have been more forthcoming to somebody who was part of the club's scenerythan they had beenin lone-off discussions. 4.6 Questions in the School (MP. Robinson & L AbraMsky) IntrOduction. Over a period of several years the Head of the Science Departmeni-in eflarge rural secondary modern school had built up an institution of 'question sessions'. We are profoundly grateful to Mr. George Gillard for contacting us and making.available all the materials for this analysis. hese. had developed friary.) the problems of handling Health Education.

These are issues about which Pubescent children may suffer bob? .4, ri strangebeliefs and an inability or unwillingnesi to ask what they want to know. To find outwhat sorts of beliefs and worries pupilihad,'queition sessions' were introduced. Pupilswrote out questions on scraps of paper. These were collected, readout, and answered .by the teacher. There are some weird folk-myths about ways of acquiring diseases,deformities, and babies, and this rural setting might have been a fertile. breeding groundfor such beliefi. ThroUghhis means sex education could be linked to the actual stateOf ignorance and misconception of the children rather than to adult presumption. LikeAlice, question sessions' Crowed and spread through the Science department and across,topics; they occurred as filling-in lessons,thecks on material taught and responses topupil demand. I. Although the questions had been preserved, they were anonymous and theirimmediate context of collection was unknown. Normal techniques of analysis could notbe applied, but we decided /it was likely to be worthwhileto look at' age and streamdifferences for recentlY collected generale science questions and sirmi.of the questions' about sex from earlier years. We transcribed, classif4ed and collated the questions, basingthe classifications mainlVon the referential categories of Robinson and RackstraW11972). 4.6.1Questions'about General ScienceThe first distinction made in classifyingouestions was between 'particular and 'general','particular' referring to single concrete ofteniiniinediately observable phenomena orprobleMs, e.g. 'What is the thing with the tube going round_if forr(\"Mien are we goingto do Eliology?'. The answers to these questions are not part of 'general knowledge'. AsTable 4.6.1. Shows the incidence of these questions relates closelii to age and stream.-Streams across years are not comparable, but these would appear to be a rapid falling-off.of particular questions after the first year; while within that year there is a considerable'systematic increase as,one moves down the stream. In the section on seven year old .children's questions Arnold and Robinson (421) foUnd a very high incidence of particular;questions, which would support an argument that claimed a developmental trend.-`4Table 4.6.1. Percentages of Particular as opposed to Genbrhl Questionsas a function of Stream and III\\ personal-procedural from other q estions.\\These were normally 'particular' as well they were questions asking about he personalC. Table 4.6.2. Percentages of Types of Question in relatiodto Stream and Year type of Open text _ a..3 Percentage's in brackets refer to Closed questions that are not Personal & Procedural history and 'preferences of the teacher and those concerned with the nature and organisa-tion of the rhool and its curriculum. These were totally absent in the fourth year pupils,rare in the higher streams of the first year and common in the lower ones (see Table 4.6.2.).A third division was into questions minimally answered by 'yes' kW 'no'and 'open' questions that required more. Superficially.'closed' questions like 'Couldyou tell us what CO2 stands for?' were treated as substantively 'open'. At first sight theproportion of 'closed', questions is fairly independent of stream and age, but when weelithinate the perional-procedural, such as 'Do you like us to use Kemekals', the propor-tion regularise themselves showing a higher proportion of 'closed' questions in the topstream and in.older children.Among 'open' questions questions characterised the top stream, while'why' questions Were commonest in the bottom two streams of the first. year, while thefoUrth year obliging reff:ented the same pattern. There was more variability in streams2-5, although two obsiryations might be, made. Questions seeking definitions anddescriptions, 'what Ise sun made of ?', 'Wot makes glass?', are mainly confined tostrearns2-4 in the fist year, but have Some prominence in the lower streams of thefourth year Questions calling for identification, 'Who invented aooviga?', 'Which is thehardest metal?', steadily increase in incidence as one moves down the streams of thefirst year; with the-exception of the bottom two streams who are mainly whying.We did not look at complexity 01 linguistic structure or levtl of conceptualisationin any systematic fashion, but impressionistically' the questions of the top stream of thefirst year were both more complex linguistically and predicated on greater knowledgethan those of lower streams. Examples may be given to illustrate this \u00b05.Top Stream:When ygu cough why does a bubble burst in your lung?,Why does an empty tank vvhich ltas had petrol 'Wit and has notbeen drained out properly, ivOen the, tanker' Pacific Glory crashed,....they were frightened to move it because it would blow up?If people breathe (Jut CO2 how does it change back intO,OChgan?:If any one could land on Mars could earth keep in contact withthem or is there no radio that could pick up that\" ar?Bottom Stream: Why do we have Scines?We do not have meth) work whySir wort isfiri the fish boll on the Bench next the Bar withplasti Bag on it?We might argue for a Teutonic influence in both sets of questiOns but wheressthat in the second extends only to capitalisation of nouns and phonetic spelling, in thefirst set there is a wealth of subordination, frequently of a conditional nature --yenassumption, sometimes hypothetical, is made explicit and, in the middle two, the qtiestionsare based on the ju).taposition of conflicts ofsome kind.If We-were to be euphoric enough to suggest a developmental trend which.is ajoint function of age-and attainment, we would suggest the foillowing successive concen-trations of interest: explanation in, terms of 'why', identification of elements, identifica-tion of .categories and a concern. With thecomposition of these, and finally a concernwith processes and methods introduced by 'how'. There is a' parallel increase in complex-ity of structure and thinking with questions increasing involving hypOtheses (closedquestions) or the posing of conflicts rather than simple assimilation of more facts. 4.6.2. Questions about Sex.Questions from second and third year pupils collected over a number of years werecounted and collated. The 281 children concerned had asked a total of 982 questions, ofwhich thirty six per dent were directly or peripherally related to sexual matters. Boysand girls in the' second and third year were invited by the general science teacher tosubmit written questions about anything theY wanted to know. They were assured ofreceiving answers to these questions. clThe 281 children asked a total,of 982 questions. Of these questions, 36% wereconcerned with sexual matters in the broad sense of this term. Included in this categorywere questions about the anatomy and physiology of the reproductive system, normaland abnormal sexual relations, reproduction of both people and animals, and sometypes of neonatal care such NS breast-feeding. Also included were questions about 1maturation, contraception, t enereal disease, secondary sex characteristics, and somesocial situations and attitudes. Only these questions were analysed;Each question was coded according to which of fifteen categories it came under(iee Table 4.6.3. for list of categories and percentage of questions in each). One thirdof the questwere about pregnancy, childbirth, some aspects of neo-natal care andpossible congenital defects of the baby. Although these questions represented a higherproportion of the girls' questions than of the boys', they did also represent more thanone quarter of the boys' questions. For the most part they were straightforwardrequests for simple information. They were not emotionally charged nor were theyquestions which one would expect parents or teachers to find embarassing to answer.Some examples are 'When the womb swells what happens to the digestive systems?'asked by a second. year boy; 'What would kappen if the woman didn't have liquid inher womb?' asked by a third year boy; and 'What is a miscarriage?' asked by a secondyear girl;and 'How long does a baby feed off its mother's breast?' asked by a thirdyear girl. The pupils seemed to find this. a very interesting subject if one accepts numberand type of questions as an indication of interest Ifthis istrue, thenthildren couldlearn a great deal about all the life sciences through a detailed study of the development of the embryo, the effects of pregnancy on the-body, and the way in which achild is born and becomes adapted to a biologically independent existence. This-wouldput into, what is for the pupil an interesting context; the study of microbiology, thevarious systems of the boyd, types of tissue, and could-easily be used as a pe!r'ifr. ofdeparture for comparing variou; types of animals.Onequarter of the questions were about sexual 'anatomy, physiology, andmaturation kfid about normal malefernalesexual relations. This was not surprising asthese were more often questions which children might normally.finchembarrassing toask parents or teackars. Some examples are 'Does a man feel his sperm go dowk hispenis when hilt having ikercourse?' asked by a third.year girl; and 'How long does aman keep his penis in at the longest?' asked by a third year boy. One would expectboys and girls of this age to be keenly interested in these subjects and to find difficultyin gettingthisisort of information either because of their own inhibitions, the inhibi-tions of o\\hers or a combination of both.OnCinteresting difference between_the boys' and girls' questions was in thecategory male-female social relationhisps. Seventeen per cent` of the girls'questions fall into this category whereas only three per cent of the boys' questionscould be cod3d in this way: One explanation for thlywouldbe that girls of this age 163 / are more sexually developed and. mature and are more interested in having a relationshipWith a member of the opposite sex than are boys of the same age. A-very small numberof questions (3%) were about abnormal male-female or person-animal relations, Asimilar number of questions were about homosexuality. The questions about abndimalsexual relations were mainly abdut sexual assult Some examples are 'How can you killa woman by intercourse?' atked by a 'If you are assulted beforeyou beco pe a woman, will it do you any harm?' aiked by a second year gill. Therewere, two, uestions about beastiality.T ree per cent of the questions were based on misinformation, and this wasfelt to'be ncouraging. ExaMples are: 'Why is there penal' asked bya second' yr girl; and 'A man had a baby at the age of 17, how was this come by? Thiswas in theaily Express'Ziisked by a second year boy. :Overall, these children seemedto be reasonably well-in-formed on the subject, but keen to learn more about it. Thisinterest was mainly directed towards information about normal, healthy sexual activities.They did not askmany questions about contraceptionbut what they did ask indicateda fairamount of ignoranceon the subject. An example is 'Can two people haveiexualintercourse without having a baby? If so, how?' asked by a third year boy. A few ofthem did mention' the sheath in their questions, but mainly to ask what it. was Anexample is 'Whit is a rubber 'Johnny and what is it used for?' asked by a third year girl. //Table 4.6.3. \\Characteristic of Questions about Sexual Teachers College New York: McGraw-Hill, 1960.Bone, Margaret.

BORED? I ntroduction. The analysis of boredom, uriosity and questioning made in chapter 2\u00b0posed certain links among ,them. Betwry een curios'and questioning the link was notso strong that either could be seen as necessa or sufficient conditions of the other. II _ _ can be manifested in activities otner than questioning. Asking questions mayserve functions other than that of atteMpting to satisfy curiosity. .However, we are le, Ito specify some of the conditions under which we can stimulate curiosity and questi nsI(see chapters 2 and 3).LBorerlom was treated as an internal state whose presence ensures the absence of/curiosity; it would bebdd to allow them to co- exist. In Figure 2.3 the two states were/ associated with different stimulating conditions: while curiosity is one type of uncertaintystemming from ambiguities, novelty, complexity, incongruity. and surprisingness of-stimulie-boredionvis-alleged-to arise-when-external-stimulation-is minimal or monotonous,i.e.: repetitive, predictable and regular. There are several possible responses to such a state_ :convert the monotony into nothing byrfallIng asleep, indulge in divershre exploration-either behaviourally by moving around or playing, or Mentally by acts of imagination andthinking. However, neither of these coping strategies may be available,or allowable: Themost relevant type of example in thiscOntext is of a teacher drbning on with an eagle eye;/-open-for wandering attention among-the pupils. The norms and rules dictate that thepupil stay where he is, that he attend and learn. The choim is, between attending andbreaking the norms and risking what sanctions may arise. We would not expect task-related questioning to-occur in this situation.We also noted in chapter 2 (sec. 2.5) that chronic failure to resolve conceptualconflicts may lead to chronic states of anxiety, especially if failures are associated with -punishments of some kind. It was suggested that there may be more than one way of ,1handling this anxiety, but nhat in any case its victim is likely to remain unresponsive toexternally provided stimulation associated with learning. This state may also be labelled'boredom'. Here again, however, we would not expect sufferers to have knowledge-seeking questions.--7 Hence; regardless:of-how wide or narrow-the-scope-bf theword-ibTafidom', i itspresence should not be associated with question-asking. Or if 'it is, the questions are likelyto serve as diversions, protests or complaints rather than as requests for information '-Paradoxically, if one isinterestedin states associated with question-asking, it is better tolook at boredom rather than curiosity, fOr whereas the association between, curiosity andquestioning is probabilistia and contingent, information-seeking questions are a sufficientcondition for the absence of boredom. To find out who is bored under what circumstancei, can be used to diagnose who is not asking questions under those circumstances.But-are-pupils bored? And if they are,who is most bored by what/ What-are-the-antecedents and consequences of being bbred? Inevitably the first *Wein is one of 2\\ measurement. Commonsense, that mythical morass of legendaiy 'wisdom, would encouragesimplicity'and naivety and assume that this was eh instance where one could'ask peopleand that their remts could be reliable and valid. Unwilling to be more complicated anddevious than necessary, we began by, asking pupils what bored them and what they didabout it. This pilot study gave evidence to encourage to rely further on people's reports.At this same time we came across the Schools Council Enquiry on 'Young-School /\\ .eavers by MortonWilliams and Fi7h 1968): We regretted that we were unable to, . fount Such an impressive survey an not with even more regret that they had obtainedinform tion about boredom which they h analysed only against age of leaving school --appropi /te for theii fraine of reference, b t sad for ours. It was not until 1972 that we. 1/, realised it might be possible to make a seco dary analysis of these data and thereby conduct,// a larsurvey of boredort. As mentioned in perii ions were Finch very made allnee :Imary data available for such an analysis: is make up the bulk of the thipter. igned to test the competence of WCand MC Children to ,formUlate que ions in-linguist ally appriop -it was decided 7,/''to include also a pilot study into boredom.The inteion was not to consider the problemini,/es/n depth, but ttablish guide-lines along which fu her investigations could bedire,.cuted. 11 Jt\\ We adorned the commonsense technique of as ing children to write down lists ofthings tyvhich bored them, their reasons for these being bOring, and some of the things they,.didhen 'hey felt bored. It was expected that WCchi. rei would ealmit to being boredbimore /assive intelleCtual activities than their MC cf nterparts, whilst the same time,i.,they mig; tchoose more active pastimes as a release from boredom. It !vas also expectedthat perhaps WC children might give-more or 'fiddling withrngS' and possibly show agreer tendency toward behaviour that could become an social,/for direct. The children wereearKhigivena singlesheetof. papier, divided-into three sections. They had alreadycoulpleted.seVeral other tasks (see chapter 7) and on this last paper,' eylwere asked to write down..in .the aOpropriate spaces, things they found boring;\"-their rea ns, andkinds of thing.theydid when they felt bored. TheAhree instructions were read aloud by experimenterwhilst the children looked atithert. It was explainedat answers should4 written in thespacesprovided undr each section heading. They %V allofive minutes to complete, the task. The 'specificsection headings were: i- /'1.Please write down a list of boring.2.Please/write clownwhyyou find somi of these inboring.I .3.,Please 'writedown some Of the thing which yo do when yoi, feel bored.' ,The task was completed by the class as a group, in eir own classfroom, during whatwould have been leso . time. The teachers were absent thronghout, and the experimenters,both of whom were fale, attempted to induce a !riendly, elaxed atmosphere into theproceedings, whilst at th4 same time, being firm regarding th noise and chattering occasionedby the overcrowdednditions and occasional interruptions)l''ISubjects. Two local mixed primary schools had been select-,situated in a MC distiict,! the other in a WC area The majoriMC sample were members of-staff at a university, and the ch/./170for this series of studies, oneof parents of children in theIdren lived in' owner-occupied 0residential districts, whilst the parents of the WC children were mainly manual workers,many connected in some way with the docks. The two groups of children were both often year oldi, tasks beingperformed by thi4 top 'stream of the final year in each school.Information was obtained from the schoolSabout the occupations of both parents ofevery child, and clansification was made accordingto'the Hall -genes Scale. Three immixgrant children from the WC_sample were withdraWri, and so also were two childreninitially classified in the lower status range;' bufvhose:mothers held higher status occu- / pations. .The final sample consisted of twenty seven children fr6m each of the two schOcls(fifteen boys and twelve girls in each). In the MC sample, children 'ranged from. socialclasseS 1 4 (Means .:Boys: 1.8; Girls: 2i), and in (Means 7- Boys: 5.6; Girlt: 5.4). 5.1.3 Treatment of Results and ResultsThe completed scriptsOf.tbe final sample were divided into four sets boys and girlsfor each of the two social class groups. .1.The first step was to categorise each child's responses on the first and thirdquestions (that -is tne.things they found boring and the things they did when theyfeltbored) into two sections which we named Active Responses and Passive Responses.'These two main headings were each further subdivided within the first and third kcategories, into four groups.,:(i) ACademicOr.alsociated activities.e.g.'Arithmetic! (ACtive)'Mrs. X giving lectures in Scripture; (Passive)(ii) The home and things done specifically in the home environment.e.g.'Washing up' (Active)'My parents talking to the first:stage, we considered the respective scores Obtained by the four roupsof children under the two main headings of Active and Pative Responses, but co Id findno significant difference between them. All children appeared to makeapproxim tely thesame number cf respOnses in each category.,2.The second stage was to look at instances of anti-social behaviour given by childrenas a release from bOredom, e.g., 'Flicking ink', 'Banging desks'. The scores of th fourI groups of children were approximately equal.3.It was obserVedtn4t several children had made 'unconstructive' response in answerto (2-3,what did they CIO when they4/ere bored, e.g. 'Sleep', Pothing': Th re were npsignificant differences by social Class or sex. ..4.'Watching teleVisidn' and the names of specific televitionprOgranirnes cuffedfrequentlyin the responses of several children. Istelevision seen as soMethi to occupythe time when one is bored, or is it considered to be boring in itself? There We e unfOrtun- 171 ately insuffiCient data to enable us to answer the first; question. On the second issueeight of the fifteen. MC boys found television programmes boring, but only twoOf theWC boys (Fisher Exact Probability-Test, p < in the working Class, seven of thetwelve girls.fOund television boring, giving a sex difference. (p < .02).5./Som. ing activities appeared on tha lists as antidotes to boredOm. Ten WC boyspreferred to relieve their boredom by participating in sports of various kinds, no MCboys (p < .004). Only two WC girls Mentioned:sports, giving a sex difference withinE the working class (p < .04).6.The largest block of 'boring things' listed by the children were specifiOschoolsubjects. A two way analysis of, varianceof social class and sex against the total numberof subjects mentioned by each pupil showed no effects for sex or clasS on their own.HoweVer; there was a significant sex x Social Class interaction (F = 10.06, df 1/50,2.< .01), Within tpisoWC boys mentioned more MC boys\"(X/MC = 1.2,X/WC = 3.2, E=.9.65,-df 1/29, p < .01). While in the working class boys mentioned'more boring subjects than girls (X Boys = 3.2, X Girls = 2.0, F = 5.16, df 1/26, p < .05),this was reversed in the middle class IX. Girls = 2.8, X Boys = 1.2, F= 4.90, df 1/26,p < .05):7..Children's reasons Were not sufficient to merit analysis. '5.1.4 Discussion.While there were 'trends' fOr WC children:to be more bored by passive activities, tO,say ;they wouldrelieVe boredom through motor activities, and to admit to more 'unconstruc-tive' and 'anti-social' means-of achieving relief, these were too weak to do anything otherj thansuggest-they are worth exploration.The significant differencesin SoCial Class responses to television show that WCboys are less bored than eitherthe WC girls or the MC boys. It is possible that perhaPsthose who mention teleVision programmes as more boring are more discriminating in theirviewing than the WC boys. However, other factors are involved. The large attraction ofsporting-aCtivities for WC boys: could mean that they di) not watt very much television;-it is possible alsothat their Parents have similar tastes to their chillren, and may therefore,for the most parc- view mainly Westerns, Cluiz,games and-soap operas; the same dualifica-tion applies in reverse of course, in that MC parents are perhaps more inclined to watchcurrent affairs programmes and documentaries, which may be boring to their ten yearold children. This possibility is borne oUt to some extent by the sPecific.programmesmentioned as boring by the middle class such as 'Panorama' and 'World in Action'.The high scores obtained by MC girls in stating specific school s.:;)jects as a causeof boredom can be exptained to some extent by the inclusion of one particular subjectby many,of the girls (seventy five per cent. of the sample). Over half of the MC boys also /gave this subject as being boring. Unless children of this age have an innate or acquireddislike of this particular subject, it might be suggested that the personality ofthe teacheror the particular teachingmethods employed inthis instance may be a contributory factorto the attitudes of tne Children tOWards thf: subjectIn conclusion, two finalornment; shbuld be made about the study:\" Firstly, thatas the children had already worked hard at various other experiments, we left ourselvesopen; when final sample. A second consideration which must be 0mentioned, is that the experiment was carried out within the school environment; andthe instructions to the children in the sample may not have been sufficiently explicit inasking for a list containing anything whichthey.considered to be boring, rather thanthings particularly associated with school..:Within these limitations pupils' reportsappear to bia sensible way of settingabout the location of boredom in the social structure. , . 5.2 Boredom' in the Young School Leavers.5.21 IntroductionFull details of the sampling design and specific measures used are to .be found inMorton-Williams and Finch (1968).

HOwever, administrative convenience; speed andcost also affected decisions. In the end only three of the MX possible data card for eachpupil were used such that they contained information from the three sources of pupil,parent and teacher and the estimates of boredom, athievement and social dais. Other:variables of interest on these carcis were included. 5.2.2. HypothesesTo ease understanding of the manner in which the theoretical ideas mentioned in chapter2 and the introductiOnto chapter 5 translates into expectations about the distributiOns ofthe particular items incorporated into the analysis, Figure 5.1 was constructed:The central feature is 'boredom with school subjects'. Immediate expressionsof this might be withdrawal, aggression, (diversionary activities) and/or reduced effortin learning these subjects. Reduced effort might well an absence of performance-directed aspirations for iMprovethents and both should lead to lower performance. Inthe absence of extra-learning attractions at school, truancy is one intermittent way ofavoiding boredom, while leaving school as soon as possible finalises escape The conse-quences Of low performance are likely to be contingent upon the values placed uponacademic success by school, parents and:peers, but, other things being equal, one might..Wect feelings of failure to -be more PrOnuuriced when the school is formally competitive.Streaming'and a high incidence of Pupils taking national examinations are two symptomsof competition. A history of failure and an, eXpectation of future failure, it has beensuggested, may in turn increase boredom or anxiety states reported as boredom. Itshould be noted that the system is closed and-can sustain itself. However, externalinfluences can also affect it-Pupils can use teachers as models. If teachers are bored by their subjects, pupilsshould be less likely to be enthusiastic, bout them. Teachers can show no respect forOP interest either in the learning of their Oupils or in the pupils as people (see chapter 4,section 4).

These amenities will bein part, but only in part, contingent upon the wealth of families. The concept of 'socialclass' normally embraces many covarying features of different life-styles that shouldaffect the boredom of children with school subjects.

Full raw data and results are relegated to the Appendix. To report the resultswith scholarly precision would haver been but the ti6pendicised provition-of theraw data allows argumentation'and isagreement about the heavy simplification madeto render the results readable. There were differences in the numbers. of oUpils aboutwhom one had information, especially on the Parent's queStionnaire. Evidence washthat these numbers Were either so small or so distributed as to be irrelellantto theassociations with the Bore Score. Preliminary inspettion of the crot breaks an partitioned X2 s'syggested thatthree main types of association dominated the results. SometiMes no association wasobtiined. Sometimcs,the association was monotonic, viz the incidence of Bore Scoreincreased as the value of the associated variable increased. Thirdly, the high BoreScore category was deviant that is thetliree other categories gave roughly similardistribution, but the most bored group deviated from this Results are not describedin such detail and the only contrasts generally given arebetween' the extreme, a per-centage of the highest Bore Score group is contrasted with that from the lowest.

While it may be useful to ask about causes of boredom, itmust be remembered that such factors may subsequently be affected by the boredomthey createdgiving the system a dynamic interdependence. It'is a positive feedbackmodel that reaches an unstable equilibrium only because other forces act to contain it.Escape for the bored pupil below the statutory school leaving age is not possible thelaw and its sanctions presumably acting eventually as a major force to keep the boredpupil ticking over in the classroom'.Several points of minor significance may be noted. We had no infOrmationabout the physical amenities of school, but might expect them to be of marginalrelevance only in this regard. As in the work of Morton-Williams (1966), Wiseman (1966)and others, we find the material and financial conditions of the home to be of little' import. 'it is the values, interests and behaviour of parents that is relevant- .We regret having no independent estimates of these same characteristics. inteachers.

As Spencer (1972) shows in his study of attitudes.ofadolescents, the Majority aspire to orthodox ways of leading satisfying lives and arecontent to endorSe the values of parents and schools.We might also mention the association between boredom and competition.Where competition between individuals is constructed and encouraged and wherewinning is rewarded, it is inevitable that there must be losers.

CHAPTER_6 QUESTIONS ASKED AND SOCIAL CLASS (G.V. PROSSER) Editor's Introduction. In theautum'n of 1968, flush withithe,prospect of three fullyears in which to collect hard data that could serve as a basis for the discription`qfthe educational needs both to stimulate and maintain curiosity and to equip childreliwith the verbal skills to equire and evaluate knowledge, the Project Director demandea census of questions that secondary school children have._If the theoretical position, presented at the end of chapter 2, about differencesbetween t..e social classes is valid, then WC secondary children should be less curiousthat MC children about their environment and hence should have fewer, questions aboutit In so far as their skillin the representational use of language.and-thiir generalknowledge about the work are also depressed, their questions shOulci also be differentr,in quality from those of their MC peers. The'results mentioned in chapter 5 supportthe view of differential 'boredom. The results mentioned; in section 1 of chapter 4point to relationships between maternal tactics 4f answering questions and the question-and answering of young children that are consistent with the general thesis, andas we Shalt see in chapter 7, similarly consistent social class differences appear in thequestions of children up to the e of ten. 'Butare there sociallass dirences in the quantity and quality of the questionsthat older, fourteen year of ,childrenve?.The data in succeeding pages are intendedto throw some light on this question..liomao_colLect the questions of fourteen year old children was not immediatelobvious. In the first placeve did not wish to restrict the topics of questions to hi9hfycircumscribed school-based subjects. 1n.the second we wanted to ensure that our'materials and contexts merely elicited questions and did not stimulate new ones. Inthethird, we found Ourselves on the horns of a dilemma if pupils were\"truly andchronically bored would they even ce'-operate in our investigations? This was not soMuch a practical worry about the behaviour ofxhildren, as a worry about theoretical.adequacy. On the reasoning presented.in chapter 2, the truly bored would presumablyjust not be interested in taking part in any investigation. But pupils in school wereunlikely to be as uncooperative at that (in our case such virtue was a handicap).Overt rebellion is hazardous. If one applies a combination of 'minimizing misery' anda 'least effort' principles; the bored should conform demands for questions byproduCing them: It might, of course,` be even more boring just to'sit doing nothing.Questions produced might therefore signify nothing more than a mechanical willing-/ ness to conform.To explore the dilemrhe we thought it best to take the devil by the hornsbetween whicIrtve were trapped and, talk the problem over withahe fourteen year olds',already mentioned in chapter 4. Neither this venture nor our Youth Club enterpriseshelped to answerOur questio:is about research technology. ._Discouraged somewhat by the impotence of our imaginations to generate an, .all-purpose general question elicitation instrument, we f.:11 back upon orthodox simple-mindedness: we provided pupils-with a range of topics about which they could askquestionS, some of Whig!\" would be subsequently answered. The pilot study in SchoolA served several functions: it provided questions upon which a taxonomic scheme j'1. e.21 203 could be developed and, in spite of the dearth-of MC pupils,there were encouraging hintsof-social class-differences.The gambler's statistically correct preference to stay with a winning number led usto repeat our orthodoxy in schools more heterogeneous in social class intake. Of three 'schools in the area which had a sufficient incidence of MC pupils to merit approach, twowere unwilling to discuss the possibility of our enquiry taking place. The third schboi,School B, allowed us in, but then constrained any development of our enterprise beyondgroup administration'for one double period, A fourth school that might haVe been suitablereplied, 'I think sometimes we ar9 fighting'what could be a \"losing`battle\" in our schoolSto get on with what is obviously ,our major task to educate the children. Exercises ofthe kind you-suggest may be of interest to you but as far as we are concerned they are aSheer waste of time ...'.Somewhat put off by our lack of credibility, we .consoled ourselves by thinkingout good theoretical grounds why the information derived from School B was sufficientto our needs. 6.1 Introduction A number of factors might be expected to operate to determine the quantity and qualityOf quetionkasked by children: Once the excitement of hearing their offspring's firstwords has passed,---parents are made increasingly aware of pressure to answer questions. ,Reactions to this questioning-activity may range from pleasure in the child's-thirst forknowledge to irritation at what appearto belittle more than a demand for attention. Ateither extreme, certain assumptions are made regardingq-uestions, In the first place it is--7assumedTthat:cluestions-are-asked-inrordeko-obtain information,A-seconeassumption_isthat questions may be used for manipulative purposes. As Robinson and Rackstraw (1972)point out, questions may serve a Variety of purpose& Thek may:be used'to test authority, to register a pretest, to evoke embarrassment or otheremotion& states, to prevent an uncomfortable silence, or as a rhetoriCaldevice' (id. chapter 2)This means that both motivational and cognitive faCtors have to be taken into account whenconsidering the determinants of question asking, and when considering what form thequestions might be expected to take.If children are encouraged W ask questions, they will presumably not only bemore likely to do so, but the qual itY of their questions shOuld improve with practice.Conversely, if children find that the asking of questions isnot rewarded, either byapproval or by suitable answers, they will ask fewerquestions,:l?e leSs skillful in.formula-ting questions and in consequence of this will be even less likely to ask questions. Thisvicious: circle may be observed in the context of both home and school. The individual\"child at horne will be largely dependent upon the encouragement received froMparent& In such. a case, thete is a one-to-one retiOnship, and the foundations laidfor individual differences in question asking. At-school, however;; the child is set withinthe context of a social situation. EaCh school has its norms, and-to has each classroomwithin the school. Much will depend upon individual teachers, and More Will dependupon the interactions between teacher and class that are customary in any particularschool. At school, individual differences may be obscured. It is possible thatPnly the'best' and the 'worst' pupils experience a one-to-one relationship with the teacher...\u00b0N 4.Pupils with a high verbal IQ might be expected to ask more questions simply beoause theyhave a readier access to the teacher. They have more incommon with the teacher. For thesame reason, children o: MC parents should find it easierto communicate with the'teacherby means of questions...But in spite of this, both high ability pupils and MC pupils mayfind it more convenient to accept the norms of the majority of the class. This would applyparticularly to older pupils, who are more sensitive to peer approVal and disapproval. Allthings being equal, however, we might expect that more capable children will framequestions of higher quality, and that the ability to ask suitable questions will develop withexperience. The Bernstein hypothesis predicts-that children of MC families will have theadvantage of more experience in asking, and receiving answers to, questions.In chapters 2 and 3 of this report, a fuller review of theory and research relatingquestions to curiosity end social class his been given. In view. of some uncertainty, aboutthe constructitself, ifis not easy to decide whether curiOsity acts as the independentvariable. In so far as the word 'curiosity' applies to a range of behaviours, it is possible toconsider the problem of eliciting curiosity by appropriate stimuli. if, however, the emphasisis upon curiosity as a motivational or perscinality state, the problem, of measuring orindiciAingLits._presence becomes appropriate. I n relation to curiosity, questiOns may be__consc\u00b1ered as dependent upon this motivational or pergonality state, and thus serve-a& ameasure of curiosity. .On the other hand, questions be regarded as an example ofcuriosity behaviour& in such a case, both questioning and curiosity can be regarded asdependent variables, elicited by appropriate stimuli, or expressing some underlyingpersonality or motivational state.in the literature, the tendency has been to regard questionsas the dependentvariable, offering a measure of curiosity. In Berlyness.(1954)study, question&Served bothto stimulate curiosity and ti, indicate the presence of curiosity. Ashton (1965 ).consideredthat children-who, asked more questions, end .who-atsp-had-a:tendenty-to4orm-m-orehypotheses regarding stimulus 'objects, were more curious. When 'Berlyne and Frommers-(1966) subjects respOnded to 'curiOsity-arousing' stimuli by producing more questions,this was taken to mean that curiosity had in fact been!arOused. MaW and Maw%(1968) 'high' curiosity subjects asked more questions, and.Rosenshield's (1968) 'high'curiosity group asked their questions about topicsVvith which they were, presenily un-familiar. That is to:say their curiosity was aroused by the:unfamiliarity of the material;and their questions served toindicate thiS.. (For references, see chapter 2.)In attempting to relate the construct of curiosity to social clast as well as to theasking of questions, a difficulty arises. If it is assumed that the children of MC-parentshave been rewarded.for showing curiosity,they might be expected to ask more questionsin situations where'their curiosity is aroused: But the literature seems to suggest that thearousal of curiosity is itself not independent of such factOrs as the nature of stimulus-.material, and the extent to which it offers something new, unexpected or unusuallycomplex in relation to the Subject. What is unexpected for the child of LWC parents mayrn out to be familiar and.wholly predictable for the child of MC parents. This couldhay.he effect of inhibiting the asking ofquestions..lt might tax the resources of thechild to .itempt a new question about an old situation, and this could be reflected in thequality of estions asked, but it does seem that studies in this field will need to lookfOr interaction affects if any generalisations are to become possible.- 205 6.2 Method Subjects. Two neighbourhood creamed comprehensive schools were visited. The Ha 1,1-Jonesscale of occupational prestige was used in order to determine a social class rating for each 'pupil. The father's social clasiWasusually taken, but where this could not'apply, themother's social class.waS taken. The two schools clearly differed n distribution. of social5 , class members. The catchment areas were different. School A was situated in a doWn-townarea. The premises'were old and unattractive. The school was divided into several-sectionssitUated.at points separated by as much as a quarter of .a mile. Pupils were often requiredto walk this distance betWeen lessons. time being alloWed forthese journeys. An appreciablenumber of pupil's were Pakistani and Other immigrants: In spite, however, of these diffi- .1 .7 culties, a keen interest. in social welfare and other extra-curricular. activities was apparent .....Information regarding social class was available fOr forty four out of sixty twopupils considered in this school.

The widowed .4mother was a cleaner (class 7).4.In grouP 6-7, approximately eqUal numbers were chosen from each class,although there were in fact twice as many class 6 as class 7, boys in the fourthform of thiS school. .;Procedure. Pupils were seen together.'In order to prevent communication between the.. different school classes, members of the research team visited the schoOl at the same time,.divided themselves among the classes, and elicited questioni from the pupils during:thesame lesson period.An explanation was given in terms approximating to the following form:'You are used to being asked questions in tests and\\examinations, ;but weat the University are interested, in the qUestions that you yourselves mightlike to ask.

The'pupils were then thanked for the co-operation.Coding procedure: taxonomy of questions. I riOrder to score the questions whiCh hadbeen elicited, a taxonomy of questions was produced extending and developing ideasadvanCed by Robinson and Rackstraw (1972). This followed the pattern of an algorithmor flow chart in the hope that Such 'a scheme would have sufficient clarity of definitionfor high inter-scorer reliability. A Scoring Manual was developed jointly with Duffy,whilethe taxonorny;was being used to score the queitions of the twelve girls in school A. Thisalso gave an cipportiinity for a preliminary testing of inter-scorer reliabilitiett,,When thequestions, of the thirty boys in school B were scored; inter-scorer reliabilities were re-tested.The Taxonomy and Scoring Manual COmprise nine basic dimensions, each witha number of categOriei (eighty, one in all). The nine dimensions, A fall into three'divisions; viz Form, Intention and Content. Under. J, which may be regarded as a tenthdimension, the total number of wordi is Jecorded.

It seems safe to say that childrenat school have already developed opinions regarding school, feel strongly about theM,..and are more ready to use questions for the purpose of expressing their own views. 215 As for the topics 'Sport' and 'Doctors and Nurses', what has already been said in dealing41trl complex questions would probably be applicable here also.Under the tenth and finaldimension J, number of words, no significant differ-ences occurred. As the Table 6 5 indicates, the difference between mean number ofwordi per subject slightly favours the WC group, but MC subjects used more words perresponse. Table 6.5. Social Class and Number of Units in Responses X ResponsesResponsesX 7) 32.810.7350.5 Summary and Discussion: School A. As far as the results for School A are concerned,although differences did not reach an acceptable level of significance, the coding frameappears to have been sufficiently sensitive to pick up certain meaningful divergencesbetween the two social class groups. ktendency for MC subjects to ask questions ofgreeter length, complexity and sophistication is discernable. Where results went in theOpposite and unexpected di7eclion,:there appears to be:room for doubt regarding theoriginal interpretation.:Subjects had a limited time in which to write questions, and itmay be that MC subjects asked fewer questions because they tended to take more timeover Ouestions. It is to be noted that as the groups were matched for intelligence testscores, the. MC subjects had no advantage when forming longer end more complexquestions. The time factor could thus be held to operate:in their case:Furthermore, although MC subjects did not ask more cloied,:hypothesiS-testing:question% it is poisible that they chose answer suggestions as a strategy for hypothesistesting in preference to asking closed questions. In faCt, their closed questions scoreitself could have been inflated if questions offering alternatives had been counted withclosed questions as 'half-closed' questions. Data here are not sufficient for-more detailedanalysis within dimensions to make these finer comparisions possible. In any case, itwould not be appropriate to press detailed findings to the point of claiming that theyare of general application. Only twelve subjects were involved in what can only-beregarded as a pilot study, and all were girls: The grouping of categories has undoubtedlyobscured the operation of some factOrs and, as the form of the results stands, it is oftenpossible to explain them irrespective of direction. 6.3.2. Results: School BWith this sc. ,00l aslo, it is possible to trace a profile for each of the two social class groups.In this case there are fifteen subjects, all boys, in each group; and within groups it was Figure 6.4. Profile of Percentages of Questions on each Dimension for Two Social assign subjects to three ability and attainment streams, High, Middle and Lowrespectively. The LWC subjects were again from groups 6 and 7 of the Hall-Jones scale, butthe MC subjects were from groups 1-4. The profiles do not, therefore, correspond exactlyto those of school A. If, however, the profiles are compared using the original predictions,as in the case of school A, the differente favouring social class group is not significant whentested against its standard error (t < 1) (Figs. 6.4 & 6.5).When results for the two schools are considered together, they appear to tell asimilar Story. If for example, we use theresults obtained with school A to predict thedirection in which the MC subjects Will obtain higher percentages than the LWC subjects,the difference between 'profiles-favouring the MC subjects and tested against itsstandard error is significant at the five per cent level (one-tailed test, t = 1.85).This result might be better expressed in the following form:for dimensions B (complex questions), F (seeking information rather than opinion),H (questions free from personal references) and I (abstract and: general questions), resultsare in the predicted direction, i.e. favouring MC subjects, in both schools;for dimensions C (closed questions), D (non-manipulative questions) and E {questions free-from suggesti0i-rof---ansWer),FesultS go eriiitrar-y to prediction, i.e. favouring` the LWC .subjects, in both schools.Since a greater number of subjects took part in school B, it was posiible to lookat the results in more detail. For all dimensions except G, two - factor analysis of variance 217 Figure 6.5. Profile of Percentages of Questions on each Dimension for Two.

Results went in thecontrary direction, but no significantiClass or stream effects were found. ,I.Content: abstractness. More abstract qUestions had been expected from MCsubjects, but as in the case of school A, although differences were in the predicteddirection, they did not reach an acceptable level of significance. Analysis of varianceof frequency of questiOnsyi the category Abstract(1. 6) indicated that although the .effects of social class were not significant, the effects of stream were (F = 4.22,df 2/24,p <.05). Comparison of means shows that,High stream subjects asked significantlymore abstract questions than LOw stream.subjects (t = 3.21, df 24,.p <'.01)'and theMiddle and Low stream subjects taken as a group It 2.88, df 24,13 <.01). Directional agreementsThe Bernstein hypothesis suggests that social class can offer the same kind of advantageas intellectual ability. From this, it .might be expected that'scores of the MC subjects in ..relation to those for .the WC group will be directionally.the same as those for.Higherstream subjects in relation to Lower stream subjects. If the'results for school B areconsidered dichotOrnous categorieS under/most of the dimensions such that under one .category or group of categories MC subjects will obtain proportionately'higher scores rwhereas under the other category, the position will be'reVersed..The relationshipbetween H Igh and Low streams for thoSe categories cin'then be examined (see TAbie6.7). It is immediately apparent that the High stream subjects tend to have a higher meanscore than Low stream subjects under most categories simply because they asked morequestions: For this reason, the exceptions are of particular interest. For the only twot categories where Low streain subjeCts asked more questions than High stream' subjects;the proportiorrof questions asked MC(groups 1= 414-subjects. categories are 'Placing' questions and 'Particular'as against 'General or abstract' questions.

As in tliecase of school A, the difference between mean number ofwords per subject favoured the WC.group, while MC subjects used more words perresponse. Althpugh the difference in words per respOnse was sranifiCant at the 0.1 percent level, there was a large disparity between*Var.lances for the two social class grOupS= 5.66). With middle=clasi subjects the variance was significantly greater (p <7001)(Table 6.9). Thus it appears that in spite of the matching procedure; the two samples.are not ho.mogeneous. 223 d ems.

Sample sizes and techniques clearly need,to be modified and variedsignificant differences on specific categories are to be found.For this reason, it has.not.been possible to establish exactly what goes on within thedifferent groups of subjects: but the coding frame apPeartd-have been sufficientlysensitive to indicate a tendency for hioh stream and MC subjects to respond similarlyin the question-framing situation, .a tendency which Was statistically significant if'weighting procedures are deemed acceptable. 6.4. Simplification of the. Question TaxonomyOne way of modifying techniques of investigating differences in 'question-asking behaviouris'to use a simplified coding frame or taxonomy:of questions. Under certain conditions,ai much less time-consurning.scoring procedure might alsppe,Welcained, althoughinformation would have to be saarificed..An attempt was, therefore, made to design auseful shorter taxonomy, while at the same tin* minimising the amount ofinformationlost in the proCess, by using techniques whereby possibly relevant factors might beisolated and identified. 6.4.1. Factor Analytical ProcedureA preliminary:principal components analysis was carried out on the seventy twoscoring categories and this was followed by a factor analysis on grouped categories. Inorder to facilitate meaningful ccimparisons, categories were grouped within each dim-ension to form twenty one grouped categories in all. Where possible, categories weregrouped in such a way as to suggest dichotomous variables, e.g, under dimension B(syntactic structures'of questions: complexity) the 1 statement', and 5 'question compound group', were all placed under the singlerubric, 'complex', in opposition to the remaining category 'simple'. The criteria fordivision were largely intuitive, but were also based upon inspection of responses in thestudy on school A, and already_ incorporated into the taxonomy. They received suppOrt' from the preliminary principal components analysis. IThe analyses were carried out with a computer programme XOS2 produced byInternational Computers Limited, ICL, 1900 series, Stat stical Analysis Mark 2 (9). The I factor analysis was carried out on a correlation matrix, t e dimensions of the test spacebeing.derived from a principal components analysis in ich ninety perof the'variance was accounted for by five dimensions or Components. Five factors accountedfor approximately ninety per cent of the variance. Fact rs were not rotated to'a final.solution in view of the fact that responses from only a all sample of subjects had beenscored.. Furthermore,,it was only intended use the analysis in order to discover whetherthe intuitive allocation ol responses to categories and groups of categories was meaningful,and in order to prepare the way for a siMplified*taxonOmy.f'Fpctor analysis results. In the preliminary principal components analysis six componentiaccounted for sixty per, cent of the-varia7ce. /I226/ These were:1.A general component, accounting for over twenty five per cent of thevariance, and relating to the total number of responses made under eachcategory.2.A component whose bipolarity appears to relate to the 'seeking informa-tionseeking opinion' and the 'open-closed' dichotomies. Over ten percent of the variance is accounted for by this component.3.A. manipulative component, accounting for over eight per cent of thevariance.A component accounting for over six per cent of the variance, but vvhichit is difficult to label. It appears that subjects whose scores tend to bepositively loaded on this component choose to seek specification ofplaces,- times and persons, rather than activities.5.A number of personal reference variables have loadings on this component,which accounts for over five per cent of the variance. The personalreference loadings arein both directions, and what appears to matter iswhether or not the personal references are situationally appropriate.6.A component which appears to relate to inadequacy of response. Aboutfive..per cent of the variance is accounted for by-this component.7-15.Nine components accounted for a further thirty per cent of the variance,but as the responses of only thirty subjects on nine topics had beenscored over the seventy two categories, it is difficult if not impossible toassign meaningful labels.The grouped categories on which factor analysis was (PERS) H.N General (GEN L) 1.5, 6.

Response. This is clearly a general factor, accounting for over fifty seven per cent of thevariance, and relates to the total number of responses made under each groupekcategory.The'variable 'response' has a positive leading of 0.97 nn this factAr.2 Testing. This factor accounts for thirteen per cent of the variance. The evidence forbipolarity is strong, and this primarily relates to the 'closed-open' dichotomy, the loadingsbeing + 0.77 and - 0.68 respectively, that is to say both loadings are high and they are inopp6<te directions. Closed questions may be'regarded as serving the purpose of testinghypotheses which are being advanced by the questioners, and in such cases it Might beexpected that subjects will be interested in obtaining opinions. Such opinions would serveas feedback on the testing procedure. Consistent with this view is the finding of highpositive loadings on the factor of the following variables:'I-you'(+.59)'Personal'(+.22)'Seeking opinion'(+.49)The testing associated with this factor would thus appear to involve more than justhypothesis-testing. It is as though those who are being questioned are also being tested fortheir reactions, and not simply for their usefulness as sourcesof information. The loadingof 'seeking information' on the factor is negatiVe (- .46) but this does not mean thatquestions are being used for manipulative puiposes. In fact, 'manipulative' has a slightnegative loading (- .16) whereas the dichotomous variable 'reduce uncertainty' has apositive loading (+ .20).The meaning of the high loadings of the two variables 'description' ( +:57) and .'explanation' (+ .67) on the factor is not clear. Subjects testing for and seeking 6pinicinsmight also be expected to show a greater interest in explanations than descriptions, butthe reverse position appears to hold here. It may be a matter of using the form which ismore suitable for the questioner's purpose. Whereas open questions may be appropriatewhen seeking explanation's, closed questions are more likely to be used when seekingdescriptions. It may be urged that requests for explanation usually begin with interroga-tive words like 'why' and 'how'..These are inevitably open questions. Fuithermore, whensubjects ask questions Seeking explanation, it is more usual to suppose that they do notknow what the answer is, and thatthey probably do not have an hypothesis to test; Whenseeking description, however, subjects are as likely to use the closed question say, 'Is itred?' as the open question 'What colour is it?'. Furthermore, open questions of the form'What causes its redness?' are almost certainly less frequent than questions of the form'Is. it red?'.3. Complexity. This factor accounts for over six per cent of the variance. The evidencefor bipolarity is strong, and this primarily relates to the 'complexity-ski-106W dicholoadings are - .57 and + .52 respectively; that is to say there is a high negativeloading of complekityand-a-high positive-loading-of-simplicity-.on-the-factorr Congruent--with this is the finding that the 'particular-general' dichotoMy is also-relevant. The loadingof !particular' on the factor is positiire (+ .30) and this strengthens the association of thisvariable with 'simplicity'. The negative loading'Of 'general (- .23) on the factor offers anassociation that may be expected with 'complexity'. It makes sense to suppose thatsubjects whose qiiestions are coMplex will be more likely to ask general and abstractquestions. There is a positive loading of 'placing' (+ .32) on the factor, and this would-appearto associate requests for information identifying persons, things, times and places 229 with 'simplicity'. Does this mean that this kind of question, i.e. the 'placing' question, ismore direct, to the point, and therefore simpler? A difficulty arises at this point. It doesmot follow that because subjects ask simple questions, they do so- because they are unableto ask complex questions. it is true, of course, that complex questions will offer cognitiveproblems to the less able. Syntactical complexity in.particular might be expellted to bewithin the reach of the more able. But subjects may choose to write simple questions in.spite of the fact that they are able to write cOmplek questions. It may bea matter ofstyle; or even possibly a sign of ability to think clearly and to give clear expression toone's thoughts.The variables 'manipulation (- .31) and 'suggesting answer' (- .26) both havenegative loadings on the factor. This is consistent with a suggestion that the use ofquestions for manipulative purposes introduces a cOmplicatiOn into the questioningsituation. Loadings of the dichotomous variables on this factor were positive, associating'reduce uncertainty (+ .21) and 'free from suggestions' .(+ .21) with 'simplicity'. lf,iipossible that subjeCts WhO are capable of formulating complex questions will also tie moreadept in the use of questions for.manipulative purposes, althoUgh it does not follow thatthey will necessarily be more inclined to 46 so. The negative loading of 'impersonal'(- .2.1) on the faCtor may be interpreted as indicating that persons who are Capable ofwriting complex' questions are also able 'o frame questioni without persons.This dois not mean that they will nece rily.make personal referenCes, as theassociated negative !biding of 'we -they' (- .20) on the factor testifies;The suggestion hereis that impersonal questions are possibly more difficult to frame. The negative loading of'number of words' (- .38) on the factor is consistent with a vieW-that more complex.i qUestions tend to require more words. /4. Manipulation. This factor, accounts for over seven per cent of the variance: The evidencefor bipolarity is strong, and primarily relates to the 'rn-anipulation-reduce uncertainty' _dichotomy, the loadings being positive for 'manipulation' (+ .65) and negative for 'reduceuncertainty' (- .47). We might expect that there will be an association between `manipUlation'and 'suggesting answers' and in fact the 'suggesting answers -- free froM suggestions'dichotomy, with loadings of + 49 and .41 respectively, is in evidence. It appears,therefore, that subjects who. use questiont. in order to express an attitude or make arequest, tend also to suggeSt how their questions should be answered. Furthermore, theytend to seek an opinion rather than information; the loadings of these two variables 'seeksopinion' and 'seeks information' on the factor being + .22 and -..26 respectively. Consistentwith this, they tend to avoid partiCular and direct references, preferring explanation toidentification or specification of persons and objects. The relevant loadings are 'particular'(, .26), 'placing' I- .28), and 'explanatiOn' (+ .36).5. Personal reference& This factor accounts for over four per cent of the variance. Theevidence for bipolarity is again strong, and primarily relates to the dichotomy 'personal'(+ .50)impersonal39)% Consistent With these loadings are the positive loadings of'we-they' (+ .41) and 'I ,You' A1) on the factor. In this connection, it is interesting tonote-that these two latter variables are in opposite direction of polarity When consideredinrelation to Factor 4-viz. 'manipulation'. ('we-they' + .15, 'I-you' - .26) We may wonderhoW, and in what way, 'we:they' could be-supposed to be more manipulative than 'I-you',but we need not doubt that both variables have a personal reference. There is no obviousexplanation for the positive loading of 'number of words' (+ .34)4on the factor, althoughit is arguable that subjecti who make more personal -references are engaging in a task that 230 is Superfluous to the requirements of a strictly information-seeking situation, and thatthey will therefore tend to use a greater number Of words..With regard to the loading of 'placing' (+ .23) on this factor, associating thevariable with 'personal', it may be that subjects'who make personal references tend alsoto ask questions regarding identity of persons and things; but there does not appear tobe any strong reason why this should be so. . 6.4.2In the light of the findings mentioned, it would seem to be reasonable to collapse codingdecisions in accordance with the following chart: TAXONOMY OF QUESTIONSSimplified Flow Chart S,TART.HERE: A responseconta n a question?

As subjects grow older, theirquestions may increasein frequency at first, but a decline in frequency can follow while .the quality of questionsimproves.Boys apparently tend to ask more questions thangirls, 'except at the age of twb years when the greater frequency of girls' questions maybe attributed to their earlier language development. With regard to mental activity,'some evidence exists for a curvilinear relationship between number of questiOns asked ,and favourable scores on measures of pedagogical interest.Questions have, not unnaturally; been used as a measure of curiosity, and it ison the assumption that in the case of MC children; curiosity behaviours hey? beenencouraged, that a higher frequency of questions is expected from them.The question-framing behaviour of adolescent pUpils was investigated using ataxonomy of questions designed to indicate dimensions and categories where social classdifferences might be observable. Two schools were visited, and written questions wereelicited from pupils on a number Of. topics. The responses of twelve girls from schoolA were analysed, and served as a basis upon which the taxonomy was developed. Theresponses of thirty boys frOm school B were then analysed. Although individual differ-ences betWeen the social class.groUps in school A did not reach an acceptable level ofsignificance statistically, a tendency for the MC subjects to ask questions of, greaterlength, complexity and sophistication was discernible. They wrote fewer questions,but as their questions were longer, and the amount of time allowed was the same forall subjects, this is understandable: A similar pattern of results emerged.for school B,an when prOfiles for the two social class groups were compared,, taking the directionresults of school A as a basis for prediction, the data indicated differences in thepredic ed direction which were statistiCally. significantith respect to intelligence, the two social class groups do not appear to havebeen hom geneous.

His observation that this may arise because the MC pupils could have been'overachieliers' and the WC ones 'underachievers' encourages, or even requires, a digressioninto the methodological hazards of making and interpreting social class Oomparisons.,This digression is necessary because its substance justifies the switch of emphasis. awayfrom the.social class differences as exemplified in chapters 5, 6 and 7 to the study of theoperation of curiosity and questioning within the working dais (chapters 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9).Social class comparisons of small samples of pupils ofmatChed attainment (orability) within a single school fail to provide 'valid estimates of the significance of socialclass as a determinant of differences in so far as the samples are typical Crf the populationsto which generalisation is intended and in so far as the measures of attainment and 1 .abilityare not furictio;ing as independent variables. Unfortunately a mass of evidencecan be adduced to stiow that both propositions can be true. ;\\We have no hrief to set out the full argumonts about the relationships' etween)0 .scores, the concept of 'intelligence', and the assumptions and logical coherence of theargbMents that assign proportions of variance to genetic and environmental influences,.to 10 scores. Suffice it to say that bOth Jensen (1968) and Eysenck (1971) have under-estimated the extent toWhich 10 scores can be shifted by induced experiences. Skeels' ',(1966) demonstration of a fifty five IQ point difference in 'experimental' and 'con ofgrburis of fostered andorphanage-children and Heber and Garner's (1970) hi threepoint differeacet-in trained and untrained children are the two stror examples ofIQ scores being affected by interference with normal experience for 'disadvantaged!children, while many significant but less dramatic shifts could also be cited (Bereiter,1972; Creed & Robinson, 1971; Gray and Klaus, 1965; Weikart, 1972)../Such studiesconcentrate their attention upon Childrenat the bottOm end of the status hierarchies ofsociety and that these are underachievers in the educational system has alsobeen repeatedly demonstrated (Douglas, 1967;Douglas, Ross & SiMpson, 1971: Husen,1972). AttainMent even more than IQ scores are depressed'in WC children and thisj depresSion 1923):Hence to match MC 10 scores is 'a odd prpcedure, sinceit is likely that the WC *scores are underestimates of the riot tial and overestimatesof the attainment measure (Stream) which we need.

What do. MC parents do if their children are below average on develop-mental norms that parents accept as desirable? Do they step up 'home education' tobring their children uptci average, and are they successful in such enterprises? If they6 annfail are they more likely' to pull their children out of the state sector of. education? Thepoint of raising these questions is to suggest and we can do no, more, that the MC boysin our study may also have been somewhat atypical, especially thoSe in the lowerstreams. Whether or not -any abnormality results in the.parental behaviour becomingultra middle class or moJssez faire we cannot say.For our particular subjects we should need to know their individual familyhittofies, bUt more generally we deCided that it was notinformative to make socialclass comparisons at secondary age levels. If, in such studies, we relaxed controls..for indices.of ability;or attainment, our work would be condemned as futile. if wemaintained the controls we would be eliminating much of the variance attributableto social clasS. Until the climate of academic opinion shifts, and there is someconsensus about definitionsof 'intelligence' supported by an adequate, theory linkedto measures; and until those of us who share an interactional viewpoint are able topersuade both rabid environmentalists and staunch hereditariani of theft inconsistencies,we had better direct our efforts to demOnstratiOns of the kinds of experiencithat canlead to learning that can beseen as associated with 'intelligence'. 6.6.

We chose social class as a possibledifferentiating variable between Children.' 7.1. Finding Out (W.P. Robinso & L. Abramsky) Introduction. Many people think that one of'the most i ortant functions of education.is to teich children-how to find out iriformation they want ut have lot got and howto master, now skills should they ever wish to do so. Knowing ow to find out is aparticularly valuable skill, if only because we would find it irnpos ible and uneconomicto learn so much that we never had to learn more.The skill has two basic components which we shall call strategy\u00e0n source ofinformation. By 'strategy' we mean the activity in which the person enyages order tofind out, e.g. observation, experiment, asking, reading, reasoning etc. By 'sourceofinformation' We mean the particular respondent, book or programme etc. to which thepersOn turns for the information. We shall refer to the combination of strategy and Nsource as the method so that asking ona'3 parents, reading in a history book and watchingand listening to the news are methods.We wanted to find out The range ofimethitidliiiiiwn to children, nearing the endOf We-Middle school phase of their education and for which problems they might usewhich methods: The age group was selected because we expected all methods to be available to the most advanced ten to eleven year olds and we wished to see whetherthere were differences -'mong children of the age group. Although we might have beeninterested in differences associated with age, sex, intelligence or other personalitycharacteristics, we concentrated upon social class; with, the particular concern beingthat WC children might differ from their/MC peers.Since our enquiries were not set in a wealth of accumulated knowledge and wehad limited resources, we had to devise our own instruments and could do no more thanbegin to pose some of the probleMs in this areaWe did not try to fin, d out which methods children in fact used to answer theirquestions oreven whether they bothered to satisfy their curiosity at all. We would haveliked to have obtained such information, but regarded interviews as giving the best returnfor initial investment. We decided to use only small groups of children to maintain amaximum of homogeneity on other sources of variance such as school experience. MethbdSubjects. The children were drawn from two of four classes in an unstreamed middleschool drawing its intake from both a residential area and a council estate in the suburbsof Southampton. Children were screened on Raven's Progressive Matrices, and teachersgave details of fathers' occupations. On the basis'of this information an attempt was made/to construct grouPs of girls and boys matched on Raven's scores but different on socialclass. This proved to be difficult. In the end five MCrand five WC girls were extracted, butboys' numbers were so low as to render comparisons impossible. For the girls in themiddle class group, the mean age was 10.9, the mean non - verbal. IQ scores 116, andfathers' occupations were in Hall' -Jones ranking 1 or 2. For WC girlsnmean age was 10.9,mean non-verbal. IQ 113 and fathers' occupations were in Hall-Jones categories 6 exceptfor one in 5b. The'girls were clearly well above :average, ability for their age group. Materials. The itemvfOr the questionnaire were to be presented orally in an interview.Since we were primarily interested in how children would find out what, they didnotalready know, we were obliged to include as many items as feasible for which this wouldbe true. However, in practice the interviewer observed that children found it disturbingnot to know the answers tbthe questions presented. Explanations that we were:interestedin how children would :find out and that the items were deliberately chosento be outsidetheir :knowledge did not allay suspicions and anxieties. Such is our culture! Knowing theanswers is what counts. We overcame this difficulty by including some items to which thechildren would know the, answers and then asked them how they found these outThe items were intended to cover the range of methodi we could think otrFOrmost items there was more than appropriate and feasibie-s.trategy. We could not prejudgethet availability of human Sources, bu we tried to cover the range of standard referencebOokS and a variety of persons. The main categories covered were observation, experiment,---asking a person, looking at books, p_ap radio, reasoning_and -doing: Personart-O-urces.likely tobe mentioned were parents, peers, Source materials covered were dictionaries, encyClopedias, atlases, and-varioustypes of other reference works.We-have mentioned that most items were asked assuming that the did notknow the answer. This apparent clumsiness was intended to help overcome the assumptionof children that they should know the answers. When a child gave the answer, she was asked how she had found it out. All questions were probed. All indefinites were probed.All questions included 'Are there any otherways yoli could find out?' The Questionnaire1.You know the Evening Echo newspaper (local paper); how could you findout how much it costs? /2/How could yOu find out how td bake a cake?How could you find out what the word 'avaricious' means?4.Cars going in the same direction n-drive down the same side of the road.

At the time of the administration of Raven's Matrices, childrenwere told that, the woman helping would be returning to talk with some of tern. She dulyreturned and spent about twenty, minutes interviewing the selected children individually.The official instructions were:I'm trying to find out something, and I want your help. I want to knowhow boys (girls) your age find out about something when they don't knowthe-answer. I've got a list of questions here. I don't expect you to know theanswers, but I want you to tell me how yoU could find out the answers.There are several different ways of finding out things. For example, youcould ask someone, you could read about it, or watch television, or youcould go and look at it yourielf or do it, or you might just think about it /and work it out for yourself. .This isn't a test. There are no right answers or wrong answers. Yoprobably won't know about lots of these things, but I want you to tell'ifiehow you could find out. All right?The customary checks on understanding were followed by the questiorraireitems. The basic procedure was adhered to, but children were not interrupted Af theywandered from the questions asked. it seemed to be natural for them to interject with thecorrect answer if they knew it They were then asked to recall how they had found out.Whenever indefinites such as 'someone' or vague references to 'a book' were used, aquestion seeking finer specification was asked, e.g. 'Who?', 'What sort of bo k?'. When thechildren had finished responding, they were asked, 'Are there any other wiys you couldfind.out?' and after the reply to this probe; the next questionnaire item w?s given. Allinterviews were tape-recorded.Treatment of Results. Answers were transcribed and coded in accordance with the framedescribed briefly below and fully in Appendix 7.1.The main categories were:A.ObservationB.ExperimentC.Asking a personD.Miss mediareadingE.Mass media- television or radioF.Reasoning,--CL---Learning-throughe-xp-erienceH.No answer or not known!.Oddments that did. not fit into A.-HPersons acting as sources could be specified: 1. Parents, 2. Teacher; 3. Peer,4. Expert by virtue of special training or experience, 5. Specified other person: Thesedifferences could apply to both `A. Observation' and 'C. Asking a Person'. Where personsWere mentioned under G., this was noted in another waY. Under bOth Mass Mediacategories, subscripts were used todenote specific sources. Under 'G. Learning throughexperience!, distinctions were drawn between just practising alone, learning with thehelp of a book and learning with the help of a teacher. I. was noted only when an answermisconstrued a question andiit did not seem possible to get the child to understand theproblem set Scores on these categories and sub-categories were tabulated, and where appropriate,Meng Whitney U tests were run to compare the groups.Each method mentioned was also scared as to how appropriate it was, that is, howlikely it was to yield-the required information, assuming that the source was available. Itwas.also scored in terms of feasibility, that is whether or not the child would be likely tohave access to such sources or resources. For example, a child might have said he couldfly to Northern Ireland to find out what was happening. This would be appropriate, butnot feasible. While our judgements were subjective, and some children's pocket moneymay run to ,the fare and some parents would allow them to go, we thought it worthwhile. to;'nake such assessments. Scores for both ranged from 0 to 2, 1 being used for suggestionswith a measure of doubt.ResultsAlmost all children could give a reasonable answer to 0.8 about the meaning of 'greedy',but the answers to how they had come to know were sufficiently odd to give cause forworry about other answers requiring recall. One girl 'guessed' it, one had 'thought it out',and one 'had seen it done'. 0.8 was dropped from further analysis.

The Children felt it Was.moreimportantknow the answers than to kni.ivy how to find them out.Although these children 'had enjoyed several years of integrated days and a dash. of 'discovery' learning, they appear still to be concerned with immediate convergence onunique answers within a context of set problems. They did not wallow in the elaborationof possibilities.A second interpretation would be that the responses could be viewed ap person-rather than problem-centred. Particularly among the working class there was the implicitapplicatidhiof a leasteffOreOritetitifi:-What is the minimal acceptable response? Hence,the abbreviated indefinite and vague replies. In Chapter 2, we refeired to the hazards ofresponse-based learning as distinct from understanding-based learning. To the extent thatwe had createdan artificial situation and thechildren were as co-operative as children .tend to be, we perhaps unwittingly encouraged the adoption of such an orientation.Unfortunately thetwo principles of 'one-answer mentality' and 'least effort' bothlead us to expect similar responses in the situation we used To differentiate between themwould require an experimental manipulation. Suffice it to say that one or other or bothof these may have been operating and could explain the differential behaviour of the twosocial class grOups as well as the absolute performance, if we hid evidence that the WC aremore person- than problem-centred. Such evidence was produced in chapter 2.We did; of course, wish to eliminate these influences sinceour goal was to find outwhat strategies and sources children could think of as ways of solving problems. Theprobing should likewise have encouraged the production Of alternatives and anincrease inexplicitness and specificity. in so far as these objectives were realised, .weare justified inconciudingthat the WC class girls were Ids able than their MP peers to think of varied andexplicitways of finding out answers to the problems posed. 249 APPENDIX 7.1CATEGORIES FOR STRATEGY AND SOURCE Running through the categories of Observati,on', 'Experiment', 'Asking Other people','Reading' and deemed desirable todistinguiSh aotive goal-directed attempts to learn and passive riception of information.

In general, the readingages of the boys were compar ble to t ell' chronological ages, and_in any case were matchedacross groups. While there wer no soc al class differences in the total number questionsasked there were substantial-di \".1renc in other rwpects. The WC boys produced morestatements (in intonation as we as fo m) instead of questions and a higher proportion ofquestions.were of the same for indicating indicating a stereotyping absent in MC boys; it med as though they wished to do what was 'right\", but did not have genu.ne qUestionstwasor. The questions they produced were less complex grammatically (no more than onemain clause) and more of them focused upon perceptual rather than conceptual aspectsof the stimuli, e.g. 'Are they always green?' as opposed to 'How does-it work?'. In thisStudy, the objective evidence pointed to differences in lite if not in competence, althoughit might be argued that the fact that since the WC boys produced .a mixture of statementsand questions they were still developing the skill: Although there was only a low incid7.ence of grammatically unacceptable forms within questions themselves, the errors whichdid occur were normally describable in one or other of Brown's (see above) development-ally prior forms. Subjectively, the impression was that the WC boys were less genuinelycurious, but were more enthusiastic in their willingness of co-operate. At age seven then,we might conclude that WC .boys are comparatively retarded viva viz MC boys, butwhetheror not they are also developing in a different direction we do not know. 7.3. CoMpetence at Posing Single Questions 7.3:1..Competence at Question-Posing: Middle school PupilsIff section-7.2. we have seen that there is some evidence for a developmental sequencein children's capacities to produce questions and'that at the formal, level this sequence,is consistent with generative transformational grmMars. Further, there may be a set .order in which questions utilising the special interrogative 'wh' words appear and thismay be related to difficulty of the underlying concepts. Social class-differences areconsistent with the idea of a develOpmental lag-in the-working class, at least as far asthe formal requirements of questioning are concerned. But is there a similar lag in thesemantic and pragmatic: aspects of questioning such that WC-children are less likely to beable to formulate questions that will evoke the type of answer wanted? Given that thereis something .a child wants to know, can he frame a question that could evoke an .appropriate answer?Single Questions, Single Answerso attempt to answer this question Susan Rackstraw (1972) deVised a technique wherebychildren were provided with statements but had :to construct questions to which thestatements could be answers. Children-aged ten had no difficulty understanding the natureof the task,.but with several variations in the form of the answers and a wide coverage of'wh'. words, shefound a number of social class differerkes.

The narrative and desCriptive passages were analysed separatelyfor the boys and girls of each social class group.1.The total number of questions of,each child was counted and entered into a three-way analysis of variance with two values of each variable (sex, social class, type of passage).2.,As for 1, but.only questions which were grammatically acceptable, other thanhaving questionMarks or capital letters missing, were used3.'Imperfect' questions generated by each child were divided into four categories:-Spelling mistakes.(ii)Grammatical mistakes.OMPresupposition. e.g. 'What did, they give him?' 'Have they sharp edges?'(iv)Questionsl\\iot answered in the text. e.g. 'In what century did he live?'Spelling and grammatical mistakes were later categorised together, and a threeWayanalysis of variance done.It was noticed that most of the'mistakes' occurred in Category (iii), and sofurther calculations were made. If the presupposition in the question referred to something stated or implied in the previous question, this second 'question was counted to becorrect-ag. Q.1 'Whue did James one mor.-.ing?'0.3 'What was he carrying?' Question' 2 can now be marked correct as 'he'' refers backto stated James Badger in Question 1. Question 3 can also be marked correct, since 'he'.,again referi to James Badger implied in Question Z If the presuppoSition in the questiondid not refer back to something stated or implied in the previous question, the questionremained noted as indorrect, .(iii) e.g. 'Do they sink?' (Meaning people/animals), 0.2 'AreInc, like ordinary grains?' (Meaning grains of quicksand). On the batis of these further calculions, two more three-way analyses of variance were done, one which dealt with'accepble' quettions of the second kind, and another which examined the totatamountof pres pposition generated by the ohildren.4.The final stage was to try and find out if the children found it more difficult to; askquesticns, the answers to whichwereexpresied through different and possibly difficUltgrammatical structures. Also, did they avoid any particular type of question? Eachparagraph was divided into eight sections, three of which were subdivided. This coveredevery important point of information upon which relevant questions could be asked. Theywere scored irrespective of spelling, grammatical or presupposition msitakes, and to obtaina fullscore of twelve,qv, stions had to be attempted on each point. Some children askedmore than one question on the same tOpic, and a cross was Put against their score toindicate this. The-divisionmade of the paragraphs was:Narrative passageA'In the early da ys. of the railwaysB(1;2)Jamet-Badger lived in a house-near the NutchestersLine.Carly one morning. .7.D(1,2)..he saw that a landslide had blocked, the track.ESo he dashed along with a lantern ...-.F..j.ust in time to save the train.G(1,2, The people of Nutwood were:so proud of his deed that they gave him3)a medal.HJames was quite a hero in the village.'Descriptive passageA'Quicksand looks like ordinary sand ..B(1,2) ....,which is why unlucky animals and sometimes people stu-nble. into,it by mistale and sink.C(1,2) Unlike grains of ordinary sand which have sharp edges, quicksandgrains are round,DThere is water underneath....E(1,2,....which separates them.and lifts them up -- in a sense it floats3).and thus the sand cannot take solid weight.Any heavy object that falls into quicksand sinks, as though throughwater ....but much more slowly'.A final analysis dealt with the results obtained by these calculations. c.)Results.-1.MC childrenasked more questions than WC children (F = 38.75, <.901.),--.4and boys (F 1/50, p <-05).

Freeman)-In the last section we have described our investigations friteAheCoMpetenCe of ten yearold WC and MC children to formulate questions in linguistically appropriate ways ongiven points of information.The two experiments to be described here were designed to extend the scppe ofthese investigations. For although it is important to distover whether, when confrontedwith pieces of information of varying degrees of complexity,\"a child is able to formulatethe correct questions to which these korrnation Points,are the answers, his would notbe a very common occurrence in teal-life situatioi:s. That is, after reading a story orseeing a film or televisiOn progtamme, providing sufficient stimulation has been pro-duced to ask questions, it is more probable that the questions asked would be aboutthings extraneous to the stated content of the book or film. For exaMple, if on a newsbulletin ait was announced that 1,000 American soldiers were being sent to Sandakan, aninformation-seeking question would more likely be 'Where is Sandakan?' rather than'Where are 1,000 American soldiers being sent?', or 'Who is being sent to Sandakan?'.Thus the question is asked about a missing piece Of informatien, or'one about which thequestioner-is not certaina frequent occurrence in everyday life, not only through lackof knowledge, but also because of interruptions such as coughs and traffit noises, or gaps=caused by bad telephone connections or the occasional word illegibly written. ..In these two experirnents_therefore:-.-We attempted to design tasks in which the:important information'Points were missin :!_ln.ihe first, subjects were presented with aSet of sentenceS fipm-which-sdtne of the words had been blOcked out, and in the second,a short story, also with severai words blocked ouvEach subject was required to writedown the question's they would have to ask in order to find out what the Missing word orwords were It was expected that children of higher IQ would,be able toperform thetasks better than thoselower IQ, and in viewof our previous results which indicatedthat MC children were more corivetent: than WC children at finding and asking well-formed questionS'about Stated points of information, we also expected to find a socialclass difference.

Both,experiments were designed to cover a wide range of possible interrogativesfor subjects to use, i.e who, why, when, Where, What (identification), what for (explanation), which, how (degree), how (rnanner). The first task consisted of nine unrelatedstatements, each with a gap which should have contained an important information point.The second task was a short story of approximately one hundred words, again with ninegaps in Places of various points of. information. The content of the two tasks was asfollowsTask 1ExarAple:'My name isQ.'What is your name?' .Last weekend, .I went to see who lives with her mother inWinchester.'Q.2..'John always takes the short cut through the fields so that hecanQ.;when Igo to town, I promise to' return the books to thelibrary.a. 4.The cinema is by thetown.

It was.hoped that this original sample of 168 subjects would provide uswith several comparison grOups whose performances we could examine on thebasis ofsocial class and IQ. However, this unfortunately was not the case. We were unable toobtain background information fotwenty-one Subjects, and we found an unfortunatelylow percentage of MC children, especially boys, in the sample. There were only three MCboys ,(social classes 1-4) witpItil's over 100, and only one'MC boy with an 10 of leSs than100. Similarly; there was only one MC girl with an IQ of lets than 100.

We then scored the scripts a second time, and in this instance, in addition to the 'correct'questions of thp praeviouS analysis, we also included in the total for each subject, questionswhich contained spelling mistakes, and 'bizarre' questions. A 'bizarre' question was oneWhich;in effect, would give the required answer to fill, the gap left by the\\missing informa-tion point, but was one which appeared to be a lengthy and somewhat complicated methodof achieving this'end.For example, in Task 1 an expected question would fiave been,'Where iithe cinema?. A 'bizarre' example was 'What is it that is on. the left off the cinema,'past the Post Office in town?'

All three feitures are necessary, conditionsfor success. Mosher and Hornsby (op.cit.) constructed anarray of coloured drawings offorty two common objects (e.g. hammer,- gloves, doll) which_ could be grouped into higher-__order categories (e.g.itoolg, clothes, things you caneat, 'red', pairs). In the firsiiun ofquestioning, children were allowed an unlimited numberofquettions to find out whatthe eXperimenter had in mind, in the second they were confined to ten. While the resultsare presented less rigorously than ours, we can quote that in their first experiment hypo-thesis scanning was used ninety per cent of six year olds, twenty.five per cent cif _eightyear olds while among eleven yearolds it occurred only as'\"a scattering df temPtationunresis-ted'. For/constraint questions the inverse held. The number of qtiestionsinecessaryto achieve soltitions were twenty six; fifteen and respectively. While similarresults were fbund in the second experiMent, the eight year olds showed a higher_incidence of hypothesis scanning; although they continued to open with constraintquestions-they did not proceed to narrow (funnel) as the eleven year olds, but switchedto.specifidguesses. ,While 'Twenty Questions' has a visibly finite number of possible solutions, asecond puzzle had neither. After a practice trial, children were given a brief outline ofa car Crash and had to queition the experimenter with closed questions to ascertain howthe accident happenedIn this activity the eleven year Ole a continued to operate mainlywith constraint questions Isixty per cent), but eight yearoldS did-not-(tfiirtY three percent). They behaved more like the six year olds. When asked whether fhey had a system,the sixyear olds said they did not, sixteen out of tWenty-eight eight year olds clsimedto have one,\\,but for most of these it consisted of working out the most likely cause ofthe accident\\whereas fifty. per cent of the elevenYear olds explicitly mentioned the\\idea of startingwith broad questions and narrowing down. The 'intermediacy' of the .i_____eight-year-olde-performance is further illustrated by their stated preference for a generalrather than a speCific question when asked tcy say which was likely-to be more useful.' 'At six only a minority of children made this choice, while all elevenyear olds did andgave appropriate justifications. .'-: . ,Mosher and Hornsby conciuded that, while six year olds do not have adequate,categories of grouping or strategies,for interrogation, eleven year olds' havp both.

There was no substantive relationship betWeen Raven's scores andany of the dependent variables, with exception of a weak trend for low scorers either tohave inadequate reasons for preferring the more general of_the offered questions or tochoose the more specific questidn..ComParison of Performance in the two ExperimentiThe variables on Which results could be directly compared were percentage constraintsand-incidence of-narrowing. The percentages of constraints across the two experiMentscorrelated 0.51(p4.05), while 'narrowing' was also associated (Fisher Exact Probability .Test, p <.05) (4 S's narrowed in both, 14 in neither). DiscussionCoMparison of results in the two experiments suggests some degree of consistenWin-performance, a fact which is satisfying in view of the relatively subjectiveciiteria used inclassifying questions in the second experiment and the very wide individual differencesobtained. There was no evidence for any social class-based differences in performance;not only were all differences non-significant, but also each of the three groups obtainedthe best score on at least one of the dependent variables. Intelligence test scores werefound,to have some relevance; subjects with higher Raven's scores tended to ask a brOader.opening question and were more likely to use narrowing constraints in the first investiga-tion, and (although this result did; not quite attain significance) appeared rather better atrecognising a Superior strategy in the second experiment, after not having employed one .in the first piece. HoViiever, these advantaget were not sufficient, to.make the brightersubjects superior in performance overall.The general impression obtained was that the subjects were not very good at'Twenty Questions'. Comparing the results with those of Mcisher and Hornsby, the level-of performance overall here is closer to that of their eight Year olds than that of theireleven year olds. Why is it that fourteen and fifteen year olds in the present study performso badly? FOr example, they required a mean of 14.6 questions to guess one object inExperiment (i), and asked only forty three per cent and eighteen per cent constraintquestions in Eirperiments (i) and -(ii) respectively? One possible explanation lies in thefact that the Mosher and Hornsby materials were in colour and those used here were in-black and white.-Seventy per cent of the American eleven year olds used 'intrinsicperceptible'.attributesin their constraint questions, and colour was probably prominentamong these. Another line of exPlanation would cite a reluctance to stick to a strategywhich, although more efficient, involves rather greater cognitive strain; and part by thefrequently'observed 'inability or unwillingness' to utilise negative information c.(Donaldson, 1959). The explanation of this phenomenon is problematical, and beyondthe scope of this study, but it would appear that might have been due to a negativereinforaing effect on the part of a 'No' response, which vitiated the brriial information-value of the question; it frequently.happened that a subject. would begain a game inExperiment (i) by asking a number of constraint-questions, using some of the moreobvious equivalent-classes; for instance, 'forms of transport' or 'animals'; if all these metwith a 'No' answer, he would resort to a process of pure hypothesii-testing, often ignoringsuch information he should formally haVe gained by his previous constraint-seeking if he (lid not get the answer quickly.. Thii could simply be a case of the extinction of a ros.ponse,ofoivived by frustration which serves to impair the levelof cognitive functioning. 7.4.2 Interrogation Strategies.and Social Class (F.M.Freeman)With a selected sub - sample of girls'taken from those children described in section 7.3.2,We played a Variation on-atheme by..Mosher and Hornsby by switchintirom'an artificial .,array to a set of photographs. depicting two national costumes, historical\\events, famous \\interest people, popUlar people,.and 'crops.

If the answer was 'No', they were then requested to ask closedquestions to try to find the answer. Subjects were given a map of the. world to consult ifnecessary, the interview was.recorded, and they were allowed three minutes for` each. topic.It was made clear that this was not a test and that only we would know what they had clOne.The specific instructions were as follows:'I'd like you to look at several Photographs.

Here, subiects were required tofind out three things rather than one the name of the perscin concerned, where theevent took place, and the.approximate date.A_ t the end of the interview the girls were told that we were Rot interested in howquickly they got the right answers, but only in the way they went about finding out. Itwas no kind of test, and they were asked not to describe materials or procedure to anyoneelse until everybody had been seen.Treatment of Results. During the course of the interviews it became evident that, the girlshad not f011owed our request not to talk about the pictures with those not yet interviewed.The incidence of /cheating'.wat very high, and our detective work showed that conserve-tively an average of nearly two 'answers' had been disclosed. We cut out all responseswhich indicated that answers were already known. These were indicated by immediatecorrect solutions and-by such devHous questions as 'Does his second name begin with a P?'and 'is his first name John?'. (The on' light relief came from the occasional Confusionstemming from the two sets of pictures. A subject confronted with 'Napoleon retreatingfrom Moscow', findin, her speedy offer of 'General de Gaulle' rejected, had toiumpsome clever hoops to maintain that'she had no prior knowledge of the materials./ Usableresponses were reduced to means of Z5 for Groups A, 17 for Group B and 3.3 forGroup Ca cheating incidence ofihirty seven per cent. Calculations were based onscores per photograph. r Questions and performance overall werecategorised under five headings:C (Coristraint questions); N (Narrowing any constraint question following upon aprevious constraint), S (Specific hypotheses); I (Questims inappropriate to any plan,A (Correct answer achieved). ReiultsAnalysis of variance revealed no differences between Groups A, B and C in the percentageof Constraint or Narrowing questions. On the other hand Group A asked significantlY: \".more questions than either of the other groups (p <.05) and achieved a greater proportion\\ of solutions than Group C (p <.05) (and marginally more' than GroUp B (p <.10 (seeTable 7.4.5).

It is reportedfor two reasons, one substantive, the other technological. Although we cannot locateeither IQ 'or social class as independent sources of variance on two measures, they operate;.(..,r1unttion. Without a low I0 MC group, we cannot be sure that social clan would notoperate on its own.5 Techno' ogically, the problem to be raised is one of hoW to conduct successiveinterviews without subjects interacting in such a way as to destroythe investigation. Firstof all,lhe individual interviews were conducted in the proverbial friendly and,relaxedatmosphere', and the girls were assured it was not a-test.:Tho late? The school authoritieswere efficient in their arrangements for our activities. We had conducted timed testingwith the Raven's Progressive Matrices and thaielected girls on some unknown criterionfor individual interviews. It is possible Viet the machine-like precision of the operationproved to be its own undoing. While it is of no direcfrelevance to the particula studieshere thessue of how successive interviews can be conducted without interference is onethat merits serious inquiry. 7.5 Questions incProblern Solving There are a number of unnatural features in the 'Twenty Questions' games that may have O been responsible for the far from ideal performance of the adolescents. Who wants toknow which of forty two pictures some strange'visitorhas in mind? Who wants to knowthe answer to an opertalternatives problem? If you enjoy pitting your wits againstprobleMs, if yob enjoy working out and enacting clever strategies, then suth tasks canhave an attraction.. The provision of photographs of real personages and producti mighthave been expected to influence the motivational states of subjects, but there is scantevidence for this in the dataOur final adventure into interrogatiorfstrategies sacrificed the previow.iy-exercised degree of control over the type of responses emitted in the interest of increasing ,the subjects' involvement. We selected threetasks each intended to bedistant from theschool environment, none of whiCh required the guessing of arbitrarily contrived ideas insomeone else'S head -The significance of the'eXperimenter as a person was attenuated bothby having potentially more interesting tasks to perform and by haying the subjects workin grOups, while the experimenter faded into the role of observer.The first task in which various pieces of cardboard could be arranged into ahollow square by working out the relevance of certain visible cues was the most academicof the three. The second task required the subjects to construct a model helicopter- froman Airfix kit.The-third task was to recall and re- construct the manner in which severalgoals came to be scored in the 1964 European Cup Final from watering a film of thematch. . _In order to complete each of these ta'Wse number of subsidiary problems Mustbe solved. AlthoUgh it may not be possible to-Welty 'ideal' strategies for any of these,some evaluative comments about particular strategies adOpted can be made.:One importantrequirernent for successU solutions is to pose relevant. questions, and it was in these that-we were particularly interested. Would the children ask' any queitions in the course 'of theiractivities? Would they ask relevant questiorie in a sensible order? If we could have specifieda 'unique' ideal strategy:(or set of strategies) in advance, we might have chosen to describethe performance of the groups against such a frameWork. We chose rather to create con-trasting groups as a basis for relative comparisons. 'One complex variable used was the somewhat inevitable intelligence test scores.We might reasonably expect more intelligent children to be more successful at analysing,processing and synthesising the information in the tasks. In our earlier studies of thequ estioning- behaviour of children of this age group, 'social class' has not operated as aStriingdiscriminating variable, but intelligence test scores have had relevance. The incot,-Oration of a divisiOn-not simply to demonstretedifferences, but AO indicate howpotentially better performing subjects maYfeariie the differences irttask perforrnance.Anticipating that the children would not emerge as proficient problemsolveri, weconsidered it worthwhile to give some grouPs brief verbal instructions on how best to setabout the tasks. If 'such perfunctOry ',training' has significapt effects two inferences maybe warranted; children are not generally learning (or ass not learning to apply) the problem-skills.rnentionin section 7.1,and this deficiency might be rapidly remedied.So that social f dtors should not be forgotten and hence to act as a reminderthatin particular situatiOns social considerations will be important, we decided to introduceone source of socially- aced differences into the_grotips. Since we were interested intreating each individu I ase subject in hii own right,. it would have been unwise t6manipulate roles in the group by introduaing special 'leaders' Or something similar. Inchoosing to Manipulate the sociometric rather tharuthe normativestructure of groOps, wehad in mind the practical consideration that teachers allocating children to groups for 277 proiect work can decide to put 'friends' together or can deliberately avlid coups con-strAted on such a basis, We therefore glade up groups of close friendship hoice*and___iiriassociated boys. - .With f. small sample pf subjects, it would not be wise to generalise from theresults we obtain. The suggestions and observations generated inihis paper, as :a-result ofour observations of the way in which the subjects performed the tasks should be moldedprimacil y as a starting roint from which thoughts and future work might be developed.Bearing this in mind, it-was expected that the higher IQroups would performdiffercntly to the lower IQ groups, in that they would talk more, ask more queitions, bemore efficient in noticing and making use of the` concepts available fctr them in Task 1(the puzzle) generate more suggestiOns, and be better able tO'Organisethemse:ves into a.:working- team.' It was also thought that the close friendship groups might be less productive',than the non-friendship groups, because they would spend toomuch time in social exchangesand Pleasantries (Back, 1901), and finally; it was expected that the Vainea.groups would-77perform the tasks andieliiiiie scores more similar in nature to the high IQ groups t n to. their fellow low IQ groups who were untrained. k o MethodMaterials._TasicThethree-taskiiisiere chosen specifically because it was considered they Wduldarouse the interest of our male subjects and would not appear to them to be closelyrelated to academic work. Task 1 was to complete a geometrical shape (a hollow square)which was divided into four sectors. The- sixteen pieces were marked with coloUred starsfour silver stars, three red stars, three blue stars, three green stars and three yellow stars.In addition, pieces which formed the four outside cornersofpthecompleted square weremarked with a black arc. One piece from ea.:11 quarter was placed in an envelope for eachsubject, one of which in each case was a silver piece.The completed shaPe, measured 14\" x 14\" and kyas_made q-thick-white card.The solution to the puzzle wasthatthelOur silver pieces formed thd inside edge ofthe(one in each'quarte!): Each quarter comprisedthe_three pieces of the sarriecoloureg one quarter consisting of one silver piece and the three blue pieces; anotherquarter consisting rlf on4sihmr piece and the three red pieces etc.. The first ten minutes ofthe task had to be spent by the subjects in a discus..;.., of how they could solve theproblem without actually attempting tol do so. A further five minutes was then allowedfor them to put r4ideas they had generated into practice. All conversation was taperecorded and two observerswere present throughout, making notes to aid in the trans:cribi-ng of theto note, as far as was possible who was spoken to, and by whom, andto Jecord any specific social interaction, for example, a display of verbalor physicalaggression by or against one of the subjects.In Task ,2 the groups had to construct an Airfix model of a Westland helicopter.They were given fifteen minutes to do this, and again, all conversation.was recorded, andthe observers made notes.Task 3 consftted of a piece of film taken from a European cup final match betweenEintracht and Real Madrid, which had been kindly loinedto us by Southarnpto IfootballClub. The selected piece of film lasted kipproximately fen minutes and during is timehree goals were scored. Each group saw the film sequence once, then on a se ond runhrough, the film was stopped three times, shortly before each goal was scored. The groups had to come to a decision among themselveitai to what action followed, andwrfichmoves led up to the scoring of the goals. Again he talkftwas tape recorded, and theobservers made notes. ' ..?';----, .The three tasks were completed consecutively by etch group in thesame order asabove, and before and,after finishing the tasks the gro6ps were requested to fill inquestionnaires (Questionnaires?..and 3) which it was hopediwOuld give us additional' - inf imation and possibly clififiOation of theinteraction which had taken place, anti alkoindi ate whether opinions had changfracl during the course of the group.

Subjects. A large, predominently working class boys' 'comprehensive school was se ected for this series otexperitente. The original population consisted of the entire third year of the school; which was dpidedintasix-sets,-some-1-30:boys-in all, the average age of whom' `\\was 13.6. As we intended to use intelligence test scores as a variable, theischool was visited i`-some weeks prior to the Main experiment, and the Raven's ProgressiVe Ailatrices wereadministered to:Yell 130 boys. IQ equivalents were then calculated. For Matching, tolerance. limitsmits Of approximately.four pointsjon either side were allowed. In addition to completingwere the Raven's Matrices, all the boys erequested to fill out a/questionnaire (Questionnaire .'`,.',1) The purpose of this was to obtain information upon which we could base our choke of'friendship' groups and 'non-friendship' group's. /On the basis of this infonnation gathered on the first visit to the school, it wasa/ possible to select six groups of four subjects (one group from each of the six, sets) all, ofWhom were aged ourteen: .1t!,'Group A consisted of a 'non-friendship' group of four hiIQ boys.GrouP9 consisted of.efriendship'Egroup.vf high 10 boy.

Thus, for instance in Group P (Low.I0/Friendship Group/Trained), out of the twenty four possible choices made by the four.subjects ..- each. subject chooting three friends; and three people to work withtwentyone-of-these/choices Were for members of\"the:groUp.

It was considered necessaryfor subiis to be reasonably Popular as workmates, as well as friends, in bider to qualify .for meersI ip of a 'friendship.',group,in case their popularity as,friends-Was dependent .,,upon a.ething which might not be conducive. to efficient problem solving. For example, lo'severalf the boys in the original saMPle obtained quite.Fiigh scores on ihe friendipip ..,.:catego y,,,but few people wished to work with them. This could heiie been because theywere -girded as not being very intelligent or perhaps because their' popularity was baied(-- I- , to some extent on their destructive attitude in class, bringing light relief to their class- mates by fooling around behind the teachers' back, etc.'Non-friendship' groups were again composed of subjects.who scored highly on the'work category and obteil;ed high scores as friends. The main difference here was thatmoneof the choices were reciprocated. That is, a popular member from one Section of the classwas picked to work with similar boys from other sections. For example, in one of thegroups, one subject was rated as a friendby six people, and seven people wished to workwith him, but none of these choices were made by subjects eventually chosen to work withhim in the group experiment who themselves had obtained similar scores. .Instructions and Procedure. It was considered advisable to run a pilot-study of Task 1 (thepuzzle), before using it in the final experiment. This was bedause it had beendesigned bythe experimenter and had never been used by children before, and we had no ideahow longchildren might take to complete it.-. Agroup of four high IQ fourteen year old girls were used for the pilot experiment.They were allowed ten minutes to &Tuss how they would solve the problem, and then given._uplimited time to put their ideas into practice. They in fact completed thesguare in twenty-seven minutes.-Although the time allowed for disbussion (ten minutes) remained the.same in thefinal experiment as in the pilot study, the time allowed for the completion of the patternwas cut to five minutes. This was for two reasons, the first being that much of the latteconversation of.the pilot group was concerned with the mechanics of the task, that is theactual fitting together of the pieces, once they had got hold of all the concepts of the tasksild realised the Solution; after completing one quarter of the square. The second, andPossibly moreimportantreason was that ive.did not want the subjects in the final experi-mentto find it easy to complete the pattern within the time limit. We were essentiallyinterested in the way they - attacked the problem, the use they made of the concepts, andthe ideas they generated for. its solution; although it would of course have been interestingto let each group complete the pattern if they could, and compare their time with differentvariables. For the general- pUrPOses of this study, we decided to forego the possibility ofobtaining statistical differences in the Performance of the groups in favour of a detaileddescription of how these children actually tackled the problem. -When the subjects in the main experiment entered the room where the tasks hadto be performed-, they were asked to sit down at a table where places were numbered from1 to 4, but were told they 1,ould choosetheir own seat. (The numbers were to aid theobiervers when making-notes of the proceedings.) The experiMenter chatted to them for,several moments, asking their names, explaining the use of the tape recorder and generallytrying to put subjects at their ease. SUbjects were then asked to complete Questionnaire 2. .The experiMenter indicated the paper and pens on the table, and informedthe. subjectsthat they could use these if they wished.Task 1 was then begun, and the four 'untrained' g .ups. were given the folloWingspecific instructions:'I want you 'all to listen carefully while I explain what you have to do.. Infront of each of you is an envelope, which contains four pieces of card-board, therefore between you, you have sixteen pieces. When all thesepieces are fitted together, like a jigsaw puzzle, they make a square like this. You can see that there is a square hole in'the middle of the pattern. Youcary\"also see that the square is divided into four parts each part containsfour of the pieces from youcenvelopes. Do you understand so far?I want you to work as a team, and spend the first ten minutes talking witheach other, and deciding which is the best way to complete the pattern.But You must keep all your pieces in front of you all the time.You can touch ybur own pieces, but you must not touch, or -exchange pieces with other members of your team.You must not start trying to make the squr,te yet.You must not mark any of the pieces.Right, you will all please open your packets now, and spread the pieces outon,-the table in front of you, with the side with the stars on top.

Now will you try to make the pattern,working as a team.'The two 'trained' groupS were given the following instructions:want you all to listen carefully while 1 explain what you have to do.

When all these pieces are,fitted together,.like a jigsaw puzz!e, they Make square like this. 'You can see that there is a square hole in the middle of the pattern. Youcan also see that the square is divided into four parts each part containsfour of the small pieces from your envelopes. Do you understand so far?Now .let's go over that again. How many Pieces have each of you got?How many does that make altogether?

Now will you try to make the pattern,working as a team.' 284 -After completing Task 1, whilst the table was being cleared to prepare for thenext task, subjects were encouraged to talk, again in an effort to-make the prOdeedingsappear friendly and relaxed. Task 2 was then begun, and the 'untrained' groups weregiven the following instructions:'I want you all to listen carefully while I explain what you have to:do.ThiS is a model ofWestland Helicopter and here is some glue.

Now watch carefully.'After the three tasks had beeri completed, subjects were asked to completeQuestionnaire 3, and were then allowed to-return to their classroorins, and asked, not tomention what they had done for two days, that is, until all groups had been observed. .The groups were seen individually in Oneof the schoOl's geography rooms, whichhad black-out facilities, awing what would have been lesson time.

CREED) Editor's Introduction. In chapter 6 we have reported briefly Upon ways of finding out, andwe have related these to a variety of problems for a small sample of children. One of theMeans available was to ask someone. Whether or not it is sensible to ail( someone willdepend up:41 a number of factors: Inifiei lier it is the sort of question to whichsomeonemight know the answer, whether other means are readily available, whether a suitablepersOn is readily at hand, whether or not you are prepared to ask someone.For example, if you wish'to knoW where a particular path on Dartmoor leadswhen you are standing there in splendid isolation on a rainy winter's day, reading anyvisible signpost or consulting an Ordnance Survey map is abetter bet than waiting forsomeone as eccentric as yourself to appear. If neither are available, then y6u may have towalk and see where a path leads. Observation and experiment are generally reliable andvalid means for answering empirical questions, and are espeCialiy useful strategies whenthose people. ho might know are absent or when no one actually knows. Of course, youmight decide to wait fOt_the eccentric to appear and ask him. If he is wearing a certainpriton-like Uniform, you may decide he is unapproachable. If his reply mentionsTimbuktoo or is .delivered with too much uncertainty, you may judge him unreliable. Ifyou yourself are an officer in charge of a platoon of men on a map - reading exercise, youmay be embarrassed to admit your ignorance in front of your men. There are then a`variety of circumstances which would reduce or eliminate the probability-that you ask aquettion of another person, but if you do decide to, who do yoU ask? -In this chapter interest is focused upon eight types of receiver of questions forfive categories aquestion and six Categories of esker. For onetype of receiver, the teacher,an analysis is made of attributes relevant to being selected as a question-victim. Additionallyand briefly,,the relevence of having a suitable time and place to ask it considered. This,nvestigatiOn, relying as it does on verbal reports, has the advantages and disadvantagesinherent in this method. While we night expect replies to be reliable in that the subjectsid be likely to give very similar answers if asked again; we could'have doubts aboutthe validity of their answers. How do we know they bear any direct correspondence tothe natural behaviour. of the pupils? Ideally we would have liked to supplement thisinvestigation with detailed observation of the children's behaviour, but, both technicallyand adminiStratively, this would have been a difficult and costly operation. It WoUld,havemeant, for example, the research worker following a small sample of children around in theclassroom, the playground, the home and elsewhOre, noting what they asked of whothand perhapi vainly hoping that his presence was not influencing behaviour. Some partialobservational support would hive been welcomed, but we thought it better to rely on othercriteria. Thelirst was the nature of the school. Suffice it to mention two points. Ourresearch was accepted enthusiastically and cooperatively by both pupils and staff, so thatwe can have some faith in thegeneralisation of this goodwill. Secondly, a number ofteachers-had instituted questioning sessions during which pupils asked what they liked ofvarious staff members; hence the idea of asking teachers questions was .not wholly alienthe participants. More direct evidence comes after the fact. That the results made sensand a reasonable interpretation could be offered, is additional evidence-for the validithe replies; . ...The study reported is only one instance of maro combinations-of variablesiA'y ir might be examined. From a practical point of view one would like to know whether thereare variations-in school structure associated with variations in perceived availability,approachability and expertise of teachers? Is there any systematic difference with the ageof- children both in the extent to which they are encouraged to ask questions and the extentto which they wish to Bernstein (1972) has found that the chile who asks many cppestions(of an unspecified nature)-is differently by teachers at age fiye and seven and. middleand working class schools.At time 1, (age five) in the WC area, child-initiated communication (explanation andquestioning) was seen by teachers as being-independent of co-operativeness and attentivrness;both-of these being features of an 'appropriate' relationship to the teacher. This may bebecause, for the WC child, this is something he has:to learn. However, the MC child has beensocialised into the'appropriate' social relationship in his family and, therefore, at time 1, thequartet of explanation, questioning, co- operativeness, and attentiveness, are all highly \"inter-correlated. In thWC area, by time 2 (age seven), it was found that the quartet was moreosely related, so that the child-initiated activities (explanation and questioning) and'appropriate social relationships were by then linked. In other words, during the WC child'stwo years in the Infant School, he is being socialised into an appropriate relationship to theteacher. The latter involves the WC child, relative to the MC child, coming to do what theteacher wants; learning the conductthat the teacher eXpects. 'Child-initiated cognitions aremediated through a social relationship in which the teacher's values and attitudes aredominant` (Bernitein, 1972 p. 33).Obviously we would like to know more about the teachers' understanding of whatwas meant by 'a child who asks a lot of questions'. The child whokeeps asking task-relevantquestions may; ell be viewed, rather differently from one who keeps asking about theteacher's clothes or pets:How age and personality of child relate to the type and frequencyof qUestions asked of.others, particularly teachers,, is again a more general question beyond,our present possibilities. However, while it is with some regretthat we can offer nosystematically collected data of real questions asked of real teachers by real children, wewere able to append a supplement to chapter 4 comprising on analysis of a number ofquestions collected during the questioning sessions mentioned earlier.,8.1 The Problem 'of Who to Ask It is generally believed that many children in secondary schools show little interest in andask, but fewquestions about their school-time activities. 'Too many appear to be bored andapathetic in school' (Newtom Report, para. 47). It may be argued that, with respeCt.to;questioning behaviour, there are two, separate problems here: a problem of stimulation,how to increase curiosity among children who arinot curious, and a problem of elicitation,how to provide conditions that will encourage children to ask questions they already have.It is with this second problem of elicitation that this investigation is concerned. We areconcerned only with_asking other people questions and not with other means of findingout answers and we look at.three factors likely ,to be of importance. These are, firstly, therelative expertise of the person who may be asked, secondly, certain psychologicalattribute's of this person, and lastly, the situation in which the question maybe asked.Firstly, the would-be question-asker must find another person whom he perceives,' as having an interest in the topic with which he is concerned; and a greater amount ofi knowledge on this topic than he hialself has. Such a person may be called an 'expert'./ Thereare reasons, other than his knowledge of thequestion-tOpic, which wilrcause a r person to be seen as an 'expert'. For example, Aronson and Golden (1962)'found thatirrelevant aspeetscifa communication may affect the likelihood of that message beingaccepted, e.g. a white Caucasian source message was seen as more credible than a Negrosource message even when the communication concerned topics to which race-membershipwas irrelevant. Teachers may,- for example, merely by virtue of their status as teachers, beperceived by children as being experts'upon a whole variety of topics about which in factthey are no more or less likely to have knowledge than anyone elSe..SeCondly, having found someone. Whom he views as an expel, the would-be.questioner has the problem of whether or not this person is 'psychologically approachable'.It is assumed, for example, that a questioner is more likely to ask an expert who-is afriend than to ask one who is'arl enemy. It is probable that a person is mdre likely: to beseen as being apProachable if in the past there has been a greater opportunity of interactionand if this interaction has previously been rewarding for the questioner. It is also probablethat this factor of approachability will become more Salient to the questioner as the topicabout which thequestion is to be asked becomes more\\ ego-involving or emWrassing tothe questioner. Presumably, however, this 'approachabr'. factor could become increas- \u00b0ingly less important as the questioner's need to know the answN- increases.Finally, when an approachable expert has been selected, the potential question-asker must still consider whether or not the time and place are appropriate for asking.--There aredifferent horms associated With different interaction situations which relateto whether or not questions may be asked. Tao take an extreme example, in most interviewsthe flow of questions goeS only one way; and only-if-the-interviewer specifically-asks himdoes the interviewee ask questions. However, in a conversatioi between two friends nosuch constraints are apparent.Such ideas about the expertness and approachability of the other person, and theappropriateness of the situation; are perhaps obvious and general. However, we have nohard evidence on the subject and cannot make any supported statements, otdetail aboutwho asIs whom, what, when, and where. This investigation opens up this field of inqufry..Children were given a series of queStionS and asked to imagine that they wanted to knowthe answers to them. They were then asked to whom they could and would go in orderto find out-the. answers. While such a procedure is artificial, the greater amount of databought at this cost may be worthwhile. The children were also asked whether theypreferred to ask questions of teachers and parents when atone or not Teachers were.asked to fill in questionnaires so that we might find out what teacher characteristicsmight be related to the children's choices. 8.2 MethodSubjects: The Children.Fifty three girls and sixty six boys from a dreamed comprehensiveschool took part. High and low IQ were created by dividing each age group at the meanon MOray. House Verbal Reasoning scores. The mean score of the twelvc year olds was86.7, of the fourteen year olds 94.7.

The school from which the children's sample was drawn hadforty nine teachers. All teachers in the school were sent a questionnaire with a coveringletter whicli stated the purpose of the investigation and asked for cooperation. Twentyseven teachers returned the questionnaire (fourteen male, thirteen feMale).The School. The school from which these samples were drawn was a county secondary.school in the south of England. The mainly rural area contained one smallish town whichWas supported by a large militaryestablishment. The mean Moray House Verbal Reasoningscores reported above may seem to be low, but were in fact typical of-the whole school.There was in this school already in existence a system whereby pupils handed theirwritten questions about any topic to teachers. Consequently, it is argued-that childrenin this school would not see it as odd to be asked which teachers they would go to inorder to have their questions answered; although this would not be the case in sme otherschools.Materials:The Children's Questionnaire. The children were presented with a list of twenty onequestions and asked to. imagine that they wanted. each of them answered and then toindicate to whom, they could and would go for an answer. There were five types'ofquestion-content with four examples of each The additional question was one usedduring the instruction procedure in order to show the subjects'how to fill out thequestionnaire, There are many ways in which quettiOns may be categorised by aninvestigator to give him 'type of question' categories. The of questionschosen here reflects our expectation that a questioner's choice of an answerer willdepend in part upon the content of the question. The five types of questions were1.Questions asking for information about the physical world.2.Questions asking for explanations of phenomena in the physical world.3.Questions asking for information aboUt the. social world.4.Questions asking for 'empirical' explanations of the social world.5.Questioni asking for 'moral' explanations of the social world.These.five types of questions are self-explanatory except perhaps for the fourthand fifth Categories, 'Empirical' questionsabobt the social world.are qUestions thatare asking for explanations of the processes and laws that govern human behaviour,e.,q. 'Why do people hit other people ?'; no value judgements are required to answer these.'Moral' questions about.the social world are questions concerning.ethics and valuejudgements, and appealing to moral codes, e.g. 'Why is it.wrong to hit people you do notlike ?'. The reason Jar including questions-asking fOr both information and explanation. was that it wasanticipated that answers to questions asking\" or explanations might bemore complex and longer, and therefore more difficultto understand that answers givenIto inforrhation questions. For this reason, the factor of approachability might be more /salient since the answerer might have to repeat orreforinulate his answers, and expertness/might be imPortant in that fewer people may be capable of giving satisfactory explanations. 1.302 D1 InThe actual instances of the five types of.qiiestion that were used in this, invest-.igation may be foUnd in Appendix-1. The questions were draWn up in consultation withthree foUrteen year old girls who agreed that the questions finally. decided upon werein fact quettiOns that children of their age might often want to ask.The Order in which the twenty questions were presented to the subjects. wasrandotn, but the same for all subjects (this Order may be found in Appendix 1): Questionswere presented singly .to the subjects. Below each qeustionwas a list of role-titles(unfamiliar peer, friendly peer, any. adirlt, mother, father, any teacher,: particularteacher, somebody else). Th'e subjects were required to indicate whether they thoughteach person would know the answer to the question, whether each would be chosen bythe subjects for answering the question, and which of therdwould be the first choice.Subjects were required to fill in the: name ofa partidular teacher for each question,whereas the specification in 'somebody else'. category was at their diScretion. FollOwing.this, the subjects were asked whether they would prefer to ask This.question of the choienteacherin classtime with others present or in breaktime alone.

This question-mire attempted to assess some of the teacher's attitudes towards teaching, educationand ciaisrooth control, and also included a: personality assessment and some personaldetails; e.g. age, sex, number of years teaching etc.:Thefull set questionnaires maybe found in Appendix 3. Details for scoring them are also in Appendix.4. The variousscales used within each questionnaire are briefly described below.16.1.Opinionaire on Attitudes towards Education (see Q.1; Appendix-3).. This fortyfive item scale was devised by Lindgren and Patton (1958). Five items-in the originalscale-were omitted, viz. items 1, 8, 11, 17 and 30. The word 'pupil' was substituted for,'student' because it is the more usual term of reference for children of this age inEngland. The scale measures attitudes towards childrcentrad policies and practices\"'education. The statements are concerned with the desirability of theleachers-usirgauthoritarian methods as a means of controlling the behdviour of students, and thedesirability of thesubject-matter-centredness as -contrasted with learrter-or-child-centred-ness.' (Shaw and score indicates more favourable attitudestowards child-centred policies. 02.Social Intimacy Scale for Teachers (see Q.2, Appendix 3). This sdale was devisedspecifically for this investigation. The scale consists of thirteen contrastive pairrof 303 statements concerning social behaviour towards and expected tram. pupils. An exampleof one-such pair of statements is:Item 1.I address both boys and girls by their Christian names.Item '14.I expectpupils to address me by my Christian name outside school.Teachers were asked to indicate the extent of their agreament with such state-ment-. The scale purports to measure three variables. These are: (fA) the extent towhich the teacher moves towards social intimacy with the pupils, (18) the extent towhich the teacher lets the pupil move towards him and (1C) the degree of.reciprocitybetween hoW he behaves towards the pupils and how he expects them to behave towardshim.Can 3.The Eysenck Personality Inventory. This scale, devised by Eysenck and Eysenck(1964), purports to measure neuroticism and extraversion/introversion. 4.The Educational Guessing Game Scales (see 0.4, Appendix 3). This scale was devisedspecifically for this investigation by Robinson. It consiits.of twenty six statements taken- .from the writing of various prominent educationalists of the past. Teachers were asked toindicate their agreenient or otherwise with these statements. While doing this task, theywere not aware of the authorship of the statement. At the end of the task, they couldopen.an envelope -which contained the'author key.The answers of the first eighteen teachers to return the completed questionnairewere used. to construct a correlation matrix (see Appendix 5) from which clusters ofitems could be extracted. The items formed two main groups. the firtt could be called a'Free development potential scale' (F.D.P.S.). It contained ten items and a high score onthis scale could be said to be characterited by the following.set of beliefs: 'the child hasa natural capacity, for curiosity and for spontanecius moral development which is broughtout (Or should be) by a free (non-restrictive, non-punitive) and affectionate environmentand love. Early experierice of love is seen as especially important for the young child'.The second duster, the 'Training Scale' (T.S;), contained eight items and a high score onthis scale could be said to indicate the fofloWing set of beliefs: 'the child becomes toowild (and children are amenable to discipline and punishment); the child needs to betold what it is necessary for him to know in a formal manner; competenCe is'largelypredetermined (inherited).' .Procedure:Instructions for the Appendix 2) . Nfrom the children's questionnaire was written on blackboard of the classroom sothat the procedure could be explained to the children. The Experimenter (E) in fact'went through the filling out of this first questioh with the children\u00b0. The questiOh usedfor thepurpose was:A'Which in June ?'.. -This quettiwas.used only for procedural purposes and was not scored in the lateranalysis. The inructions were as follows:-'Listen verarefully because what we have to do is a bit complicated. We wantto know whou like to get to answer your questions. On the paper in front ofyou there:are tweone questions. After each question there is aliit of p; oglewho you might ask.show you an example on the board so yoU can see what .you have to do with eacof the questions. Here, at the top of the board, I'vewritten the first question the 'yob:have on yoursheet. 'Which countY in England has the highesttemperature in-June?' Underneath, we have 8 different people ...(here E: reads through the format of the first questiOn as' shown ir. Appendix 2).Then you corrie to question 2, and you get exactly the same layout for thisquestion. All right, so that's what it's like. Let's go back to the beginning to seewhat you have to do. The first question then is 'Which county in England has thehighest temperature in JUner Now I want you to imagine you want to find out theanswer to this question: Even if you knoW the answer already,.I want you topretend you don't know it and imagine you want to find the answer out. First of '-all.I want you to think of all the teachers in the school. Which one would youmost like to ask this question? Right then, all of you think which teacher you'dmost like'to ask this question, if you really wanted to know the answer. Thenwrite that teacher's name in (g) like this (E. writes a name2in the appropriateplace on the board). Put any teacher's name you like as long as theyare at thisschool. Now you've done that, I want you to think which of all these people willknow the answer:to 'Which county in England has the highest temperature in,Juner (E's fingers run down the board indicating the people) except this one(points to 'somebody else'). I'll do it now for myself. Well, I don't think (a)would know, so I put an X here.(E. points to the appropriate box and makes themark), I do think (b) knows, so I put a-tick here. (E. goes through all the names).Of course, you might well want to answer differently, becaise these people arenot the same for you as they are for me. Right now, you all do that for yourselves.O.K.! Now, have you all done that? Good. Now, some of the people who youthink knoW the answer, you would go and ask some maybe you wouldn't wantto ask. In the column, marked 'would choose' tick all thOse who you would ask,,like this, and OUt crosses for the ones yOu Wouldn't ask. (E. &es this on theboard for himself). Right, now you do that for yourselves still leaving the 'some-body else' blank. (Subjects do this). Now, from the ones you've chosen, I wantyou to tick the one who would be your firSt choice like this if it were. me. Ifthere is somebody else who isn't on' the list, but who would be Your first choice;then write their name here and who they are and put a tick here (E,points to'somebody else' box). for example, if you have an uncle who is a weatherman,you might want to ask him as your first choice, so write in 'uncle' and put'weatherman' like this, and then put a tick in the 'somebody else' box. Butotherwise if your first choice is one of thesepeople, just put a tick and leave .'somebody else'. All.right, now-all tick your first choice. O.K.? Good. Now; allyou have to do is answer these two questions here like this (E. reads the questionsaloud and answers them on the board). You have to answer these two, after allthe questions. Now all do it for thit question. (E. now briefly recapitulates thewhole procedure and writes a summary of the major steps in the procedure onthe board.) Before you start are there any questions? Is there anything you don'tunderstand? You can write in any names you like beCause I shall be the,onlyperson to see them, none of your teachers ill be looking at them.Don't forgetyou can choose the same teacher for lots of the questions if yOu like, or differentones, just choose the one you.want for each question. All right, now start. Ifyou have any problems put up your hands.'Children took fifteen to twenty five minutes to tOmplete the questionnaire.Procedure:Instructions for the teachers, A covering letter was sent out with the .-questionnaire..

B.Analysis of Teachers' QuestionnairesThe scores taken from the teachers' questionnalre'Were correlated in a 15 x 15matrix (Table 6). This matrix was further analysed by the technique of principal compon-ents. The score included in the correlation matrix were as follows:OP INScore on 'Opinionaire on Attitudes towards Education'; a indicatesmore child-centred attitudes.LIELie score from Eysenck Personality inventory; a higher indicates greateramount of score indicatesgreater extraversion.FREEFree development potential scale; a higher score indicates a greater belief innatural growth.TRAINTraining scale; a higher score-indicates a greater belief in the desirability ofsocialising.

C.Choices of Particular Teachers1.Choices of Teachers bythe Eight different Subiect Groups. The namberof choicesmade by each of the eight subject groups for each of the twenty seven teachers wereused to' provide an 8 x-8 correlation matrix (Table 8.7a). This matrix was furtheranalysed by a principal components analysis. The principal components.analysis showeda very clear picture (Table 8.7b1.Component 1Obviously, a general component, i.e. teachers chosen by one groupof subjects tend to be chosen by all groupsComponent 2A bipolar component, indicating that the group of teachers whotended to be chosen by twelve year olds is not wholly the same asthat chosen by fourteen year, oldsComponent 3A component primarily associated with the twelve year olds,indicating that slightly different groups of teachers were chosen byLow and High IQ groupi.3i5 Table 8.7a Correlation Matrix of Teacher Choice Consistency all Children for the five Types of Questions.Each teacher received a certain number of choices from the children to answer each of thefive types of question& Thtis each teacher may be given a Score for each of the five typesof question.

'.8.4 Discussion--The purpose of this investigation waslo attempt to specify some of the conditions thatmight affect the elicitation of questions; especially the characteristics of the other personwho might be chosen to answer a question. With the results obtained, this question may(318 be discuised from two points of view. Firstly, are there specific and identifiablecharacteristics that separate those teachers chosen from those not chosen? Secondly,are the different. groups of children (age, sex, IQ) making different choices as to whichpeople they think would know the answers to the questions, which people they wouldbe prepared to choose, and which people they prefer as first choice& .The data reported earlier, in.sectiOn C of the results, clearly indicate that someteachers are consistently chosen to answer the children's questions whilst others are notFurthermore, these results indicate that twelve and fourteen year old childrenare choos-ing different groups of teachers; twelve year old High IQ Children are choosing differentlyfrom twelve year old LoW IQ children; and at a second order level teachers chosen toanswer 'physical' questions are riot the same ones as are those chosen to answer 'social'question&It can be said therefore that while children are making similar and consistent,choices, differences in choice that do occur are associated with the differcnt groups ofchildren and different types of question; iii other wortls the children are not randomlychoosing different teaChers for different questions. One may therefore assume thatsub-groups of children do share common criteria and that the criteria are not identicalfor the twelve and fourteen year olds, nor for the High and Low I0 twelve year.oldgroUps, nor for 'sOciaras opposed to 'physical' questions. Therefore either there arecertain charanteristics common to:chosen teachers and absent among teachers not'chosen, or perhaps certain characteristics are common to those not chosen and absent', 7among those who are chosen. This is probably true whether-ornot-We-ara-able-rib---identify any such characteristics. .Although this conclusion will surprise nobody, it does for this very reasonimply that the procedure used in this investigation has probably elicited from thechildren responses that will correspond to the choiCes that they would at least like tomake in the everyday life, and perhaps, also, correspond to the choices they.in fact domake. The question may now beposed as to whether any of the measures that weretaken from the teaChers in this investigation are related to these different and consistentchoices of the children.Thesintercorrelations of the fifteen, measures froth the teachers' questionnaire:.weresubjected\\to a principal component analysis whose results implied the existenceof three clusters of iterhs:,an 'experience' cluster of age, number of own children,number of years toking and training; cluster of the extraversion/ '1introversion and neuro icism scales which, although not correlating highly with eachother, were separate frothe other variables; and an 'attitudes towards eciucation'-cluster of Opinionaire scale, ree Development Belief Scale,,and SOcial Intimaby SCale:On the basis of thiiprincipal inponentcanalysis suggest that measures of\\experience, perionality and educ tional attitudes have been obtained. The labels ofd'experience', 'personality' and 'educional attitudes' I should be viewed as 'referentialtags' rather than as linterpreta/ive concepts'. Additionally; it should be remembered',that the teachers' questionnaires which \\gilded these measures contained only two testedand established scales (ie. the Eysenck Personality Inventory and theOpinionaire \\Scale) and this second one has not been usecrnuch: The remaining scales were intuitkieand unstandardised: With reservations, ituld still seem that the teachers' ,questionnaires provide a selection of.variables tha \\one would. imagine may be relatedto whether or not a teacher might be chosen by'a p6pil`for the pUrposes of question- asking. Can such measures taken from the teachers be used to predict which teachers are /Chosen?The {-egression analysis reported in section D of the resultS showed that severalOf the measures taken from the teachers' questionnairegave bettee than chancepredict-fions of the number of choices a teacher' received from the various groups ofchildren.For fourteen year olds, the teachers' opinionaire score was a better than chanCe predictorfor all groulipa except the fourteen' year old Low IQ,girls, but was only weakly so,for thetwelve year old's choices. It is interesting to note the results reported in section C: theseshow a cciiirelation analysis of the number of choices received by each teacher forRachof the eight subject groups. It maybe seen that a principal components analysis producesthree components that account for ninety per cent of the total variance. The firstcomponent is general, the second component differentiates mainly, betWeen the tWelveand fourteen year olds, whereas the third component concerns primarily only the twelveyear oldsarld differentiatesamongthem'on the basis of la However, although three, ofthe fourteen yaer old groups load negligibly on thit third component, the Low IQfourteen year old girls load irva similar fashion to High IQ twelve year olds; thus suggest::ing that the9 are a deviant group. ,If We examine the Opinionaire's success for different types of questions, it doesso for both information and explanation typei of 'physical' question's, but not for 'social'___questions.From-section-A-resulti, wethat, althOugliiiiildren would choose teachersrather than parents for all types of question,they::make particular teachers first choicesmore often for i'Physical! than for 'social' questions. Hence, it could be suggested thatit' is for the 'physical' qaustions that teachers are seen as most useful and for answeringthese, the Opinionaire socre is a significant indicatOr of Which teachers are preferred:the only othervariable-Peediatih9 teac6.,er:_choice was sex._ For :social' qUestionsboys preferred male and girls preferred feMale.teachers.With the failure of other indices to have predictive value, it is sensible to seehow far sheer expoiure to diffe.fentteachers is relevant to choices made. Zajonc (1970)has amassed a sizeable body of date to Show that familiarity alone positively associatedWith people's.preferences,.other. things being equal.. The groupsof children haveexperienced different teacher's for their formal teaching, and even within the groups, thereare certain teachers who have taken the children often and others whohave seen theft)only infrequently. The correlation between the number of hoiirs teachers had takenfourteen year olds and the'nUmber of choices received`from fourteen year olds wasnegligible (r = 0 04, t = 0.21,-df 25)..Hence, the hypothesis that fourteen year olds werechoosing teachers who teach them most often can be rejeCted. A siinilie correlation fortwelve year olds' choices and number of hours spent teaching them was higher, (r = 0.37,t = 1:98,'df 25, p<.10). The hypothesis that twelve year oldi.were.chooting on the basisof exposure has some weak support The fact that there was a measure of correlationbetween 'number of hours and.number of choices for twelve year olds but not forfourteen, year olds is not surprising. All the children entered this school at theage ofeleven.. At the time of this investigation the twelve year oftia were nearing the end ofwhat was their first academic year at the This means that, by and large, they hadexperienced on's/ one group of teadheis since they entered. This would not be the'casefor fourteen year olds;they would have been taught by one group of teachers in thefiear, a second group (even if overlapping with the first group) in their second year,'and weraring the end O a year With their third group. The fourteen year olds therefore would have ad the op,.oeunity of knowing more teachers than the twelve year olds .,,and would also know a number of teachers who were not teaching them at the time of .the investigation: .As a check that the relationship between Opinionaire scores and 'teachers chosen'among the fourteen year olds was not an art #act of any variation in exposure, thecorrelation between these two rntasures wasTe-calculated forthoSe teachers who were.currently teaching that age group formore than one lesson aweek: Ttie correlationremained significant. (r = 0.58, t = 2:99, df 18, p <.01). .At the beginning of this discussion two questions were posed; it is now possibleto give a tentative answer to the first of these (i.e. are there specific identifiable character-istiCs separating the teachers in thit study who were chosen from those not chosen)bypupils to answerquestions. There is evidence to show that a high score on the Opinion-oaire scale is A good predictor of a large number of choices from fourteen year Olds toanswertheirquestions (with the exception of fourteen year old C,ow IQ girls). There. is ,also evidence tO,suggeitthat this same OpiniOnairescore predicts choices from allchildrenquestions Ahigh towards child centred educational,polici& and control as opposed to subject-niattercentred policiei and authoritarianmethods of control. It Should alsd be remembered however that,..while the Opinionairescale appears to be a good_predictor,,experience as measuredrpersonality- as-measurede2.-and:the various other measures of educational attitudes did not predictchoices ofteachers. .One explanation of the fact that Opinionaire score was a good predictor for thefourteen year old choices but not for twelve year oldchoices-has. been given, viz. thattwelve year olds have a limited group.of teachers from whom they can choose, whereas. ,fourteen year olds may choose from:a much wider group of teachers; and that thereforetheir choices are more I ikelyto reflect what they want an answerer to be like: .s.Another explanation might be that between the ages of.twelve and fourteenthe children learn to make different sorts of choices with regard to the answerers theymight choose. Both of these explanations may be correct. -However, these consictera-Lions lead 'us directly to the seconcrqUestioff posed at the beginning of this discussion,viz. are -the different groups of children' (age, sex, IQ) making different types of Choices-as regards.who they think know. the answers to the question6 who would they be pre-.pared to.chodse, and who would he their first choice? The data preiented in section.Aof the results have direct bearing upon this problem. Before discussing these data aninterpretation that we may labeftWe'exposure-differentiation'.hvpothesi\u00a7of choice ofanSwereris presented, .If we imagine a questioning childwho knOwsnothindabout his,potentialanswerers other than that they are available to him, he may, ask questions randomly.However, some people will be more:frequently .available than otherg; so that we Migi:itexpect the child simply .to ask questions.on this batis. However,.As he asks more .questiOns, which may or may not be answered, and as he develops greater skill in differ-entiating'between, satisfactory and. unsatisfactory answers, we Mita expect him tobegin to differentiate betweenansWerers. should.come to see, sortie pedple as more. -exPert,.than others; some as more approachable than others, and he may begin to learnthat these attributes will depend upon the type of question to be AnSwered.Hence,while availability and total exposure shOuld have A relevance, there should alsobeincreasing differentiation within the set of potential answers arid.ive might expect. thisto increasewith intellectual development and with the number of persons known. (Of . course, the differential.preferences may be related to reasons other than those mentionedhere).If the age and ability rangeS in this investigation are sufficient, and the hypothesisvalid, we can expect that older and more able children should_show more differentiation,in their choice of answerers thakyounger and less able Children whose choiiei.shOUld-be-----mainly 'a function of amount of contact. A.The results reported in section A showed that Children believe that 'particular.teachers', fathers and mothers would be most likely to know the answers to thesequeStions; these same answerers are most often indicated as being the children's firstchoices. Of these three types of people, 'particular teachers' are chosen more often thanthe other two. it niust9 remembered however that for an individual child the 'particularteacher' chosen may be a different person for the different questions, whereas 'mothers' .and 'fathers' are for the individual child always the same pefson,There are differences apparent between these three types of answerers with orespect to the different types of questions.: Children view potential answerers as morelikely to know the answers to 'explanation' questions (as opposed to 'information'questions). Ohe may assume that the children therefore see these as easier questions. Thisis true of both 'mother' and lather'. However, iparticulai appear to be seen asmore likely to know the answers to physical,qUestions,thah social quettionS and arealso mcirelikelylo be chosen to answer physical than social questions.tiGiven this background which dominates the chqices made by the children, are theredifferences between the various subject groups which suppcirt the above differentiationargumentsConsidering the data concerning who would khow the answer's to these questions,it can be seen that Law IQ children think that a greater number of people would knowthe answers than do High IQ children.- In other words High IQ children are limitingthemselves, to fewer people who would know the answers. This is seen tbe true of alltypes of questions, except 'social moral' qtesticins. High til)roupssee a greater rangeof people as being likely to know theanswers to 'social more questions than do LowIQ groups.. However, 'social moral' questions are the only type Of, questions (of the fivetypes used in this study) that cannot ever have true or false answers. These questions are(unlike the other types).askirig for opinions rather than knowledge: The High IQ groups,it Seems, are more likely, to realise this and apPreciate that anyone may have an opinion.Thus, High IQ groups are more restricted ir, their beliefs as to who would know answers---ta4atner_questions and lesi restriate4r 'opinion' queitions. It is argued that the viewHigh IQ children-ire more discriminating than Low Icichildrenin their selection of arisv4rers:The readers should be reMinded at this point of the fact that the socalled 'HighIQ' group in-this study h'avie a mean 10 that is below the national average; The objectionmight be made that such an 10 group at this ageis unlikely to appreciate the ratherphilosophical point that. while 'factual' answers may have differing relative: validity,answers to 'opinion' questiOni may be equally valid. However, the argument above Shouldbe interpreted in this way. What is beihg said here is that thdan-swers-tb-the 'social moral'questions that the children r!4ceive may be.found by them to be equally useful or useless,regardleSS of who is answering (assuming the answerer is co-opetative)..lt is suggested \"---thafrelative to the lower IQ group, the higher group may learn this more.quiz.kly.However, still considering the 'who would know' data, there is fOund a sex cdifference that would not be.exp3cted from the 'expb'sure-differentiation' hypothesis, ,ix. girls bremore likely, than boys to think that others will know thesnSwers 'to thequestions.

Questions abound inside the school as well as outside. Teachers askquestions, textbooks ask questions, examinations ask questie.ms, even children ask questions.The schoolday is heavily sprinkled with questiorA asked for different reasons and todifferent ends. Here we are not concerned with why questions are asked, but whether ornot their occurrence affects learning. Are more likely to acquire knowledge if gaps inthat knowledge have been formulated as questions? Naive expectation would be that if aquestion has been asked and answered, the answer is more likely to be remembered thanif the antecedent question had not been posed, bUt is this in fad the case? Does, a pupil'learn more if the knOwledge which becomes available to him has done so as a result of himasking questions? Is a pupil more likely`to learn and remember something if the teacherhas posed the problem as a question or indicated hat questions about it will be ked :subsequently? Are teachers' questions more or les'l efficacious than the pupil's o n questionsas a prelude to learning; that is, can receptive learning be as efficient as discover or guideddiscovery kerning? The following chapter reviews the literature and reports som investiga-tions around three topics, while setting them in a Wider framework.It should be made clear from the outset that the focus of attention is upoquestioning.as an independent rather than a dependent or mediating variable. The e isno concern with what conditions give rise to more or fewer questions of particular types.There is no concern with how they might be an overt consequence of curiosity, -an hencea stimulus to learning. What are perhaps the natural concomitants of questions asked bypeople who do not know the answers haVe been treated as confounding complicationsand stripped away.Given-this pared-down problem of the qUestion as question in relation to learning,--we could adopt a crassly empirical approach. Confining our frame of reference to-thatknoWledge which can be represented verbally rather than ikonically or enactively, andassuming that it is desirable or necessary for pupils to acquire some such body of verballyrepresented knowledge, then hive questions a role to play in facilitating its acquisition?If they have, how can they be hest exploited? What is the optimal number of questionsto use fOr certain lengths of text? Should the questions be open-ended or closed? Whatlinguistic form Shduld they take and-of What type should they be? Where should they belocated in any text? At the beginning or the end? Or perhaps distributed in the text? Whosequestions promote most learning, those of teacher or the learner? These are some of theprobleMs that arise, but of course notAll. Neither are issues as simple as.this: 7The answers to the above questions may well be contingent upon the nature andstate of the learner, the nature and am \\ unt of material to be learned. Younger childrenMay differ from older children, boys fro girls, the interested from the uninterested, theclever from the not so clever. Narrative aterials4nay require different strategies fromdescriptive or explanatory ones. \\\\How all this hangs together presents\\a fo array: \"too daunting for con-sideration? Not if one is patient Too trivial to m rit investigation? Only the necessary saryinvestigations can answer that question. Irrelevant to the classroom? Hardly so, in view ofthe vast numbers of questions asked every. day. All teachers have attitudes about the valueof questions asked by themselves and by pupils. TheSe may be implicitOnly but the use ateacher actually makes of questions represents a decisiOn, albeitoMplex one,-about their 1.341345 significance. This type of Point is not alwayi obvious at first sight, but a little considera-tion makes one realise that to ask a question is a decision not to do something else, sothat implicitly at least one is making a value judgement that this is the best thing to do.In the face of this devious, but nevertheless valid, argument, we are forced to questionthe value of the question, in spite of the complications mentioned above.Fortunately we do not have to proieed along the Crassly empirical,railway lineslaid down above. We can see certain ways in which questions might relate to learningand we can mzke a number' of distinctions which may prove useful. This Chaptercontrasts the backwardsend forwards effects of questions. Any backwards effect would,operate, for example, when pupilsreading or listening to material know they will beasked questions about it subsequently. Although this knowledge is unlikely to increasetheir curiosity (except about the particular questions?), it may well introduce otherincentives reflected in increased motivation to do well. Such sourcescoold be many, fromwishes to please the teacher or parents through to snubbing one's peers or siblings orwishes to avoid punishment It should also be noted that incentives can just as readilyincrease motivation to do badly or decrease motivation to do well, but for 'the momentWe may assume the world to be cooperative and enthusiastic. While he might wish to dowell for its own 'sake, the incentives referred to above are all extrinsic to the indiyidual. Ifthis is so, we might expect pest -study questions generally to affect peitormance byincreasing motivation to do well for reasons extrinsic to the task. This motivation willhave two characteristics, one energising, the Other directing. The energising component.indicates the extra effort to be applied, the directive one to the fact that attention willtie focused on relevant activities and distractibility reduced.. Within limits, increases inmotivation lead to increases in learning even if this :s in ways not altogether clear. Con-centration on the task in hand is one feature, perhaps increased rate and frequency ofrehearsal of material is another. Post-task questions could have otherconsequences:increased tendencies to be selective in learning with gambling on likely questions,increased anxiety about the subsequent test resulting in distraction eta.Questions supplied in advance, but which are answered in the succeeding material,are also candidates for motivation arousers. By making explicit the gaps in one's knowledgewith an entailing promise to fill them shortly, they should give rise to curiosity: These'specific items may arouse a generalised curiosity which should lead to increased pro-bability of learning the materials. However, it is possible that the effects'could be specific,arousing curiosity only for the qUestions actually pre - posed,. thereby decreasing thechances of learning other knowledge in the materials. This source of motivation is usuallyconceived of as being intrinsic to the materials.While c:uestions posed both before and after material to be learned have a potentialsimilarity as motivating stimuli, this similarity does depend upon the learners having fore-knowledge of any posi-material questioning. Should they not be given this nor suspect it,then post-questioning can simply be a rneans of testing what has been learned. If, however,teachers are using questions as aids to learning rather than as a means of testing, the effectof their occurrence may depend upon whether they are located before materials or after-Wards but with prior notice that they will be asking them.In either case the questions.are prOvided by the teacher rather than constructed bythe learner. In the case of post-questions they are inevitably provided questions in appear-ance and in reality. With pre-questions this is not necessarily so. Superficially, the questionsare provided by the teacher, but if they are adopted by the learner as his own, thenalthough not actually constructed by him they have in some Measure become his. Presumably 346 1.40ateachers often hope that the questions they raise when they introduce a topic will be sotaken over and integrated into the learner's thinking. However, reamers can create theirown questions. If they are provided with or already have some knowledge about a topic;they can be asked to formulate their own questions: These 'own' questions, as they arecalled here, could be thcught up after material has been presented; how this would affectlearning is difficult to see but it could be investigated. More commonly 'own' questionsare posed before the materials.One might expect, other things being equal (which they of course seldom are),that learners who have devised their own questions should be more highly motivated thanthose who have had them provided by the teacher. Such a premise; would appear to be atthe heart of the enthusiasm for the virtues of discovery learner. But is this so? The learner'sown questions facilitate learning more than questions provided for him. This contrast is .the main focus of thework to be presented.Questions themselves are contrasted with other possible ways of facilitating .learning. With what consequences? The icAlowing material should answer! 9.1 Literature Review In order to focus attention upon the role of questions in learning it will be necessary toignore a\"wide range of questioning behaviouri. Questions may be used to serve a variety ofpurposes, such as to test authority, register a protest, evoke embarrassment, preventuncomfortable silences,express an attitude, make a request or simply as a rhetorical /device. Although these actions will have relevance for the teaching situation (sometimestoo much?), it will be in their capacity as 'a means of obtaining inforination that the'special role of questions in relation to learning will be construed.A distinction may be made between those questions that are asked by pUpils andthose that are provided by teachers for the pupils. This raises the problem of whether ornot these two can be distinguished in any important way. In practice, of course, theycan be. In the classroom it is not difficult behaviourally to determine whether the teacherasks the question, or whether the pupil asks the question. The difficulty arises when thenature of the question is considered in this context The teacher may ask a question, orincorpOrate it into a learning programme, in the hope that the pUpil may make the -question his own, or in order that the pupil may rehearse an item of information in someway. Whether questions used in this manner affect the curiosity or some other motivationfor learning of pupils, and whether in turn this leads to a more effectiVe grasp of informa-tion, may be difficult to establish. Teachers have tended to assume that the questionsthey direct at their pA,Pils facilitate learning, although doubt has been cast upon theeffectiveness of this pibcedure. In one study (Hoetker, 1968) tape recordings weremadeof several junior high school English classes over fiVe days. The tapes were transcribed, andit was found that the mean rate& teacher questioning was 1.68 questions per minuteoverall, with 3.22 questions per minute during periods of all teacher-pUpil talk and 6.17questions per minute of subject matter related talk. Non-theoretical questions came at afaster rate than others and the higher the rate the lower the proportion of Correct answers.This does not mean that other benefits did not result from the question-aniwer exchanges,nor that the teachers:were as skilled as they might have been in framing suitable questions.As Kay, Dodd and Sime (1968) pointed out, beginners with prOgrammed instruction areliable to write short statement-question fraMes of the form, 'Mary had a little lambWhat did Mary have?' These 'Mary fraMes' are not calculated to' ma4 much ofa demand 347 upon the pupil. Unless such questions occur very near to the' \\ related material, they are toogeneral to have any kind of relevance, and they are not likelyto serve a useful purpose,apart that is from testing whether pupils are awake or not ( Sanders,. 1966 for adviceon framing questions in classrooms). \\ _It will be convenient to give the label 'provided questio s' to those questions thatare offered to pupils, usually as problems that require solution. This will distinguish themfrom the questions that are asked bY pupils, and which may be conveniently labelled'active questions. The label 'active questions' is intended to suggest the active role ofpupils in formulating the questions for themselves. .',. -...,.9.1.1 Studies of Provided Questiohls in Relation to LearningTesting and Learning. A number of studies have been undertaken to determine the ways inwhich provided questions may be used to facilitate the learning and retention of. verbalprose material, particularly in connection with programmed instruction. In a series ofexperiments by Hershberger and his associates (e.g. Herthberger and\\Terry, 1965),it wasfound that subjects ,earned more from written passages they were reading, if testing wasinterpolated rather than just at the end. Although the intention had been to investigate /the effects of testing upon the limning process, the fact is that the tests were administeredin the form of question& Following up on this work, Rothlcopf (1965) determined toinvestigate whether questions and specific Piactice-like effects, or whether they had ashaping effect upon the behaviour of subjects in the learning situation.\\Positionof Questions. In RothIcopfs experiment, 159 college undergraduates took par.They were exposed to a chapter of prose material taken from the book by r;achel Carl n,'The sea around us'. The chapter was 5,200 words !,..Nng, and described marine life at thegreater ocean depths. For the purpose of the experiment it was divided into seven sections,and two questions were constructed from the material of each of the seven sections,'giving fourteen experimental questions in all The main experimental coniparisons werebasedion a 25item criterion test, in which none of the experimental questions was repeated.Treatment were as follows:(i)The two experimental questions were given shortly before each section.Subjects wrote their guesses at the answers, and received the correctanswers before reading the section;(ii)As for (i), 'except that subjects did not receive the correct answers afterwriting their guesses; .\" 1 (iii).All experimental questions were given before starting the chapter.Subjects wrote their guesses as to the answers vial( questions,) andthen received the correct answers;(iv)Immediately after reading each section, subjects wrote answers to the. -two qUest. ions whiCh related to the section. They then 'received the .correct answers; 1(v).Ai for jiv), except that subjects did.not receive the correct an rs;I (vi)NO experimental questions were given. Subjects were instructed toread and study, and told that a test would follow;(vii)'As for (vi), except that subjectsmere advised to read'carefully anslowly:Rothkopf found that higher learningscores were obtained in the criterion testby groups (iv),. (v) and (vii), viz by those subjects who were given theexperiment I 348 questions immediately after reading each section, and by those subjects who had been .-given no experimental questions but were instructed to readslowly and carefully.Inspection of Rothkopf's data indicates that the treatments effects were largely attributableto the differences between scores obtained by the 'questions after' and. the 'questions* :.before' experimental treatments, With IquistiOni after' being more.effective. The resultsdo not support a superiority for questiOns over control, conditions overall. The differencebetween controls, viz. (vi) and (vii), attributed to the giving of special instructions, wasnot great enough to reach an acceptable level of statistical significance.It is arguable that the pre- questioning and post-questioning treatments were not.strictly comparable. The post-questioningtreatment referred subjects to items of informatiothat had already been given.. The pre-questioning treatment required subjects to makeguesses at information that had not yet been giVen. Interference from the incorrect guessesmight have occurri4 and offset any heightening of interest...The Mathemagenic HypotheSis.. If; however, questions operate_ differently depending. upon .. their position, this may be held to support Rothkopf's interpretation of the results asbeing consistent with his mathemagenic, hypothesis. According to.this hyPothesis,'Subjectsengage in certain behaviours when confronted with instructive material. Some of thesebehaviours are observable, e.g. gross postural adjustment of the head and body toward theprintedpage, and movement of the.eyes over the page: Other behaviours are not observable,such as mental rehearsal, the translation of written symbOls into internal _speech,and_the---segmentation of such interhal:speech-intd-Phrases, sentences, and other syntactic comPon,rents. RothkOpf professed reluctance in coining yet another word., but felt that 'hy;the-..magenic' more nearly Suggesied that thought of behaviours producing. learning th a.familiar expression such as inspection.behaviours.. His results could therefore be reformu=lated as a claim that knowledge that.questions would follow readinghad the effect ofintroducing more effiCient intpectiOn or mathemagenic-behaviours. With further materialthat followed, the exercise of these skills Could .help in the aCduisition and retention ofnew information. By definition, mathemagenic behaviours tend,to prcidUceclearningon this view, it is not necessary to make ahy.assuMptions regarding the extent to whichsubjects may be directly motivated to earn.Decline in Inspection Time. With regard to these mathemagenic behaviours, Rothkopf.considered that certain changes ight be expected to occur over a period of study. Aboutsuch changes in reading behaviou he writes, 'Fewer and fewer words are read' on eachpage. Paragraphs and even pages are skipped. Eventually the reader, may being to inspect:the room about hiM or become sleepy.' (1965; p. and Bisbicos (1967)reported adecline with repetition or prolonged reading as one resultof their study investibiting the selective facilitative effects of interspersed questions. Asin the previous 1965 study, it was,found that retention'was higheit when questions weret,, seen after reading relevant material. It was also,found.that variations in the type of post-questions could selectively reinforce the retention f question-related material. Asking fornames and quantitative measures produr:ed higher recall of that class Of phrases. In a I further study investigating emagenic behaviours, Rothkopf (1968), found that average.

In one experiment(1967) 79 coliege subjects read a passage of biographical prose, excerpted from 'Psythology:The science of mental 1 ife',,by G.A. Miller.(1962). .The following features of the experiment are of interest . (i)A 2,000- word. passage was:divided-into-twenty paragraphs of ten lines,.sothat material could be presented to subjects in passages of ten, twenty .and forty lines; i.e. one, two and four paragraphs respectively.(ii),,Two multiple-choice questions (five alternatives) were formUlated for eachparagraph: These qUestions required recall of specific factual informationsuch as, number of children in the JaMes family, or a course of study under-.taken by William James at a particular time.(iii)The twentyquestions which related to the second half of the paragraphs-.-occurred during the learning session and also in the post-test These werelabelled retention questions, and. were presented either before or afterthe paragraphs to which-they referred(i,)The other set of twenty questions, relating. to the first half of the paragraphs,was used to test for incidental learning. As subjecti were required to a.nswer'both sets of questions during the post-test, the use of the label 'retention'for one Ofthe sets is miileading. Frase.clearly wished to erriphasize that theneed to retain information relating to these queitions was made mereexpliCit..(v)'The:effects of feedtwk (Or KR, i.e. knowledge of results) were also investi-gated.- When.answers were giVen, they irnmediately followed the questions.When answers were not given,- subjects were required to look,for answersin the text material.\\In summary. this was a three-factor design,sinvestigating the effects of positionot questions, .length ofpaSsage,and.presentation of knowledge ofresults. There.were two dependentmeaiurei, viz learning scores in relation to retention and incidental questions. Data forthe two measures were analysed .separately. .,.Frase found that the effects of position of questions were significant:for .Dincidental. question& Learning scores were higher when questions were provided after theparagraph to which theY referred. With regard\" o retention questions; the situation is not - quite as clear. Althoughthe effects of .all three factors were reported to be significant,'showing higherlearning scores when questions came after the related paragraph& andindicating that twenty lines was the optiMal length of pasr.ge, a significant interactionbetween KR and position of questions Occurred. This did not affect the direction ofresults, favouring higher scores in the presenceOf KR i--?oth when questions preceded andfollimed paragraPhs, but it is doubtful whither the effects of the three factors wouldhave been statistically significant if compared with and tested against this interaction.Furthermore, the scores of a control group, who did not receive any questions, were notincluded in.the analysis. Inspection of Means (see Table 9.1 below) indicates that therewas no significant difference between the learning scores of controls and the scores ofsubjects who had received questions. With incidental questions, the controls obtainedscores intermediate between those of pre=questions and post-questions subjects. 350 Table 9.1.

Hedoubted whether,questions would have a retroactive, facilitating effect, particularly inview of the findings of Ausubel, Schpoont and Cukier 11957) that asking subjects toremember course material after they had read the material did not facilitate retention.For this reason, Frase favoUred aninterpretation consistent with Rothkopf's mathesmagenic hypothesi& -Contiguity of Questions and Texts. One way of interpreting the difference in favour ofpost-questions rather than pre-questions is to say that the pre-questions have an inter, \\fering effect on matheniagenic behaviours. Perhaps they encourage subjects to concen- \\trade on these parts of the text which appear to relate directly to the question& If0 ,pre-questions interact with the text in this way, restricting the stimuli that are respondedto, then it might be hypothesised that the closer individual questions are placed to answersgiven in the material, the sharper they selective effects.in order to ascertain the relevance of contiguityof questions and related content,Erase undertook two studies (1968a, 1968b). In thefirst of these, again using material__from the textbook in_intrciductory-psychologyTand;Wcifkiiig-with College students,, he-placed questions before or after every ten, twenty, forty or fifty sentences. All subjectswere given the same complete set of questions, but depending upon their spaCing withinthe text, questions were presented in groups otone, two, four or five. It was found thatretention of the incidental material decreased substantially for the prequestions groupwhen questiont were presented with greatett frequency, When questions occurredinfrequentlwas in the case, when they were presented before or after every` fiftysentences, there were no differences in retention betvveen the .e-iand post-questioni groups. In the second study, questions were presented either before or afterthe paragraphs every ten or twenty sentences, and similar results were.. Fraiedoubted whether the post-questions acted as discriminative-stimuli for the arousal of , mathemagenic skill since there was a difference in favour of post- over pre-queztioning__, on the very first paragraph. .Frase did not Usea control group in these two studies; but his results are consistentwith the possibility that pre-questioning, in the case of the first paragraph at'least, mighthaVe led to pro-active interfertee. &control group was used in a study by Frase, Patrickand Schumer (1970), but the effects of one type of extrinsic incentive were arso investigatedin their study. Pre-questionsl4re found to have the effect of depressing incidental learningwell below control group scores. In a fUrther investigation of this particular inhibitingeffect of prequestions, Patrick (1968) hypothesised that rehearsal of the prequestionsshould make the questions and their gUessed answers availableover a longer period, andcarry the inhibiting effect forward. Hii prediction was confirmed for pre-questions groups . Who had been instructed to write out the questions. I I Extrinsic Incentives. While investigating the effeCts of pre-questions Frase, Patrick andSchumer (1970) were also concerned with the effects of incentives. 270 undergraduates \\were promised no, three or ten cents fOr each correct answer on e test given immediatelyafter reading each of twentypaFigraPhiof biographical text. All except control subjects\\viewed twenty out of forty questions derived from the paragraphs under two conditions:\\either with one question beforelor aftereach paragraph, or with groups of five before orI4/ after each group of five paragraphs. Learning was found t be contingent upon how muchmoney subjects were offered for obtaining correct answe .The advantageof post- overpre-questions which had been repotted in previous studies diminished under the high:\\ i incentive condition. The writers concluded that this was not a result of any deficiency in ..the learning consequences of post-questiOns, but to/improved performance by the pre-questions and control groups as incentive \\increased. Delayed Retention. In his\"study investigating the effects of rehearsing prequestions,Patrick (1968) administered muliiple-choice tests immediately after.reding a passage, I and one week later. He found that although, as might be expected,. retention on thei delayed test was lower, the effects of the queStions remained the sortie.The effect of pre-questions on delayed retention of question-reievant and question- I irrelevant prose content was inv,estigated in a study undertaken by. Peeck (1970). He feltI../ the need to control reading time, as it wasd.ifficult to_judge whether better results inretention were due to extended inspection p to a more attentive, active reading process.A 3,000-word prose passage about Greece was presented to seventy two undergraduate\\students for a fixed period of time One group was first required to guesS answers to alist of pre-questions. They indicated their guessesby marking one of a numr of alternatives. Another group simply read the prequestions. One control group was all wed as ,mUch-extralime-for:Lstudying-as-the-two-experimentaligrOups-were-given-to-dea -with the, pre:questions. Another control group was no given extended study time Both prquestions groups showed better retention ove seven days of queStion-retevant prosecontent than controls, but inferior delayed retention of question-irrelevant information.,The question-irrelevant test roughly corresponds to Erase's incidental questiOns test, sothat Peeck's findings'may be said to have replatek.Frase's findings for the pre-questionssubjects. For the immediate retention' ,test, rio \\\\distinctionwas made betWeen questiort-relevant and questiOn-irrelevant information, 1.id the control _drOUp which had beengiven.:_extendeitime obtained significantly higher 'scores than the Pre-questions glouRs__-that had not been required to guess the ansvers. Differences between the two pre- ),\\questions groups were not statistically significant either in the short or lehg term.',COnirnehting on this, Peeck writes, 'Thus it seems that as far as retention isconcerne it does 352/ A 4\u00b0not make much difference whether one reads the questiOns without committing oneself .by marking'an alternative or one actually answers the pre-questions.' (1970,p. 244). Theeffectiveness of the reading control treatment, particularly in the case of_question,.irreleVant infOrmation retention, may be attributed to the fact that in the experimental,situation, subjects were prepared'toconform to an assumed requirement that the learningtask be taken seriously. It needs to be remembered that these were university students;and,they may be expected to have evolved their own Strategies for dealing withi materialthat they are reqUired to read and.learn. With regard to youhger sChool pupils, it ispossible that. this would only apply to the most able.Inhibitory EffectOf Pre=quesiione. The main difficulty with thelp/rovided queStionsexperiments, would appear to be that the questions do notarise frOrn the passages beingstudied; but are really,foci for rehearsing particular points within, pe passages, SomePoints are overlearned; while otners are negleCted. It is for this reason that pre-questionsappear to have been unsatisfactory. There could be lowered incidental learning!without acorresponding increase in relevant learning.

It is tothe extent that these questions call for answers that they Maybe said to contributetowards the simulation of a genuine queitioh-askingsituation. quite clear to what ,extent experimentere requirementS that subjects' answer, or makea guess: at answering,pretquettions will have depressed learning and retention. to (1967) either suppliedianswersor instructedsubject to look for answers within the text material,lt is arguable that any curiosity`.-which may have been aroused by prelquestionswas offset experimental require-ment that, UbjeCtd make a guess at. the ansWers. PatriCk's(108) design may have gonepart of the way to meeting this objection. He required one group to write out quettions,another group to write out what they thought were the cOrtanswers, and two groupsto read the questioni..There.was depressed incidental learn6 for the group writing outquestions, and this was interpreted as indicating that writing pre-questions was the mosteffective way-of rehearsing them and.of carrying forWard their inhibitory effects. in view\"of Peeck's t197e) failure to find any between and ,guess grOupi, Patrick's interoretationThay be tenable. -Summary of Results with Provided Quastions. The chief I pints that emerge from studiesInvestigating provided questions are as follows:(i) Subjects learned more from written pessag if they pwere.periodically tested .on the material they were reading.

Proceduresadopted to this end are likely to haveheir own effects upon learning and retention, so - -othat it becomes diffiCult to separate the effects of questions from thoSe of the proceduresadopted to elicit the'quetions.Fahey (1942b) cites a number of early educational texts which make the assump-tion that active questiOns facii;tate learning, e.g. ewey (1916), Woodworth Haslerand Smith Wesley (1937) A quotationfrom Wesley bears repetition,,'The question is a natural expression of the thinking mind. , The teacher who does not receive a number of unsolicited questions should seriously , examine his methods.

Teachers will justifiably, have doubts regarding thetruth of such a generalization; but the assumption tharactiie-questions facilitate learningis also one that needs to be tested./'Effectiyeneis' of Children's Questions : Early Studies. Among ear ? / attempts at assessingtthe effectiveness of children's questions were those of Finley (1921) and kelseth (1926),Finley encouraged.children to ask questiOni by bringing a salamander into the' classroom.,--:\"1-Ie recorded a total of over 8,000 questions from.1,713 children..In a' est based on thesalamander as topic, he found that children remembered best those points whichhey had asked the most question& The difficulty in interprAng.this studyn:.olely in termsf the relationships between questioning and learning is that the points about whichchildren asked most questions were possibly the points most likely to arouse curiosity,and most likely to tic remembered fo that reason. 1\\Heseth encouraged sixteen of her -pupils to use questions, and found that theirability to find questions that could be\\asked increased. These pupils were also found to Ibe above the norms on U.S. standardized history tests: This it anie;:arnple of the kind ofstudy which confounds the effects of the eliciting process with the effects of the question&InterVention programmes, particularly with.such a small sample of subjects,are almostcertainly in danger of contamination by Hawthorne effects (i.e. rnflation'of glores,attributable totinterest shown in the.subjects by eXperirnenters,'and found to nave occurredin experiments at the HaWthOrne works, Chicago.

Ausubel has emphasised that both diiisovery leadingand reception learning can be meaningful. It is not correct to assume that rote learni \\and reception learning are indistinguishable. Reception learning may be rote or mea ingful. The chief point about it is. that the entire content of what is to be learned is pre nted .to the learner in\\its final\\ form/The it is\\available and reproducible at some future time In the discotfery learninsisituation eprincipal' content of what 1 to be learned must be independently discovered 6)thelearner. Discovery: learning in this sense rarely occurs at the classroom level.,Thee iusuallysome imermediate position, more properly referred to as 'guided discovety'Ausubel held that while discovery learning is an appropriate procedure for solVing very-day prbblems of living, large bodies of subject matter are most easily acquired thro ghreceptiOn learning. And educational and other eitablishments frequently require t 'rmemberi to absorb large bodies of verbal! ymediated knowledge. -\\Verbal. Reception and Guided Disfovery. In support of this view, a recent study .b Rowell,Simon and Wiseman (1969) may be cited. They devised an artificial schema, the, sicelements of which were symbols; each of Which was associated with'a separate ,m fling.The symbols included such figureSas a square, a circle, a triangle, an arrow and aster, andthese were associated with the meanings:container', 'cloth', 'making', 'moving', nd 'heat%respectively. These symbols could ,be combined according to, specific rules in. Or, er togenerate new patterns of meaning, e.g a square combined with an arrow would uggestthe association of the two meanings 'Container' and 'moving' togenerate the n meaning'vehicle'. The subjects, whoWere university students, had the task of learning td, under-stand andthe schema. Two methOds of piesentatiOn were used, viz. verbal receptionand guided discovery. The verbal reception subjects.were given a carefully pre rod .1 lecture; examples of combiriationsofisymbols, and opportUnity to practise. T e guideddiscovery subjeCts were given examples of combinations and, after a starting p1 int hadbeen dttermined upon in consultation witlythe experimenter, went on to disc ver themeanings of the symbols, using the_technikr of question-answer discussion a ong then':selves. The, resul's of a post test git4n ten weeks later showed the verbal rec ion methodof presentation was Superior to guided discovery. Mean scores (percentages) ere 7E9and 65.6 respectively. ----'In such studies, the question is/a dependent variable insofar as it is eli ited by the,discovery situation and certain experimental procedures. To the extentxhat e auestion-Ina procedure is held to produce certain effects; such as discovering ruleSor eanings, thequestion acts as the independent variable. In the Rowell, Simon and Wiseiria j study, itwould not be possible to attribute the comparative ineffectiveness of the gui eddiscoveryprocedure to the questioning that Went on in the question-answer discussion As in the -case of in ervention programmes aimed at eliciting questions, the effects of the estionsthemselve are confounded with the effects of the procedure used to elicit them/ l\\ .,.Motivational and Cognitive FactOrs. Proponents of dik/overy learning tend to s assal as against cognitivefactors.

However, as Kagan.acknOWled es, youngchildien.may not be able to appreciate the joys of problem- solving; and any pupils are .not able to.sustain effort without the prospect of immediate reward. Br ner (1961, 1966) .'____:urged: that.d.iscovery procedures tend to foster an.interest in the activi itself, rather thanin the rewards which may.follow from learning.'

They may consider whether or not to concen-trate their attention upon items of information that are clearly and directly related to thequestions. Much,wifl depend upon the conceptiOn They have of the task with which theyare faced. Led to anticipate a test at the end of the study period, they may make theirown guesses regarding the nature of that test. Subjects such as psychology undergraduatesmay be supposed to have had some experience of perfOriiing in tests, and they could well,imagine thatithe experimenters were aiming to trap them. In this case, they might payspecial attention to items of information not relating to the pre-questions. On:theotherhande- they may not care very much what is likely thappen in the test, yet find that inspite of a general lack of motivation, they cannot help noticing items of informationrelating to the pre-questions..Considered from the Point of.view of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, the.situation may be repreSented as follows: high intrinsic motivation will.be motivation forlearning the passage. High extrinsic motivation may be Motivation for a good test perfor-mance or for some reward associated With This In both situations, subjects will pay asmuch attention to incidental as to question-relevant information, and in such cases littledifference might be expected between scores obtained under pre- and poSt-questions .conditions.- Erase, Patrick and Schumer's findings in the incentive experiment are con-sistent with this In the low.motivatioh condition, subjects probably to follow theeasiest way out, and simply use the Pre7questions as a means of rehearsing:specific itemsof information. The rest is.neglected.With regard to active questions, it has-diready been pointed out that difficulty is .experienced When attempting to separate the effects of active questions upon learning.from the effects of the procedure that is adopted -in order to elicit the questions. It seems'likely: that teachers who encourage their pupils to ask questions are good teachersin otherways as well in that they aim to arouse the interest and active participation of theirpupils in the learning process. Thi;:, does not mean that they are necessarily the mosteffiCient teachers. It could be argued that however desirable from the point of view ofthe classroom as a social situation,.questions asked by pupils are really a waste of timeRowell, Simon and Wisenian's findings aPPear to suggest this but it needs to be borne,inmind that their subjects were university students roc whom the problem of arausinginterest is probably less acute than for lower ability adolescents in a comprehensive school: 9.2 Project Studies : Active and Provided Questions .. MotiVational and Cognitive InteractionMotivational variables appear to have relevance for both provided and active question's,and it was felt that some practical purpose might be Served by exploring the possibilityofan interaction between.motivational and cognitiye faCtors. Ausubel (e, g. 1963) dignitivestructure p:Vi)1;-and in the iolloWing project studies,the main emphasis is placed upon investigation of motivation and cognitive structure inrr'ation to learning based on active question& in view of the relative papcityof controlled 357. experirriental studies in this field and their implications for guided discovery methods.IIG9.2.2 Design Problems Related to Active Questions..In experiments investigating the usefulnets of provided questions, the structure of\\thequestioning and, learning situation can be more closely brought under the control Of \\theexperimenter; and in the Rothkopf and Frase studies, the post-tests were directly linked,to particular sections of the written prose to which subjects were exposed. On the otherhand, the effects of active questions, in, fig. example, Blank and Covington's (1965) studywere of a general rather than a specific nature. Subjects were held to have achieved ahigher level of performance in tasks not directly related to the experimental situationitself, in consequenceof instruction in question-asking behaviour. For this reason, it wasfelt that in order to assess the facilitative effects of questiOing, the experimental.designshould permit of a definite association between materiali t.sed to generate questions, andmaterials serving is a basis for tests of learning and retenti n. In this search for closerexperimental 'control, it is inevitable that some of the spon neity that might be thought'typical, of the question-asking situation must be lost: 9.2.3 Summary of Research ProgramineThe research programme, giVing some indication of the problems investigated in the courseof particular studies, is summarized below. Full details may be found 'in Prosser (1971).1. Nature of.

Study I was carried out in two stages. In the first part of the experiment, apassage of 'easy' biographical prOse was presented to forty seven boys and girls, agedthirteen to fotitteen years, and taken from the upper two of five streams corresponding toability and attainment in a neighbourhood comprehensive school: In the second part ofthe experiment, a passage of 'difficult' prose was presented to thirty of the boys and girls 4.2 involVed in the first part. ,The \"easy' Passage was specially prepared; of 300 words in length; it related to thelife of a young soldier called Jim. The 'difficult' prose was a 450 word passage taken fromthe life of Robert E. Lee, in 'Men of America' by Lionel Elvin London : Pelican Books,1941. This had not so far formed part of the class curriculum, and subjects denied know-ledge of the topic, apart from having at some time heard of the Ainerican Civil War ingeneral terms. This would have given them no advantage when considering the details inthis one man's life which were now being studied. Apart from the fact that the 'difficult'passage was longer, it contained more information, and was written in a style thatrequiredthe use of a more advanced vocabulary. In a pilot study, learning scores obtainedon the 'easy' passage were considerably higher than those obtained or the 'difficult'passage, irrespective of treatment conditions; and this'appeared to validate the notion ofdifficulty for this experiment.In order to compare the perforMance of subjects at different ability levels, a Mill.Hill vocabulary test raw score of 43, approximating the fiftieth percentile Lae. for thegeneral population), was taken as a convenient cut off point for upper and lower verbalability groups. Since all sUbjects were from the upper streams, there were no very lowability pupils in the study. The terms 'high'. and 'low! will be used inreporting thiiexperi-ment, but should of course be treated as relative. ,FOr each part of theaxperiment a non-specific version of the prose.passage wasprepared. Pronouns were instead of names; adjectival or adverbial qualities were notspetified; and events were referred to in general and indefinite, terms. \u00b0 , e.g.Full Passage: 'The sea was rough, and their boats were too smalland frail'.Non-specific passage: 'Conditions were unsuitable, and equipment poor'. The gaps in information were expected to elicit questions, and where questions were pro:vided by die experimenter, they related to these gaps. In the above example, the providedquestions were: 'What were the conditions?''What was the equipment?''In what way was the equipment poor?' Subjetts were assigned at random to five groups; three experimental and twocontrols. Study tasks and timing were as follows: 360 TreatmentsQUESTIONS Active Provided Passage Read Full Passage Immediately following the study and learning period, all subjects were given thepost-test., A modification of Cloze procedure was used 25 sentences were devised, fromeach of which two words were deleted. Words were selected for high inforMation contentTransformations, particularly frOm active to passive voice, and vice versa, were frequentlyused Blanks in the test sentences were indicated by dotted lines of even length.e.g.Full Passage:The intervening six months had been a rime of vigorouspreparation.Test Sentence:Getting.......had takenmonths.Responses in the post-test were 'doubtful': To deter-'mine a subject's.score, only those 'right' responses that occurred in the same sentence as a'right' or 'doubtful' response were counted. Semantic sense and grammatical appropriatenesswere sufficient to count as correct,Post4est scores were subjected to analysis of variance, the main variables being sex,verbal ability, and difficulty of material; all in relation to the five treatments. Means were4. compared and tested against the error variance term,.Results. Results may be summarized-es follows:Easy ProseGirls: ,Questions (particularly provided questions) gave higher scores thanReading.Boys:Reading gave higher scores than Questions (particUlarly active questionS).High ability:Reading gave higher scores than Questions.Low ability:No difterencebetween Reading and Questions.Difficult Prose`Girls:No difference between.

Seic DifferenceS. It would appear froin theie results that the role of bothactive and provided questions in the learning process is comolicated by factors; arisingfrom individual differences associated with both sex and verbal ability. Differentialadvantage had been expected for active questions in the case where more difficUlt prosematerial had been used and Wheie pupils may bepresumed to, have considered that therewas point in asking questions. Results appear to have been consistent with this, but notwholly explicable in this way.'Interest in the sex differences centres on the boys for whom prose difficulty,reverses the effects of experimental treatments. Active questionipg, WhiCh had proved the .least helpful treatment when boyswere presented with easy prase, became. the most.helpful treatment when the proie was difficult. In:the case of-girls, however,-the direction.;of effects fairly consistently favoured questions, even when failing to reach an acceptablelevel of significance: .Byway of eXplahation of this result, it may be suggested that whereas boys arepossibly task, oriertted, girls are situation oriented. In other words, boys may be moreresponsive to the pacing of a particular task; kf, the task. is too.easy,_they Will slacken theirefforts. Girls, on the other hand, may beprepared to sustainA level of performance moreclosely elated to factors in the experimental situation itself, e.g. teacher-pupifarrlexperimenter-subject relationships in the classroom as a social situation. Girls tend to bemore cooperative, and to take an appointed task\"more seriously. .There is considerable evidente in the literature to support the fathiliar stereotypesof female passivity.as well.as the male readiness to respond to a realistic challenge.;Moriarty (1961) foUnd that young girls tended too adapt more qUickly to anew situation,orienting to instructions and tasks; but that with increase in task difficulty, this sexdifference was reversed: Crandall and Robson (1960), found that in thbiix to eight years 363 age group, boys chose to do a task that they had not been allowed to complete, morefrequently than girls. Working with college students, McClelland 119531 found thatwhereas under relaxed conditions, women's need for achieverhent was greater than men's,but when subjects believed that they were competing on an academic text, there was asharp rise in the men's need for achievement. It was when subjects competed for socialapproval that the women's sense'of need increase& Social factors were held by Smockand119621 to account for sex differences in response to various forms of novelstimuli. four sets of-Pictures representing types of perceptual conflict were presented toboys and girls aged seven to eight years. The children could elect to look at each pictureas many times as they wished. When presented with these picture materials offeringstimulus complexity, incongruity, and meaningfulness of the sequence of information,the boys were more curious. Girls, however, had a tendency to respond to the absenceof environmental structure, Le to seek for an interpretation cif new stimuli in terms ofexisting cognitive structures. Thistould explain the resultS o'Jtained in the present study.Although imMediately challenged to activity by the 'easy' prose girls were more rigid intheir approach to the 'difficult' 'printVerbal Ability. With regard to differences aaributable to verbal ability, it would appearthat With the easy prose, high ability subjects found that the overt response; i.e. ofwriting questiont or answers to qUestions, was an unnecessary sniploymeht of time Thetaskwas too easy to offer them any kind of challenge. They found the questionsirrelevant and unhelpful. Low ability subjects took the task more seriously, particularlyin the case of difficult proseSumoiary. In the course of this study,- three research problems were considered, viz.(i) Do the effects of difficulty of material differ for active and provided\\questions?Are the effects of difficulty of material the same for high and low ability_ _._subjects, for: boys and girls?'Mil\\ Are subjects more likely to benefit from questions if faced with a`reelistic challenge to their competence? . \\ f.

It might be safer to think in terms of--subjective difficultyrather than dkiiiculty aisuch. The terms 'High' and 'Low' as used inreporting the experiment were, however, relative No low ability pupilshad taken part. Itthirefore seemed ufeful to consider whether questions would be helpful to pupils in thelowest abilitystreams. At-the extreme position a task.rnay be diffiCult enough to discourage subjects. /Instead of difficulty:providing a challenge to activity, it may result in tiOidance behaViOur.This -,ggests that there might be a point of optiMum subjective difficulty and, if this is:-the case, that there might bedatt at which the fatilitatiVe effects of questions, parti-milady active questions, will be at their greatest in view of findings regarding sex differ-\\ences, it might be predieted that this,point will be set differently for boys and girls.Procedure: Pupils in the lokest ability streams of the swim school in WhiCh the firit \\exPen ent was run were exposed to the `difficult`.-prose material.

The problem is to know whether anythingdifferent hapPens over the long- as opposed to theshort-terrn interval. Early items 'in a series may belorgotten beeause' of retroactiveinterference (Waugh and Norinan), decay of the original trace formed by the items (Brown, 1964), or because, they haVe not been organised into meaningful patterns for incorporation into the 'Secondary memorystore (Wood, 1969.- cf. also fuSubel, 1963, 1968).,It is possible. that byaskingquestions,pUpils will be led to impose some pattern uponstudymaterials,' and that more perminentmental (or cognitive) structures will be established in consequence.,In the short term, rote-learning strategiesmay beemployed,. so that differences between qeustions and reading treatments, are_ obscured.

That is to say, they need to,,be aware of a problem beore they are likely togive verbal expression to this awareness in the \"form of..-a question. If subjects feal that theiquestions have a significant part to play in the learning process, they will bi more likelyto ask questions..One way in\\hich subjects might be led to feel that the task is relevant wouldto ;give them answers to their questions. Another method would be to provide the information that might be supposed to answer a range of pnisibie questions. This can beidone byoffering a list of answers to hypothetical questiOns. In this case, feedback is provided inthe form of information- related to the quettioningprocedure adopted by the:subjects. Inretrospect, they learn which of their questions were considered appropriate and worthanswering. Quite Possibly, under such circumstances, subjects will ask questions in order '\u00b0to get information rewding both the, aterial and their own skill in asking questions. Thisis comparable with the classroom situation where the teacher says, for example, That is agood qbestionr.'..e,Procedure.

The time spent by them in performing each task was recorded. The post-test was a Cloze completion test similar to that employed in the previous studies.Results.

Contrary to prediction, the Active Questions Groups did notoiltain'higher scores than the Pfovided Questions Group. In fact, results were in theopposite -direction; and the;diff-vence between scores only failed to re h an acceptablelevel of significance when the main treatment effects were testes using a significant Sexby Reacoing Ability interaction instead of the within-cell variance as the error term in theanalysis of variance.

For 'low' reading ability subjects this correlation was significant at theone per cent level= .65, N = 16), but for 'high',ability subjects it failed to reach anacceptable level of significance(r = .45, N = 16.1.Discussion-of Results. With regard tapost-test scores, it is possible that the tasIcWassimplified by repetition over a series of presentations, so that the situation correspondedmore closely.rto the 'easy' prose condition of the first experiment This could explain why -the active queitions treatments failed to give hich-er score:. than the provided questionstreatment. If this explanation is correct, results On that part of the post-test correspondingto the first presentation might fie expected to approximate those foUnd with klifficultprose in the first experiment. The only-cOmparable treatmentsare active and providedquestions, and in both experiMents the Active Questions Group obtained higher scoreIn this study, the superiority of the Active Questions Group reached an acceptable levelof significance. The. Relevant Active Questions GrOuP were possibly at a disadvantage onthe first presentation, in that their task was slightly 'MOM complicated; buteliilts showthat.they made the biggest improvement between the first and second presentations. Itwas with the second presentation that the benefits of feedback might be *meted for thefirst 'time; and this is what appears to have happened. However, in spite of the initialadvantage that active questions had with the first presentations, provided questions were'clearly at no disadvantage overall. ,The sex by reading ability interaction indicated in the analysis of variance is ofparticular interest, for whereas girls gave evidence of a fairly consistent perfOrniance, the'-high'ability subjects obtaining higher scores than the 'lbw' ability subjects, boys' scores'fluctuatedas they reflected the different experimental treatment conditions in relationto their own ability. This is consistent with the suggestion made previously in,connectionwith results of the first experiment that boys were possibly more task-oriented, whereas*girls were more situation-oriented.The prediction of a decline in time spent on both study and inspection oversuccessive presentations was clearly supported by the results. A highly significant lineartrend was found. Postponement of this decline in inspection time did not, howeVer, occuroverall for the Relevant Active Questions Group. Analyses of linear trend were performed,and although comparisons coulci)iot be made without the warrant of interaction effects,it was interesting to note that the variance of _linear trend for 'low' a'aility boys under theRelevant Active QUestions treatment offered the least deviation from zero. Thii is con-sistent with the point made in discussion of the scores; for i had been found that for low'ability boys the difference in scores between the treatments was negligible. 372 ITable 9.4 Correlations between Inspection boys.21.38.63Low Ability girls.36.30.36 For each group, N = 24.

Thii would help toexplain why they tended toobtain-higher-scores, Here-is _oneforrn_Otmathemagenic behaviour that is more closelyunder the control of the experimenter. These pupils were required to answer the samenumber of questions at each Presentation; so that their writing task remained 'relatively_constant. The Active Questions Groups could decide for themselVes from pretentation topresentation how many question they would write, and consequently how much timethey would spend at.the task. This decision would be determined by their own conceptionof the task, and of the challenge that it presented. 'Low' ability boys again proved to bethe special group. Whereas:the amount of writing time for the Provided Questions Groupwas greater.,in the case of all other puPils, particularly 'high' ability boys (p <.0011, thedifference was not significant in thecase of 'lOw' ability boys. This result is consistentwith the findings fOr low' ability boys on scores obtained and time spent on study andinspection.The Relevant Active Questions Group were expected to ask more questions thanthe Active Questions Group, because they had the opportunity of discovtring that theirquestions had some part to play in the learning process: The only subjects for-whomresults in the.expected direction approached an acceptable level of significance were the'low' ability boys (p <.05 one test). 'Low' ability boys tended:to ask more questionsin any case, whereas the 'high' ability girls asked more 0estons:than the 'low! abilitji girls. o. This gives further support to, the suggettion that girls tend to be situation - oriented:'High' ability pupilS would be expected to\\manifest their ability by formulating morequestions, and girls perform accordingly. Boys, however, tend to formulate questions ifthey feel that the task warrants it. 'High\" -abilitY boys were not sufficiently challenged, .and consequently asked fewer questions than the 'low' ability boys.. o9.2.9. Study VI: Successive Presentations Retention Interim!\\ The effects of retention interval upon scores obtained by the different treatment' groupshad been considered in Study III and as expected, loss attributable to factors Operatingover a long-term interval Was less pronounced for the Active Questions Group, Theexperimental design had not however, permitted detailed irivestigatiOn for this type oftreatment by retention interval interaction. In order to obtaina\\less equivoCal result;it was decided to follow up on the subjects who took part in the experiment investigatingthe effects of successive presentations (Study V).Procedure.After ten,months, thirty MX of the Original forty eight p pils were stillavailable, and were re-tested. A further twelve pupils who had not takeipartin theoriginal.experiment were also tested: They were able to act as controls, anctheir scoreson the post-test were compared by t-test with the learning and retention scores obtainedby the thirty six experimental subjects. Since the controls had not completed theimmediate post-test, theyWere excluded from the main analysis of variance. Seo).es9fthe experimental groups were trantformed to give a normal distribution, and subje ed-to a four-way analysis of variance. within-subjects factor offered two measures, and short-termRetention Interval. This gave a3x2x 2 x2 repeated measures design, three replicatesto each cell.Results.As predicted, a treatments by retention interval interaction occurred (p'.01)Loss attributable to factors operating over the ten months' interval was greatest for theProvided Questions Group, and least for the Relevant Active Questions Groups. In fact,the difference between short- and.long-term scores for the.ReleYant Active Questionssubjects was negligible Almost exactlythe same scores were obtained by the threetreatment groups on the long-term retention post-test. This means that even if short-term results are interpreted as having shown that provided questions are more effectivethan activequestions, from a long-term point of view active questions and relevant activr .questions appear to halm been at least as effective in facilitating the learning andretention of prose Material as provided questions.Althote differences between long-term retentiontscores obtained under thethree treatment conditions Were negligible, the comparison of means indicated a largedifferenCe (p<.001) between scores obtained by experimental subjects and controls.It is possible that the scores of controls were inflated as a consequence of some contactwith experimental subjects: but even if it is assumed that this dio not happen; and thatthe performance of controls was not above chance level, the experimental scores werestill clearly superior and may reasonably be attributed to learning under the experimentalconditions. 37.5T Fig. 9.6.

The results of this studyare of speCial interest. from -a pedagogical pointof.view, and could help teachers overcome any reluctance. to substitute the pupils'oWnquestions (i.e.:active qtiestions) forwhat course,,active questicis-have not been shown to besuperior, but similar scores may. have been obtained by the three experimental grotipsfor different .reasons.Assuming that these reasons are of practiCal importance, some light may be .shed upon the situation by considering the reading age 'y sex by retention intervalinteraction, which was just significant at the. five percent level. Such higher orderihter-actions are not always easy to interpret, but a brief 'description of the pattern ofresults may be helpful. In order of magnitude; lossattributable to retention interval .was at follows:1.High ability boys2. ,High ability girls,I3.Low ability boys4.Low ability girlsThis is consistent with the results of Studies I and II which suggcsted that \\questions particularly active questions, were most helpful when subjects were facedwith a challenge to their competence, and that girls were more ready to take anexperimental task seriously as a task.Applying these principles' to the experimental groups used in Studies V and. VI,of expected rank order of magnitude of loss attributable to Retention interval, withineach factor, would be as of sequences overall, depending uponthe extent to which the effects of any given factdr are given priority.e.g.1..The 'main division Treatments, with either (a) bility of (b) Sex as chiefsub-division.Dividing on Ability level, with either (a) Treatments or (b) Seas chiefsub-division.sitcDividing.&on Sex, with either (a) Treatments or (b) Ability as chief sub-division:When for each of these six possible sequences, the observed rank order wasplotted against the eXpected rank order, correlation coefficients pairedobservations) twelve in all cases. 9.2.10. Study VII: AdvanCe Preparation and Wider ContextIf, as suggested in the previous'Study, a consistent picture is emerging of the way inwhich active, questions wOrk,.it will be useful toloa-more_alosely-at those features whichappear to distinguish between active and provided question% ,,;Provided questions may se ,,e the purpose of drawing the attention of OuPils tothose points which the teacher withes them to remember. They are a means of leading.pupils to rehearse these points, and tend to encourage a rote-learning approach to the.task.In the case of more able:pupils, it may be-suppOied that they have a better storeof thought patterra; or cognitive structures with which new items of information can besystematically integrated without Much difficulty. Such pupils may find the taskuninteresting, but they will learn and remember some of die material in spite-of this Forthem there.wilLbe two kinds of learning,vd (1) Rote learning, which is facilitated by therehearsal of items to wh ich. attention has been drawn by the provided questions, and (2)' Meaningful learning, which, is facilitated by-the availability ofl. a -existing body of relatively :Well organised knowledge (cognitive structure) and brought about by the simple juxta-position of provided questions and the material to which they relateIn the short-term, results oftoth kindeof learning will be apparent; but in thelong term, information learned by rote will tend to be lost betause by definition it willnot have been meaningfully related to existing knowledge thing the analogy of a filingsystem, information which has not been carefully categorised is.not readily recovered.In the ease of less able pupils, although their store of cognitive structures willnot be as great, the need to fOrmulate their. own (active) questions encourages a moredeliberate relating of new information to their existing knowledge. In their case, withthe challenge of a comparatively difficult and possibly r#ore interesting. task, there will \u00b0-tend to be greater emphasis upon meaningfults against rote learning. To this extent,therefore, low ability subjects will have less to losein the long term. In other words, suchgains as they dci make in the short term will be relatively perManentIf this is a fair assessment of the position, two fukher possibiiities may be use-.fully explored:-(1)Perhaps the difference betweal high and low ability subjects canbe dimin-ished by providing allisubjects in advance with a pattern or structure to whith newinformation is easily/related. By exercising some control overthe Cognitive structurevariable in this way'it might be possible to expose the tendency for provided questiOni .to encourage rote, learning, while active questions strengthen the meaningful learningapproach. Evidencesfor rote learning could be adduced from the presence of primaryandcrecency eff,xts which appear in, and tend to be characterittic of, rote earningexperiment% ,(2)-7-Perhaps subjects will be encouraged to use a meaningful learning approachto material when offered a wider context io that material. As well as being offered textmaterial which they are expected to learn, pupils can be given the opportunity to.gainsupplementary information from context material. This extra information may come in the form of answers to hypothetical. questions (i.e provided questions), or be availablein answer to real questions active questions). If subjects are led to see a relationshipbetween their own questions and the extra material,.they ay be more ready to lookfor meaningful relationships throughout the learning situ ion.Procedure.A series of bxperirnents.was undertaken, in which t\" le effects of thesevariables were investigated using a number of designs, but the some basic materiati. Apaiiage of 600 words was selected from 'The. Pyramids of EgyjR' by LE.S. -Edwards,London: Penguin books, 1947.. A list of sixty four, items of information based oh-thispassage was. compiled'. This was then diVided into,four sections, each containing sixteenitems of information. These four sections were labelled 'context' passage& ,e.g. 'In early hieroglyphic writings the ba was represented by astork with a tuftof feathers on the front of its heck; later :theign was changed to a bearde:.1humah-beaded bird preceded by a lamp'.Items. of inforrhation were then cut frOm these seCtions as evenly throughout the sectionsas possible until there were eight items in each Section. These shorter sections were labelled..'text' passages, and served as tt,e required text, or text to be learned.e.g.7 'The ba was represented by a stork, and later by a h.Urri :headed bird'.These were then sysprinatidally. reducecLto form sections comprising four items, twoitem& and finally onelitem,Of information These sections were used to provide theadvance preparation, which was bUilt up again on the items of information beginningwith the shortest sections of one item per section. Theiiems of information did notcorrespond to the 'bits' of information theory, but werevtaken as convenient unitsto be learned by subject&e.g.. 'The bas were sometimes show as birds'..If these items are regarded as statements, the first task in'the advance peeparatio-n wasfor subjects to read the four statements. They then completed sentences correspondingto the statements, but frOm which two words had been deleted. A list of four cluesfollowed, and subjects were required to write the words suggested by the clues.e.g.\" Clue: 'Sometimes they: used -to shwo themas-birds'.\\ This was followed by eight statements, with eight sentences to comPlete and eight'clues to solve: Finally sixteen statements followed; with sixteen sentences to completeand sixteen.clues to sCve.Experiment I.

If, as results in the previous experiment suggest, pressure Of time has the the Active QuestionsGroup derived special benefit from availability of context.Furthermore: in thisexperiment the context passage was always available. The resultscould therefore be interpreted as indicating that tte pre-te t positiOn of the contextoffered interference, while the post-text position offered lel ss interference. However, assubjects were older, and taken from the higheit ability stream, it is not likely that thepre-text availabilityof context would have .offered them any difficulty. The post-textavailability of context would, therefore, appear to have helped rather than hinderedlearning.In the previous experiments, between-subjects. error variance had tended todepress the effects of ihe different experimental questions treatments. There was less .doubt about the effeets of the within:subjects factors such as presentations. and retentioninterval, In thseXperiment, the two experimental treatments foimed a within-subjectsfactor. That is to say, subjects served as their own controls.

The results of experiments in this series show that:(i)When subjects were given advance preparation, primacy and recency effects occurredfor all treatment groups, but appeared to be more pronounced for the ProvidedQuestions Group.(ii)When subjects were given wider context, a retroactive interference effect appearedto occur, and this effect was exacerbated when the amount of time aVailable tosubjects was restricted.(iii)Loss attributable to long -term retention was leSs for subjects -given advance prepare- .tion:(iv), When subjects were.exposed\"to two presentations of material, there was no differ-ence between scores obtained on tests relating to each'of the prentatb-ris. 383 r (v)With subjects of relatively low ability, advance preparation predictably assistedlearning and, although questions treatments gave no advantage over controls,active questions were of greater benefit than provided questions. .(vi)Above average ability subjects, acting as their own controls, derived greater benefitfrom active questions than from the control treatment, when there were only twopresentations.(vii)For these higher ability subjects, context'given after textmaterial was morehelpful than context given before.Discussion. The two chief problems investigated in this series were(1)Do questions make a contribution towards meaningful learning that may rot other-wise be made if subjects are given a carefully structured advance preparatiun?(2) *Does question-asking encourage Subjects to look for and derive a more meaningfulunderstanding of prose material.from a wider context?.With regard to the first of these problems; advance preparation appears to havemade sortie contribution to learning, particularly in the case of below averdge abilitysubjects. Evidence for a contribution towards meaningful learning by the use of questions,over, and above that made by advance preparation, is less clear. Primacy and recencyeffects occurred for both questions groups When all subjects were given advance preparation,so that rote-learning strategies appear to haVe beenused to some extent at least On theother hand, the finding that primacy and recency effects were less pronounced for theACtive Questions Group than for the Provided Questions Group lends support to thesuggestion that subjects asking their own questions are more likely to look for meaning-fUl relationships in the material.With regard to the second problem, in the first five experiments of this seriesthere is no evidence to suggest that the availability of wider context encourages Meaning-ful learning, either with or without the use of questions. In the experimental situation atleast, subjects preferred to concentrate/upon learning the. text.material. Wider contextinterfered with this task,particularly'1when subjectswere under pressure of time In thefinal experiment of the series, older subject; of above average ability.were used; and inthis one experiment where context availability appears to have helped, and where contextgiven after text material was more helpful than context given before text material, theeffects of position of context were the same whether subjects asked questions or per-formed icontrol task. It is however, arguable that the higher scores obtained by subjectswhen they' sked questions indicate that they made more efficient use of the contextmaterial, irrespective of its potition in relation to the text material. 9.2.11 Study VIII : ouestions and Other Syntactic TransformationsTransformational grammarians, their from Chomsky (1957), have producedan analysis oflanguage'whichseparates out differentrules for generating sentences.Underlying each sentence, a kernel string is presupposed, and this is someiirnesreftrredto as its Ono structure. This string can be arranged in a number of Wayi in orderto generate particular sentences. The order of words, and the form (Particularly litheendings) of words canbe varied according to certain basic rules.

In the two experiments where the effects of treatments reached an acceptablelevel of significance, the direction of results was again in accordance with prediction.In one experiment, both the Active and Provided Questions Groups obtained lowerscores than the Transformations Gropps (p <.05). In the other experiment, where therewas no`Providednuestions Groups,. the Active Questions Group obtained scores thatwere significantly lower than those of a Transformations Group (p <.001)In four of the experiments in this series, the design permitted investigationsfor the effects of interactions between treatments, form of post-test, and retentioninterval. In only one of these experiments, the final experiment of the series, werestatistically significant interaction effects found. The treatments by form of test inter-action was significant (p <.001). In this experiment, form of test indicated both reten-tion interval and forrlhiith respect to transformation of post-test.Inspection of means indicates that in the short term, the Active QuestionsGroup obtained higher scores on the untransformed post-test by the other treatmentsgroups..For all except the Active Questions Group, short-term scores were higher thanFong-term scores (p <.05). In The case of the Active Questions Group, there was nosignificant difference between short-term ,andlong-term scores; and the differencewas in fad in the opposite direction.Summary.With regard to the main problem investigated in this study, the explanationthat provided questions assist learning because subjects process information by performinga grammatical transformation into and from the interrogative appears to be adequate.If provided questions had the effect of arousing curiosity, there is nothing here tosuggest that this helped learning.'Active questions, however, appear to work differently'.They are et some disadvantage in the:short-term rote-learning situation, but: such' gainsas are made are apparently more permanent and suggest a meaningful-learning approach.

Butassuming that interest aroused by the experimental psychologist's visit was randomlyspread across the different experimental treatments, there is other variance to explain,and statistical generalisations about this variance may be considered Meaningful.It is, of course, true that a measure of unreality attaches to laboratory-typesituations, and it can be objected that although experiments may be conducted in theclassroornT-theilio-m3rotWriioli than a rough. approximation to classroom teaching.:If anything, hOwever, this shOuld adckextra weight to-findings regarding the usefulnessof questions, partiCularly active questions. Active questions could not be given a fullopportunity to demonstrate their special facilitative effects. Question-asking applied .moreespecially to the iformal or loosely structured as againtt the formal and highlythe''-structured. approachteadhing. But in order to investigate for effects specific toexperirinental treatme ts-and the prose material used, experimental visits had to berather formal occasions,.with traditional seating arrangements, and silence throughoutthe experiments. -It is often easier for the visitor to secure such conditions than it is forIfie resident teacher who has to deal:With the same pupils day after day in situations(where problems and strategies vary considerably.Cle4rly then, the acceptance:Of certain experimental restrictions has beennecessary; and from the point of view of applied psychologY, particularly educationalpsychology, this approach may not be regarded as adequate. But before more thoroughand extended investigations can be considered, there needs to be some appreciation ofthe number and characterof the variables involved. With regard to questions, particularlyactive questions, the task remains at the exploratory stage; and what has the: appearanceof being a major problem has, for the present, to be approached by way of miniaturestudies. ,. 9.3:2. Summary of findingsIn a statement of the principtil findings, it may be as well to bear in mind the criticismsthat Ci-onbach (1966) has made regarding a great deal o tro'r.nal researchor ofextrapolation from educational research findings. He has suggested: that generalisationsshould take the form,'With subject matter of this nature,inductive experience of this type,in this amount,'produces this pattern of responses,in pupils al this leVel of developMent' (p. 79).If we were to be extremely cautious, and accept Cranbach',s.suggestion,Tthe----,---findings made in the course of these studies may be stated-in the following font,'With biographical prose material relating toa young soldier,and to certain national leaders inthe American Civil War,and with descriptive material relating to. Egyptian beliefs and practices, and with simple sentences set in prOpositional form,subjects' own written questions,interspersed between sucdessive presentations of material,have been found to help in the completion of sentences from which information\"has been omitted,relating to material offered in the first presentations,but not in subsequent presentations,and less efficiently than procedures involving gramthatical transformationsunless wider context is available,in the short term,bUt as effectively as these transformation procedures,and questions provided by the experimenter,relating to material over all presentations,in the long term,for boys and girls,aged 13 to 16 years,in the upper and middle ability streams,of neighbourhood comprehensive schools,derived from arrupper working class population,in a south of. England city .'.Perhaps the most important general statement that can be made is that undercertain experimental conditions questions, whether active or provided, have been at leastas helpful to pupils learning prose material as other methods requiring them to processf:he material. There appears to be some justification for the existing practice of askingpupils questions regarding matters of fact set within materials proyided for study.But our special concern has been with the effects up6n learning that may beexpected from the questions that-pupils ask; Are pupils! own questions more or lessefficient than the possibly more expertly framed qUestions that are provided by teachersand educationalists? Results of the studies reported here suggest that these activequestions can not only be as helpful as provided questions, but under certain conditionse.g. when pupils' are offered a challenge to their competence, can be more helpful. Itlooks as if there is a case for overcoming any reluctance that teachers may have atpresent for using Up what appears to be valuable time in permitting, or even encouragingthe asking of questions.Even if it is doubted whether active questions have been shown to exercisea powerful facilitatiVe effect upon learning, there is little to suggest that they contributetowards a diminution in learning efficiency. At first, it looked as if this Might be the case,with the finding in the first experiment that with easy prose material, boys and highability pupils derived less benefit from questioning than'from jutt reading in a givenperiod of time. In the long tern's., however, the situation, mproved, and not only werethe effects of questions, particularly active questions, found; to be favourable withdifficult prose, but with easy prose the short-term effect was reyessed.______.This pattern of improVement in the position of active quettionsOver the long-,term appears to have been consistent across the-experiments. In this regard, the strongretention interval by treatments interaction reported in Study VI (Successive Presenta-tions: Retention Interval, 9.2.9) is of particular interest. The superiority of providedquestions over active questions through a series of presentations in the short term, was completely lost in the long term. 4The second thing that can be said is that active-questions appear to have workedin a different way from that of Provided questions in two respects: (i) The effects ofactivequestions-upOn learning were probably more sensitive to the influence of motiva-tional factors such asthe challenge presented to the competence of puPils.. The strengthOf this challenge would; of course, bepartly detennined by the ability leVel of pupilsin rOatiOn to the material presented, but boys and girls appear to have differed in theirresponte to this. Challenge. The thallenge itself was found to relate more specifically toactive questions; and it is in connection. with active questions that the greatest directionalchanges occurred: In Study ( (Nature of Material, 9.2.,- it was with active questionsthat boys obtained their lowest scores with easy prose and their highest scores withdifficult prose: This did not happen in the case of girls of comparible ability. The sexdifferences were explained as attributable to the \\effect of TOW perception upon theattitudes of pupils towardithe task. On this view boys.were supposed to be taskoriented, and their interest in the task was largely determined by such factors as levelof difficulty. Girls, on the other hand, were probably situation oriented and, tendingto be more conformist, were motivated to respond suitably, i.a at a near'optimumlevel of interest, to the deinands of the experimental situation. (ii) Meaningful learningseemed more likely to occurwith active questions. In the rote leaning situation, as e.g.in the experiments of Study VI I I .(Questions and Transformations 9.2.11. where thetask inVolved cOMpleting easy sentendes whiCh were transfornnedoi untransformed,active questions were at a disadvantage. Furthermore, in the experiments of Studyi VI I{Advance esultt\\over presentations that resembles theM, were sharper for provided,questions than for active questions; and this was in the situation where subjeCts werecarefully prepared; and where presumably the speCial effects otthe two differenttreatments might be expected to show.With regard to answers to questions, results' do not offer a clear pattern. This. isprobably due to lack of specificity in the feedback procedure._ Strictly speaking, pupilsdid not receive feedback on their questions because there was no evidence to them thatthe information which came through the full passages provided-in the experiMents ofStudies I. to VI, the context provided in Study VII, and the full sentences in them:Peri-ments of Study vi!i, was:direCtly giVen in answer to their qUestions. The pupils couldnot feel that their questions had brought the infnrmation: Their questions did not haveany control over the information- giving procedure. In the final experiment of Stiidy VII .(Advance PreParation and Wider Context, 9.2.10.) where-pupils received'greater helpfrom the context coming after the text material than from the context coming beforematerial, it it possible that the older and higher Pupili who took part, were better ableto relate text to context On the other hand, the higher scOres:obtainedliOiaPifir-whenthey asked_questionsTniay-be interpreted as indicating that thley found the Context more-usefUl when asking questions, and that its usefUlness lay in the ct that it acted toprovide feedback to their questions. 9.3.3. Practical Applications: PedagogicalAlthough caution is appropriate when attempting to extrapolate from results of the kindof experiment reported in these studies, the pattern of findings seems to suggest thateven if theoretical generalisations are dangerous, attempts at practical application willnot be. The first general conclusion was.thatoestions, whether active or provided; can beat least as helpful as other methods.requiring pupils to process material which haS beenpresented to them' for study. As far ?provided questions are concerned, it seems thatresults are consistent Witkthefindings of Rothkopf and FraSe, reported earlier WA.).Howeyer, noattempthas been made in the present studies at replication of their workrelating to the location of provided questions, and to differences in the effects of.questions upon learning question-irrelevant and question-relevant information. Theresults:of experiments in Studies V VII (Successive Parsentationt Relevant ActiveQuestions and Refentibn Interval; Advance Preparation and Wider Context) are alsoconsistent with the position adopted by AusUbel (1963) regarding receptibn learning.The carefully structured teaching situation, where information is organised and-presentedtaking accountthe existing apttern of the pupils' knowledge and experience, offersgood prospects of meaningful learning. Provided questioni,which are formulated by theteacher, appear to lend themselves more readily to this organisational procedure; andthis has been recognised by those responsible for writing textbooks and teachingprogrammes.\u00b0 Theproblem arses whether activequestiOnsican also be incorporated into wellstructured teaching probrammes,.aSsuming of course that it is desirable to do so. Teachers.are often under pressure of time. Rightly or wrongly, there are syllabus requirements andexaminations to be considered. For this reason, it is possible to be discouraged if thebenefits of active questions are not always immediately apparent. A reluctance to goahead may be Overcome if it is accepted that in the long run, active questions are certainlyat no disadvantage, and that eVen.in the short term, under conditions where a challengeis presented to the competence of pupils, or if a wider context is offered relating to thesyllabus Material, active questions can be helpful. Of course, it is the long-term positionWith which educationalists eve concerned, and there is the further possibility that questions,whether active or provided, may prove to be useful for other reasons, .in the classroomas a social situation. In addition to,this, as e.g Blank and CoVingttin (1965) found,question-asking behaViour can be elicited in children, and skill in question-asking maybe expected to .improve-with practice.Procedures followed in the experimentS of.Study VII (Advance Preparation andWider Context, 9.2.10), suggest how active queStions may be incorporated into carefully:organised teaching situations: Prose may be broken'down,inio a number of information-,bearing items, anda basic division between text and context determined upon. TheprObiem then arises regarding the aims of teacher and pupil. These do.not necessarily:coincide. The teacher may want the pupil to learn the text. The pupil maybe. interestedin selected portions of the context..Assuriling that the teacher is right, his task becomes,that of leading 'the pupil to an understanding of the text by means. of his excursionsinto the context. Haying itemised infornrtion in:the context, the teacher thin preparesan exhaustive list of questionscorresponding to those items. It becomes:a matter then oforganising the output of answers, or library of answers, so that *r can come as feedbackto the pUpit's questioning: The teacher then haS the difficult task of monitoring thepupils ediScoveriee, so that in the more formal teaching situations, these nay-act asanchoring pointS for the basic information which it is left that the pupil should acquire.A carefully programmed text might be usefully linked to *le class library.Frames could .Offer pupils achoice of methods by which to learn material,.and thepossibility ofchanging from one method to the wher: In a typical frame, the pupil may Thkfollowing flow nos.aQUestionInfo.

Results along,each panic lar line of research wouldn\\to be watched over a much lOnger periodthan has been possible in the reported here. Perhaps it should also be stressedthat in view of findings suggesting that active.questions are certainly not less helpfulthan provided questions, this is research that may be safely and profitably uiiclertaken. 9.15. SummaryQuestions were labelled active when framed by pupils, and provided when offered to.pupils as problems requiring' solution. The chief problem has been that of isolatingthe effects of provided questiOn&4 ,A-number-of studies investigating the effects of provided qeustions are mentioned-in the literature. The variables of location, frequency, contiguity, long-term retentionand incentive; have been studied in connection with provided questions, particularlyin:relation to Flothkopf's Mathernagenic or inspection behaviour hypothesis Post-queit' ions had been found to offer,greater faCilitative effects than pre-qUestions, and itwas suggested that questions folloWing one presentation provided a test-takingorientation for subsequent presentations. Pre - questions appeared to have had an inter-_feting effect by concentrating the attention of subjects upOn particular points: Whenquestions were frequently interspersed betWeen passages of prose material, the differencebetween pre -send post-questions favouring post-questions, was more pronounced. Theinhibiting effect of pre-qUestions could be carried forivard by means of rehearsal. Theadvantage of post over prequestions was dimi hed when incentives were given.. Thelong-term effects of provided .question ently followed the short-terM pattern.The main difficulty with the provided questions eXperiments appears to be thatquestions do not arise from the passages being studied. They are as modes ofrehearsing points within passages, and are possibly no more than restatements ofinformation in interrogative form. ,Useful studies investigating the effects of active questions appear to be rarebecause of a practical difficulty arising from the fact that procedures Used to elicit -questiOns almost invariably have their own effects upon the learning and retention ofmaterial.In,the course of project studies, the effects of the following variables upOn learningand remembering were investigated.:-(i)Provided questionsThese were questions framed by the experimenterand usually required\"answers.(ii)Active questionsThese were the pupils' own questions.(iii)Active and provided questions combined.(iv)Relevant active questions These were questions framed by the pupils,and compared with Provided answers. \u00b0395 (v):Reading, singie(vi)Reading, contextSex level of pupilsPupils read only the text material.Pupils read the text material after having read anon-specific summary.Pupils tried to supply a given word when offered aclue.imperative transformationsSentences to be learned were transformed intopassive, interrogative and imperative formsrespectively.Posttest sentences either Correspond to the textto be learned, or were transformed into the passive Pupilswere exposed to.successive presentations ofsimilar text material. In these studies, the dependent variables were:(i)Criterion scores on a completion task In the post-testS, pupils were required tocomplete sentences from which words had beenomitted. The number of senterces completedcorrectly was taken as a measure of learning andretention.(ii)'Pattern of scores over presentations --The posttests were divid2d into sectionscoreesponding to each of the presintations ofmaterial: Scores on these sections could differsystematically.When tasks were self-paced, the ar ount of timeSpent by pupils in reading and studying the differ-ent experimental materials was recorded.When tasks were self- paced; the amount of timetaken by pupils to write their own questions orgive answers to provided questions was recorded.(v)NUmber of questions asked.Questior s, whether active or provided, were found to be at least as helpful topupils learning prose material as other methods requiring` them to process the material.Active Questions were more helpful than a control, clue-solving task, when contextmaterial was also provided.Difficulty of material and itility level of pupils appeared to deterrriine thestrength of the challenge presented by a learning task, and hence the tendency to benefitfrom active questions. Boys and girls responded differently to this. Boys were- rn2re:sensitive to the level of challenge to their competence, deriving more help from activequestions When the material was comparatively 'more difficult.Retention interval operated differently for active and provided questions. Whereas(iii)Inspection and studytime (iv)Writing time 396 the benefits of provided questions were apparent in the short term, this was not alwaysthe case with active, questions, although in the long term, they were equally helpful,There was some evidence for supposing that pressure of time in the learning,'situation itself was also relevant. When time available to pupils was limited, there was'a tendency to use rote-learning strategies; and this operated.to the disadvantage of activequestions.With regard to presentations, meaningful differences eould be observed in thepattern of results, and it appeared that the mathernagenic behaviour (e.g. inspection,study and writing time) of low abiiity boys at least could be modified by the use ofactive, particularly relevant active questions.Some difficultY was experienced in the procedure to operationalize relevance,and results regarding the effects of feedback were inconclusive; but e position ofcontext, wheiher before or after related text, appeared to be imp tent. Higher scores .were obtained by pupils when context was provided after the ext; and it seems probablethat in this case the context acted to provide feedback to their questions.Active questions appear to have been helpful under certain conditions, andalthough further research in depth is warranted, the indications are that careful applica-tion of results already obtained could prove fruitful 9.4.

APPENDIX : STUDY V (9.2.8)A fuller report of the procedure used in Study V offered' as an illustration of the methods andtechniques used in the studies investigating active questions. Method SubjectsThe subjects were forty eight boys and girls, aged thirteen to fourteen years, taken from theupper two of five streams corresponding to ability and attainment in a neighbourhoodcomprehensive school. MaterialsA passage of moderately difficult prose was taken from the life of Alexander Hamilton in'Men of America' by Lionel Elvin. The passage, of approximately 900 words in totallength, was divided into six paragraphs of approximately 150 words each Correspondingto these full paragraphs, non-specific 'paragraphs were prepared. The Min-specific paragraphwas alShorter version' of the full paragraph, and was prepared in such a way as to suggestgaps in infOrmation. Pronouns were used instead of names; adjectival or adverbial qualities'were not specified; and events were referred to in general and indefinite terms. Gaps in'information.would be filled by the full paragraph. If.all the full paragraphs were readtogether;they formed a continuous whole passage. .Six lists of questions were'devisedbythe experimenter, and related to points inthe non-specific paragraphs were further information was needed in order to make completesense..All the questions could be answered from the full paragraphs but not from the non-specific paragraphs. These lists were the.provided qUestioris: Wits of answers to thesequestions were also prepared. .. .A brief pre-test comprised five sentences which subjects familiar with the topicmight be expected to complete without difficulty.The posttest took the form of six paragraphs from each of which ten words of highinformation content were excluded. This was accompanied by a list of these words presented in-alphabetical order. instructions at the head of the: test sheet included the words,'Read the TEST WORD LIST. Using words from the WORD LIST, fill as many blanks as-.poiSible. Some words can be used. more than once'.The above materials, excluding the posttest, were bound together in personalfolders for each subjectAubber bands held the sheets face downwards; and. instructionswere given that only one sheet was to be released and turned at a time.'Special clock was constructed in order to make it, possible for subjects to recordthe time to the nearest five seconds, at which they began and at which they finished eachsuccessive task. Its mechanism was that of a domestic pendulum clock, usually placed upona mantelpiece. The pendulum weight was removed so that the minute hand completed onerevolution in 15minutes. A special -face was cut from white perspex..24 inches in diameter,and letraSet figures 1% inches in length indicated units of time in fives from 5 to 180.Intervals of one unit of time,. approximately equivalent to 5 seconds, were indicated-by-7--.lines, etched to a length of %\" and filled with black paint. The hour hand was removed,but an alOminium extension was made' oIhe minute hand andcovered with black paint. 400 ProcedureSubjects were assigned to three treatment groups, matched for sex and verbal ability.Information regarding reading age and scores on the Raven's Standard ProgressiveMatrices test was available from the school. It was felt that the matching predureshould be based on the reading age result which appears to be more relevant When con-, sidering performance on a verbal learning task. However, when cell means were afterwardscalculated by using both systems of matching, viz. four subjects per cell, matched onreading age, and three subjects per cell matched on Matrices score, a highly significantcorrelation (r = .916, p <.001) was found.The three treatment groups were: -1. Relevant Active Questions. Subjects-first read non-specific paragraph No. 1, then wrotetheir own questions about the paragraph. They were instructed,'Look back at the NON-SPECIFiC PASSAGE. In.order to make sense of it, there arethings yoU need to know. Write as many questions as you can about the passage. You maywrite on both sides of this sheet'.Subjects were then required to check- the list of experimenter's answers, corresponding tothe first non-specific paragraph. Instructions were,'Check this list of answers and underline the ones which answer your OWN QUESTIONS.Underline any of /our own questions not answered here'. ...Subjects then read the full paragraph.This procedure was repeated for. the remaining paragraphs 2 6, and subjects werethen required to reread all the fullparagraphsTbefore--etiking for the post-test.2. Active Questions.. After reading the non- specific paragraph and writing their ownquestions, subjects read the full paragraph. They were then instructed,Put the NON-SPECIFIC PASSAGE (NSP.1 to 6) and the FULL PASSAGE (FP.1 to 6)side by side, and underline all the new faCti given in the FULL PASSAGE'.The rest of the procedure for this group was the same-as for the active questionstreatment group:PrOvided Questions.: After reading the non-speeific paragraph, subjects read the fullparagraph. Then they wrote answers to questions provided by the experimenter. These,answers were then checked against the experimenter's list of answers, subjects underlingall correct answers. The rest of the procedure for this group was the same as for the othertreatment groups. .Subjects were allowed to work in their own time As they began and completedeach page, they were required to make a note of the time indicated on the special clock.A brief training period sufficed to make subjects familiar with the clock face. Subjects,:began and finished the pretest together. When subjects had completed re-reading all thefull paragraph's, they were instructed to signal to the experimenter that they had done so,and they were immediately given the post-te\u00a7t. This was also'completed in their own time.___ -Treatment of ResultsScoring Precedure. At least four methods of scoring seemed possible:(i) A raw score, i.e. where subjects used the exact word which had already been decidedupon by the eXperimenter and which had been included in the list of words supplied tosubjects. MI A transformed response score, i.e. where, as in the case of the raw score, subjects used theexact word, but where the blanks to be filled occurred in sentences or phrases involving anactive-passive transformation.(iii) A difference score, i.e. the raw score corrected by the subtraction of the pre-test score.(iv)'A gross corrected score, i.e. the difference score corrected by the addition of responseswhich, though not taken from the list of words supplied to subjects, were_ not: incorrect.Spearman's rank-order coefficient of correlation was obtained for cell means usingall four methods of scoring. Table A9.1 Rank Correlations among Different Scoring Procedures Type of Score Type of Score(ii) Transformed (iii) Difference coefficient of correlation (rho) was highly significant (p <.001).-In view of evidence suggesting that subjects misunderstood instruCtiOnifegardingthe p're-test, it was felt that it would be safer to assume that familiarity with the topic wasrandomly-distributed throughout the groupi. The raw score, was, therefore, used toindicate the criterion for learning and retention. The transformed response score servedto give further information whiCh could also be treated statiitically.X2,!;.swere calculated on data set in contingency tables and grouped by number ofsubjects for Whom correct transformedresponse scores formed more or less than fiftyper cent of 'total raw scoreS. Treatment groups were separated in three ways: (a) threetreatments (b) Relevant Active Questions compared with the remaining two groups(c) Provided Questions compared with the remaining two groups.Three-way analysis of variance-was operated on the square root transformationof the raw scores:Treatments by Reading Ability by Sex (3 x 2 x 2) 'Means were compared and tested against the within-cell variance term. there were fourreplicates to each cell:Raw scores obtained on the first presentation were analysed separately, using asingle- factor designin_the,threeAreatments.-Means were-compared-and variance was operated on differencelcores calculatedby subtracting scores obtained On the first presentation from scores obtained on thesecond presentation. Means were compared and tested against the within treatmentsvariance term.Correlation coefficients were Calculated for each of the twelve experimentalgroups (i.e. High and LoW Reading Ability boyi and girls for the three treatments) with 402 the rank order of presentations one to six.Further analysis was suggested by results of the calculation of correlationcoefficients, viz. analysiS of linear trend(a) Considering the three treatments, boys only; High and Low Reading Ability..__(b) Considering the one treatment, Relevant ACtive Questions; boys and girls;High and Low ReadingAbility.Comparison was made by t-test between treatment groups.with regard towriting time, after an f test to establish that the pooling of variance was permissible.Three;way analysis of variance was operated on the number of questions asked rsby subjects in, the ACtive Questions and Relevant Active Questions Groups for treatmentsby Reading.

Results(i) ScoresThe analysis of variance (Table A9.2) indicated a significant Sex by Reading Abilityinteraction (p .05). With girls, High Ability-subjects obtained higher scores than LawAbility subjects, whereas the slight difference for boys favoured the Low Ability Subjects.This difference in direction in the case of boys was wholly attributable to the RelevantActive Questions group. This treatment group obtained significantly lower 'scores (p <.05)than Provided Questions` subjects in the case of High Ability boys, but the. difference forLow-Ability boys was slight None of the differences between treatments for Low Abilityboys was significant. -r.

Off-the-cuff CommentsIn the course of investigations such 3s ours we were sure to notice features of thebehaviour of Children that were not immediately relevanI to the focus of our enquiriesSome of these are worth mentioning, however, because they are relevant to children'slearning.Several can be captured in a caricature which would note that for many childrenschool learning consists of being able' to give those single answers to questions posed byteachers that will satisfy teachers.That our research seldom requiied single right answers helps to highlight thegeneral concern of children with answers rather than questions. When we asked childrenhow they would find out something they did not knoW, they were diitressed that theydid not already know the answers (Chapter 7). Similarly, the cheating reported. later inthe chapterwas geared to getting the answers right. The children were not enthusiastic.about developing efficient search strategies, nor did they appear to derive anysatisfiCtionfrOm knoWing or thinking up ways of finding outIt is easy tosee how such attitudes might deVeloP. After all;: most classroom -initiatives come from the: teacher, most questions come from the teacher (see Sinclair,.Coulthard, and Doughty, 1972,'for a review of relevant studies): Children are socialisedinto a passive role..,Fur many of the questions. directly posed by the teacher there arelikely to be single, right answers. Teachers make frequent use of closed questions andthose to which one word replies suffice. While it is necessary to check that learning istaking place aid while it is also necessaryto encourage a convergent approach to theacquisition of knowledge, it is to be regretted if the giving of right answers is all that isencouraged. It must be remembered that problem-solving in Ies task definition,analysis, procesaig, synthesis, and that answers to clearly fated q f estions areonly a small part of this activity: Knowing which question opose is a n essarycondition of ultimate success.That our children generally did not view such skills as %ialuable knowledge is:.inforturiate. Confronted with Our materials they could generate questions,but theydid not see this an achievement. They did not appear to think in terms of questionsgood and bad, important and trivial, efficient and inefficient (or eveninteresting and'boring?). They wanted to apply or have us apply judgements of correct and incorrect,right or wrong. It seems to be items that' can be so evaluated that are important`to them.Questions are not answers and it, is ansWers that count! \\The edUcational implications of this problem are discuss later, but we canmention briefly the methodological difficulties arising. Investigations into questionsthat children ask are intrinsically strange enquiries to conduct because the .respondentsare being asked todosomething odd. QuestiOns follow answers, not qUestiOnsQueStions arise from conflict and are intended to evoke a'reaction..Yet we ask whatquestionSchildren have. The activity they are now to engage. in is not seen by them ashaving any-value-It is pointless-Investigations that require subjects to:make pointlessresponses which they are unable to evaluate are not likely to yield useful results. 1-0(-1/415 ASSociated with the 'only-one-answer' mentality was a general absence of 'don'tknow' responses. Children seemed o be generally unwilling or unable to concede igneranCe;.they chose to guess. An unwillingness to concede ignorance is an unfortunate fault all tooprevalent in our society, and we can see how it might interfere with learning, especiallywhenone comes to fool oneself as well as others, but an inability to distinguish what oneknows from what one, does not know seemed.particularly dangerous. There is no needto complicate the issue with a lengthy philosophical digression into epistemology. We .are all aware.that some of our pretended knOwledge is mistaken. Also we know thingsthat we do not know that we know. Much of our purported knowledge is messy in that'. we are notreally Sure.of its status; However, there are things we are sure we know andothers of which we are sure we are ignorant. Curiosity arises at the borders between the-two. We can only be curious when we areaware of particular ignorance in a frameworkof knowledge. Questions locate gaps in knowledge; it therefore follows that where thecontrast between. knowledge and ignorance becomes too blurred, neither curiosity norquestions can arise. No one can acquire knowledge unless he has criteria for discriminat-ing knowledge from ignorancei.This is'why we were worried about 'knowledge' linked primarily to the judge-ments of authority rather tha to personal conviction. Ideally, both conditions should bemet. Teachers should be seen credible sources of knowledge, but their authority shouldbe in being correct and not in s atus.The catual conversation at clubs and on courses (Chapter 4) uncovered exampleswhere children had 'rejected' t it own beliefs in favour of the beliefs of teachers, butwhere the teachers had prov ubsequently to be wrong. There are two disturbingaspects to this: The first is that the original disagreementi about matters of facts were notresolved by the teachers making an appeal to other sources of evidence. The second isthat in the end the teachers suffered a loss of Credibility. If they'are'dogmatically wrongabout the date of Malplacjuet who knows what else of what they say isiuntrue?We also observed occasions where teachers would solicit answers from childrenbut only.allow as correct that answer which they already had in mind. Other sensible _and correct answers were acknowledged but deflected:or quickly negated. Where record-ings had been made, teacher's were quick to spot v4iat was happenNge disturbed, andresolved to take appropriate action. (Remembering the parableabout motes in eyes, I.was promptly, able to diagnose exactly the same egocentriim as pervasir characteristicof my own teaching. OCcasional tape-recordings of One's lessOns are a salutor'y source ofreminders about unintended limitations). Both these styles of behaviour fit the model ofresPonse-based learning mentioned earlier (Chapter 2.6 and 2.7). 1In Chapter 4 we examined some consequences of attendance at various courses.;The suggestion thatwe evaluate the success of'the Cross-cultural Week-end was welcomeand.the results showed measurable changes. The queStion that has to be posed, however;is why so feW courses are evaluated. If courses are arranged there are presumablyobjectives in mindor there should be Means are chosen to achieve these ends. Are .they satisfactory? Could they, be substantially improved upon?

Reportscould be filed both locally by Teachers' Centres or LEA's and centrally by such bodiesas the. Schools Council?These suggestions should not be taken to presume an obseSsion with evaluation. .Clearly evaluative procedures.could be bureaucratized to Such an extent thatthe coursesthemselVes might be rendered absurd. It is a plea,,not fpr an epidernicbut-for-a-serioUsattempt to check the actual value of course attendance. Neither should itbe presumedthat children should be asked how manynew friends they made, whether they.enjoyedthe..partya.orhow mucb_more confident they now on a Seven point scale..Thereis experiente and enjoyment to be had which would be diminished by probing interviewsandAnsistent questionnaires. But if courses have specifiable aims whose attainment can:be measured without.undue interference in the courses themselves, there should be someoccasional check on their success. 10.1.2. Questions: sincere and simulatedThe failure to construct cunning techniques for experimentally tapping genuine questionsmay have been. the big failure of the project. Or was it simply a misguided aspiration? Wecan note several points in favour. of the 'preferable interpretation.Given that the interest was in questions as an expreSsion of curioSity, then if .thedynamics of curiosity and boredom are reasonably represented in Figure 2.2. and ifthe list of functions of questions set, out in Table 2.1. has a measure of validity, we can. restaSsUrjd that the simplest approaches to the probleM of eliciting genuine-questions mustfail.hat no questions are eVoked in a situation may mean that there is no curiosity, butit could mean that other means of satisfying it are preferred. If questionsere elicited, theymay be fulfilling any one of a number of functions. This lack of reciprocal implicationbetiveen the two justified the switch to the analysis of boredom in Chapter 5. At :eastthe presence of boredom could be argued to bee reasonable 'ground for expecting an.absence of questions.- We have argued; particularly in chapter 6, that scime of the questions we obtainedmay have been more an expression of conformity to norms, of .a willingness to play the.role of helpful pupil, or of a calculated minimitation-of-troubie strategy than of any wish .to fill gaps in knOwledge. It might be argued that this may be true but derives from oursimple - minded methodology. Questions are usually spoken not written. They.are posedin individual rather than group settings. They are occasioned by a confrontation withsomething enigmatiC; often particular and concrete. They are not often prOvoked bythein verbal uniform of an abstract.generatconcept like 'The PoliCe'.QuestiOns asked are normally answered immediately rather than later and are a part of .a continuing dialogue. All these points have force. Taking note of them complicateiproceddies, bUt might help: -;.We could have followed children about trying-to remain unobtrusiye. Duffyplayed such a role in the Youth Club, but in eighteen months heard no questions. of anyinterest; adolescents just did, not ask knowledge-seeking questions. To have played. asimilar role within the confines of sChool might have been irifortnative, but at schoolchildren are 'pupils'. They knowwhat is role appropriate behaviour and can; if theychoose, -meet the expectations of teachers, asking questions when they judge it is right_to do so and not asking them when they judge they.should not While our situations 417 may be construed as requiring thechildren. to play a role, we must not iinagine that thereare other situations where no role is being played. Different roles perhaps, but still roles. \\An ethological approach would have sacrificed the controls needed.for comparisons to bemade, but, if these comments are yal id, they would have not necessarily provided anycompensatory advantages..We_could4taire-collected a series of objects or representations of events or ofobjects and shoWn or mentioned them to individuals in conversational settings in whichthe qUestions asked were answered: If we ignore the difficulties. of. projecting adolescentsinto a dialogue with a stranger, we would have still had two major difficulties to Overcome.The answers given to questions would have acted to influence subsequent queStions.Comparisons across individuals are immediately rendered.awkward if ndt impossible. Andonce one child from a class has been seen, we are projected into the problem of at theleast some leakage of information and hence a (continuously?) changing situation forsubsequent interviewees.:We believed these difficulties would be exacerbated by the issues already Mention:ed about the pupils' wishes to perform well apd get the answers right when this wasimpossible (10.1.1.1./. Another possiblity would have been to have taken children, into our confidendeand said why we were interested in onl y.their genuine questions. This wastried on oneoccasion, and the story told was greeted with devastated incredUlity:-'You mean some-one pays you to go round doing things like that?\"I es crazy!. The perspeCtive of theresearch workeiwas not one that the children found easy to appreciate.. In the Iasi analysis the defence ofour seemingly odd techniques would probablyhave to retreat behind the plea that there. is something logically and psychOlogicallysilly about the idea of eliciting questions which are products of Curiosity. Curiositysuggests spontaneity not contrivance; it is not amenable to tidy Control. And ifquestions are expressions of curiosity they will dermrid immediate answers; they arethemselves demands for responses. ...These consideratiOns may not be particulaily.seriouSeither for theory or foreducational prictice. They do not and did not prevent us from examining competenceatquestion-asking (Chapter 7), nor from finding out about Into might be asked what(Chapter 8), nor from seeing What the utility of questions as stimuli for learning mightbe (Chapter 9). Enough Studies have been done to enable unto tell a sensible story aboutcuriosity, boredom and questions-(Chapter 2)In practical terms the important .knowledge is not of what, but of how to find out!The idea that there are simple universal laws about what will stimulate curiosity ihchildren would be a perniCious Myth; if anyone were to believe it We have argked thatcuriosity-provoking stimuli can onlybe defined in relational and:not in.categorical terms.What is enigmatic will always depend on the current state of the knowledge and interestof-the perceiver.What is important then is that teachers should see that any generalisations aboutcategories of .objects that will evoke inquiry by children have to, be checked againstthe..children. It is invaluable to haVe many 'rules of thumb' about the predominating interestsof children of various ages, sexes, backgroUnd, etc. It is foolhardy not check theapplicability of such generaliSatiOlirtothe particularChitdreT-1 one is working with.Provided teachers have a range of 'materials and strategies for teaching specific problems .and are willing to engage in a diaidgue to establish the nature and value of what is to.. be learned, curiosity and boredom should be controllable. The principles as well as theirpractical realizations are the important features of the, maintenance of interest. 10.1.3. Social Class Comparisons in Secondary SchoolsThe results of the locally conducted investigations into questioning led us to abandonsocial class comparisons and to adopt experimental studiet at secondary schools incouncil estate catchment areas. We have mentioned some Of the reasons for this switch(chapters 6 and 7). An oversimplified-generalisation would claim that whereas thetheOretically expected social class differences in questioningwere generally establishedin primary schools, they were not in seCord'ary schools. This could have been because .early real differences have disappeared, or because methodological Or technical oversightsOr impossibilitieS obscured their operation. Only the latter are mentioned in this section.In the studies at secondary level we looked at class differences within schools,controlling for intelligence test scores. We could have ignored intelligence test scores,and we could have looked at differences across schools.If we had looked at differences acrossschools we would'have been open to thecharge that any differences found were a function of school environments and not ofsocial class. However, controlling for school leaves one open to the,criticism that thesamples of the social class groups will not be representativ.I.n.the bilateral System ofsecondary education, the majority of working class, especially lower working class,pupils'are in secondary Modern schools and their grammar school social class peersare deviant. Orilya small minority of middle class pupils are in secondary modernschools. While,it is true that.in the LEA in which most of the work was done hadSwitched to-a creamed neighbourhood comprehensive system; neighbourhoods arethemselves class-linked. In schools we used; the middle class were only'VerY lightlyrepresented. Even if there had been large.cOrnprehensives available, these would havemost likely been streamed, with consequent variation in 'culture' of streams and the'middle class:pupilsoverrepreSented at the top:The research wOrker is duly impaled on the horns of idilemma; whatever. hedoes can be criticised.

It can possibly be esCaped by'! sacrificing certain constraints r occasionally using large samplers: The smaller thesample the more likely it isIgis b 'deviant' in sol me way. If one moves to the level ofa national sample, one can at leait ay what.is happening in:the societyas,a wholeaswe did in Chapter 5.-Controlling or not controlling nintelligence test scores is but a special, caseof the problem. We know such scores are of c \\ lture free (Vernon,,1969). We knowthat within unknown limits,\u00b0they can be Cha .We know there is something wrong-headed aboUt theheredity environment contro ersy (Eysenck,1971;Jensen,.1969;Hunt, 1968; Robinson, the other ha \\d, psychology would be poorerlfit did not entertain a concept of 'intelligence' CO ,.'ved as wholly inherited potential 1 (See Butcher, 1968; Hebb; 1958).There are cases where it is appropriate to control for intelligence test scores. Onewouid be where differential 'intelligence' indexed by variations in scores could reasonablyserve as an explanation for differences observed. If there is a wish to know whether aninjection of nicotine affectsrates of learning material, and we already know that IQ scorespreditt different learning rates, it may well be sensible to control for,IQ acrossbur injectedand uninjectedgrown. Ori the other hand, if it was the relationship between nicotineinjections and weight lifting that was of interest, such a control would be odd. In somesituations rates and types of questions might well be a function of both 'immediate'intelligence and differential knowledge previously acquired through intelligence, but inothers this would not be so. Given the definition of questions in terms of knowledge gaps,then relevant knowledge is a necessary condition of gaps being present and some measureof 'intelligence' must have been a determinant of the acquisition of that knowledge. HoweVer;our evidence shows, for example, that twelVe year old pupils of 'average' intelligence Shouldbe as well equipped as those. of 'high' intelligence to ask questions about many topics. It isdifficult to see how differences in rates of questioning Could beexplained in terms ofintelligence. How often do we say that someone is curious or interesLed because he isintelligent?Developmentally, we would expect initial mastery of questioning skills to be linkedto intelligence. In so far as there is a developmental sequence, ,more intelligent childrenshould move faster through it, but once a skill is thoroughly mastered; differences in itsutiliSation are.untikely to be a function of intelligence. It is diffidult to see why this pointhas not been, argued beforeany criticism.of a study that has failed to control forIntelligente' needs to show how the variation found7Woulci be explained by the invocationof differential intelligence. 'Intelligence' must be unpacked in terms of operations and notwaved as a Magic wand. We haVe frequently controlled for intelligence test scores, partlybecause the mastery of the language skills under examination is likely to be related tointelligence developmentally, and-partly to disarm the critics. It is occasionally desirableto stack the cards against oneself in order to meet criticism on its home ground.As a final point, it may be as well to note IQ's of 100 at different ages are onlycoMparabre in limited:aspects. To obtain a score of 100 at fourteen should require greater ,intelligence than to obtain a score of 100 at age ten. The identity is relational only withinan age,cohort. Absolutely, knOfmedgeand abilities increase with age, a feature fully explicitin Piaget's theory, but heavily neglected in the individual differences tradition that aroseafter Simon and Bi'net.switched from thinking to pragmatism.In practical terms. this means that studies of social class comparisons with adevelopmental interest should normally include at least two' wo age groups, and possibiy morethan one. IQ group. (Ideally theiower IQ older age group should have the same operationalintelligence as that of the higher youngergroup.)The use` of such designs should help to sort what issubstantiVely related to thebehaviour being studied from what is only accidentally associated. We did not realise-theadvantages of the three way contrast until too late.In any case iheisoiated-excursiOn into training children (Chapter 7:5) should serveas attrthos who place too much weight on present performance as an index ofactual capaCity. A b ief set of guiding instructions was sufficient to enable a low IQ groupto behave like a high 16 group. Although it would be silly to place too much faith in thisinstance, it is quite possible that the questioning andproblem-solving skills of all childrencould be rapidly improved if deliberately taught 10.2 Conclusions 10.2.1 The Dynamics of Curiosity and BoredomBy the end of chapter 2,we had refined Berlyne's analysis of curiosity and boredom intoa general model of human behaviour which sought to represent the antecedent andconsequencesiofthese states and in particularto show,the conditions under which learning ;1'might be expected to occur. This model was subsequenthrsetirra-more general frameworkof child development that articulated the ideas and evidence of the cognitive developmentaland reinforcement principles approaches-We tried to show how the ideas of Piaget, Skinnerand.Bernstein would be combined.'We were subsequently able to examine and elaborate upon certain features of thisperspective. We did not find it necessary to makeserious.amendMents or reject it.--Duffy's analysis of the relationships between interest and perceived value and-.surprisingness on the one hand and between interest and questions and learning on the .,'other were consistent with model of the dynamics of curiosity advanced (Chapter 3).More messy field investigations (Chapter 4) were likewise supportive viz a viz curiosity,although questions asked failed to relate to other variables. In the study of mother-childexchanges we failed to find the expecteddepressed rate of questioning in working class. .children; but the results linking the rates of Child questioning and answering to the mothers'provision of cognitive meaning and her corrective and encouragement tactics providedstrong evidence fOr utility of the model advahced. Likewise with the correlates of boredomin Chapter b. Lack of 'parental interest and example, lack of teacher interest, poor academicperformance, along wilh aggressiveness, withdrawal, truancy, early leaving and generaldisenchantment With schbol all fitted into a self-perpetuating boredom Cycle. We havealready issued caveats about the questions analysed in Chapter B. .QueStions are the-weak point in the cycle, but we have indicated why this wouldbe expected to be the case and will be returning. to sthe issue later.. 10.2.2 Social Class in relation to Boredom, Curiosity. and QuestioningWe assumed that children develop their knOwledge through :the.interaction with theenvironment thatPiagetian theory cites'as necessary and sufficient. We argued that chronic.failures by socializing- agentSto make optimal learning conditions available to children.should retard this deiref 1651-helit. We further suggested that frequent, non-reward or actualpunishment applied to attempts to-find thingsbut would lead to a regression or suppressionof such efforts: TheSe views are given particular expression in Bel nstein's attempts.describe and explain social class differences in socialization practices. Bernstein dreWattention particularly. to the differential' use of language by members of the middle andlower working clasS. If Bernstein.is correct we would expect. questioning among lowerworking claSs children to becbme particularly suppressed. Such children should.lack theknoWledge to serve as a springboard for questions; they should be less concerned aboUtignorance, less skilled in the formulation of their questions and less concerned about the.sense and truth of the answers received. !Our evidence on boredom with school subjects shoWed this state to be stronglyassociated with social class. Further, the/big diffnces were.between the lower workingclass and the..remainder, just as. Bernstein would have to maintain. That social class is thesociologically important loCating factor is shown by the relative failure of boredom torelate to income.' * If we were to treat the rate of questioning as an index of curiosity; however, wewould have to reject the theoretical premisses. We were able to show class differences inmaternal interaction with their children, consistent both with findings of previous research(e.g. Hess and Shipman, 1967; Robinson, 1973b) and with Bernstein's Particular theoryand the more general reinforcement prinCiples approach (Chapter 4). Further; individualdifferences in maternal behaviour both within and across social class were empiricallyasso-CTifed-with-children's-rates-of.questioning-to-a_particularly_strong degree. Social class'differences intypes of question produced by children were consistent with the generalstory both in six year olds (C4apter 4) and more weakly in fourteen year old adolescents(Chapter 6).It would be rash to throw away the theoretical model because the upper, ratherthan lower, working class children in one study failed to show up one contrast expectedon one index of questioning.However, contrasts in rates of questioning to pictures in seven year olds (Heber,see. Chapter-7), to verbally presented topics in fourteen year olds (Chapter 6), in -twoversions of 'Twenty Questions' and to incongruous cartoons (Chapter 7) also failed toyield differences: In each case we had some grounds for being wary of the results cheating,difficulty iri.selectihg and possible deViance of sarnples, strangeness of testing Materialsand conditionsbut suspicion needs to be followed by clarifying evidence. While we judgeit better to retain a faith in the idea that conditions of administration did reduce the chancesof finding differences in sincere questions and can obtain some comfort from supportiveevidence, we are obliged to defer any firm decision. If a sample contrasted on social classgave the same, no difference inOne of the situations above; but carefully obterved naturalrates of questioning differed there would be support for the original position. If we couldshow that lower working :class adOlescents are generally 'cooperative' in experimentalsituations and in particular could show that their questions contain a higher proportion of'insincere' ones, the original story would be supported. Wootton in Aberdeen (1974) hasfound class differences in the spontineous'questiching rates of a small number of fouryear olds re;drded in natural settingi.Other possibilities should be mentioned. Perhaps the initial variation in treatment ,of questioning by mothers of different social class is insufficient to depress the vigour. ofthe push to resolve OOgnitive conflict alleged to be underlying intellectual development:-This is rendered unlikely because we were able to show strong associations between thebehaViour of motherschildren within class. It is unnecessary to argue that schoolsrevive the curiosity of lower working class children; since we have failed tOfind differencesbefore the children-go to School.Alas, there is also the possibility that the schools (or life experiences generally)erode or supplant the curiosity of. middle class children. Ih'Chapter 2 (Section'7.3) weargued' the case that middle class children could beCorne switched into schedules ofreinforcernent that encourage therrito purtuiresponse-based, coMing-top, examinationsuccess directed learning. Middle class adolescents, may be much too busy filling theirheadi with examination material to have time to be curious.

Adaptive problem-solving skills havenever beenencoilraged to develoP into the systematic efficiency portrayed in Piaget'sconcept of the formal operational thinker. .103 CONCERNS The last paragraph might be seen asa flexing up of the emotional muscles in preparationfor an apocalyptic frenzy. It will be helpful, however, to-focus back on questioning andcui iosity rather than to la'unch out into wider questioni of the directions in whicheducation is moving. What might be. one to what ends to harness questions to: acilitatelearning, to improve questioning skills and to encourage curiosity and reduce theboredom of school children?Prosser.has already summarised the educational, implications of. his ekperimentsinto questions as an aid to learning (Chapter 9.31, and here we need clb nc more thanremind ourselves of two main points. The efficacy of encouraging or providing questionswas a relational and not acategorical problem, being unnecessary when material was veryeasy and. irrelevant. when it wastoo difficult. Hopefully, classrbom occasions of the latter ,,are kept to a minimum, but this will not be so for the former. Once Children have graspedconcepts and are required to learn items under a heading they understand, 4. Germanstrong verbs, the counties of England, or the school rules, questions will not differ fromother attention maintaining rehearsal-encouraging devices in their power to aid learning.It is at intermediate levels of difficulty that questions are of use, and we must note that .although pupils' own questions had no short-term advantage over questions'providedexternally, in the long-term they were equally beneficial. In so far, then as it-is better thatchildren develop an independent mastery of teaching themselves, we'could argue thatchildren's own questions as aids; to learning be preferred, where this is both possible andsensible in terms of conditions and materials.10.3.1 Questioning SkillsWe have seen that elementary questioning commences with the beginnings of speech:By the time children enter school, most of them will have mastered the grammaticalrules for generating well-formed questions. What is still relativelY weak is the knoWledgeof when to ask the right question to gain the sort of answer required Clearly, it would besensible to check that children school have attained mastery of question fOrms.yests. --such as that of Bellugi (see Fibbinson & Rackstraw, in prep.) might well-be-ghienandelaborated on and subsequent instruction geared-to-tidying up outstanding deficiencies.Heber's data showing that the questions of middle class children are more likelyto be complex and conceptual and Arnold's (Chapter 4) and Prosser's (Chapter 6),similardifferences are presumably not peculiar to questions per se, but to language_mastery ingeneral:Both Rackstravi's and Freeman'tdata (Chapter 71-revealed a lower working class .deficit in generating questions tO fit answers, which is not whcilly unexpected in view of leo'o the earlier results which showed a higher inciOenCe of answers irrelevant to questions inIcioiver working class children.

We were able to improve skills in the understanding ofquestionanswer relationships very quickly using an artful puppet (Robinson 'and RackstpW,'.in mepl. ,-Just as the question-answer links of working class children.were less well establishedthan could be rapidly achieved, so were their interrogatory skills in 'Twenty Questions'.

As our-special analyiis of questions about sexualbehaviour showed;anestablished routine sensibly handled did not result in larking about;almost all questions were serious and sensible. Again, the teacher in charge was able topoint out that what might appear to be a facetious or cheeky inquiry may in reality be'deadly serious. We areprone to judge in the lightof our knowledge rather than thechildren's ignorance. Many of us can probably recall incidents at school where perfectlyserious answers from pupils.ware pounced on an insubordinate. We can probably alsorecall some very professional acting as well. .Creed's results can however, be used, to argue the case for the occasional availabilityof individual consultations arranged so as to allow child-teacher Interaction without the/pupil having to break peer-group norms.

They are certainlyworth trying both for specific and general matters and like All puddings the eating shouldbe informativeTheir enactment does imply a concern to teach what children want or think theywant to know, as well as to teach them what we think they need to know. Pupils areapparently able to store up questions that occur for handing in at a future date-Teacherscould help by having Question Boxes opened fortnightly on Thursday,afternoons. If somesimilar system were used sensiblY, it could help .to meet a number of the moans made bythe 'bored'. The bored should see their own questions as relating to useful rather than touteleis knowledge -.Boxes and sessions indicate that teachart are interested in their puOilsand willing to treattheM'as responsible. A little variety is added to, the perCeived day-to-day sameness.s,Additionally, the questions give teachers an opportunity to admit to the limitationsof their own immediately available knowledge, a useful means of enhancing credibility andauthoritativeness. Nothing diminishes authority as much as being wrong, yet unable orunwilling to admit it..There is no reason why teachers should actually provide answers to all questionsasked. Other piapils may know answers. These answers might differ. Ways of finding out*could be discussed. These could be acted upon.and evaluated. It might even be found thatseveral ways atclieveral answers were all sensible.QuestiOns either specific and general are a useful source of information for teachers 0 both for them pz ascertain where the boundaries of knowledge and ignorance are locatedand-what the interests of their pupili are Teachers may be surprised at the extent of thethfferences between what is the case and what they believe to be the case. With oriefstudygroup-we recorded small discussion groups of pupils with teachers, without teachers andordinary lessons.. The topics were particular poems. What surpriSed the teachers was thediscrepancy between their expectatiOns and what the pupils actually said whenalone. Theteachers focused on the insights and aesthetic qualities of the Omni and how these wereexpresied thriiiugh the linguistic units and structures. The children asked each other whatwords and clauses meant, happily commenting on the absurdity -orge.metaphors theywere interpretingliteralli. Odd references to links between events in the poems' and theirown experience mingled with criticism of of granter. 'You can't 425Z. f'start a sentence with 'And'.' The questions the children asked revealed the great gap between.vetiere they were and the lessons given. 10.3.3 BoredomThe difficulties schools experience lie partly in the diversity of the functions they are expectedto perform, and in the lack of a systematic analysis of the relationships between these functionsand the structures andresources available for realising them. Prisons are a sad and inconsistentmixture of-punishment, refoem, deterrence and the protection of society's members, muddlingalong in a mess. Schools are expected to prepate children for the next stage in education orlife, to socialize children into good citizenship, to categorize and select Children for differentschools and to diagnose and attend to welfare problems as well asmust perforce ignore all but theiastbut at-leastweoatiiriefition our smpathy the job a teacher.Ern-withinthe-lestfunction:the. hoolf have.tO resolve a necessarily continuingdilemna. On the one hand they are required to transmit increasingly large quantities of thefactual knowledge acquired by mankind, on the othethey are enjoined to allow childrenthe freedom to discoVer the secrets of the universe for themselves, interfering but mini-mally with this process. Regrettably and absurdly these extremes are set UP as alternatives,in spite of the fact that-the contrail confuses content anciinethod. As we have argued earlierthe decisions about niethod should be contingent upon prior decisions of what is to beteamed. It is absurd '.0 expect individual children to discover knowledge it has taken menthousands of years macCumulate. It is absurd to insist on rote learning of ununderstoodconceptt.Likewise, in terms of content, we can see that adolescents who are simply mines offacts are as hapless asthose'who are adaptive general problem solvers with no facts on whichto exercise their skills. 'Knowing that and 'Knowing how' are complementary not anti-thetical. How much and what of which involves a complex value- judgeient to be based oncurrent and estimatecifuture requirements of the meMbers of a society.Our immediate concern has been that `knowing how' is undervalued\\and under-taught in the very generalarea of problem-solving, a concept that embraces all subjects in .the currictlurn. Skills in knowing how to find out answers to questions and skills at-formu-lating questions are sadly neglected. But the development ofthese skills in a vacuum wouldbe even more silly than teaching children to read without them seeing any point in doing so!They can only sensibly be acquired if they are seen to be of use in solving problems children .are interested in.solving. This is not to say that the problems have to have only the attributesof value or relevance or the ctiriositY-arousirig features of conflict mentioned in Chapters2 and 3: But they will not be ffiluired if children are bored. .If nearly thirty per cent of secondary school children are bored by at least thirtyper cent of the subjects they are studying in school, we have reason to be dissatisfied. Theminority is too wbstantial, to be ignored, and we have to ask ourselves what steps might betaken to improve-morale We susoect that the aspirations of the Plowden and, moreparticularly, the Newson reports have not, yet been translated into practice and it is'difficult ,to see why not There may be a self-perpetuating boledom cycle like thatreprefented in Fig. 5.1 and it may be endemic in the lower .\"irking class, bin it doesnot havel0 be so. Both parents and pupils may see what goes on in the school as Lifeless.and irreleVant. They are unlikely to change their minds., The teachers may judge thesituation to be hopeless; It is true that it is likely to be a slow and arduous task for them 426' to change the situation, but they are the only force that can. We have suggested that ifthe curriculurn in secondary schools were seen to be relevant and valuable, the pupilswould.learn. It would seem sensible to try to persuade the pupils that the curriculum isrelevant and valuable. Why then do teachers not justify the curriculum? Do they thinkthis unnecessary? Are they unwilling or unable? If it is argued that it is unnecessary, thisis either an insult to the intelligence of maturing adolescents or a serious error of judge:ment: It would be insulting to the teachers to suggest they are unwilling. If they areunable, is this because they have not or are not taking steps to. find out why_the-curricuiumis as it is? Or is it that these steps_have been-taken-Welt* themselves judge thecurriculurn-tOliiof no value? If thii last is true, how can pupils be expected to see thevalue of what they are required to learn if their teachers do not? It would not be surprisingthat classroom interactiondegenerates into problems of control if no one present sees anypurpose in any other activity.We would suspect that the Wit and last reasons both have need to be investigated:It would be well worth examining the consequences of explaining the rationale a! thesyllabUs to pupils. It is urgent to find out how many teachers are themselves unable tojustify what they are teaching, and if it emerges as one might expect, then there will needto be some yigorous discussiOn and decisions, whose sense should be tested against theconsumers' learning, untll,we arrive at curricula that re-engage the enthusiasm of thebored for knowledge. When teachers are convinced of the worth of what.they are teaching,they are likely to be credible. If they are credible,-the pupils should come to believe them.And when the pupils are persuaded,,of the value of the knoWledge they are to acquire,they may strive to master it. .REFERENCES Bruner, J.S.,& Austin, J.A.
