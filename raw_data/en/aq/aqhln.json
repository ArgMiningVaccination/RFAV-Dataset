We provide compassionate care in more than 75 communities throughout California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington. Adventist Health entities include: 20 hospitals with more than 2,700 beds More than 260 clinics (hospital-based, rural health and physician clinics) 15 home care agencies and seven hospice agencies Four joint-venture retirement centers Workforce of 32,900 includes more than 23,600 employees; 5,000 medical staff physicians; and 4,350 volunteers We owe much of our heritage and organizational success to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which has long been a promoter of prevention and whole person care. Inspired by our belief in the loving and healing power of Jesus Christ, we aim to bring physical, mental and spiritual health and healing to our neighbors of all faiths. Every individual, regardless of his/her personal beliefs, is welcome in our facilities. We are also eager to partner with members of other faiths to enhance the health of the communities we serve. Our commitment to quality health care stems from our heritage, which dates back to 1866 when the first Seventh-day Adventist health care facility opened in Battle Creek, Michigan. There, dedicated pioneers promoted the \"radical\" concepts of proper nutrition, exercise and san itation. Early on, the facility was devoted to prevention as well as healing. They called it a sanitarium, a place where patients \u2014and their families \u2014could learn to be well. More than a century later, the health care system sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church circles the globe with more than 170 hospitals and more than 500 clinics, nursing homes and dispensaries worldwide. And the same vision to treat the whole person \u2014mind, body and spirit \u2014continues to provide the foundation for our progressive approach to health care.

We recognize that health status is a product of multiple factors. To comprehensively address the needs of our community, we must take into account health behaviors and risks, the physical environment, the health system, and social determinant s of health. Each component influences the next and through s trategic and collective action improve d health can be achieved. The Community Health Plan marks the second phase in a collaborative effort to systematically investigate and identify our community's most pressing needs. After a thorough review of health status in our community through the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) , we identified areas that we could address through the use of our resources, expertise, and community partners. Through these actions and relationships, we aim to empower our community and fulfill our mission, \"to s hare God's love by providing physical, mental and spiritual healing.\" Identified Community Needs The results of the CHNA guided the creation of this document and aided us in how we could best provide for our community and the most vulnerable among us. As a result, St. Helena Hospital Clear Lake soon to know as St. Helena Hospital Clear Lake has adopted the following priority areas for our commu nity health investments for 2017 -2019: Healthy Behaviors Clinical Care Social & Economic Factors Physical Environment Additionally, we engage in a process of continuous quality improvement, whereby we ask the following questions for each priority area: Are our interventions making a difference in improving health outcomes? Are we providing the appropriate re sources in the appropriate locations? What changes or collaborations within our system need to be made? How are we using technology to track our health improvements and provid e relevant feedback at the local level? Do we have the resources as a region to e levate the population's health status? Building a healthy community requires multiple stakeholders working together with a common purpose. We invite you to explore how we intend to address heal th challenges in our community and partner to achieve change . More importantly though, we hope you imagine a healthier region and work with us to find solutions across a broad range of sectors to create communities we all want for ourselves and our families . COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 9 Together Inspired Community Profil e How our community is defined Lake County is located in Northern California just two hours by car from the San Francisco Bay Area, the Sacramento Valley, or the Pacific Coast. The county's economy is based largely on tourism and recreation, due to the accessibility and popularity of its several lakes and accompanying recreational areas. It is predominantly rural, about 100 miles long by about 50 miles wide, and includes the largest natural lake entirely within California borders. Lake County is mostly agricultural, with tourist facilities and some light industry. Major crops include pears, walnuts and, increasingly, wine grapes. Dotted with vineyards and wineries, orchards and farm stands, and small towns, the county is home to Clear Lake, California's largest natural freshwater lake, known as \"The Bass Capital of the West,\" and Mt. Konocti, which towers over Clear Lake. Within Lake County there are two incorporated cities, the county seat of Lakeport and the City of Clearlake, the largest city, and the communities of Blue Lakes, Clearlake Oaks, Cobb, Finley, Glenhaven, Hidden Valley Lake, Kelseyville, Loch Lomond, Lower Lake, Lucerne, Nice, Middletown, Spring Valley, Anderson Springs, Upper Lake, and Witter Springs as displayed on the map below. Lake County is bordered by Mendocino and Sonoma Counties on the west; Glenn, Colusa and Yolo Counties on the east; and Napa County on the south. The two main transportation corridors through the county are State Routes 29 and 20. State Route 29 connects Napa County with Lakeport and State Route 20 traverses California and provides connections to Highway 101 and Interstate 5. According to California labor market data about county -to-county commute patterns (which have not been updated since 2000), the total workers that live and work in Lake County is 15,566 persons: the total workers commuting in was 1,046; and 4,320 total workers commuted out. About 67% of people who live in Lake County also work within the county. While the population size of Lake County was estimated as 64,918 residents in January 2015, the population can swell with daytime work commuters and seasonal tourists. Demographics of the community Approximately 30% of all Lake County residents live in the cities of Clearlake and Lakeport while the remainder lives in unincorporated areas. The population of Lake County has increased modestly overall since the 2000 Census, with most of the growth occurring outside of the two cities (Table 3). Table 3. Population Estimates of Lake County Cities COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 10 Together of California, Department of Finance, E-4 Population Estimates for Cities, Counties, and the State, 2011 -2015, with 2010 Census Benchmark . Sacramento, California, May 2015. City/county population estimates with annual percent change between January 2014 and January 2015 show slight growth for the county overall .The two cities, however, saw a slight decline in population between the two time periods. In 2010 three -quarters of Lake County's population identified themselves as non-Hispanic White, 17.2% as Hispanic, 3.1% as multi -race, 2.4% as American Indian, 1.9% Black, 1.1% Asian and 0.2% as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; less diverse than the state as a whole. Lake County's population is projected to become increasingly culturally diverse in coming years with significant growth among Hispanics, Asians and multi -race individuals. The Hispanic population is projected to more than double, Asians to increase four-fold, and persons identifying as multi -race to almost double from 2010 to 2060. Conversely, the proportion of non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, and American Indians will decline. The shift in Lake County population groups has implications for designing and delivering needed services in ways that are culturally and linguistically appropriate. Lake County's senior population is projected to grow at a disproportionate rate, while its proportion of young and working age people declines. The working age population (age 25-64) is expected to shrink by 10% by 2060. In 2010, 17.8% of the county's population was 65 or older compared to 11.5% statewide. It is predicted to nearly double and comprise almost one-third of the county's population by 2060. California's senior population is also expected to double, but to only comprise about one -quarter of the total population. In Lake County, the proportion of people age 75- 84 is projected to double, and for people 85 and over to almost triple. The anticipated significant growth in this age group will put a larger burden on the health care system and local economy, which may not have sufficient community services or tax base to support it. Priority Areas Priority Area 1: Mental Health While risk and protective factors vary, individuals, families and communities are impacted by mental disorders in endless ways \u2014health status, income, family stability, suicide risk, to name the more important ones. People have different ways of coping with mental and emotional distress \u2014some healthy (exercise, worship), some not (drug use) \u2014and different extents of support systems. Social and economic determinants of mental health demand public health and population -based strategies to prevent and manage common mental disorders in the community. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 11 Together Inspired Priority Area #2: Substance Use Disorders Experts indicate that an optimal mix of prevention interventions, as well as treatment resources, are required to address substance use issues in communities, because they are among the most difficult social problems to prevent or reduce. Priority Area #3: Access to Programs and Services This priority area addresses a range of access concerns from inadequacies in infrastructure to lack of community awareness. It was clear from the community input to the CHNA that so many people in Lake County were unaware of the many health, educational, and social services and programs that are already available (though not always affordable or convenient). Priority Area #4: Housing and Homelessness The vast majority of homeless individuals and families fall into homelessness after a housing or personal crisis. These households may require only short -term assistance to find permanent housing quickly and without conditions. Others fall into homelessness after release from institutions, including jail and the foster care system. Still others come to homelessness from mental health programs and other medical care facilities. Early intervention to prevent homelessness is a critical component in treating mental illness before it can cause serious results like unemployment and chronic homelessness. Suggested strategies for Lake County could include: Year -round sheltering that includes families with children. Social programs that connect vulnerable populations with emergency services, temporary cash assistance, and case management, many of which already exist in Lake County. By and large, homeless individuals can access mainstream programs, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medi -Cal and other existing federal assistance programs. Financial and other support or assistance to achieve housing stability and individual well -being. This can also minimize the length of stay in shelters and reduce repeat homeless episodes. Housing locator services that include incentives to landlords to rent to hom eless households, creative uses of housing vouchers and subsidies to help homeless individuals and families afford their rental unit, and links to resources to help clients maintain their housing. Low-demand housing that does not mandate sobriety or treatm ent. It is well recognized that many people living on the streets exhibit mental illness, substance addiction, and other negative behavior patterns. Information gaps There are several ways to present data just as there are multiple ways to identify health needs: by age group; by issue or problem; by ethnic group; by systems (hospitals, clinics). The CHNA examined the published community health indicator data commonly collected in community needs assessments (referred to as \"secondary data\"), added to it, and highlighted populations and issues of interest where the data already existed. Where data were available by more than one variable (for instance, age and racial/ethnic group) they are generally presented. Having baseline data from the prior asse ssment allowed us to add certain trend data in the current report. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 12 Together Inspired Using secondary data requires collecting information from many sources. Data availability varies among different data sources; new data are continually being released. Any report of this t ype will soon have certain data that are not the most up -to-date. (For example, data from CHIS, the California Health Information Survey, which is a rich data source for community health needs assessments, is generally not released until about 2 years afte r it is collected). Also, reporting periods can vary by calendar year, frequency and fiscal year; consistency varies, especially over time and among agencies and organizations; and data are not always collected in the format that is best suited to the purp oses of the report. The CHNA relied on data that could be collected and analyzed to determine if and to what degree a problem or need existed. In some cases, data did not exist that directly applied to a certain need or condition; in other cases, no indic ators were readily available to describe a potential need. The community input process (referred to as \"primary data\") provided some opportunity to identify such needs and ensured that they were considered in the priority -setting process. The availability (or lack) of services can substantially influence reporting. Some data were not collected, such as the availability of services from private medical groups, and therefore could not be counted in the capacity assessment. In some cases, statistics and infor mation that others compiled have been included in this report. However, it was not always possible to authenticate all of that data. In some cases, expert opinion was included in the analysis regarding the state or condition of a certain issue. And, while recommendations to address unmet needs were identified by participants in the community input process, there was no attempt by the Collaborative to evaluate these suggestions for appropriateness or endorse them relative to best practices and evidence -based effectiveness. Finally, no one data set in this report really tells the whole story about Lake County's unmet or under met health needs; all of the data collected by this process \u2014the statistics, feedback from the community questionnaire, focus group inpu t and key informants' perspectives \u2014collectively paint the picture. It is therefore suggested that readers consider the entirety of the findings when drawing conclusions or making policy changes and funding decisions. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 13 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Community Health Needs Assessment Overview Link to final CHNA report St. Helena Hospital Clear Lake approved the 2016 CHNA in September 2016 and made it publicly available on the St. Helena Hospital Clear Lake website in October 2016. Click here to view the https://www.adventisthealth.org/pages/about -us/community -health -needs -assessments.aspx . Methodology for CHNA Collaborative Process To engage community partners and maximize the efforts of this community health assessment, invitations were issued to individuals, organizations, and Tribal representatives to serve as the project's Advisory. In addition to providing overall guidance and helpful insights, the members supported the community engagement strategies, helped to increase awareness and mobilize the community, and facilitated participation in community input activities. Data Collection Community needs assessments involve gathering, analyzing and applying data and other information for strategic purposes. These methods provide the necessary input to inform decision makers and funders about the challenges they face in improving community health, and the priority areas where support is most needed. The information is also useful for community organizations by having comprehensive, local data located in one document. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect the information for this assessment. Secondary Data: Publicly Available Statistics Existing data were collected from all applicable existing data sources including government agencies (e.g., California Department of Health Care Services, California Department of Finance, Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, California Health Information Survey and other public and private institutions. These data included demographic, economic and health status indicators, and service capacity/ availability. Where trend data were readily available, they are presented in this report. While data at the national and state level are generally available for community health -related indicators, local data \u2014from counties and cities \u2014are less accessible and sometimes less reliable. For example, small sample sizes can result in statistical \"instability,\" and well-meaning data collection methods without appropriate \"rigor\" may limit the value of the findings. Because data from publicly - available sources typically lag by at least 2 years \u2014because it takes time for reported data to be received, reviewed, approved, analyzed, and prepared for presentation \u2014data may not always be as current as needed. And, some data may only be reported as 3-year averages, not annually. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 14 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Document Review A document review was undertaken that collected relevant information about the community, health status, where health services are obtained, other related services, and gaps in services. This information was found in documents and records of facilities such as data from local clinics and state government, reports from needs assessments conducted related to health, and reports about specific health programs or services. Primary Data: Community Input Input from the broad community was considered and taken into account when identifying and prioritizing the significant health needs of Lake County that are addressed in this assessment. This rich source of data was obtained through key informant interviews, focus groups and a community health survey. Community Survey A survey was developed in English and Spanish that solicited people's opinions about most important health needs, barriers to access care , and suggestions for community health improvements. Certain questions that serve as markers for access to services were also included. The survey was distributed in hard copy by members of the Collaborative to locations where the groups of interest would best be reached, such as at branches of public libraries, laundromats, churches, nail salons, and family resource centers throughout the county, as well as promoted through efforts such as at the 2-day Valley Fire \"Rebuild Expo\" in Middletown and over the air on KPFZ's \"Senior Moments\" show. The survey was also available online (English only) and notices about the electronic version were posted on the County's and various organizations' websites and in newsletters. All of the electronic and hard -copy survey data were cleaned, coded, and entered into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS Version 20.0. Community Focus Groups Three communities \u2014Clearlake, Lakeport and Kelseyville \u2014ensured geographic representation at the 6 community focus groups that were conducted. Key community -based organizations and social clubs were identified by the Collaborative and invited to host a focus group. In each case, the focus groups were co- scheduled during a time the participants were already meeting there for other purposes (e.g., young mothers attending a Mother -Wise parenting meeting) to facilitate access and promote attendance. Although the participants constituted a convenience sample, there was the expectation that in the aggregate the groups would be diverse and include the populations of highest interest. A common set of structured key questions was used for all groups (Attachment 2). The questions were generally open -ended; prompting with information or data was limited to reduce the potential for bias or leading of participants to any conclusions. Participants were not asked to \"vote\" or otherwise rank the items they identified as needs, problems or solutions. The focus group data were recorded on a flip chart or notebook by the facilitator during the meetings then transferred to written summary formats where the notes were then coded for analysis. A $20 Safeway gift card was offered in most groups in appreciation for participation. The agencies and organizations that sponsored the community meetings helped to publicize the sessions and promote attendance. Key Informant Interviews Telephone interviews using a structured set of questions (with additional, personalized questions to obtain more in-depth information) were conducted with 12 of the 16 invited individuals who agreed to participate in COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 15 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope a key informant interview (Attachment 3). The interviews provided an informed perspective from those who work directly with the public and/or determine some of the policies that affect the community's health. These individuals were able to offer information about local resources and gaps in services, high -priority health needs, and suggestions for positive change. The interviews also focused the needs assessment on particular issues of concern where individuals with certain expertise could confirm or dispute patterns in the data and identify data and other studies the Collaborative might not otherwise be aware of.

Located in Lakeport, the health center advocated for a public transit bus stop at the clinic site and provides a van to assist patients in accessing services. Services are provided for individuals regardless of their ability to pay. The health center provides medical, dental and counseling services. The clinic reports that almost one-third of its patients have some form of chronic illness and the overwhelming numbers of these individuals have multiple disorders. Services include: comprehensive primary care medical services including physical exams, chronic disease management services, health maintenance support, vaccines, immunizations, incision/drainage of cysts, outpatient HIV testing and care, well-child care, CHDP exams, addiction medicine, and screenings for anemia, lead, vision, hearing and tuberculosis. Additionally, the clinic provides services offsite to seniors in skilled nursing facilities and to the homeless. Lakeview Health Center's program continues to integrate primary medical care and behavioral health counseling for patients with difficult problems like addiction, mental illness and chronic pain, tobacco use and obesity. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 16 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Comprehensive dental care is provided by dentists on site. Special programs include HIV dental care, oral health care for pregnant women and oral care for the developmentally disabled. Sutter Lakeside Hospital Sutter Lakeside Hospital operates a community clinic and a family medicine clinic. Community Clinic The community clinic in Lakeport provides comprehensive primary care for adults and children. Preventative care, vaccinations and physical exams are provided as well as more specialized services including osteopathic care, cardiology, sports medicine, obstetrics and gynecology and integrative medicine. The clinic also cares for those with long -term medical conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease. The community clinic opened in 2014 and reported 5,762 patient encounters for that year. Family Medicine Clinic The Family Medicine Clinic is located in Lakeport at the site of Sutter Lakeside Hospital. Currently the clinic provides cardiology, podiatry, family practice and employee health. Clinicians also offer general medical care including physicals, general illness care, vaccinations, and wellness visits. The Family Medical Clinic is open from 8 am to 5 pm on weekdays. St Helena Hospital Clearlake The hospital provides medical, dental and mental health services at family health centers located in Clearlake, Middletown, Kelseyville, Hidden Valley Lake and Lower Lake (Konocti Wellness Center School -Based Clinic, onsite at Konocti Unified School District). In addition to physicians, services are provided by a certified nurse - midwife, nurse -practitioners, licensed clinical psychologists and clinical social workers. The 3 clinics combined provided 81,269 patient encounters in 2014. Public Health Services The Lake County Public Health Department offers a variety of programs at its Lakeport office. These services and programs are described below. California Children's Services (CCS) The California Children's Services (CCS) program is available for children with certain physically - handicapping conditions. The program provides diagnostic evaluations, treatment, nursing case management services, physical and occupational therapy for eligible children (0-21 years of age) related to their eligible medical condition. The CCS program also has a local Medical Therapy Unit for Physical and Occupational Therapy for eligible clients. . Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) Program Administration Administrative oversight of a program that provides for free periodic medical and dental health check - ups for infants, children and youth through age 20 if program eligible. If further medical, dental, or mental health services are needed, the Department can assist with scheduling and/or transportation information. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 17 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program Nursing case management services are offered at no cost to a family when a child has a confirmed elevated blood lead level. Other program activities include community outreach and provider education. Clinical Services There are no clinical services currently available at Public Health. Communicable Disease Communicable Disease Surveillance services are conducted to collect reports and monitor reportable communicable disease data to identify local needs and to control disease outbreaks. Dental Disease Prevention One of the Public Health Nurses helps to convene the oral health advisory committee. Emergency Preparedness Lake County Public Health prepares for natural and human causes of disasters and disease threats, working collaboratively with other emergency responders, healthcare facilities, and local citizens in order to serve the community. Lake County's Public Health Preparedness and Response program focuses on planning the response to disease threats, such as influenza pandemics, bioterrorism, and health hazards associated with natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, wildfires and others).

Only the paper copy of the survey was available in Spanish . A total of 768 surveys were completed, 67% online and 33% on paper. Five (1%) of the hard -copy surveys were completed in Spanish. These percentages are within 5% of the 2013 community health survey responses. A total of 96 individuals attended one of the 6 community focus groups. While no one group was expected to be representative of Lake County, in the aggregate the groups reflected a diversity of residents, particularly those with needs most often addressed by community needs assessments. All of the groups were English - COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 19 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope speaking, and overall women and men were represented in fairly equal numbers. The participants were typically 40-65 years of age, although two groups had a predominance of older adults and one was comprised mostly of young adults. The focus groups were held at a variety of host organizations. Focus group participants were asked to make recommendations for \"improving the health of people in the community,\" including suggestions about the kinds of services they would like to see added, expanded, or improved in Lake County. The facilitators did not prompt the responses but reminded attendees of the significant health needs they had earlier identified; in only about half of the groups the participants tied their recommendations to the top health needs. There was little consistency in the above listing of recommendations among the groups: 5 of the 22 ideas were made by 2 of the 6 focus groups; the remainder of the ideas was suggested by only 1 group. The 5 common recommendations related to: Preventive nutrition -related education Preventive health education aimed specifically at youth Activities to involve and engage children and youth Mental/emotional health counseling Inter -agency collaboration What was given little attention across the focus groups in the recommendations, given the importance of the needs the participants had identified earlier, and that might have been expected to be advocated for (and which were also significant concerns in the last CHNA), were recommendations related to: Alcohol and other drug treatment and recovery services. Dental services for low-income, especially limited scope of adult Denti -Cal benefits. Affordable wellness centers, particularly with closure of Sutter Lakeside Hospital's Wellness Center , mentioned by several participants in a couple of the groups. Transportation challenges and its impact on ability to get to work, keep medical appointments, and engage in social and recreational opportunities. Medical provider recruitment and retention, particularly for more in-county medical specialist services. Sixteen key informants were identified by the Steering Committee, and 12 (75%) agreed to participate in an interview. The interviews, which were conducted by telephone, generally lasted an average of 45 minutes. The key informants generally represented a cross -section of the Lake County health and human service community that in addition to health care professionals from public and community -based organizations also included policy makers, administrators, and other individuals with an informed perspective about unmet health needs. While most of the interviewees spoke to the issues they knew best from their professional roles, many were also able to consider and describe additional health -related needs when prompted with questions to help them think about population characteristics, geography, political landscape and other factors that influence community health and access to services. Interviewees were asked what they thought were the 3 most significant health problems/needs in Lake County that needed more attention. They were not prompted with a list of top-ranked needs from the previous CHNA or from regional and local statistical data but asked for their perspectives about this as an open -ended question. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 20 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope The interviews yielded fairly consistent results with the community survey and focus group responses conducted for this assessment except for transportation, which received more attention as a problem by the key informants. Most of the identified needs directly tied to the perceived challenges in Lake County they described. Nearly all of the items had been identified as problems in the previous 2 CHNAs. Two of the highest need issues \u2014substance abuse and community -based mental health services \u2014received mention by at least three -quarters of the interviewees. Food (as a resource issue for low-income families) and nutrition and affordable health care for non-insured/under - insured were not indicated in the list of significant needs this time. Substance Use/Abuse Key informants identified substance abuse as across the board needs for: prevention education (e.g., school children and youth, parents); training (e.g., medical providers who over -prescribe painkillers); stronger enforcement (including of growing and selling); treatment and recovery services; and efforts to change societal norms and make it \"not OK\" concerning underage drinking, tobacco use, alcohol abuse and legal and illegal drugs. When asked, most interviewees perceived the problems to have worsened (\"the problem is severe\") and tolerance higher (\"people do these things for a reason. What are they trying to self-medicate from?\"), despite various programs, services and campaigns. Mental Health Community -based mental/emotional health services received the second -most common attention as a serious unmet health need in Lake County. As in the last CHNA, the observations included the lack of affordable individual and family therapy and support groups for people experiencing chronic stress, anxiety, depression and poor coping skills. It was also noted that some of these mental health situations that end up in the emergency department could have been avoided with adequate access to community -based therapist services. For those with more acute needs, the lack of local inpatient placement beds continues to require out-of-county placement, generally by ambulance (impacting local availability for ambulance services). The association between mental health problems and substance abuse (\"there is a mental health component as an underlying cause\") was noted by 3 of the interviewees. A couple individuals remarked that more support was needed to support children continuing to experience emotional stress from the 2015 wildfires. Further comments that highlight the needs and system deficiencies included: \"Mental health is missing so many people because of the funding structure.\" \"It's painful to watch people deteriorate to the level where they're eligible for the County's mental health services.\" (The County's funding for mental/behavioral health services is understood to be available only for the most severely mentally ill.) \"County Mental Health won't accept some of the severe mentally ill. It's almost useless to refer.\" \"Lots of single parent families could sure use even a little help [with coping] to get over a hump.\" \"A significant percentage of the law enforcement calls are related to mental health.\" COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 21 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Preventable and Chronic Health Conditions Getting people to adopt healthier habits was mentioned by 4 individuals as one of the top health needs in the county, with the problems of obesity and diabetes as the most common examples. A couple of people commented that it was hard to get some people, including \"those who need it most,\" to attend health education sessions/events (\"the population is so diverse, not everyone wants to take advantage of free programs;\" \"they aren't interested unless it benefits them;\" \"people are too busy raising kids\"). Health Access Despite greater access to health coverage for more people (through the Affordable Care Act and enrollment of Medi -Cal beneficiaries into managed care [Partnership Health Plan]), provider capacity because of unwillingness to accept public insurance continues to be a concern. Key informants described the access problem relative to physicians as retention as well as recruitment. The problem, similar to other small counties, is largely due to the attractiveness of cultural opportunities and greater earning potential in larger cities (\"despite the county's lower cost of living\"), a wish to practice nearer a university medical center, and a desire to live elsewhere because of the \"lack of professionalism\" and \"poor reputation of the county.\" In addition to medical services, one of the key informants identified the need for affordable dental services among the county's highest health priorities. Although all of the interviewees understood that Lake County's economic base could not support all or a sufficient range of specialty services, those who ranked this a top concern believed more should be done to attract and retain the most critical specialists, which in their view included orthopedic surgery, ENT and psychiatry. Transportation The need for better transportation options, mainly concerning client travel to medical appointments (\"the routes aren't user friendly for medical services access\"), seniors' access to social opportunities, and young people to recreational and other activities, was identified as a top priority by 4 of the 12 key informants. (Note: transportation challenges were perceived to be a top concern in only 1 of the 6 focus groups.) Concern was also expressed about health and safety in relation to \"dangerous road conditions\". One interviewee pointed out that the public transit system \"takes all day if you're going to use it\" as the reason there were \"no takers for the bus passes some organizations give out.\" Additional Comments Related to Significant Health Needs Additional input from the key informants that did not always tie to specifically identified need issues but expressed themes that would be important to consider when prioritizing implementation strategies include the following: \"It's not necessarily that the problems are getting worse, it's that we're running out of time to address them [losing a whole generation of children in the meanwhile].\" \"The Tribal groups struggle with all of these health issues the most.\" \"Lack of jobs is a huge issue equating to hopelessness.\" \"It's a vicious cycle: people don't have the skills, have difficulty finding work, can't find work that is COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 22 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope meaningful, can't keep the job, get discouraged and lack motivation to try again, and the cycle starts all over again. It starts with doing what it takes to keep children in school, motivated, engaged, healthy.\" \"There's a defeatist attitude because of gangs and crime in Clearlake so we write them off. How do you re-enfranchise them? How do you break this cycle?\" \"There's a large subset of anti-establishment/anti -government types \u2014a whole cultural and support network of these people \u2014that are more apparent in rural areas because of small population size, and this bleeds over into people's perception of Lake County.\" COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 23 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Identified Priority Needs from 2016 CHNA Identified Priority #1 from 2016 CHNA Healthy Behaviors (Access to services , Housing and Homelessness, Substance Use Disorders ) Goal Increase healthy behaviors by increasing the number of and access to programs and education services offered to all families and individuals in our community resulting in a 10% improvement in county health statistics.

We lift up the role of community and community organizations as vital settings that create the conditions of health. W e also understand the importance of non -medical resources in communities that promote well -being and prevent disease. Excellent medical care alone is not sufficient to create healthy communities. In order to create a healthy Lake County, we must work with others to create health -promoting physical, social and economic environments. Supporting and leading collaborations is one important way we live the Adventist Health Mission of supporting physical, mental and spiritual health and wellness, and maintain our commitment to do nothing in a silo, outside of partnership. Short -term Objective : Create community partnerships Interventions: 1.

COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 32 Together Inspired Making a difference: Evaluation of 2014 -2016 CHP A Time of Recovery In the summer of 2015, as the current CHNA was being rolled out, Lake County experienced the devastation of several momentous wildfires, including the Rocky -Jerusalem and Valley Fires. Nearly one -third of county residents experienced evacuations during the Valley Fire, 4 deaths occurred, and nearly 2,000 structures burned including approximately 1,300 residential structures. In the fall of 2016, during the ongoing recovery from the Rocky -Jerusalem and Valley Fires, Lake County suffered the Clayton Fire. Thi s fire caused the evacuation of St. Helena Hospital Clear Lake for 64 hours. The community lost an additional 300 homes and 12,000 residents were evacuated for one week. The long -term effects of these traumatic events on the health and well -being of Lake County are still being assessed and remain to be seen. Along with Public Health and other community partners, Lake County hospitals are pivotal for having a collaborative role in engaging the community and implementing community health improvement strate gies. Drawing from the implementation strategies, Sutter Lakeside Hospital and St. Helena Hospital Clear Lake developed strategies in response to the immediate preceding CHNA identified priorities and the Hospitals and other Lake County organizations imp lementation those strategies to address the significant health needs (Table 1). In many cases these activities were not new because the problems were not new; the grave need for more mental health support, for instance, continues to be a significant issue. The resources committed and the progress made by the partners since the 2013 CHNA continues to move the county in a positive direction despite such unforeseen events as the horrific wildfires of 2015. The 2013 CHNA became the common impetus for strategic action and collective impact in Lake County. Many collaborative initiatives were instituted since that time and remain ongoing, including: Wellness Roadmap Hope Rising The Healthy Clearlake Collaborative Healthy choices/healthy behaviors Community Wellness Projects Clearlake Food Pantry Food Hub Wellness RX Lake County Hunger Task Force Lake Family Resource Center Farm to School Climb to the Peak of Health Mental health and well being St. Helena Hospital Clear Lake, in identifying mental health as critical need area: Created a new position through an initiative with Partnership Health, a huge asset to its medical team.

Partnership is not used as a legal term, but a description of the relationships of connectivity that are necessary to collectively improve the health of our region. One of our objectives is to partner with oth er nonprofit and faith -based organizations that share our values and priorities to improve the health status and quality of life of the community we serve. This is an intentional effort to avoid duplication and leverage the successful work already in exist ence in the community. Many important systemic efforts are underway in our region, and we have been in partnership with multiple not-for-profits to provide quality care to the underserved in our region.

Total number of people served: 261,637 COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 39 Together Inspired Connecting Strategy and Community Health As hospitals move toward population health management, community health interventions are a key element in achieving the overall goals of reducing the overall cost of health care, improving the health of the population, and improving access to affordable h ealth services for the community both in outpatient and community settings. The key factor in improving quality and efficiency of the care hospitals provide is to include the larger community they serve as a part of their overall strategy. Health systems must now step outside of the traditional roles of hospitals to begin to address the social, economic, and environmental conditions that contribute to poor health in the communities we serve. Bold leadership is required from our administrato rs, healthcare providers, and governing boards to meet the pressing health challenges we face as a nation. These challenges include a paradigm shift in how hospitals and health systems are positioning themselves and their strategies for success in a new pa yment environment. This will impact everyone in a community and will require shared responsibility among all stakeholders. Population health is not just the overall health of a population but also includes the distribution of health. Overall health could be quite high if the majority of the population is relatively healthy \u2014even though a minority of the population is much less healthy. Ideally such differences would be eliminated or at least substantially reduced. Community health can serve as a strategic platform to improve the health outcomes of a defined group of people, concentrating on three correlated stages: 1) The distribution of specific health statuses and outcomes within a population; 2) Factors that cause the present outcomes distribution; and 3) Interventions that may modify the factors to improve health outcomes. Improving population health requires effective initiatives to: 1) Increase the prevalence of evidence -based preventive health services and preventive health behaviors, 2) Improve care quality a nd patient safety and 3) Advance care coordination across the health care continuum. Our mission as a health system is to share God's love by providing physical, mental and spiritual healing and we believe the best way to re -imagine our future business model with a major emphasis of community health is by working together with our communit y. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 40 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Financial Assistance Policies Adventist Health (AH) facilities exist to serve patients. They are built on a team of dedicated health care professionals - physicians, nurses and other health care professionals, management, trustees, and volunteers.

For each health need, the CHP must either: a) describe how the hospital plans to meet the identified health need, or b) identify the health need as one the hospital does not intend to specifically address and provide an explanation as to why the hospital does not intend to address that health need. 3.Community Benefit: A community benefit is a program, activity or other intervention that provides treatment or promotes health and healing as a response to identified community needs and meets at least one of these objectives: Improve access to health care services Enhance the health of the community Advance medical or health care knowledge Relieve or reduce the burden of government or other community efforts Community benefits include charity care and the unreimbursed costs of Medicaid and other means-tested government programs for the indigent, as well as health professions' education, research, community health improvement, subsidized health services and cash and in-kind contributions for community benefit.
