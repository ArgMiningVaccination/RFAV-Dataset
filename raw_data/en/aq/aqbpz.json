{"title": "Paul Chek - \"In the future, the soul will be eliminated by medicine. On the pretense of health, there will be a vaccine whereby the human organism will be treated as soon as possible, possibly directly at birth, so that the human being cannot develop the awareness of the soul and the Spirit. \"Materialistic doctors will be entrusted with the task of removing the soul from humanity. Like today, people are vaccinated against specific diseases, so in the future, children will be vaccinated with a substance that will immunize against the 'madness' of spiritual life. The vaccinated person could be very clever, but would not develop a conscience, and that's the real goal of some materialistic circles. \"With such a vaccine, you could get the etheric body to detach from the physical body. When the etheric body is detached, the relationship between the soul and the universe becomes extremely unstable and man an automaton, because the physical body of man must be polished on this Earth by will and by spiritual effort. So, the vaccine becomes a kind of force that rivets consciousness to matter. Man can no longer get rid of materialistic feeling. It remains animal by constitution and can no longer rise to spiritual conscience.\" Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) Steiner's words are worth meditating on DEEPLY... NOW.
