However, the vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective for under-18s, with benefits outweighing risks, according to leading authorities on health. A clip from a GB News interview has been shared widely on Twitter ( [here](https://twitter.com/EsqHumbug/status/1472501450546819075) and [here](https://twitter.com/ZeitgeistNZ/status/1472378699215376388)) and at the time of publication has been viewed more than 125,000 times. Other versions have been shared on Facebook ( [here](https://www.facebook.com/DarrenofPlymouth/posts/137986221932727) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=293459469459373)) and the whole interview can be watched [here](https://www.bitchute.com/video/dYaLExqwee8/) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpYocpWc3yw&ab_channel=GBNews) (timestamp, 38:58). During the interview, Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist and immunologist says he does \"not regard them (the vaccines) as safe particularly in children\". \"The risk-benefit ratio is completely upside down. More children will die from these vaccines than will be saved. The data are quite clear,\" he tells GB News presenter Neil Oliver. Leading health authorities told Reuters, however, that there is no evidence COVID-19 vaccines are causing child deaths. Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which \"closely monitors\" COVID-19 vaccine safety in under-18s, told Reuters that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines \"continue to outweigh the risks in the majority of people including individuals under 18\". The MHRA concluded a positive safety profile for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds following a \"rigorous review\" of its safety, quality and effectiveness in the age group ( [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-mhra-concludes-positive-safety-profile-for-pfizerbiontech-vaccine-in-12-to-15-year-olds)). Alison Cave, the MHRA's chief safety officer, said: \"To date there have been over 3.5 million vaccinations administered to under 18s. \"No new safety concerns have been identified following use in children since the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines in both UK and international COVID-19 vaccination programmes and the vaccines remain safe and effective to use in this population. \"COVID-19 presents a substantial risk of harm to at least a small proportion of children, in particular those with underlying conditions and in rare cases children have sadly died.\" She also flagged the long-term effects of COVID-19 in children which she said include rare but serious cases of inflammatory syndrome as well as \"long COVID\". Professor Jeffrey Morris, the director of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania (here), told Reuters via email: \"As far as I've seen, the only established risk for youth is the myocarditis risk that is primarily to young men. \"I haven't seen any evidence of pediatric deaths caused by vaccines, or even evidence that myocarditis in youth is leading to much serious disease or long-term problems.\" The MHRA previously told Reuters ( [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-coronavirus-britain/fact-check-very-low-number-of-under-18s-with-myocarditis-after-covid-19-vaccine-idUSL1N2SO1XA)) that instances of myocarditis among under-18s following COVID-19 vaccination are \"very rare\" and typically mild, with individuals usually recovering within a short time with standard treatment and rest. When contacted by Reuters to provide evidence of his claim that data shows COVID-19 vaccines will kill more children than they save, Dr. Malone said the information could be found at [here](https://www.rwmalonemd.com/mrna-vaccination-in-children) and associated tabs therein. In the supplied link, Dr. Malone cites a report titled: \"Why are we vaccinating children against COVID-19?\" published in the \"Toxicology Reports\" journal ( [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221475002100161X)). The paper claims COVID-19 vaccines \"carry a risk/benefit ratio of five deaths in the older, high risk cohort for every one life saved from COVID-19\". The paper relies heavily on data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which documents suspected reactions to COVID-19 shots to detect possible safety issues. Reported incidents are not evidence of a causal link, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which manages the database with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ( [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vaers.html)) . Prof. Morris said the paper's conclusions are \"severely flawed\" and \"completely driven by the assumptions\" made about background death and underreporting rates, inferring virtually all deaths reported to VAERs are caused by the vaccines ( [here](https://www.covid-datascience.com//post/evaluating-claim-in-peer-reviewed-toxicology-reports-article-vaccines-kill-5-for-every-1-save)). Prof. Morris also questioned the legitimacy of the report's peer-review process ( [here](https://www.covid-datascience.com//post/evaluating-claim-in-peer-reviewed-toxicology-reports-article-vaccines-kill-5-for-every-1-save) and [here](https://twitter.com/jsm2334/status/1443300430801481731)), likening it to a \"commentary\" instead of a scientific paper, given the senior author was originally listed as handling editor. The article was later revised to list a different handling editor ( [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8410220/)), who Prof. Morris says is a regular collaborator of the senior author. In his response to Reuters, Dr. Malone also pointed to a video ( [here](https://www.canadiancovidcarealliance.org/media-resources/the-pfizer-inoculations-for-covid-19-more-harm-than-good-2/)) and presentation ( [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/617d909092cd2314e37ebe67/t/61cd2981c928c169030d37d6/1640835524685/The-COVID-19-Inoculations-More-Harm-Than-Good-REV-Dec-16-2021.pdf)) from the Canadian Covid Care Alliance as evidence. However, one of the group's references is the \"Toxicology Reports\" paper. The Canadian Covid Care Alliance presentation also makes a range of assertions based on Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial report ( [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345)), including that the vaccinated group had \"an increase in illness and deaths\". However, the \"illness\" detailed includes all adverse events including local reactions such as arm pain, and systemic events such as fatigue. Few participants had serious adverse events or adverse events that led to withdrawal from the trial, the study says. Meanwhile, according to Pfizer's study, none of the deaths among trial participants were \"considered to be related to BNT162b2 by the investigators. Causes of death were balanced between BNT162b2 and placebo groups.\" Reuters previously addressed the claim that COVID-19 vaccines kill more than they save, finding COVID-19 vaccines are not causing more deaths than they prevent [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-coronavirus-usa-idUSL1N2QP18K). VERDICT COVID-19 vaccines are considered safe for under-18s, with benefits of vaccination outweighing risks, according to health authorities. Instances of myocarditis among young people after vaccination are very rare and typically mild. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
