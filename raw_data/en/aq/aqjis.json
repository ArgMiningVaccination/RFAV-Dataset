The rising costs of pain care and managingadverse effects of that care have prompted action from state andfederal agencies including the DOD, VHA, NIH, FDA and CDC. There is pressure for pain medicine to shift away from reliance on opioids, ineffective procedures and surgeries toward compre-hensive pain management that includes evidence-based nonphar-macologic options. This White Paper details the historical contextand magnitude of the current pain problem including individual,social and economic impacts as well as the challenges of painmanagement for patients and a healthcare workforce engagingprevalent strategies not entirely based in current evidence. Detailedhere is the evidence-base for nonpharmacologic therapies effectivein postsurgical pain with opioid sparing, acute non-surgical pain,cancer pain and chronic pain. Therapies reviewed include acu-puncture therapy, massage therapy, osteopathic and chiropracticmanipulation, meditative movement therapies Tai chi and yoga,mind body behavioral interventions, dietary components and self-care/self-ef cacy strategies.Transforming the system of pain care to a responsive compre- hensive model necessitates that options for treatment and collab-orative care must be evidence-based and include effectivenonpharmacologic strategies that have the advantage of reducedrisks of adverse events and addiction liability. The evidence demands a call to action to increase awareness of effective nonpharmacologic treatments for pain, to train health- care practitioners and administrators in the evidence base of effective nonpharmacologic practice, to advocate for policy initia-tives that remedy system and reimbursement barriers to evidence-informed comprehensive pain care, and to promote ongoingresearch and dissemination of the role of effective nonpharmaco-logic treatments in pain, focused on the short- and long-termtherapeutic and economic impact of comprehensive carepractices.

The prevalence of pain is highdespite costly, well-intentioned medical responses, which relymainly on pharmaceuticals and high-tech interventions. Painand aspects of current pain management strategies are havingenormous deleterious impacts on patients, the health systemand society. 1,2From the 1970s to the 1990s there was hope that new drugs, more liberal use of opioids, new technologiesand a growing understanding about the mechanisms of painwould reduce the occurrence of uncontrolled pain. This wasnot the case. Growing rates and escalating costs of pain-related morbidity, mortality and disability have led to calls forculture change in pain medicine by The Of ce of the Army Surgeon General Pain Management Task Force (PMTF)Report, 3Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now the National Academy of Medicine, NAM),1,2Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee 's National Pain Strategy4and others. Government leaders have declared the opioid crisis anational emergency. The recommendations consistentlypromote a shift toward a more comprehensive, patient-centered and health-focused approach to pain patients. Inthis model, collaborative care is team-based, interdisciplinary,and involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologicapproaches. The model af rms the essential role patientshave in improving their own health and pain-relatedbehaviors. There is a growing recognition that currentconventional medical treatment may not be the beststarting point and is often not suf cient. In addition to inadequately addressing pain there is increasing evidence thatconventional treatment strategies are fueling the opioid crisis,according to a National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA)report citing one in three Americans used prescriptionopioids for pain in 2015. 5Moreover, evidence-based nonpharmacologic approaches may be the more appropriateinitial treatment for acute and chronic pain management. Currently, there is no clear roadmap for a comprehensive approach to pain management that includes evidence-basednonpharmacologic strategies. The goal of this white paper is tooutline the role of evidence-based nonpharmacologic strategiesfor the management of pain and how they can best beintegrated with conventional approaches. This integrative painmanagement approach is in alignment with the stated goals ofthe reports from the Of ce of the Army Surgeon General PMTF, NAM, National Academies of Science, and the NIHNational Pain Strategy. How pain is assessed, managed andtaught to health professionals must be updated. A shift isessential to address the immense deleterious impact that painand the current system of pain care, including opioid reliance,have on patients, the health system and society.

Recent estimates for the cost of pain care fall inthe vicinity of $560 -635 billion annually. 1This exceeds the annual expenditures for heart disease, cancer and diabetescombined, the nation' s priority health conditions. 6The IOM report estimated over 100 million American adults suffer fromchronic pain. This gure is likely an underestimate of America 's overall pain burden, as it does not include children, nursinghome residents, ac tive military, or those in prison. 1,2The prevalence of chronic pain conditions in the general adult USpopulation is estimated to range from 11 -47% in large sur- veys. 1,6-11Low back and neck pain, osteoarthritis (OA), and headache are the most common pain conditions in the US andare leading global causes of disability in 2015 in most countries. 12 Unfortunately, we can expect the chronic pain burden toescalate. A 2013 National Academy of Sciences report predictspain prevalence will rise as chronic illnesses increase. 13For example, neuropathic pain currently affects over six millionAmericans and is expected to rise dramatically due to theincreasing prevalence of diabetes. Obesity is also increasing andis associated with risk of diabetes, neuropathy and orthopedicproblems. 1Inadequate postsurgical pain management strategies for the increasing numbers o f ambulatory and outpatient surgeries have resulted in chronic pain. As surgical, anestheticand pharmaceutical interventions save lives in cases ofcatastrophic injury and life threatening illness there is anotherg r o w i n gc o h o r to fp e o p l ew h oa r el i v i n gw i t hc h r o n i cp a i n . 1 Although pediatric pain statistics are less well studied, a system- atic review of the epidemiology o f chronic pain in children and adolescents found that \"persistent and recurrent chronic pain is overwhelmingly prevalent in children and adolescents and shouldbe recognized as a major health concern in this population. \"14The most common pediatric chronic pain complaints includemigraine, recurrent abdominal pain and general musculoskeletalpain, including limb pain and back pain. 15Depending upon the population surveyed and time frame of the survey, prevalenceestimates for pediatric chronic pain range from 4 -89%: headache (8-83%), abdominal pain (4 -53%), back pain (12- 24%), musculoskeletal pain (4 -40%), and \"other \"or general pains that included recurring earaches, throat pain. 14 Impact of pain: individual, work place and employer health costs The impact of pain is felt at many levels ranging from the effectson the individual, families, the healthcare system, employers andthe community at large. Chronic pain is a high-impact disruptorof lives and economies. It is complex \u2014physically, neurologi- cally, psychologically, socially, spiritually, economically andsymbolically. 16For the individual, there may be decreased physical functioning and increasing dif culties with simple daily and self-care activities.17These changes can have an effect on psychological health, with an increase in sadness,worry, anger, depression, suici dal thoughts and a reduced sense of self-worth with changes in abilities. 18For children, there may be an impact on school performa nce, school attendance and interactions with peers.14,19For both adults and children, pain negatively effects social functioning and relationships. As a resultof alterations in work capacity, people in pain have lower hourlywages and miss more time from work than those without pain. 6 In some cases pain leads to the need for work modi cations or disability claims. Pain is associated with impairment in physicaland psychological functioning, 12,20lost work productivity21and lower socioeconomic status.22In addition to the costs and time needed for seeking care, people with pain conditions havesigni cantly higher direct healthcare expenditures. 6 Opioid abuse/dependence impact on health care costs Among the distinctions of the current epidemic from earlier opioid abuse epidemics is that this crisis, having been based in medical prescribing, is disproportionately affectin g white, middle-class people in nonurban settings, including those with private insurance.23 \u0081 2007-2014 opioid rose by insured.23 \u0081 2011-2015 privately insured opioid abuse or dependence charges rose from $72 million to $722 million.24 \u0081 Allowed amounts for opioid abuse/dependence healthcare services grew more than 13-fold during the same period, from $32 million in 2011 to $446 million in 2015. \u0081 In 2015 the average annual per-patient charges and estimated allowed amounts by insurance were more than ve times higher for patients with diagnoses of opioid abuse or dependence than for those with any diagnosis. \u0081 In 2015 private insurers and employers providing self-funded plans paid nearly $16,000 more per patient with a diagnosis of opioid abuse or dependence than for those with any diagnosis.24 \u0081 2006-2010 emergency department (ED) visits related to prescription opioid poisoning increased to 259,093: over half were hospitalized resulting in over $4 billion in costs.25 \u0081 ED visits for pediatric opioid poisoning between 2006 and 2012 numbered 21,928 with over $81 million in total charges.26 \u0081 From 2007-2014 pregnancy drug dependence diagnosis (including prescription opioid) rose 511%.23 \u0081 From 2003-2012 neonate abstinence syndrome (NAS) admissions increased more than fourfold with annual costs growing from $61 million to nearly $316 million.27 \u0081 Hospital stay is 3.5 times longer for NAS neonates compared to non-NAS neonates, with a threefold increase in cost.27 \u0081 A sizable percentage of the driving public has detectable levels of opioids in their blood28with opioid impaired driving implicated in motor vehicle accidents.29 These costs and risks are substantial and yet fail to measure the costs to the health and wellbeing of society: communities, families, friendships and individuals. Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 179Economic impact of pain The US spent 17.8% of it's GDP on healthcare in 2015,30 expected to increase to 20% or higher by 2025.31A signi cant portion of that is pain related since pain is the most commonand compelling reason for seeking medical attention. 32,33 \"The economic burden of prescription opioid overdose, abuse and dependency is estimated to be $78.5 billion each year inthe United States \". 34Social Security Disability Insurance statistics suggest that worker disability from musculoskeletaland connective tissue disorders is rising, not falling. Workdisability attributed to musculoskeletal and connective tissuedisorders increased from 20.6% 25.4% in 2005 35to 31.7% in 2015.36In addition to worker disability there are direct and indirect workforce nancial costs including both workplace absenteeism2and lost productivity from ill and injured workers while stillworking, called presenteeism. 37,38There can be lost business opportunities and reduced customer goodwill due to workthat goes undone and deadlines, meetings, appointments orengagements missed due to employee absence or reducedcapacity. The Integrated Bene ts Institute (IBI) conducted a landmark and ubiquitously cited survey in 2005: nearly allCFOs surveyed (343 senior nance executives) reported that they will focus on controlling health plan costs over the nexttwo years because they believe that work time lost toemployee illness including chronic pain is reaching criticallevels and is affecting business performance. 39A majority will seek to manage all health-related costs, including absenteeismand bottom-line effects as key impacts of employee ill health.IBI also found, however, that CFOs are ill-informed abouthealth-related lost work time. Nearly half of surveyrespondents never receive reports about \"incidence of absence, \"and less than a quarter receive reports on its nancial impact. Far fewer know about presenteeism with nine in ten never receiving reports on the incidence or impactof presenteeism in the organization. Cost savings from improving worker health requires new record keeping strategies. One of the most signi cant new research models is the extension of return on investment(ROI) analyses to include economic outcomes resulting fromhealth interventions such as performance and productivity.For example, while very few newly approved pharmaceuticalsactually save money, they can improve health at a reasonablecost. In pharmacy literature, net increases in spending that areup to $50,000 may be deemed acceptable or cost-effective ifthese dollars will save at least one quality-adjusted year of life(QALY). However, this widely accepted methodology hasrarely been used when considering the value of healthimprovement programs. 40By contrast, the more demanding objective of realizing net savings has generally been requiredin evaluations of health and productivity managementprograms. 41Companies with successful wellness programs, with improved health-related and economic outcomes,encouraged wellness to improve employees 'lives not only to reduce costs. 42Furthermore, employers and payers need to realize that bene ts of investments in health accrue over time, and there may be a lag between improvements in healthand savings from improved productivity. Standardcalculations of documenting ROI may need to becomemore sophisticated to capture net cost savings in theintermediate and long run. The current workforce literature is inadequate to evaluate the speci c role of pain as distinct from overall illness. The literature on work-related injuries such as back, neck andupper limb pain covers a subset of pain problems but doesnot capture data on such pain-related conditions as arthritis,autoimmune disorders, and diabetic and other neuropathiesthat are not work related. The current lack of clarity of clinicaland especially cost implications remains to be resolved byfuture, more rigorous studies conducted at worksites overmultiple years with adequate follow up times to determineboth clinical and cost bene ts. 43,44Ongoing studies seek to develop best practice models for business analysis outcomes.Recent reviews con rm that companies that invest in worker health and well-being, including through health-promotionprograms, have markedly improved stock price performancecompared to the Standard and Poor 's 500 Index (S&P). 45,46 Similar savings have also been observed through healthpromotion programs among individuals who are retired andon Medicare. 47 Health disparities and pain: race/ethnicity, genderand agePain and pain care impact speci c socioeconomic and demographic groups differently. Increased vulnerability topain is associated with having English as a second language,race and ethnicity, lower income and education, sex andgender, age group, geographic location, military veterans,cognitive impairments, surgical patients, cancer patients andthe end of life. 1Many of these same groups are also vulnerable to pain treatment that is limited in access andscope. 1,2,48In addition to factors such as age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender and geography, education andhealth literacy also in fluence access to kinds of care and to care outcomes. For example, while back pain is common across all primary care populations, low-income, racially diverse individuals are impacted differently. African Ameri-cans have a lower likelihood than whites of receivingcomprehensive pain assessment and management. 48African Americans may also receive less intensive diagnostic andtreatment approaches compared to white patients. 48For occupation-related back pain, whites are more likely to bediagnosed with disc herniations and have surgery than blacks;yet a nonspeci c diagnosis and lack of surgery uniquely predicts lower treatment expenditure and disability ratingsfor African Americans. 49Perversely, it is possible that this disparity in care provides an advantage to those AfricanAmericans who might ostensibly be considered\"undertreated \": less treatment for back pain may be better treatment. 35 This does not, however, erase the sting of discriminatory care. Episodes of major lifetime racial discriminatory events are thestrongest predictors of back pain reported in African Americans,with perceived day-to-day discrimination being the strongestpredictor of back pain for African American women. 50 Racial discrimination as a predictor of pain is consistent withthe impact of social context and its interrelationship with 180 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Carechronic pain.51Older African Americans experience severe mismanagement of pain and potentially inappropriate or dangerous medication duplication or interactions, particularlythose with comorbidity, multiple providers and limited access. 52 Patients of lower socioeconomic status and lower healthcareliteracy are less likely to be able pursue effective healthcareoptions not typically covered by insurance. There is ongoingresearch to assess how disparities in health care and outcomesoperate along ethnic and socioeconomic lines. A recent reviewof long-term survey data indicate that racial/ethnic disparities inpain may be in part accounted for by socioeconomic status andeducation level \u2014both factors that interact with race and ethnicity. 11 Hispanics are at higher risk for pain and pain undertreat- ment given the incidence of lower education, income levels,and lack of health insurance and/or access to care. Thesedisadvantages are further compounded when there is limitedEnglish pro ciency that impacts communication with health- care providers. 1American Indians and Alaska natives have markedly higher rates of pain symptoms compared to USgeneral population, 53with high rates of diseases and health conditions such as diabetes, arthritis and obesity that producesignicant pain. 1Despite this, American Indians report minimizing pain complaints and not readily asking for help,likely exacerbating disparities through underdiagnosis andundertreatment. 54Asian Americans have overall lower pain prevalence than non-Hispanic whites. However, the variety ofnational origins, cultures, languages and ethnicities lead tovariations within this group. Lower reports may be due to ageneral reluctance to report pain (perceived as a sign ofweakness) and a fear of side effects of pain medicationcombined with the potential liability of lower Englishprociency and the experience of cultural bias by health professionals. 1 In every ethnic/racial category, women are more likely than men to report a wide range of chronic pain conditions1,55,56 while pain prevalence varies for women by age and race/ethnicity. 57Women experience disparities in pain care with misdiagnoses, delays in correct diagnoses, improper and uneventreatment, gender bias, stigma and neglect, and dismissal anddiscrimination from the healthcare system. 1,58Women report greater severity, longer-lasting and more frequent pain than men,and also experience multipl e pain problems. Women are prescribed opioids and benzodiazepine sedatives at higher ratesthan men. 59,60While men are more likely than women to die from prescription opioid painkil lers, the percentage increase in deaths since 1999 is over vefold greater among women.61 Between 1999 and 2010, about 18 women died every day inthe US from a prescription opioid overdose. For every womanwho died of an overdose, there were 30 who went to theemergency department for painkiller misuse or abuse. 61 Chronic pain in children is often underrecognized1and even when recognized is still undertreated, with consequencesthat include behavioral changes and adverse effects on childdevelopment. 62While both boys and girls are more at risk of chronic pain as they get older, girls report chronic pain moreoften than boys. 14,63Undertreated pain is also common among hospitalized children.64There are many levels atwhich children may receive disadvantaged care.65Many pain medicines have not undergone clinical trials or beenapproved for pediatric use and consequently providers aremore reluctant to administer them. The prevalence of chronic pain among independent living older adults ranges from 18% to 57%, depending on thedenition of chronic pain. More severe pain and pain that interferes with activities increases with age. 1Additionally, there may be dif culty assessing pain in older adults with cognitive impairment. Side effects of drug treatment mayfurther adversely affect their cognitive function and overallhealth. 66-68 Easy access to opioids as the main pillar of pain care can be viewed as inadequate or \"disadvantaged \"care based on the lack of evidence for safety or effectiveness for chronic noncancer(CNCP) pain. 69,70This is further reinforced by opioids 'abuse liability. The successful marketing of opioid dose-escalation forCNCP has adversely affected those traditionally considereddisadvantaged as well as those who are not. The perfect storm of circumstances, with opioids for CNCP promoted by physicians 71and pharma alike, opened the floodgates to single modality care with opioids creating an addiction crisis72with a staggering impact on, for example, unemployed and disabled workers in economically devastatedindustrial communities. 73White, middle-class people in non- urban settings are disproportionately affected by the currentopioid crisis. Between 2007 and 2014, opioid dependence roseby 3,203% among patients privately insured in thesecommunities. 23Effective pain care is not assured by economic access to care, for example, through private insurers.13 While the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion (CDC) guidelines con rm non-opioid therapy is pre- ferred for chronic pain outside of active cancer, palliative and end-of-life care,74for these populations pain is often the dominant symptom.1There is substantial evidence that nonpharmacologic therapies can play a signi cant role in cancer pain, palliative and end of life pain care as well.75-77 Taking into account all health care disparities and the current US crisis in pain care, a case can be made that any patient no matter their ethnic or socioeconomic status, who isnot informed or who is not offered effective nonpharmaco-logic options for pain is, in fact, inadequately served. Onecould argue that given the risks of standard care, failing toeducate patients and recommend nonpharmacologic careshould be considered unethical. Complexity of pain categorization There is tremendous variability in the categorization of painstates that can obscure the magnitude of the problem of painmanagement. Pain is commonly categorized into acute andchronic, according to timeline and connection to tissueinjury. Acute pain typically lasts less than 3 months butmay persist longer and usually has a clear connection to aphysically identi able nociceptive (pain generating) pathol- ogy or tissue damage. 78Acute pain is expected to resolve as the tissue damage heals. Chronic pain is present for longerthan 3 months and may or may not have a clear and current Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 181connection to an identi able tissue-based cause, structural injury or defect. Cancer pain can be acute, whether it is post- surgical or due to ongoing nociception, or can be chronic.The timeline of a pain condition is increasingly beingrecognized as an arti cial metric, as the distinguishing features of the mechanisms of acute and chronic pain arerecognized. For chronic pain, the search for causative physicalsources can be frustrated by many factors, including the lackof sensitivity of available imaging technology to detect softissue and neuropathic causes, the complex structures that canbe involved in the generation and modi cation of pain, and the limited training most doctors receive in the subtleties ofphysical examination for pain conditions. 79,80Physicians report wanting more training and knowledge on evidence-basednonpharmacologic therapies and are not aware of evidence-based resources. 81\"Any meaningful effort to improve pain management will require a basic culture shift in the nation 's approach to mandating pain-related education for all healthprofessionals who provide care to people with pain.\" 82 More recent discoveries about central and peripheral nervous system pain processing (central sensitization andperipheral sensitization) are being recognized as more action-able when sensitization involvesneuronal and nonneuronal pathways (e.g., glial brain and spinal cord. 83Peripheral sensitization involves peripheral structures such as muscle, nerve, fasciaand others. 84,85In both central and peripheral sensitization, decreased inhibitory signals meant to downregulate nocicep-tive transmission are themselves inhibited, leading toenhanced perception of pain. This presents clinically ashyperalgesia (experiencing a mildly painful stimulus as verypainful) and allodynia (experiencing nonpainful stimuli aspainful). The phenomena of peripheral sensitization are increasingly recognized in the medical community and well documented in basic science literature. 84,85Another increas- ingly recognized neuroplastic process is the cortex leading to altered and inef cient movement strategies, which can themselves cause fatigue andpain. 86,87These changes in the nervous system currently inform our perceptions of chronic pain and are seen in manycommon chronic pain syndromes, including headache; backand visceral pain; and the group of conditionscalled repetitive strain injuries such as cervical posturalsyndrome, most cases of thoracic outlet syndrome, carpaltunnel disorders, trigger ngers, and forearm and thumb tendonitis. Pain can also be subcategorized according to anatomical sites where the pain is felt such as headache, neck and backpain. Pain can be named for the tissues involved such asmusculoskeletal, visceral or neuropathic. It can be named forthe pathological process such as cancer pain, osteoporoticpain, OA pain, repetitive strain injury or post-surgical pain.Many of these categories of pain can coexist and even overlap,making it important to understand the parameters anddenitions used with studies evaluating pain statistics. Regardless of classi cation systems, the number of people in pain is high and increasing. 1,7-10Moreover, chronic pain states have the highest economic and societal adverse impacts.Comorbidities associated with painThe de nition of pain commonly used in hospice was proposed by Dame Cicely Saunders and includes the phys-ical, psychological, social and spiritual domains. 88This inclusive de nition can be helpful in thinking about non- terminal cases involving pain since comorbidities spanningSaunders 'domains are common in chronic pain patients and can complicate the evaluation and successful treatment ofpain. There is a complex association between pain andpsychiatric disorders. Adults with mental health disordersare signi cantly more likely to be prescribed opioids; 16% of Americans who have mental health disorders receive over halfof all opioid prescriptions. 89Patients with chronic pain are at increased risk of comorbid depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. 32,90Pain increases depression risk 3-5 fold.91Pain, rather than chronic disease, is associated with the recurrence of depressive and anxiety disorders;2050-80% of chronic pain patients report insomnia of a severity thatwarrants clinical attention. 92However, opioids generally exacerbate rather than improve these sleep and mentalhealth comorbidities. 93 There are many interconnections between social rejection or exclusion and pain; for example, both are experienced inthe same parts of the brain. 51Social isolation is a common condition among pain patients. Pain itself isolates theindividuals since they may withdraw from family, work,school and social activities. Pain medications, however, can exacerbate rather than improve isolation by interfering with hormonal and neurotransmitter functions. 94The endogenous opioid system is involved in the development andmaintenance of human attachment. According to the brainopioid theory of social bonding, 95,96beta endorphins attach to mu opioid receptors resulting in analgesia and feelings ofwell-being. These are closely related to the dopamine rewardsystem and the oxytocin system affecting bonding, reinforcingthe rewarding nature of close social interactions. 97-99The disruption of these interconnected functions \u2014human social bonding, parent-infant bonding, the endogenous rewardsystem, which includes sexual response \u2014by exogenous opioids is currently being studied extensively. Hypogonadismas a result of long-term opioids has long been recognized. 100 The measure of the social dysfunction seen with opioid use isfar reaching and has not been adequately addressed in mostclinical practice settings. 99 As discussed above, substance use disorders (SUD) com- monly occur and have increased as a result of the liberal useof prescription opioids. These may result from preexistingSUD or be iatrogenically induced dependence, tolerance andaddiction to prescribed opioids. For a brief time, the term\"pseudo addiction \"was used to justify the prescribing of higher opioid doses while ignoring \"red-flag\"signs of addic- tion such as lost prescriptions, requests for early re lls and nonadherence with prescribed doses. 101 In studying the association of prolonged opioid use with psychiatric comorbidities, there is an \"adverse selection \"at play; people with serious psychiatric comorbidities are morelikely to end up on high dose, long-term opioids. 102-105This could be in part a result of the dif culty accessing behavioral health and addiction services as well as the need to present 182 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Carewith physical symptoms to obtain care. Opioids are being used as a proxy treatment, a convenient but risky option forcomplex pathologies that are characterized and labeled as\"pain \"by patients and practitioners. 102The social services needed to fully assess and treat them are often unavailable. Pain interacts with overall health. Other comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity are at once thecause of certain types of pain and exacerbated by pain. 1 Illnesses that are comorbid with pain can, in turn, beexacerbated by the use of opioids that are ineffective forchronic pain, produce illness behavior and carry a signi cant abuse liability. Healthcare workforce considerations Many factors contribute to the current trends in painmanagement. The majority of medical/healthcare visits areinitiated because of pain 32-35and as a result, primary care practitioners (PCPs), family medicine, general internal med-icine, general pediatrics, combined medicine-pediatrics, gen-eral obstetrics and gynecology, osteopathy, and generalsurgery assisted by nurses, nurse practitioners (APRN) andphysicians 'assistants (PAs) care for the largest proportion of those with pain and prescribe the largest proportion of painmedications including opioids. 106-108The current business model for most primary care settings encourages shortappointments to increase the volume of patients seen. Painpatients, especially chronic pain patients, have complexmedical histories and often have multiple overlapping causesof pain. These presentations place an intense time pressure onPCPs making it dif cult for them to fully address the complexities of chronic pain and may encourage therapeuticchoices that can be easily recommended within the timeallotted, most commonly prescription drugs. In 2012 nearly49% of all dispensed opioid prescriptions were accounted forby primary care specialists. 2 Additionally, the education currently provided to PCPs is decient in content related to pain in general and the full spectrum of evidence-based pain care approaches. Paincurricula in medical school education for both MDs andDOs in the US ranges from 1 to 31 hours during the3-4 year curriculum, with a mean of 11.13 hours and a mode, or common length, of 4 hours. 109Residency education is also insufcient to prepare primary care practitioners for competency in the treatment of common painproblems. 1,110\"A lack of knowledge and/or evidence of clinical effectiveness preclude the delivery of adequatecare.\" 110\"Thus, the current training system has left primary care practitioners with inadequate tools with which to dealwith some of their most frequent and challenging patients.\" 80 \"Any meaningful effort to improve pain management will require a basic culture shift in the nation's approach tomandating pain-related education for all healthprofessionals who provide care to people with pain. \" 82 Other medical specialists also treat pain that is within the purview of their specialty on a regular basis. Examples of thisare urologists treating kidney stones and their painful sequelaeor orthopedic surgeons treating post-operative pain. Gener-ally, these specialists will treat pain for a short term and thenreturn the patient to primary care or specialty pain care. Otherspecialties such as rheumatology, sports medicine, and phys-ical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) sometimes havelong-term engagement with pain care for their patients,mainly with interventional and pharmacologic options. The medical pain specialty grew out of the work of John J. Bonica who directed the Department of Anesthesiology andPain Medicine at the University of Washington in the 1960s.Many, if not most, pain clinics are still housed in anesthesi-ology clinics, but fellowship pain training can now bepursued not only by anesthesiologists but other specialistsin neurology/psychiatry, PM&R, and internal and familymedicine. Physicians who receive fellowship training in paincare learn interventional pain strategies that originated inregional anesthesia and acute pain care. Acute pain interven-tions are an essential part of pain care. But the expansion ofthese strategies, which are the mainstay of anesthesiology andacute pain practices, to chronic pain care have had moremodest success and only in carefully selected patientgroups. 111Additionally, there are licensed practitioners from evidence-based disciplines, as in acupuncture therapy,massage therapy, osteopathic therapy, chiropractic andothers, providing pain care but whose work may currentlybe less accessible within most formalized health systems. Another way to categorize the practitioners in the pain eld is through insurance reimbursement. Some practitioners aretypically insurance reimbursable such as physical therapists,psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and dentists, andunder certain circumstances, pharmacists. Practitionerslicensed in elds such as acupuncture, massage, chiropractic and naturopathy provide care that is 60- 70% less likely to be reimbursed. 112Even when health coverage is available it is generally limited, such that patients will still have substantial out-of-pocket costs.113There are also studied approaches to pain care that are not regulated but are delivered by licensed practitioners \"in place \"such as nurses using guided imagery or progressive relaxation, for example. These services aregenerally not reimbursed. The need for an informed strategy including all evidence- based comprehensive pain care is clearly demonstrated to bein patients 'best interest, as re flected by their healthcare seeking and out-of-pocket expenditures for pain care.Reported in 1993 the number of visits to what were called\"unconventional\" providers exceeded visits to all US primary care physicians; 1990 expenditures were 13.7 billion, 10.3billion of which was out of pocket. 114Analysis of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey estimated the out-of-pocketexpenditure at $30.2 billion. 115Out-of-pocket expenditures for back pain alone was $8.7 billion.113 Coordination of care across disciplines and access to nonpharmacologic care have not been optimized in thecurrent system in most states and territories. There are a fewstate Medicaid policy initiatives aimed at increasing access toeffective nonpharmacologic therapies as a rst line treatment for pain conditions. For example, the Oregon Health Plan(OHP\u2014 Oregon 's Medicaid program) covers acupuncture therapy, chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, physicaltherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for all back con-ditions. In addition, yoga, intensive rehabilitation, massage Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 183and/or supervised exercise therapy are recommended to be included in the comprehensive treatment plans and will beprovided where available as determined by each of Oregon 's Coordinated Care Organizations. 116Vermont 's legislature is piloting a program where they will cover acupuncture therapyfor back pain in a Medicaid population and monitor healthoutcomes and cost-effectiveness. 117Private coverage of every category of licensed provider is mandated in the State ofWashington, where the number of people using insurancebenets for care by these providers was similar to data by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS); hence coverage didnot lead to runaway utilization. 118Musculoskeletal pain was the most common diagnosis for a visit. For insured patientswith back pain, bromyalgia and menopause symptoms, users of nonpharmacologic therapy providers had lower insuranceexpenditures than those who did not use them. 119 Coverage for care is not current to the evidence-based detailed in Section 2 Solutions to the Problem below. Diversity of practice and engaging multiple evidence-baseddisciplines is enthusiastically embraced in pain medicine as aconcept. Yet without a strategy on evidence-based pain careboth in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, patientsare not well guided in options and are often left to be the solecase managers for their own care as they navigate a systemfragmented into silos. Practitioners and patients are challenged by other barriers in access to nonpharmacologic options that are effective forpain. In addition to the socioeconomic, gender and racial/ethnic disparities already detailed, geographic disparities existin the numbers and locations of practitioners using non-pharmacologic options leaving many regions and populationsunderserved. 120,121As of the writing of this paper there are ongoing meetings regarding Medicare and Medicaid coverage for licensed practitioners working within their state-regulated scope of practice and utilizing therapies proven effective forpain. The Joint Commission (TJC), which has long recog-nized nonpharmacologic approaches to pain, has now man-dated that it' s accredited hospitals and facilities provide evidence-based nonpharmacologic options for pain, empha-sizing the importance of options in comprehensive care.Strategies will be needed to facilitate both access and coverageto nonpharmacologic therapies. Risk and lack of effectiveness of prevalent pain care strategiesDespite increased medical expenditures for pain and techno-logical advances such as magnetic resonance imaging, newmedications and surgical approaches, the prevalence andimpact of chronic pain is worsening rather than improving.Many factors have contributed to the current situation. Bothpatients and medical practitioners labor under the mistakenidea that most pain problems can be xed by the doctor or surgeon with a drug or procedure. Medical school andgraduate courses still emphasize a search for appropriatedosing of opioid medications rather than considering otheroptions. The business model of medicine, the culturalauthority of projected and perceived certainty, and thedisempowered position of patients in pain has promotedsimplistic solutions\u2014albeit well-intentioned \u2014to complex problems. Patients are often regarded as passive participantswith little emphasis placed on self-care, on pain prevention,or therapies that engage preventive and self-care strategies,despite demonstrated longitude of bene t. The increasing need to respond to poorly addressed pain resulted in the numeric quanti cation of pain. As the notion of pain as the \"fth vital sign \"took hold in the late 1990s, pain assessment became increasingly focused on a singledimension of patient status\u2014 the pain score on an 11-point, 0-10 rating scale; either a numeric rating scale with numbers marked on a 10cm line or the visual analogue scale like theWong-Baker scale, usually a 10-cm line with faces expressinglevels of pain and no numeric markings on it. 122By taking eyes off the more complex goals of quality of life and overallfunctional ability, the system inadvertently contributed toreduced functioning and increased suffering of painpatients. 69The pressure to manage pain scores rather than to treat patients themselves has contributed to overprescribingopioids, widespread drug diversion, which is engaging illegalsources for prescription drugs, the resurgence of heroinaddiction, increasing disability from pain, and deaths fromoverdose. 1,2,35,123,124Pain practitioners have long noted that pain scores do not deliver accurate information about thestatus of a patient. Scores vary inexplicably and alone do notinform tailored, comprehensive and effective solutions. Painscores do not capture level of function or quality of life(QOL) intrinsic to an experience of well-being that can bepresent despite high pain scores. The reduction of a patient'spain experience to pain scores led to a narrowly de ned goal of pain score reduction in response to interventions. 123 Opioids and other drugsThe US prescribes 50 times more opioids than the rest of theworld combined. 72Between 1999 and 2010, opioid prescriptions in the US were enough to medicate everyAmerican adult with a standard pain treatment dose of5 mg of hydrocodone every 4 hours for a month. 125This indicates a public health crisis as prescription opioidscontribute to substance use disorder (SUD) or addiction.Prescription opioids are now the most frequent gateway drugto heroin. Inadvertent overdose deaths associated with prescription opioids exceed overdose deaths from heroin and cocaine combined 125and in many states now exceed deaths from motor vehicle accidents.126,127Societal and family disruption, violence and insuf cient resources to treat SUD have resulted. Complications attributable to the rapid rise of opioid use for chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) have led to an evidence-based re-evaluation of the practice of prescribing ever-increas-ing doses of opioids that have known risks and unprovenbenets. 69,128This has nally propagated recommendations for a shift away from opioids and toward comprehensive,multi-modal evidence-based care. While the governmenthas increased access to naloxone for the treatment of acuteopioid toxicity (respiratory arrest), it is important to note thatthis is not a preventative strategy for the deepening opioidcrisis. 184 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain CareAcute pain care can impact the development of chronic pain and disability and the development of opioid dependence, tolerance, addiction and diversion.Patients often receive long-term opioid therapy after anacute problem such as dental procedure, surgery or injury.Alarming numbers of patients then transition to chronic useafter starting opioids for the short-term treatment of post-operative pain (27%) or injury-related pain (27%). 129 Pain relievers are the medications reported most oftenprescribed at hospital emergency and outpatient depart-ment visits. 33Per the CDC, the economic burden of prescription opioid overdose, abuse and dependence isestimated to be $78.5 billion each year in the US. 34,130 Moreover, misuse and abuse of prescription opioids coststhe country an estimated $42 billion a year in lost produc-tivity. 131Workers 'compensation data from Washington State indicates that injured workers who are on opioids for overthree months are unlikely to return to work. 124 The probability of long-term opioid use increases after as little as ve days of prescribed opioids as the initial treatment of pain; the probability of patients remaining on opioids forthe long-term is the highest when treatment is initiated withlong acting opioids, 132a strategy borrowed from cancer pain treatment71and not well studied in noncancer pain. Tolerance (requiring higher doses to achieve the same analgesic effect),dependence (suffering withdrawal symptoms if a dose ismissed) and opioid induced hyperalgesia 133(a heightened sensitivity to pain) can develop quickly. There is no clearway to ascertain what baseline pain is present and what pain isin response to withdrawal from the last dose of opioid orinduced by the opioid itself. Acetaminophen (APAP) has been found to be only modestly helpful for mild pain; it is ineffective for acute low backpain, 134and it is uncertain if it has any effect in chronic low back pain (cLBP).135Although there are fewer adverse events with acetaminophen than other medications,134there are dose limitations due to hepatotoxicity.68Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory (NSAID) medications may be helpful in decreasing pain from a variety of causes such as arthritis,headache and back pain. More recent trials, however, report\"that NSAIDs had smaller 134The bene t of NSAIDs for spinal pain compared to placebo were not clinically important.136 NSAIDs are now recognized to interfere with healing137,138 and cause signi cant morbidity and mortality. They are a well-recognized cause of rebound headaches. Rebound pain,chronic medication use, and discontinuation syndromes inother conditions have not been as widely studied but exist. 139 Many patients have dif culty tolerating NSAID medicines due to gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such as nausea andabdominal pain. 140The FDA has issued new warnings on NSAIDs,66adding stroke and cardiac risk to the list of already well-known risks, which include delayed healing, renal failureand acute and chronic GI bleeding. 2,68There are 16,500 deaths annually from NSAID associated GI complicationsamong RA and OA patients alone. 67,140 Corticosteroid medications are considered potent anti- inflammatories often prescribed orally or by injection for refractory neurologic and autoimmune related pain as indiscogenic pain, rheumatoid arthritis and intractable head-ache. Recent studies challenge the usefulness of steroids formany indications including chronic pain. 134,141One in ve American adults in a commercially insured plan were givenprescriptions for short-term use of oral corticosteroids duringthe three-year period from 2012 through 2014. 142Even at relatively low doses, corticosteroids can be associated withinsomnia, nervousness, behavioral changes, increasedappetite, headache and joint pain. 143,144There are increased risks of serious acute complications such as infection, venousthromboembolism, avascular necrosis and fracture. There arealso risks of development and or exacerbation of chronicdisease such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosisand other features of iatrogenic Cushing 's syndrome. 142 Corticosteroids are one of the most common reasons foradmission to hospital for drug related adverse events. 142Yet corticosteroids do not appear to be effective for acute,radicular, or nonradicular low back pain. 134,141,145Epidural steroid injections are associated with less improvement inpatients with lumbar spine stenosis, 146increased risk of spinal fractures,147and increased risk of infection if followed within three months by spinal fusion surgery.148 Skeletal muscle relaxants are prescribed for short-term pain relief in acute pain but are associated with central nervoussystem adverse effects, especially sedation. 134Research is equivocal on signi cant bene t of some muscle relaxants for pain or muscle spasm.149Baclofen (oral, IV, or intrathecal) can be helpful for neurologically mediated spasticity as inmultiple sclerosis, traumatic brain or spine injury but withrisk of increase in mean fat body weight 150and serious complications, even organ failure, with disruption inadministration. 151Carisoprodol (Soma) should be avoided as it metabolizes to meprobamate, which has been withdrawn from the market in many jurisdictions due to toxicity and respiratory suppression when combined with opioids.Benzodiazepines may provide some relief for nonradicularlow back pain and muscle spasm. 134However, common adverse effects include anticholinergic symptoms such asdry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, drowsiness,sedation and confusion. Adverse effects and risk ofdependence are important limiting factors especially sincethere is a high prevalence of concurrent benzodiazepine andopioid use in patients with chronic pain. 152Moreover, half of deaths from drug overdoses among veterans occurred whenconcurrently prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids. 153 Anticonvulsant (antiepileptic) medications pregabalin are often used in neuropathic and neurologicalpain conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, postherpeticneuralgia and migraine and more recently in acuteperioperative pain. 2Topiramate and valproate/divalproex are commonly used for headache attenuation orprevention. 154,155Though carbamazepine is commonly used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, evidence for itseffectiveness is not strong. 155,156These medications provide mild to moderate bene t while being limited by neurological adverse effects including drowsiness and cognitive slowing.157 Antidepressants of various classes including tricyclic, seroto- nin and modulators are neuropathic, migraine, and Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 185ampli ed pain disorders such as bromyalgia and complex regional pain syndrome.158There is also a growing recognition that mood disorders, anxiety and other psychiatric comorbidities increase the suffering associated with pain,which has resulted in an increase in the use of non-opioiddrugs such as antidepressants. Certain antidepressants havepropensity to symptoms,weight gain, sexual dysfunction, emotional blunting andsuicidality, and need to be chosen carefully based on risk andcomorbidities. 159 Breakthroughs in neuroscience regarding the roles of glial cells160and other pain modulating neuroplastic changes have led to the premature use of purported modulators of glial function , including ketamine, tricyclics and other drugs, with variable results.161,162 But an effective course of acupuncture applied to local pointsfor carpal tunnel syndrome results in distinct neuroplasticchanges 87,163as do other nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic pain.164This trend to include the neuroplastic related aspects of chronic pain represents a signi cant contribution to pain care and is the focus of further research. Topical medications from various categories including local and general anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine and ketamine), musclerelaxants and (e.g.,amitriptyline) are used singularly or in combination for localpain management. Anti-in flammatories and capsaicin have been most studied and have the strongest evidence for bene t in musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain, respectively. 165,166 Local anesthetics have been used topically and as intralesionalinjections. More recently intravenous infusions have beenused for neuropathic pain or generalized pain. 167 Inhaled and topical medications containing cannabinoids , most commonly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the lesspsychotropic cannabidiol (CBD), interact with cannabinoidreceptors primarily in the brain to provide a broad range ofeffects. 168In addition to reduction of nausea, recent evidence demonstrates that cannabinoids exhibit comparableeffectiveness to opioids in models of acute pain andsignicant effectiveness in chronic neuropathic pain. 169,170 In a systematic review of RCTs of medical marijuana forCNCP, no serious adverse events were noted but \"neuro- cognitive adverse effects related to learning, memory andpsychomotor de cits were common even with low-dose, short-term use of medical marijuana though they appear welltolerated \". 171Headaches, sedation, dysphoria and poor concentration were also noted. Long-term consequences ofmedical marijuana remain unknown and research is ongoingfor bene t in non-neuropathic chronic pain. Several classes of condition-based medications like triptans are prescribed for acute migraine 172and \"disease modifying agents \" in autoimmune conditions have bene t in reducing pain related to these conditions, as in rheumatoid arthritis.173Cardiovascular and immunosuppressive adverse effects limit their use. Imaging, procedures and surgery In medical systems where a team approach to care is absent, avariety of specialists end up delivering a menu of very similarservices, primarily medication, along with costly, invasiveprocedures and surgeries. A sometimes-premature response toor over-interpretation of imaging technology can result inhigher rates of procedures and surgeries. In the rst decade of the 21st century, the use of high-cost imaging for spine and joint pain rose dramatically. 174 However, studies suggest that MRI ndings do not correlate well with pain intensity or functional impairment, nor isadvanced imaging associated with better outcomes. 175Surgery rates are highest in areas of the country where imaging ratesare highest, 176yet imaging is not associated with an advantage in subsequent pain, function, quality of life or overallimprovement. 35While the process of imaging is not related to a high incidence of adverse events, part of the risk ofimaging is the prompting of interventions that may result inincreased risk with little gain. Moreover, common age-related,nonspeci c MRI ndings such as degenerative disc disease or anomalies of the spine may unnecessarily contribute topatient alarm and distress 35that leads to reduced physical and work activity and a vicious cycle of disuse, distress andgreater disability. The focus on imaging encourages patientsto identify with their anatomical pathology often with littleunderstanding of how that contributed to their pain orfunctional state. Procedures for pain include injections of various kinds, nerve blocks, epidurals, tissue ablations, spinal cord stimula-tors and pain pumps. These procedures can signi cantly reduce suffering and allow salvage of damaged limbs andtissues in the case of acute tissue injury. Timely use of thesetechniques can reduce the development of post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD). 177In chronic pain these interventions can also be very helpful in carefully selected patients.178,179 Unfortunately, for many procedures there are no practice guidelines that are universally followed. Expensive interven- tional procedures for chronic pain, such as epidural and jointsteroid injections increased by 228% from 2000 to 2011, 180 and surgical center utilization increased by 300%.181The overuse of these strategies raises risk for patients and costs tothe system. Moreover, their lack of effectiveness can bedemoralizing for patients. 182,183 As the long-term outcomes of surgical procedures are assessed, it is more evident that surgery performed to alleviatepain often does not achieve its goal. In geographic regions,the best spinal surgery outcomes occurred where surgery rateswere the lowest; the worst results occurred in areas where rateswere the highest. 35Structural pathology of the knee, rated during meniscal surgery, for example, does not correlate withpatient reported pain and function. 184There is equivocal evidence for many common surgeries intended to remedychronic pain; knee arthroscopies 185and meniscectomies, for example.186-188Surgery is found effective in the short but not in the long term for most patients with cervical radiculopathyand facet arthropathy neck pain. 189When long-term follow- up for lumbar spine stenosis surgery is done, non-operativegroups fare as well as the operative groups, 190except the operative groups experience an increased rate of sideeffects. The cost of a laminectomy can range from $50,000 to $90,000 without insurance and up to $2000 in copayments 186 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Carewith insurance coverage. A spinal fusion can cost between $80,000 -$150,000.191\"Despite no speci c concurrent reports of clari ed indications or improved ef cacy, there was a 220% increase in the rate of lumbar spine fusion surgery from 1990to 2001 in the US\" . 35Yet there are no clear bene ts observed with surgical vs. non-surgical treatment.190Conservative treatment including physical therapy has been associatedwith positive long-term outcome and a reduced likelihoodof cross-over to surgery after one year. 192 Increased costs and lack of evidence of ef cacy is not to condemn surgery as an option, but to question practice thatengages surgery before or instead of more conservative,evidence-based therapeutic care. Decisions are complicatedby a business model of medicine that continues to valuecostly interventions not necessarily supported by evidence,particularly in the case of chronic pain and despite the factthat many patients who submit to surgery do not haveresolution of their chronic pain. While more research is needed to understand the pro- gression from acute to chronic pain, it is clear that thelimited, siloed strategies of the prevalent pain managementsystem have not addressed the scope of pain in America.The NIH National Pain Strategy, 4NAM,82the CDC opioid guidelines,193the updated pain mandate from The Joint Commission,194the FDA,195and the American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guideline141recommend evidence-informed, comprehensive pain care whileconceding that past strategies generally, and the use ofopioid medications speci cally, have not remedied but rather exacerbated chronic pain, abuse, addiction, illnessbehavior and disability. Rapidly emerging science continuesto inform our understanding of pain states and potentialresponses. Emerging science about the impact on pain states by the microbiome, 196-198mitochondria,199fascia,200-202 glia160and neuroplasticity,87,163and movement disorders secondary to pain86will likely inform future pain treatments. The national pain strategies are shifting from a model of pain care, well-intentioned but delivered in specialty silos, favoring expensive solutions that have equivocal evi-dence of bene t to multimodal evidence-informed options, tted to a patient's whole experience of pain and therapeutic goals. Evidence-informed practice is based in evaluation and dissemination of current research including biological, med-ical and behavioral science. Thirty seven US State AttorneysGeneral have submitted a letter to America 's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) asking them to include and incentivize evi-dence-based non-opioid treatments for pain. 203Nonphar- macologic therapies for pain are now recommended by theAmerican College of Physicians (ACP) for acute, subacuteand chronic... and chronic low back pain. As of January 1,2018, the largest hospital accreditation organization, the JointCommission, will require hospitals provide nonphar-macologic modalities for pain. 203The current evidence for nonpharmacologic therapies for acute and chronic pain isdetailed next.SECTION 2: SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMEVIDENCE-BASED NONPHARMACOLOGIC PAINCARE (NPPC)Nonpharmacologic therapies are best considered within thecontext of all evidence-based medical treatment. The terms\"complementary and alternative \"stratify care by considera- tions other than evidence of effectiveness and risk. Evidence-based nonpharmacologic therapies are safe and effectivecomponents in comprehensive pain care that can also beopioid sparing, that is, reduce the need for opioids to managesevere, acute pain and consequently reduce the need forchronic opioids. Nonpharmacologic therapies can be stand-alone interventions or work in combination with medicine,procedures or surgery. An often underrecognized feature ofnonpharmacologic therapies is their ability to confer addi-tional bene ts: a treatment to reduce pain can also reduce anxiety and depression, nausea and vomiting; facilitate restfulsleep; and increase a patient's sense of well-being and desire toparticipate in their own recovery. Policy decisions for strategies on pain care must be informed by research and evidence for all practices in medicine. The assump-tion that conventional care is proven care has been challenged byreviews: the US Of ce of Technology Assessment in 1978 estimated that only 10 -20% of all procedures then used in medical practice were shown to be ef cacious by controlled trial. 204Estimates reported in the early 1990s determined 10 -15% of medical interventions were ba sed on results from randomized controlled trials; by 2003 that gure improved: approximately 50% of conventional care was found to be evidence-based.205 Comprehensive, research-info r m e dc a r es h o u l df o l l o wt h eevidence and include all evidence-based disciplines in amultimodal approach to pain care, particularly therapies thathave evidence not only in the short term but have been evaluated for impact longitudinally, that is, care that registers improvement months and years following a course of treatment. 206,207 There are effective nonpharmacologic therapies available from licensed and regulated professionals such as acupuncture therapy,massage therapy, osteopathic ma nual medicine, chiropractic, physical therapy and psychology. There are instructors trainedin evidence-based, directed or self-engaged movement andmeditative movement therapies as in yoga and Tai chi. Lifestyleor behavioral approaches, such as stress management, cognitivebehavioral therapy, meditation /mindfulness and meditative movement therapies are also recommended as nonpharmaco-logic strategies. Other lifestyle approaches including diet andsleep hygiene have been shown to bene t health. These are low risk, low cost, well accepted by patients and many have beenused successfully fo r thousands of years. There is an additional bene t to many of NPPC strategies; unlike drugs and surgery, they involve patient participationand a commitment to self-care. Increased self-ef cacy in managing pain often accompanies NPPC and correlates withimproved mood and predicts improved outcomes in manychronic conditions, including pain. 208For example, the military has studied \"active self-care therapies \"as a category of pain management that may be of value in an integrated,multimodal approach. 209 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 187Evidence-Based Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Acute PainOver 50% of chronic opioid use begins in the acute caresetting, after surgery, or for treatment of acute injury relatedpain. 129Nonpharmacologic therapies have demonstrated benet for acute pain with opioid sparing in hospital settings for inpatient post-operative pain and for acute painnot related to surgery. The largest hospital accreditationorganization in the US, The Joint Commission (TJC), hasrevised it 's pain mandate, originally introduced in 2000. Effective January 1, 2018, TJC will require that it' s accredited hospitals and facilities provide nonpharmacologictherapies for pain as a scorable element of performance. 194Per TJC clari cation statement of 2015, these include but are not limited to, physical modalities such as acupuncture therapy,chiropractic therapy, osteopathic manipulative treatment,massage therapy, physical therapy (PT), relaxation therapyand cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). 210While CBT, PT, exercise2and electrical stimulation (E-Stim) have shown benet for chronic pain,211,212they are not covered in detail in this evidence review as they are currently recognized andpart of covered conventional care options, albeit underutil-ized in some systems. CBT, PT, exercise and E-Stim areeffective nonpharmacologic therapies for pain and areincluded in our recommendations. Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Acute Inpatient Pain with Opioid SparingAcupuncture therapy post-operative painAcupuncture is understood as the insertion and manipulationofne solid core needles at speci ed points or combination of points on the body. \"Acupuncture therapy \"derives from the traditional East Asian paradigm recognizing the interrela-tionship of organs and body points and channels as well asassociated symptoms, disease and dysfunction. Depending ona state 's scope of practice, acupuncture often includes treating by means of mechanical, thermal or electrical stimulation; by insertion of needles, or by application of heat, pressure or other forms of stimulation. In practice, acupuncture needlingis often done in combination with other therapies such aspalpation, Tui na, Gua sha, cupping, moxibustion, E-Stim,auricular treatment, and recommendationson diet, exercise, self-re flection and meditative movement like Tai chi. Acupuncture therapy, therefore includes acupunctureneedling, accompanying therapies and recommendations thatengage a patient in self-care, particularly in the treatment ofchronic pain. In multiple systematic reviews with meta-analyses, acu- puncture was effective in reducing post-surgical pain com-pared to sham acupuncture, controls and usual care withreduction in opioid need (21% opioid reduction at 8 hours,23% at 24 hours and 29% at 72 hours post-surgery) withlowered incidence of opioid-related and urinary reten-tion. 213-215A systematic review with meta-analysis found acupuncture after total knee arthroplasty reduced pain andwas associated with delayed opioid use. systematic review and meta-analysis, peri-operative auricular acupuncturereduced postoperative pain and need to sham or standard-of-care controls. 217Pain benet at 48 hours was equivalent to analgesics with fewer side effects. These ndings have potential for reduction of hospital readmission due to uncontrolled pain.218 Intraoperative electrical stimulation of acupuncture points reduced intraoperative opioid requirements, post-operativepain and duration of stay in the post-anesthesia care unit. 219 Acupuncture was effective, safe and well tolerated for post-tonsillectomy pain in children with no signi cant side effects. 220The American Pain Society 's guidelines on post- operative pain management neither \"recommend nor discourage \"acupuncture therapy as part of recommended multimodal post-operative pain based on the literatureavailable at the time of it's guideline writing. 221A subsequent systematic review with meta-analysis cited abovesupports the use of acupuncture as adjuvant therapy intreating post-operative pain and reducing opioid use. 214 Acupuncture therapy acute non-surgical painFor acute and subacute low back pain, a systematic reviewwith meta-analysis 222led the American College of Physicians (ACP) to recommend acupuncture as a rst-line treatment.141 Acupuncture is also effective for acute migraine.223In an RCT enrolling 300 patients with acute pain presenting to anemergency department, acupuncture was superior toparenteral morphine for pain relief and onset of action withfewer adverse effects. 224A retrospective study of emergency department acute pain patients found acupuncture decreasedpain comparable to analgesics with additional bene to f reduction in anxiety. 225A trial of 1,964 patients found acupuncture bene t comparable to pharmacotherapy for emergency department patients presenting with acute lowback pain and ankle sprain. 226A systematic review with meta-analysis of acupuncture analgesia in the emergency setting found acupuncture \"provided statistically signi cant, clinically meaningful, and improved levels of patient satisfaction with respect to pain relief in the emergencysetting \". 227The authors found evidence of lower cost and low adverse effects pro le. In an observational study of 1,008 patients including children, acupuncture given as rst aid immediately after, optimally within 48 hours, of a burn injuryreduced pain, reddening, pigmentation, scarring and PTSDthat commonly follows traumatic burns. 228 Acupuncture therapy safetyAcupuncture has a low risk of adverse events. The NIHConsensus Statement on Acupuncture published in 1998 found that \"the incidence of adverse effects is substantially lower than that of many drugs or other accepted procedures for the sameconditions \". 229Systematic reviews and surveys have clari ed that acupuncture is safe when perfor med by appropriately trained practitioners230- 237with infrequent minor side effects such as feeling relaxed, elated, tired or having sensation or itching at pointof insertion. 234Rare serious complications such as infection or pneumothorax are directly related to insuf cient training.235,236,238Safe use of acupuncture has also been estab- in pediatrics230,239- 241and for women who are preg- nant.242- 244 188 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain CareMassage therapy post-operative pain Massage therapy involves manipulation of soft tissue struc-tures of the body to prevent or alleviate pain, spasm, tensionor stress and to promote health and wellness. A systematicreview with meta-analysis of 10 trials showed a single dose ofmassage therapy provided signi cant improvement in post- operative pain. 245In a systematic review of 16 trials, massage therapy was effective for treating pain and anxiety comparedto active comparators in surgical pain populations. 246In a randomized trial of veterans undergoing major surgery,massage was effective and a safe adjuvant therapy for therelief of acute post-operative pain. 247Massage is effective for pain reduction in post-cesarean section patients,248cardiac249 and thoracic surgery patients.250 Massage therapy safetyTherapeutic massage is considered safe. Studies in adults andchildren with cancer 251-253and in the post-operative period247have found rare serious adverse events254-256and low rates of minor complaints such as muscle soreness.141 Mind body1directed therapies post-operative and acute painMusic therapy post-operative acute painA systematic review with meta-analysis of research found musictherapy reduced pain in burn patients 257and in pediatric post- operative pain.258A meta-analysis of 97 studies evaluating music therapies for pain from a variety of causes (acute andprocedural pain, and cancer/chronic pain) demonstratedstatistically signi cant decreases in pain intensity, emotional distress and analgesic use, both opioid and non-opioidintake. 259A trial of music therapy for post-cesarean section pain found decreased pain in the 24 hours following surgeryand decreased analgesic consumption in the rst four hours. 260 Suggestive techniques and guided imagery post-operativeand acute painA meta-analysis of trials found suggestive techniques such ashypnosis may be useful tools to alleviate post-operativepain, especially in minor surgeries. 261A systematic review and meta-analysis of the ef cacy of audio recorded therapeutic suggestions given while under generalanesthesia found no effect on pain and small butsigni cant effects on medication use and recovery. 262 Listening to a guided imagery CD 2 weeks before and3 weeks after total knee replacement resulted in reducedpain that persisted at 3 weeks. 263Virtual reality assisted distractionVirtual reality (VR) technology enables people to becomeimmersed in a computer-simulated, three-dimensional envi-ronment as a distraction to pain. 264Coupled with standard analgesia, VR has been found bene cial in reduction of burn- induced pain and burn wound care in adults andchildren. 264,265VR assisted burn and nonburn wound care reduced opioid need by 39% compared to no VR, while levelsof pain and anxiety were similar. 266VR has shown potential in inpatient cancer procedure-related pain.267 Mind body directed therapies safetyMusic therapy, suggestive techniques and guided imagery arenot associated with signi cant adverse effects and are safe options to improve post-operative recovery. 260-262VR has potential risk of nausea and increased potential for collisionswith objects in the real world. 268The latter is controlled by creating \"safe areas \"to use and with Debrie ng post-VR experience may bene t especially young children and those vulnerable to effects ofimmersive reality experience. Multimodal Approach to Acute Pain Care Multimodal pain care is now recognized as the optimalinclusive and responsive approach to patients experiencingpain: inclusive of all evidence-based therapies includingeffective nonpharmacologic options topatients 'diverse and needs. Evidence-based non- pharmacologic therapies are recommended in comprehensivepediatric and adult pain care. 82,194,269Multimodal pain care is recommended by the American Pain Society in it' s guidelines to post-operative pain management.221Effective non- pharmacologic options are recommended by the ACP in it' s guidelines for acute low back pain.141 Frequency, Dosage and Timing of NonpharmacologicInterventions for Inpatient and Acute Pain CareTherapies that are delivered by a single licensed independentpractitioner, such as an acupuncturist, massage therapist ortherapist providing an engaged or guided mind body interven-tion, are generally given as daily treatment for the term of theinpatient stay with referral for outpatient care follow-up. Caresuch as music therapy or virtua l guided imagery are not single practitioner dependent. Access can be continuous or timed ifprovided by recordings that can be self-administered by patients.A session of inpatient acupuncture or massage therapy care canlast from 20-45 minutes. There is evidence-based data on dosageand frequency of nonpharmacologic therapies, but more researchis needed to determine the optimal frequency, dosage and timingof interventions: length of a session, or for the case of acupunc-ture therapy, what constitutes an o ptimal intervention in terms of session time, number of points palpated, needled, point retentiontime, and with what additional hands-on therapies. Evidence-Based Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Cancer PainAcupuncture therapy cancer painThe American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical PracticeGuidelines found acupuncture was effective in improving 1The term \"mind body \"represents an attempt to accommodate the bidirectional or circular impact that interventions have on symptoms typically categorized as either mental/psychological/spiri- tual or \"discretely physical. \"However, this is an arti cial bifurcation since all body systems use identical communication molecules andmechanisms and since there is never a physical condition that does not register a psychological component.

In systematic reviews with meta-analysesmindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) had a bene cial psychological impact for breast cancer patients, 281,282and on quality of life, mood and distress in cancer patients.283A recent trial of MBSR for metastatic breast cancer patientsdemonstrated a positive impact on distress with a mild effectof improving average pain. 284 In a large systematic review with meta-analysis, music therapy showed statistically signi cant improvements in cancer pain, emotional distress from pain and a small butsignicant effect on anesthetic use, opioid and non-opioid intake. 259Music therapy in a palliative care setting produced signicant improvement in pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath and mood.77 Evidence-Based Nonpharmacologic Therapies for ChronicPainNonpharmacologic therapies are well studied and effective forchronic pain. A Clinical Practice Guideline from the Amer-ican College of Physicians (ACP) states nonpharmacologicinterventions should be considered as rst-line options in chronic low back pain, noting that fewer harms are associatedwith these effective therapies than with pharmacologicoptions. The ACP emphasizes therapies be administered bypractitioners with appropriate training. 141 Acupuncture therapy chronic painAcupuncture has accrued extremely strong evidence inthe treatment of chronic pain. An individual patient datameta-analysis of 29 randomized trials involving 17,922patients using acupuncture therapy for chronic musculoske-letal pain related to the neck and low back, knee OA,headache and migraine found acupuncture was signi cantly better than both sham acupuncture and usual care for allconditions. 285,286In a systematic review with meta-analysis, acupuncture was associated with greater immediate relief ofchronic pain compared to sham acupuncture or analgesicinjection. 287In a meta-analysis on long-term impact, the effects of a course of acupuncture treatment for patientswith chronic pain persisted signi cantly following care; 90% of acupuncture bene t persisted at 12 months in trials using wait list or usual care controls. Trials comparing acupunctureto sham found 50% persistence of bene t at 12 months for the verum groups. 207 An updated individual patient meta-analysis of acupunc- ture for chronic nonspeci c back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headache or osteoarthritis included an addi-tional 7 years of trials evaluating 39 trials (20,827 patients). 288 Acupuncture was superior to both sham and no acupuncturecontrols for each pain condition. The effects of acupuncturewere found to persist over time with only a small decrease,approximately 15%, in treatment effect at one year afterrandomization or 9 -10 months after the completion of treatment. A new nding was additional con rmation of benet for acupuncture over sham on upper body musculoskeletal pain, neck and shoulder pain. In a systematic review with meta-analysis, acupuncture showed bene t over controls in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy related to diabetes, HIV, Bell 's palsy and carpal tunnel syndrome. 289Simple pressure sustained by seeds or small magnets taped to ear points, a form of auriculartreatment, showed bene t in acute and chronic pain in systematic reviews with meta-analyses. 217,290 In a large multicenter trial of 14,161 patients with chronic neck pain, acupuncture (15 sessions over 3 months) added toroutine care was associated with improvements in neck painand disability maintained through six months compared toroutine care alone. 291Although acupuncture care increased cost of treatment, the health bene ts lasted well beyond the three-month study duration; per international cost-effectiveness threshold values, acupuncture was determinedto be a cost-effective treatment strategy. 292In a cost- effectiveness review of nonpharmacologic interventions forlow back pain (LBP), acupuncture was found to be a cost-effective option. 211Meta-analyses demonstrate acupuncture is effective and cost-effective for knee OA.293,294A systematic review and meta-analysis of manual acupuncture for myofas-cial pain syndrome found treatment of myofascial triggerpoints reduced pain and improved pain threshold in studiesusing a single treatment or a course of eight treatments. 295 Further research is needed to clarify the longitudinal impactof myofascial trigger point treatments as single or multiplesessions. A network meta-analysis demonstrated thatacupuncture needling alone and combined with Gua sha,moxibustion, or e-stim are effective in decreasing pain and inimproving physical function in myofascial pain syndrome. 296 In systematic reviews297,298and meta-analyses,299 acupuncture was found effective for frequent episodic or 190 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Carechronic tension headaches and for episodic migraine. Acupuncture has also been shown to be effective forchronic shoulder pain, 285,300pain related to OA of the hip,301and temporomandibular disorder myofascial pain.302,303In a military population, acupuncture treatment given at least four times within a year was associated withimproved symptoms, ability to function and sense of well-being as well as reductions in opioid prescriptions (45%)muscle relaxants (34%), NSAIDs (42%) and benzodiazepines(14%). 304 a systematic review and meta-analysis, acupuncture therapies with prokinetics were more effective than proki-netics alone for functional dyspepsia. 305Acupuncture therapy is recommended for functional dyspepsia in patientscontraindicated for prokinetics. A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing acupoint stimulation to NSAIDs for primary dysmenorrheafound advantages in acupoint stimulation in alleviation ofdysmenorrhea symptoms with fewer side effects and potentialuse for patients with NSAID contraindication. 306 Based on a systematic review, the American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guideline recommendsacupuncture for acute, subacute and chronic low back pain(cLBP). 141,222The US Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(AHRQ) concluded that acupuncture therapy is effective forcLBP compared to placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care orwait list controls. 145The NIH also recommends acupuncture for low back pain and for knee OA.307The FDA Education Blueprint For Health Care Providers Involved In The Managementor Support of Patients with Pain suggests acupuncture among a range of available therapies as part of a multidisciplinaryapproach to pain management. 195 As stated above, acupuncture therapy has a low risk of adverse events when provided by quali ed trained practitioners. Massage therapy chronic pain Based on it' s systematic review, the ACP Clinical Practice Guideline recommends massage for acute, subacute andchronic low back pain (cLBP). 141,222AHRQ found massage effective for cLBP compared to placebo, sham, no treatment,usual care, or wait list controls. 145The NIH also recommends massage for neck pain.307 Sixty high quality and seven low quality studies included in a systematic review with meta-analysis on pain and functionacross all pain populations found massage therapy effectivelytreats pain compared to sham, no treatment and activecomparators. 308A systematic review for upper and lower extremity conditions found soft tissue therapy effective forthe management of heel pain and lateral epicondylitis. 309A trial of massage therapy for knee OA found the optimal doseat 8 weekly one-hour sessions with bene ts persisting for at least 8 weeks beyond treatment. 310A systematic review with meta-analysis found manual therapy including massage waseffective for pain, stiffness and physical function in knee OAwith a call for more study with extended follow-up. 311 Stiffness and physical function showed signi cant improvement with treatment duration of more than 4 weeks.As indicated above, massage therapy has a low risk of adverse events when provided by a trained practitioner. Spinal manipulation therapy and manipulative therapy chronic painSpinal manipulative therapy (SMT) involves treatment of thespine and pelvic related joints; manipulative therapy (MT)refers to the treatment of other joints in the body includingupper and lower extremities. SMT and MT are oftenassociated with high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrusttechniques, as well as low velocity, low orjoint mobilization techniques. SMT, MT, HVLA and LVLAare techniques commonly used to improve pain and function,primarily by osteopathic physicians and chiropractors. A systematic review with meta-analysis showed SMT improves low back pain with bene ts maintained for up to six weeks. 312SMT was also shown to be cost-effective for low back pain.211Based on it' s systematic review, the ACP Clinical Practice Guideline recommends spinalmanipulation for acute, subacute and chronic low back pain(cLBP). 141,222AHRQ found SMT as effective as other active interventions for cLBP.145Systematic reviews found SMT benecial for neck pain,313cervicogenic headache,314and prophylaxis of migraine.315 and a meta-analyses found manual therapy bene cial for knee OA311,316as well as OA syndrome, ankle inversion sprain, plantarfasciitis, 317and common shoulder disorders.318A systematic review also found evidence that MT is effective whencombined with exercise and/or multimodal therapy forlateral epicondylitis, carpal tunnel syndrome andtemporomandibular disorders. 319A review found for adults with \"whiplash-associated disorders \"and \"neck pain associated disorders, \"nonpharmacologic therapies including manual therapy are cost-effective.320For improving low back and shoulder pain, MT may be more cost-effective than usualcare that included exercise, stabilization and/or advice aboutactivity. 321 Manipulation therapy safetyAdverse events associated with spinal manipulation includemuscle soreness or transient increases in pain. 141Rare serious adverse events include cervical artery dissection, stroke andneck injury. 322The most recent review of systematic reviews found that though rare, there is some risk of signi cant adverse events with spinal manipulation.323 Mind body directed therapies for chronic painMindfulness, meditation and relaxation therapies chronicpainMindfulness and meditation-based therapies focus trainingon moment to moment awareness of breathing and attentionwithout judgment to transform perception and relationshipsto pain and the larger environment. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a training that has had considerable study for chronic pain. A systematicreview and meta-analysis found MBSR for low back pain wasassociated with short-term improvements in pain intensity Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 191and physical functioning compared to usual care.324In a trial for patients with chronic low back pain, comparing MBSR to CBT or usual care found both MBSR and CBT to be cost-effective and MBSR to be cost-saving. 212CBT is recognized as a moderately effective approach to chronic pain, forexample, low back pain; 141however, we do not include an in-depth review of CBT as it is currently part of coveredconventional care options, albeit underutilized. Based on it' s systematic review, the American College of Physicians (ACP)Clinical Practice Guideline recommends both CBT andMBSR for chronic low back pain. 141,222 Mindfulness and relaxation-based eHealth interventions have evidence of positive effects on health outcomesfor patients with chronic pain including headache, bromyal- gia and irritable bowel syndrome. 280Internet-delivered pain-coping skills training (PCST) with physiotherapist-prescribed home exercise for persons with chronic knee painprovided clinically meaningful improvements in pain andfunction that are sustained for at least six months. 325PCST is an approach based on CBT principles that targetpsychological factors such as low self-ef cacy, poor pain coping, and pain catastrophizing, common in persons withchronic pain. PCST has been shown to be effective forosteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis pain 326and speci cally knee OA.327 has also shown bene t in pain in adolescents328,329 and in adult patients with chronic headache.330,331A review of patients with arthritis, chronic back or neck pain, or two ormore comorbid pain conditions experienced the largestaverage improvement from a mindfulness program in painseverity and functional limitations. 332Greater home meditation practice was signi cantly associated with greater improvements in psychological distress and self-rated general health. Bene t for pain and high continued compliance have been consistently associated with MBSR from its earliest study.333 Relaxation therapies use physiologic techniques (e.g., slow diaphragmatic breathing or progressive muscle relaxation) toregulate the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance and reducesymptoms of sympathetic arousal often seen in chronic painincluding situational stress, muscle tension and shallowbreathing. They also include other directed therapies likeguided imagery (use of words depicting calming images andmusic to evoke positive imaginative scenarios), hypnosis andsuggestion (induction of a relaxed but focused state ofconsciousness receptive to positive suggestion), acceptanceand commitment therapy (strategies of mindful awareness andacceptance) and music therapy. In a large meta-analysis, music therapy showed a reduction of chronic pain, emotional distress due to pain and a smallbut statistically signi cant reduction in opioid and non- opioid intake. 259Based on it' s systematic review, the ACP Clinical Practice Guideline recommends progressiverelaxation for chronic low back pain. 141,222The NIH also recommends relaxation, \"autonomic regulatory\" approaches forbromyalgia.307 In a meta-analysis of trials, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based interventions wereshown to be comparable to cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) in managing chronic pain. 334ACT was comparable to CBT but with higher patient satisfaction in one trial onchronic pain; 335older adults with chronic pain were more likely to respond to ACT in another RCT.336 Systematic reviews of guided imagery were found encour- aging but inconclusive for musculoskeletal and non-mus-culoskeletal pain. 337, 338A more recent systematic review of guided imagery in bromyalgia, arthritis and rheumatologic disorders found statistically signi cant improvement in pain and function, with several trials demonstrating reduc-tion in medication use. 339 Mindfulness, meditation and relaxation therapy safetyThe body of research evidence has shown mindfulness-basedpractices, hypnosis, suggestive therapies, guided imagery,CBT, ACT and progressive relaxation techniques are utilizedacross diverse patient populations. These approaches are safe, with rare adverse reactions in psychiatric patients, people with epilepsy or those who have suffered abuse or trauma whererelaxation may trigger a rare paradoxical reaction. 141,324,339,340 Biofeedback chronic painBiofeedback utilizes techniques in which a signal generatedby a device trains the patient to manipulate an aspect of theirphysiology not typically directed (e.g., heart rate variabilityand muscle tension) and provides a self-care tool for physio-logic modulation. A meta-analysis of biofeedback for chroniclow back pain (cLBP) found pain reduction, reduced depres-sion, disability, and muscle tension and improved coping. 341 Based on another systematic review, the ACP Clinical PracticeGuideline recommends electromyography biofeedback forcLBP. 141,222 A meta-analysis of trials also found biofeedback effective for tension headache with stable bene t over an average follow-up phase of 15 months. Biofeedback with relaxationtherapy was most effective for children and adolescents withheadache. 342A meta-analysis of biofeedback for bromyalgia found signi cant reduction of pain,343with less effect established in another systematic review due to variability ofmeasures across trials. 344 Biofeedback safetyIn a systematic review of trials for fatigue and cognition,neurofeedback (EEG biofeedback) and biofeedback wereshown to be well-tolerated without major adverse effects. 345 Biofeedback has low risk of harms with rare side effects ofheadache, fatigue or sleep problems. 343No adverse events are reported in a meta-analysis of biofeedback for chronic backpain. 341 Movement therapies for chronic painYoga chronic painTherapeutic yoga is the use of yoga to help people with healthproblems manage their health conditions and reduce theirsymptoms. Yoga originated in ancient India and has beenadapted in the West. Yoga practice combines attention andmeditation (dhyana), breathing (pranayama) and physicalpostures (asanas). 192 EXPLORE 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain CareA Cochrane review of yoga for chronic nonspeci c back pain found moderate supporting evidence that yoga com- pared to non-exercise controls r esulted in small-to-moderate improvements in back-related function at three and sixmonths and was comparable to exercise for chronic lowback pain (cLBP). 346Early intervention with \"medical yoga \"\u2014group sessions of guided Kundalini yoga individualized to each medically screened patient with lowback pain \u2014was found to be cost-effective. 211,347Based on it's systematic review, the American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guideline recommends yoga forcLBP. 141,222AHRQ found yoga effective for cLBP compared to placebo, sham, no treatment, usual care or wait list.145 NIH recommends yoga (hatha, Iyengar and viniyoga) forcLBP. 307 In a systematic review and summary of reviews,348,349yoga was found to have bene cial effects in patients with pain. In addition to low back pain, systematic reviews with meta-analyses found yoga bene cial for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, kyphosis and bromyalgia. 350Additional systematic reviews found yoga to have positive effects on pain andfunction in patients with knee OA 351and neck pain.352A meta-analysis found yoga, even as a short-term intervention,could be effective for pain and associated disability. 353A large systematic review (306 trials) identi ed 52 different yoga styles and techniques with the most common being hatha, Iyengar,Pranayama and integrated approaches to yoga therapy. Therewas no advantage to a particular style of yoga. The reviewersrecommended the choice of yoga style be based on personalpreference and availability. 354In a systematic review with meta-analysis on ef cacy and safety of meditative movement therapies (Qi gong, Tai chi and yoga) for bromyalgia syndrome, yoga yielded signi cant effects on pain, fatigue, sleep, depression and health-related quality of life at nal treatment, while Tai chi showed bene t for sleep.355In an access-to-care innovation for veterans, a clinical yoga programvia telehealth real-time interactive video conferencing,provided comparable satisfaction and health improvementsto in-person yoga, including bene t for pain. 356 Yoga therapy safetyReported harms associated with yoga for cLBP were mild tomoderate; 141,357self-limiting joint and back pain comparable to physical therapy (PT).358A systematic review and meta- analysis of RCTs found yoga to be as safe as usual care andexercise. 359No association between yoga practice and joint problems was found in a large survey of women aged 62-67. 360A review of published adverse event cases associated with yoga recommends patients with medical preconditionssuch as glaucoma or compromised bone health work withtheir physician and a quali ed yoga teacher to adapt postures. 361 Tai chi chronic painTai chi is a low-impact, mind body exercise originating inChina that has become increasingly popular in the West as aneffective exercise for rehabilitation related to multiple medicalconditions. Tai chi consists of slow prescribed movementswith attention to breathing and meditative concentration. In systematic reviews with meta-analyses, Tai chi was effective for chronic pain associated with OA. 362,363An evidence map of 107 systematic reviews on health outcomescon rmed its potential bene t for chronic pain syndromes and OA. 364Based on it' s systematic review, the American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guidelinerecommends Tai chi for chronic low back pain(cLBP). 141,222The US Department of Health and Human Services AHRQ found Tai chi effective for cLBP compared toplacebo, sham, no treatment, usual care or wait list con-trols. 145The NIH also recommends Tai chi for knee OA and bromyalgia.307In a RCT of 12 weeks of Tai chi with heart failure patients, decreased pain was among the physicalbenets reported. 365 Tai chi safetyIn a review of 153 trials, adverse events related to Tai chi werenot regularly monitored or reported. When reported, Tai chidid not result in any serious adverse events but was associatedwith minor musculoskeletal aches and pains not unlike otherforms of therapeutic movment. 366 Other movement therapies chronic pain: Alexander techni-que, Pilates and FeldenkraisAlexander technique (AT), Pilates and Feldenkrais are thera-pies developed by Frederick Alexander, Joseph Pilates andMoshe Feldenkrais, respectively. They share features of touch,directed exercise, strengthening, and awareness of posture andmuscle utilization in the treatment of pain and posturalproblems. While there are fewer studies and reviews of thesetherapies, there is preliminary evidence of bene t for chronic pain. A systematic review supported the effectiveness of AT lessons in chronic back pain. 367A large three-arm randomized trial compared usual care, usual care plusacupuncture therapy (10 sessions), and usual care plus AT(14 sessions) for chronic neck pain (median duration 6 years).The acupuncture and AT groups both led to signi cant reductions in pain and associated disability compared withusual care, with bene t persisting at 12 months following the intervention period. 368 In systematic reviews of Pilates for chronic nonspeci c low back pain, signi cant improvement in pain relief and func- tional enhancement was demonstrated.369Pilates exercise offered greater improvements in pain and functional abilitycompared to usual care and physical activity in the short termand improvements equivalent to massage therapy and otherforms of exercise for chronic low back pain (cLBP) in theshort or long term. 370A trial of post-menopausal women with cLBP compared six weeks of Pilates plus physiotherapy tophysiotherapy alone and found improvement in painmanagement and functional status with bene ts persisting after one year. 371 Feldenkrais has demonstrated bene t in chronic pain trials for neck and scapular pain in people who are visually impaired.372 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 193Alexander technique, Pilates and Feldenkrais safety Adverse events related to movement therapies are low withminor events of transient pain and muscle soreness. 368,373 -375 Frequency, Dosage and Timing of NonpharmacologicInterventions for Chronic PainA recommended course of acupuncture treatment for chronicpain will depend on the patient and the term and severity ofthe condition. In a large meta-analysis of RCTs of acupunc-ture for chronic pain of the head, neck, shoulder, low backand knee, where bene t persisted signi cantly (12 months) following a course of treatment, patients received on average8-15 treatments over 10- 12 weeks. 207In the Cochrane reviews recommending acupuncture for tension headache297 and migraine,298a minimum of six sessions was required for review. Weekly treatment was common; no trials gaveacupuncture more than twice per week. 376 In a large meta-analysis that identi ed characteristics of acupuncture treatment associated with outcome, where aver-age session time was recorded in a trial, the length of sessionaveraged 16- 45 min. 376Average needle insertion sites were 6 - 20. Increased number of needle sites treated and moresessions were associated with better outcomes. 376Therefore, referral for acupuncture therapy is recommended for at least8 sessions, and preferably 8 -15 weekly sessions of care. For a severe or acute ambulatory pain event, initial treatmentfrequency may be more than once per week. Acupuncture therapy delivered in a group setting is being studied as an option for underserved populations, 377in line with research on group medical visits.378Costs are reduced for patients and session times approximate individualpractitioner-patient encounters. Patients 'arrivals are staggered with care overlapping in a shared treatment space. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of massage therapy for pain, treatment dosage ranged from a single session of1.5 minutes to daily 40- 60 minutes sessions for 20 weeks. 308 In chronic ambulatory pain conditions, massage is usuallygiven once per week, more frequently for a severe or acuteambulatory event. Sessions are typically 45- 60 minutes, longer if elected. Number of sessions recommended is notestablished in the literature. Chiropractic and osteopathic spinal manipulation reviews evaluate varied session frequency including single sessionstrials, trials of 4-7 sessions over 2 weeks to 5 months, and upto 12 sessions or more a month with or without subsequentmaintenance. 145Once a week sessions for 4-6 weeks was slightly superior to back school or physical therapy forchronic low back pain. 379 The most studied mindfulness intervention is MBSR, which is structured as eight weekly group sessions.222,324,380 Movement therapies like Tai chi and yoga are typically g i v e ni ng r o u ps e s s i o n s ,a n dh a v eb e e ns t u d i e di nat e r mo fintervention from 1-5 sessions per week for 6 weeks to a year forTai chi 362,366and as 12 weekly sessions of 75 minutes for yoga.358 Lifestyle Behaviors and Self-Ef cacy Chronic Pain Self-ef cacy is a psychological construct based on social cognitive theory, which describes the interaction betweenbehavioral, personal and environmental factors in health andchronic disease. The theory proposes that patients 'condence in their ability to perform speci c health behaviors in fluences their engagement in and actual performance of those behav-iors, which in turn in fluences health outcomes. 365 The evidence for the impact of healthy lifestyle choices \u2014 what we eat, drink, think, feel and do \u2014on our health outcomes has become a major focus of current research.We are all born with a genome, a set of genes we inherit fromour parents. Epigenetic changes happen when genes withinour genome are turned on and off by environmental factorsbefore and after conception. Epigenetic changes have beenshown to be passed from generation to generation. Alteredgene expression rather than genetic code accounts for themajority of risks to health outcomes. The NIH cites thefollowing environmental factors as causes of epigeneticchanges: exercise, diet, nicotine, alcohol, chemical exposures,medications and stress. 381Though pain speci c studies are scarce,382there are many studies that document the relationship of healthy behaviors to improved overall healthand a reduction of diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosisand obesity, 383which are associated with pain conditions.384,385The relationships are complex, multifacto- rial and have reciprocal in fluence on each other. For example, obesity is associated with in flammation386and musculoskeletal disorders involving connective tissuestructures, including bones, joints and soft tissues of themusculoskeletal system. 387,388At the same time, persistent or severe pain impedes weight loss in patients enrolled in weightmanagement programs compared to none-to-moderatepain. 389Poor blood sugar control in type II diabetes leads to delayed healing, neuropathic pain and vascularcomplications all of which increase the dif culties that patients have with exercise that can bene t diabetic control. Optimal lifestyle choices can improve health and pain and aretantamount to healthy outcomes. Studies have shown that healthy life choices, such as dietary changes, self-engaged stress management, smokingcessation, exercise, and supportive relationships with otherscan impact depression, hypertension, heart disease, choles-terol, obesity, diabetes and prediabetes, and cancer. 390,391 Success with healthy lifestyle choices improves patient self-efcacy and is also found to improve the length of leukocyte telomeres 392associated with healthy aging and longevity.393,394 A large scale multiyear study, The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition -Potsdam Study (EPIC), studied 23,000 people for 7.8 years to evaluate the impact offour lifestyle factors on health \u2014never smoking, a BMI under 30, physical activity for at least 3.5 hours a week, and eating ahealthy diet that includes vegetables, fruit, whole grain breadand low meat consumption. 395Subjects with all four factors at baseline had reduced their risk of diabetes by 93%,myocardial infarction by 81%, strokes by 50%, and cancerby 36%, and had a 78% lower overall risk of developing achronic disease. All of these diseases impact pain andhealing. Lifestyle behaviors can affect biology as well as self-efcacy and therefore can be viewed as a key factor impacting pain. 194 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain CareNutrition and pain Nutrition science is not new and though it has long beenrecognized that nutritional status can either promote orreduce body-wide in flammation 396,397and can promote healing or inhibit it, most medical encounters for pain donot address diet in a meaningful way. As there is a growingawareness of the impact of nutritional status on overallhealth, there are more studies of nutrition and pain. 398-400 An anti-in flammatory diet is one that is high in non-starchy vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds, healthy oils andwhole grains with low levels of animal protein consumption.This type of diet balances tissue pH levels for optimalmitochondrial enzyme functioning and has been shown tohave health bene ts. 401Mitochondrial dysfunction in turn is being recognized as a root cause of many illnesses includingpain related essen- tial for optimal mitochondrial health405and the science literature thousands of articles on \"targeting antioxidants to mitochondria \"within the last 10 years alone.406 Turmeric, its derivative curcumin, and ginger, a related tuber, are extensively studied in both food and supplementform for pain patients. Turmeric is used for a wide variety ofpainful and in flammatory conditions including disease.412,413Ginger is studied for its effect on nausea414,415 but also for pain,416-418including joint pain419and primary dysmenorrhea.420Though ginger and turmeric combine the actions of plant-based antioxidants and COX inhibition theyare very well tolerated. Whereas flammatories very signi cant morbidity 421,422and mortality,67ginger and turmeric do not show the same side effects pro le.408,418,423This is likely, at least in part, because NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit theinitial step in healing which is an in flammatory one. 424A recent systematic review of curcuminoids for musculoskeletalpain found that in the studies comparing curcuminoids tononspeci c NSAIDs, the evidence was moderate to high for noninferiority of the curcuminoid intervention. 411 Curcuminoids were equal to NSAIDs in terms of painimprovement without the long-term risks related to themorbidity and mortality of NSAIDs, situating curcuminoidsas a viable oral pain medication option. Micronutrient de ciency is prevalent in the United States, 425associated with the extensive consumption of highly processed foods. Although consumption of mealsfrom fast food restaurants is decreasing, there has been acompensatory increase in retail purchase of highly processedfoods. 426Symptoms associated with de ciencies, especially when sub-clinical, are nonspeci c and include fatigue, irritability, aches and pains, decreased immune function andheart palpitations. 425Supplementation of de cient nutrients helps overall health and is being studied for its effects onpain. The following is by no means a comprehensive listingbut touches on some of the most prevalent de ciencies. Vitamin D is one of the best studied micronutrient deciencies associated with pain and delayed healing. Skin pigmentation, obesity, northern latitudes and other yetunidenti ed factors lead to Vitamin D de ciencies.Deciency of Vitamin D is often found in chronic pain sufferers, and is correlated with muscle fatigue risk factors. 427 While no de nitive mechanism for how Vitamin D influences chronic pain development is known, supplementation of Vitamin D may bene t chronic pain.428 It poses a low health risk, is well accepted, inexpensive andoffers numerous health bene ts. 429A rapid dose of Vitamin D3attenuates in flammation, epidermal structure damage, and redness from acute sunburn.430 Magnesium is also seen as a common micronutrient deciency, which is being studied for its relationship to muscle spasm, systemic in flammation, insulin resistance and diabetes, hypertension and neuropathic pain. There havebeen positive trials using magnesium infusions for migraineand many emergency rooms employ this intervention. 431,432 Magnesium has also been studied as an NMDA (N-methyl- D- aspartate) receptor blocker in the treatment of neuropathicpain. 433,434A review of the concomitant use of magnesium with opioids in animals suggests that magnesium maypotentiate opioid analgesia while also mitigating some ofthe adverse effects of opioids including the development ofhyperalgesia, improving outcomes in neuropathic pain. 435 Fish oils high in omega-3 fatty acids, also called polyunsa- turated 436A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that PUFAs at doses over 2.7 g/day for overthree months reduced NSAID consumption in rheumatoidarthritis patients. 437The North American diet is high in omega-6 fatty acids which are proin flammatory. ciency has long been recog- nized as a cause of neurological disorders including pain. Atpresent, we are only able to measure serum B12 which may ormay not re flect B12 levels in the tissues where it is active. There are over 20 recognized genetic abnormalities affectingthe cobalamin transport proteins required for intracellulardelivery of B12 to tissue targets including mitochondria.Some are severe, leading to early failure to thrive and deathand others are states where B12 is insuf cient for cellular function despite normal serum levels. 438 Other lifestyle factorsMany medications have an adverse effect on micronutrientlevels and the health of the microbiome, the mass of micro-organisms mainly housed in the gut. Elie Metchnikoff, NobelLaureate in 1908 for the discovery of cellular immunity, alsoidenti ed the microbiome as a major determinant of health. Its role in protecting optimal intestinal permeability, modu-lation of body-wide in flammation, nutrient absorption, and abdominal pain in in flammatory bowel diseases is being widely studied. 196Poor nutrition and many drugs can adversely affect the microbiome. Proton pump inhibitors(PPIs) deserve special mention in this regard since they arewidely used for prolonged periods and their negative effectson nutritional status has long been unrecognized. The FDAhas issued warnings of profound de ciencies in magnesium and calcium, B12 and protein absorption with the use of PPIs.PPIs also disrupt the microbiome and increase the risk ofpathologic dysbiosis and enteric infection such as food Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 195poisoning and Clostridium dif cile.439Long-term use of PPI medication increases risk of death.440 Important behavioral factors such as physical activity level, sleep and stress management can have direct and indirect impact on the experience of pain. Physical activity can bepractitioner or instructor directed as in physical therapy,acupuncture therapy, chiropractic, osteopathy, yoga, Taichi, or other movement systems, or it can be and often isself-directed. Physical activity has been shown to increasestrength, balance and coordination, reduce pain and improvemotor function and mood for patients with hip and kneeOA. 441-443Sleep disorders are commonly seen in pain patients. The disorders may follow or precede the onset ofpain. 444Sleeplessness has been shown experimentally to induce a generalized state of hyperalgesia, a \"bromyalgia- like syndrome\" .445Both pain and pain medications can cause sleep disorders. Sleep apnea is a risk factor for manyconditions such as diabetes and hypertension and can beaggravated by medications that are often prescribed for painpatients. Improved sleep leads to improved resilience for pain.Stress has long been reported by patients to be an aggravatorof pain. In the year 2000, the number of deaths related to poor diet and physical inactivity were 15-16% of total deaths inthe United States, while continuing to increase. 446 Economic Bene ts of Nonpharmacologic Therapies in the Treatment of Pain Full economic evaluations, reported as cost-effectivenessanalyses (CEA), cost-utility analyses (CUA), and cost-bene t analyses (CBA), often compare costs and health effectsbetween two or more therapies. 447Low back pain, knee OA and headache are among the most common and costlychronic pain conditions responsible for a signi cant economic burden on the healthcare system. There have been extensive economic evaluations of acu- puncture therapies for pain conditions. Acupuncture hasbeen shown to be cost-effective in the treatment of chronic,persistent low back pain. 28,206,211,448 -450A cost-effectiveness analysis of nonpharmacologic treatments for knee OA foundacupuncture to be one of the more clinically and cost-effective therapies using the UK National Institute for Healthand Care Excellence (NICE) QALY (quality adjusted lifeyears) thresholds 294when done alone or together with exercise-based PT.451In a large trial, acupuncture was not only effective in the treatment of neck pain but bene ts lasted beyond the three-month study duration, per internationalcost-effectiveness threshold values, showing acupuncture tobe a cost-effective treatment strategy. 292And while using acupuncture (12 treatments over three months) for migraineand chronic headache increased cost to the UK NHS healthservice, there was improved health-related quality of life overthe year that patients were followed that was favorably cost-effective compared to other NHS provided therapies. 452Similarly, the longevity of bene t for acupuncture in chronic pain was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 20 trialsand over 6,000 patients and showed that clinical bene ts of acupuncture were sustained at 12 months after a single courseof treatment. Improvements in pain were 90% sustained at 12months in trials compared to usual care and 50% sustained intrials that compared to sham, 286with implications for reduction in health care utilization over that period. Anupdate to that meta-analysis of 7 additional years of trials (39trials and 20,827 patients) con rmed previous ndings. 288 A curious and compelling nding in a large trial perform- ing a one to one propensity score match (a statisticalmatching technique that attempts to estimate the effects ofa treatment by accounting for the covariates that predictreceiving the treatment) of 58,899 patients who receivedacupuncture for bromyalgia to 58,899 who did not have acupuncture found the cumulative incidence of coronaryheart disease (CHD) was signi cantly lower in the acupunc- ture cohort independent of age, sex, comorbidities or statinsused. 453 Systematic reviews have shown manual therapy is a cost- effective treatment for adults with whiplash-associated andneck pain-associated disorders 320and is also more cost- effective for improving low back and shoulder pain thangeneral practice care that included exercise, stabilizationand/or advice. 321 An inclusive review of effective nonpharmacologic thera- pies for chronic low back pain (33 studies) found cost-effectiveness for combined physical and psychological treat-ments, medical yoga, information and education programs,acupuncture therapy and spinal manipulation. 211An earlier review of 26 studies found cost-effectiveness for treatmentsconsistent with the ACP guideline of interdisciplinaryrehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture therapy, spinalmanipulation and cognitive behavioral therapy for sub-acuteand chronic LBP. 454Group acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) was found cost-effective for bromyalgia when compared to medication in a six month RCT.455 There may be a common perception that nonpharmaco- logic therapies are an \"add on \"expense; however, an analysis of the scope of economic bene ts changes this perception. There is evidence of cost-effectiveness and cost savingsthrough avoided high tech conventional care, lower futurehealthcare utilization, and reduction of productive loss foremployers. 447A study by the State of Washington found that even with a substantial number of people using insurancebenets for nonpharmacologic therapies, the effect on insurance expenditures was modest. 118In a follow-up study of Washington state insured patients with back pain,bromyalgia and menopause symptoms, users of nonpharmacologic therapy providers had lower insuranceexpenditures than those who did not use them. 119 Finally, a cost-analysis of an interdisciplinary pediatric pain clinic found interdisciplinary treatment that included acu-puncture, biofeedback, psychotherapy and massage withmedication management reduced inpatient and emergencydepartment visits and resulted in hospital cost savings of$36,228/patient/year and in insurance cost savings of$11,482/patient/year. 456The ndings of the current cost 196 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Careanalysis support that over the course of just one year, participation in an outpatient individually tailoredinterdisciplinary pain clinic can signi cantly reduce costs by more than the cost of the intervention itself. Course of treatment and cost for inpatient acute care Inpatient acute pain care using nonpharmacologic painmodalities can engage a course of as little as one to severaltreatments, or daily treatment over the course of a hospitalstay. Inpatient acupuncture sessions can be given at a patient'sbedside and sessions can last from 20 to 45 minutes or longerand is recommended in the 24 hours before surgery, aftersurgery, and daily as requested by inpatients or their care-givers. An integrative medicine approach using yoga therapy,holistic nursing techniques and a \"healing environment \"used in inpatient oncology had an immediate term cost bene t from reduced use of antiemetic, anxiolytic and hypnoticmedication costs in the amount of $156/day/patient. Ifextrapolated to the number of patients, beds and days ofoperation for the unit studied this would result in a savings ofnearly one million dollars a year. 457 Course of treatment and costs for outpatient chronic painProjections of costs for a course of treatment of an evidence-based nonpharmacologic therapy will vary depending on thegeographic area, health system, and access to care options.First, a course of care recommendation would be based onstudies as well as systematic reviews and meta-analyses ofeffectiveness trials. Second, a recommended course of treat-ment for chronic pain will depend on the patient and theterm and severity of the condition. In a large meta-analysis of RCTs of acupuncture for chronic pain of the head, neck, shoulder, low back and knee, wherebenet persisted signi cantly (12 months) following a course of treatment, patients received on average 8 -15 treatments over 10 -12 weeks. 207In the Cochrane Reviews recommending acupuncture for tension headache297and migraine,298a minimum of six sessions was required for inclusions in the review. Weekly treatment was common; notrials gave acupuncture more than twice per week. 376Based on these studies, referral for acupuncture therapy isrecommended for at least 8 sessions, and preferably8-15 weekly sessions of care. For a severe or acute ambulatory pain event, initial treatment frequency may bemore than once per week. Acupuncture therapy costper session varies from $60 -120 458or more, with the initial session longer and higher in cost. A course of ambulatory careof 10 sessions then can range from $700.00 to $1300 or more. Acupuncture therapy delivered in a group setting is being studied as an option for underserved populations, 377in line with research on group medical visits,378and group-style self- management interventions.459Costs are reduced, with care overlapping in a shared treatment space. Group sessions canbe less than half the cost of an individual session. Chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation sessions are structured as individual care with additional costs of techni-ques like ultrasound that may be applied by an assistant.Sessions can be more than once a week to once a week formaintenance. Costs of sessions vary from $35 to $106 460or more for 30 minutes with averages $65 -$70 depending on the region of the country. Charges may increase with a-la-cartefees for interventions in addition to manipulations, such asapplications of heat or cold, for example. Massage therapy is generally offered in weekly sessions with costs varying from $60 to $90 or more for a 60-minutesession, less for shorter sessions, more for longer sessions. Feesalso depend on the site, whether a clinic, gym, spa, hotel orpractitioner 'so fce. Movement therapies like Tai chi and yoga are typically given in group sessions, and have been studied in a term ofintervention from 1-5 sessions per week for 6 weeks to a yearfor Tai chi 362,366and as 12 weekly sessions of 75 minutes for yoga.358Session fees can range from $10 -$20, with prices reduced with purchases of multiple sessions or more if privateor semi-private sessions. Similarly, sessions for Pilates,Feldenkrais or Alexander technique are paid as individualsessions or reduced if bought as a package for multiplesessions. Pilates costs anywhere from $15 -$55 for 45-minute group mat classes, $35 -$85 for group classes using equipment, and private sessions costing upwards of $50 - $150 per one-hour session. 461Feldenkrais is offered as private, semi-private or group sessions with costs varying from $50-$90 for private and $10- $25 for classes. 462Alexander technique sessions vary in cost depending on country orregion but are generally on par with massage therapy costs ifgiven in private sessions, less if given in a group setting. MBSR has been shown to be cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with low back pain. 212An eight-week course of MBSR ranges from $500 -$600 or more depending on the area of the country. In general, the costs of evidence-based nonpharmacologic options are nominal compared to medical costs of treatingchronic pain with risk mitigation and greater potential forengaging patients in ongoing self-care. Recommendations Education, Treatment, and ResearchMany in medicine and policy decision-making acknowledgethe crisis in pain and pain care detailed in this paper and seekevidence-based solutions for successful comprehensive painmanagement. Currently, most of the nonpharmacologicstrategies reviewed here are underutilized due to lack ofevidence dissemination, education and reimbursement. It istime for civilian medicine to join the call to action of militarymedicine outlined by Schoomaker and Buckenmaier in \"If not now, when? If not you, who? the immediate incorporation of effective nonpharmacologic modalities andactive self-care because of their safety, effectiveness andacceptance by patients. 463The goal in these recommendations and the call to action that follows is toincrease awareness, access and utilization of safe, effectivenonpharmacologic treatments through education ofpractitioners and patients; dissemination of andreimbursement for evidence-based treatment options; and topromote ongoing research focused on the therapeutic andeconomic impact, in the short and long term, ofcomprehensive care practices. Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain Care EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 197Education The training of physicians and healthcare providers mustinclude current pain mechanisms and all evidence-basedtreatment options for pain including effective nonpharmaco-logic options as stand-alone rst line of care and as part of individualized comprehensive pain care. This includes indi-vidualized pain care that is patient-centered and evidence-informed, and which assumes the following: (1) Patient-centered care focuses on each person's unique healthcare needs and experiences by asking a. How do you manage pain now and in the past? b. What nonpharmacologic strategies have you used? c. What are you interested in exploring? (2) Practitioners should become familiar with nonpharmaco- logic modalities and licensed independent practitioners in their system and or area of practice. Treatment: nonpharmacologic therapy frequency, dosageand timingWhile physicians are familiar with of medications,evidence-informed frequency, \"dosage \"and timing of nonphar- macologic therapies is less well disseminated. For inpatient care daily care is recommended, or every other day when staggered with another available nonpharmacologic intervention. In acuteextreme pain that is not well managed, a second same or differenttreatment may be needed in a single day. Evidence-based nonpharmacologic options for inpatient acute pain care include: (1) Acupuncture therapy, massage therapy, mind body inter- ventions and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation(TENS). (2) Daily inpatient access to effective nonpharmacologic care is recommended. Evidence-based nonpharmacologic options for chronic pain include: (1) Acupuncture therapy, chiropractic and osteopathic care, massage therapy, physical therapy, mind body and move-ment therapies and cognitive behavioral therapy. (2) Referral to a course of effective nonpharmacologic care is recommended. Recommendations and referral must take into account a patient's unique presentation and circumstances in terms ofaccess and coverage. Even when not covered by insurance, acourse of nonpharmacologic treatment may have a longitudeof bene t that exceeds short-term bene t of medications that are accompanied by adverse events and addiction liability. Research The call for research includes further study on the timing,dosage, frequency, longitude and combinations of care in thedevelopment of a comprehensive pain care model for boththe inpatient and outpatient setting.SECTION 3: CALL TO ACTIONAs detailed in this paper, documented in the literature andaccepted by health professionals and researchers, the crisis inpain care and aspects of current pain management strategies arehaving enormous detrimental impacts on patients, the healthsystem and society. 1,2In response to the grim statistics about pain care and the opioid epidemic, health care professionals,policy makers, researchers and mu ltiple major health organiza- tions and government agencies ar e moving in the right direction. The IOM, 1NAM,2NIH,4the CDC,193The Joint Commission,194the military,463the FDA,195the ACP,141and the former US Surgeon General464concede that past strategies and the use of opioid medications have not remedied but ratherexacerbated chronic pain, abuse, ad diction, illness behavior and disability and call for evidence-based, comprehensive pain care,to include nonpharmacologic therapies. While there is consensus that pain care must drastically improve and prioritize evidence-based nonpharmacologic treat-ments, there is a need for an informed strategy that includes allevidence-based and comprehensive pain care. Currently, most ofthe nonpharmacologic strategies outlined in the precedingreview are underutilized due to inadequate dissemination ofevidence, professional and public education and inadequatereimbursement. The Consortium Pain Task Force Goals in a Call to Action Are To. increase awareness of effective nonpharmacologic treatments for pain train healthcare practitioners and administrators in the evidence base of effective nonpharmacologic practice advocate for policy initiatives that remedy system and reimbursement barriers to evidence-informed compre- hensive pain care and promote ongoing research and dissemination of the role of effective nonpharmacologic treatments in pain, focused on the short and longterm therapeutic and economic impact of comprehensive carepractices. This paper is a call to action for policy makers, hospitals and health systems, insurers, primary care providers and other licensed health practitioners and health careeducators to lead in effecting this change. POLICY: Federal and State policy should increase access to and reimbursement for evidence-based nonpharmacologictherapiesBased on the literature, stakeholders must petition andsupport evidence-based policy guidelines to increase accessto and coverage for nonpharmacologic options as an essentialpart of comprehensive pain care. Federal policy Currently, there is evidence of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, cost-savings and risk mitigation for evi- dence-based nonpharmacologic options. Nonpharmacologictherapies for pain are now recommended by the NIH, FDA,TJC, CDC and ACP. Federal reimbursement policy needs tobe based on current evidence of effectiveness, cost-effective-ness and risk mitigation, and include nonpharmacologic care. 198 EXPLORE May/June 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Evidence-Based Nonpharm Pain CareState policy States need to adopt policies of coverage and plans for access to pain care based on current evidence of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, cost-savings and risk miti-gation that includes effective nonpharmacologic therapies.Policy should require private insurers to cover evidence-based nonpharmacologic the rapies for acute and chronic pain. BEST PRACTICES: Identify and develop clinical models that integrate evidence-based nonpharmacologic therapiesfor painDevelop, optimize, incentivize and coordinate care acrossdisciplines with nondiscriminatory access to evidence-basednonpharmacologic therapies, as stand-alone rst line of care and as essential part of comprehensive care. EDUCATION: Deliver evidence-based training to learners and graduates of the healthcare system in alldisciplines on pain and effective nonpharmacologictreatments for painAs recommended by the National Academy of Medicine(NAM), pain-related education for all health professionalswho provide care to people with pain must become a nationalmandate. 82Academic healthcare education should train students and health practitioners on the evolvingunderstanding of pain and its complexities, includingphysical and psychiatric comorbidities and substance usedisorder (SUD) as well as evidence-based frequency,\"dosage\" and timing of effective nonpharmacologic therapies. Healthcare practitioners require education andpractical changes in practice models to enable them to beresponsible to inform and educate patients on evidence-basedcomprehensive models of pain care including self-ef cacy, patient responsibility, self-care and lifestyle choices. RESEARCH: Identify and fund research to evaluate health outcomes and economic impact of comprehensivepain care that includes effective nonpharmacologictherapiesThe call for research includes studies on the timing, dosage,frequency, longitude of bene t, and combinations of care in the development of a comprehensive pain care model forboth the inpatient and outpatient setting. NIH, NCCIH,AHRQ, CMS, and other agencies and foundations shouldseek to fund investigation of comprehensive models of paincare and their impact on health outcomes, potential opioidsparing and reduction of opioid liability overuse anddependency. DISSEMINATION: Stakeholder groups need to engage the media and foster public awareness of comprehensive paincare options that include evidence-basednonpharmacologic therapiesAcademic organizations, pain societies, medical societies,patient advocacy groups, insurance carriers and the mediahave important roles in the dissemination and education oftheir members and the public regarding the bene ts of nonpharmacologic options of pain care. Disseminationfacilitates general and individual patient- practitioner conver- sations on options for personal comprehensive pain care. APPENDIX A.
