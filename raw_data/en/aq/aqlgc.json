Whether it's acupuncture or overall mindfulness, I would absolutely recommend him and his practice to anyone in the area! December 1, 2020 - A doctor I look forward to seeing! Dr. Olden's holistic approach combined with his medical knowledge and experience is effective and reassuring. It hits a sweet spot in health management. His willingness to take the time to truly listen is refreshing and the result has put me on a better path both physically and mentally. December 1, 2020 - Aaron is the real deal! As someone who knew very little about acupuncture and was even more hesitant, Aaron has been wonderful about explaining the process. Aaron is also great at listening and treating the whole person. November 30, 2021 - From the moment you walk into Dr. Olden's office, you feel more at ease. The atmosphere is calm, clean and relaxing. Dr. Olden listens and is genuinely interested in what you have to say. I felt very comfortable with the treatment provided, and left feeling encouraged and relaxed. Anyone interested in incorporating acupuncture into their wellness routine would do well to seek treatment from Dr. Olden. I feel lucky to have access to his great care and wealth of knowledge. Highly recommended! December 1, 2020 - Aaron is relatable, a wonderful listener, and exceptionally knowledgeable in his field. He consistently invites feedback and allows you to be a contributing part of the process. I highly recommended to anyone and everyone! December 1, 2020 - What a fantastic experience. I recently was prescribed meds for anxiety and depression and quickly realized they were not for me. I was fortunate enough to find Dr. Olden who has been treating me for over a month with acupuncture. My depression is gone and the anxiety is minimal. I can not say enough about the professionalism and knowledge Dr. Olden demonstrates during my appointments. It is a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere with tremendous results. I am so grateful to Dr. Olden for my spectacular results!!! December 1, 2019 - Dr Olden provides excellent acupuncture treatments but that is only part of the amazing care he provides. He treats the entire patient to ensure all of your questions are answered, every pain and stress ailment is addressed and he diligently works to adjust treatments for optimal results. After suffering for over a year with chronic pain, trying 6 prescriptions, having 4 injections, countless tests and seeing many specialist doctors, only working with Dr. Olden has given me relief and I feel I have an advocate to help me. March 1, 2021 - I have had chronic osteoarthritis hip and leg pain, and therefore sleeplessness, for almost two years. Physical therapy in the past seemed to be working but never felt a significant ongoing improvement. Granted a cortisone shot did help but I did not want to rely on an ongoing regime of cortisone. This lead me to research alternative practices. My primary care doctor recommended Dr. Aaron Olden for acupuncture. I have been seeing Dr. Olden every other week for two months. His office itself projects the calmness and consideration that you immediately feel when you meet Dr. Olden. Each visit, he listens attentively to my pain concerns and intentions for recovery. Dr. Olden then incorporates this into his acupuncture procedures all the while explaining what he is doing and the desired outcomes. In addition, he provides valuable resources to aid in the progression of recovery. I am slowly seeing and feeling a steady improvement in the level of pain and tightness. The headway we have achieved is so promising, if only I had looked to acupuncture earlier. I can completely recommend Dr. Olden, as he is professional, knowledgeable and truly dedicated to his profession.
