The three people were between 20 -30 years old & not vaccinated against meningococcal disease. They were born outside of Canada in countries that do not provide childhood meningococcal vaccination. Sadly, one person died. What is Meningococcal Disease? Caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis . Some people carry this bacteria in their throat or nose without getting sick. In rare cases ,it causes serious illness including an infection in the brain, spinal cord and/or blood, as well as other health complications. Mostly affects children under five years old, teens and young adults who are not vaccinated for the disease.How it Spreads Direct, close contact with saliva or mucus from someone who has the disease. Examples: kissing , coughing or sneezing, sharing food or drinks, sharing toothbrushes, cigarettes, or living in the same household. Not spread through casual contact or by breathing air where someone with meningococcal disease has been. Can spread up to seven days before becoming sick and until 24 hours after starting the appropriate antibiotic.Symptoms Vaccination is Your Best Protection The meningococcal vaccine does not contain live bacteria and cannot give you meningococcal disease. Common side effects include pain and redness where the vaccine was given, headache, as well as feeling tired or unwell for a short time after getting the vaccine. In rare cases, serious allergic reactions may occur but they can be treated and are usually temporary. The vaccine is safe and effective with no long-term side effects.Need Health Advice?
