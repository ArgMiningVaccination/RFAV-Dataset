Nothing is more sacred than this high form. Novalis Dear Colleagues, This year our annual conference will focus on the question of the relationship between the I and its body. The living body is the place, already predisposed at the beginning of creation, where the immortal core of the human being establish - es itself, giving the body its individual imprint. T he body is, as Novalis puts it, the only true tem - ple in the world. The task of the art of healing is to put an abnormal relationship of the I to its body into a more harmonious one. Thus the title of this year's annual conference of the Medical Section is \"Body and I - The immune system and autoimmune diseases\". The human I pen - etrates its body in the form of the \"I-organisa - tion\". This is expressed in an outstanding way in the de velopment, individualisation and lifelong adaptability of the immune system. Its central function is to distinguish and demarcate the interior of the body from the exterior, its own bodily substance from that which is alien. Au - toimmune diseases are a good example of what c an happen when the body turns alien. Their frequency has been steadily increasing in re - cent decades with the growing influence of the \"w estern lifestyle\". Numerous lectures and case reports will address the topic, which will be ex - plored in depth in 26 workshops. This year, too, the conference has three parts. In seven specialist conferences - for medicine and pharmacy, midwifery, eurythmy therapy, body therapy, nursing, psychotherapy and den- tistry - the professional groups will work on their own topics. The focus of the conference on spiritual deepening will be the 11th class lesson, which will look at the structure of the body and the temple motif from an esoteric perspective, work on the Foundation Stone Meditation and on the Gospels. The multiprofessional conference will focus on the conference topic with speakers from over 15 countries worldwide. The develop- ment and pathology of the immune system will be presented with regard to the joint therapeutic activity on the patient, and there will be an ex - change of therapeutic experiences between the professional groups. A special highlight of the annual conference will be the handing on of the Section leadership to the incoming leadership team. This year, too, we would like to encourage you to work with the texts below in preparation for the conference. The World Group here offers an international forum that is preparing the ground for the gathering at the Goetheanum in world - wide online meetings and local working groups (contact: sophia.wittchow@medsektion-ikam.org).

Who is here wrestling with whom? How can the various aspects of genet - ic predisposition, specific environmental factors, ps ychosocial stresses and personal moments of destiny be meaningfully related to each other? 100 years ago, Rudolf Steiner gave the lec - ture \"The invisible human being within us\" (GA 221), which had a de fining influence on Anthro - posophic Medicine. In it, a systematic under - standing of the human being unfolds which illustrat es how the spiritual core of the human being penetrates and shapes the visible body with four differentiated force currents. Follow - ing the traces of these invisible currents, we aim to understand immunological phenomena such as autoreaction and self-tolerance, and in doing so will steer typological constellations of the human constitutional elements to the concrete remedy on the basis of a patient presentation from Klinik Arlesheim. Pharmaceutically, the challenge that must be met time and again is to find a bridge from the individual healing requirement to the substanc- es of nature. How do the various kingdoms of nature and pharmaceutical preparations show themselves against the background of the \"in- visible human being\"? Especially for patients with autoimmune diseases, it seems essential not only to reintegrate the self-alienated nature of their own body, but also to enable a healing connection to external nature. We warmly invite you to this specialist confer- ence prepared jointly by pharmacists and phy - sicians. In terms of teaching methodology, we strive for different formats with lectures, work in small groups, keynote and discussion units as well as a panel discussion. In medico-pharma - ceutical workshops, we aim to bring the natural substances and the pharmaceutical processing methods to direct experience. We look forward to living work together!

Sonja von Hees 12.30 Lunch br eakNursing takes place in the intermediate spaces. Between injury and healing, awakening and sleep-ing, inside and outside, patient and physician, between relatives. In the in-between it is mostly invisible. It appears when it is missing. Nursing lives in time. In our health systems, dominated by economic and financial constraints, time is a cost factor and nursing care is reduced to the performance of medical and administrative pro- cedures. Ever more colleagues are leaving this system that does not see and rejects the reasons for which nurses have chosen this profession. Now, complaining does not get us any further. But encouraging examples of new beginnings and of the transformation of existing situations through inner strength do. In this respect we want to follow different avenues in our confer - ence. Being inspired and motivated by innovative anthroposophical nursing initiatives Sophie Martin will talk about a unique nursing project in France. A country where complemen- tary medicine is under severe attack. Fiona Bay has worked with emergency educa- tion teams and with Doctors Without Borders in various crisis zones around the world. Working with people affected by war and terror, running hospitals, organising aid.Tracing the personal nursing and biographical path of development What led me into nursing? What separates me from this impulse? How does what I have experienced accompany me on my further path? Deborah Bednarek introduces this topic and leads the \"Bi - ography and Occupation\" workshop. Tapping inner strengths and surviving frenzied everyday life Deadening or becoming inwardly worn out? This is a question that many nurses are confronted with. How can we preserve our vulnerability? How can compassion be transformed into an organ of per - ception? A workshop with Rolf Heine will consider thes e questions. Implementing Anthroposophic Nursing in a non-anthroposophical setting Colleagues all over the world are undergoing further training in Anthroposophic Nursing. How - ever, there are relatively few anthroposophical settings in which nurses can be employed. What opportunities are there to join forces? How can what has been learned also be applied in a non-anthroposophical environment? Christoph von Dach explores this question in his workshop. We hope to see participants from all over the world at this international conference for nurses. It is the prelude to two more exciting multiprofes - sional conferences, whose attendance we warmly recommend.9 8Anthroposophic Nursing Specialist conference Eurythmy Therapy Describing - moving - discussing the health of the immune system At the centre of the international specialist con- ference on eurythmy therapy is the health of the immune system. The focus is on two of the much-used sequences TSRMA and LAOUM, which will be examined from as many perspectives as possible. In addition to movement, the focus this year will also be on the experiences of colleagues from around the world in practice and the joint exchange of ideas. We were able to attract Annette Wei\u00dfkircher (research and experiences in allergic rhinopathy), Norman Kingeter and Rob Schapink (results of archival research) to provide historical back -ground information and information from practi - cal research. Following this specialist conference, we rec- ommend attending the conference on spiritual deepening and the multiprofessional conference. In the multiprofessional conference, the confer - ence topic will be discussed together with physi-cians and other therapists. We look forward to seeing you!

The inter - national specialist group of psychotherapists will addr ess those disruptive and damaging influences in childhood and adolescence that can predispose to later illness. In particular, some barely visible educational errors lead to serious illness later on. The manifestation of a somatic autoimmune disease depends on additional, individual factors. However, the same disruptive influences predispose to both psychosomatic and mental illnesses. Since the concern is particularly to uncover the hidden harms, the development in childhood and adoles - cence will be examined from a psychological, med - ical as well as educational perspective. We will also w ork on how effective prevention and therapy can be achieved through interdisciplinary cooperation.12 Sept - Tuesday 15.00 Joint start of the conference Welcome Matthias Girke, Georg Soldner Formation of the body - an instrument of destiny Lecture Karin Michael, Marion Debus 16.30 Coffee break 17.15 Opening of psycho therapy- conference, Henriette Dekkers Keynote presentation: Attacks on child development Hartmut G Horn Keynote presentation: Breakdown of identity in soul and body in adolescence Giovanna Bettini Work in small groups: Experiences from professional practice Collation of responses by the organising committee 18.30 Evening break 20.00 For all specialist conferences When the body turns alien Bernadette Gollmer, Rolf Heine, Corinne Horan Conclusion with eurythmy13 Sept - Wednesday 08.30 Opening with mantr a The South American Psycho - ther apy Conference ELAPA - the power of community building \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez, Patricia Botelho Preview of the structure of the day Henriette Dekkers, Hartmut G Horn 09.00 S econd admission for in-person participants 09.15 Under standing deeper developmental needs of the first 21 years Lecture with discussion Adam Blanning 10.30 C offee break 11.15 T he global rise of auto - immune dis eases - the mental vulnerability of children and young people Keynote presentations Vasuprada Kartic, Swapna Narendra, Carlos Guio 12.30 Lunch break 15.00 S ystematic disruption of development due to school con - s traints, smartphones, media plat - f orms, advertising, consumption The teacher Wilfried Kessler inter - viewed by Hartmut Horn Que stions from participants and discussion 16.30 C offee break 17.15 T he global rise of toxic stress and anxiety - General increase in mental disorders in children and adolescents - Approaches to healing Meron Barak, Ioulia Ventouratou 18.30 E vening break 20.00 F or all specialist conferences How the body becomes familiar The embryonic envelopes Natalie Hurst Birth Daniela Zahl Embodiment in childhood and adolescence Jan Vagedes Conclusion with eurythmy14 Sept - Thursday 08.30 Opening with mantr a The healing effect of community building on the global disease of social isolation Susan Overhauser Preview of the structure of the day Henriette Dekkers, Hartmut G Horn 09.00 S econd admission for in-person participants 09.15 Pr esentation of the results of the work in small groups on Tuesday Vasuprada Kartic, Henriette Dekkers, John Lees Worldwide initiatives for the return to health of body, soul and spirit in adolescence - Short presentations by: IYP Programme, J\u00e4rna / offee break 11.15 Cr eating new community building in family systems - fostering social security and identity formation among adolescents Henriette Dekkers Review of the conference results, outlook Henriette Dekkers, Hartmut HornThe conference will be held both in person in the Terrassensaal and online.

Their dwelling becomes part of themselves. It becomes their life. The placenta is created before the unborn and born after them. It is located in counterspace and in this way is connected with the other world. The working hypothesis for this conference is that the placenta with its envelopes remains active for humans in a differentiated and communicable way even after its organic disappearance. What effects of forces still remain part of us? We invite all midwives to look at, study and reflect on these issues in different ways. We wish you wonderful, busy and inspiring autumn days. For the Association for Anthroposophic Midwifery and the International Coordination of Anthropos - ophic Medicine: Merja Riij\u00e4rvi. WS 1: Workshop for the exhausted and for all generations of midwives: \"Drama and music\". (Christian and Susann Breme) (DE / EN) Christian Breme is a Waldorf teacher, sculptor and illustrator and the author of the play \"The unborn make themselves known\". It can be re- hearsed and performed in a very short time even without acting experience. The play is based on the stories of parents and their dreams and wak - ing dreams of the approaching being of the child. The cellist Gotthard Killian will participate in the workshop. There will be improvisation with voice and instruments. Music by Arvo P\u00e4rt will frame the production. Those who wish can bring their musical instruments along. WS 2: Workshop for those thirsty for knowledge: \"Textual work and art\" (Daniela Zahl and Georg M\u00fcller) (DE / EN) Textual work and art on the subject of the placen - ta. How do we look at the embryonic envelopes? W here and how did Rudolf Steiner speak about this? What is the importance for us in the midwife - ry profession? In this group we will approach the t opic through reflection and artistically. Georg M\u00fcller will guide us to the violet glass window in the large auditorium of the Goetheanum. The workshop is a unique opportunity to understand and incorporate the embryonic envelopes into our midwifery work. Literature for preparation. WS 3: Workshop for practitioners. \"Emergency management of the placental phases\" (DE / EN) There are transitions between physiology and pathology that can be identified. It is important to be alert here and, if necessary, to act appropri- ately. Such presence of mind can be specifically practised. What help does the child need and when? What to do if the child can no longer man- age? What follow-up is required postpartum if the child has experienced an intrauterine placental emergency? Bring your experiences and insights and be inspired by each other. It will be highly interesting and specific.Conference languages see individual workshopsWS 4: Workshop for cultural anthropologists and multiculturalists. \"The cultural meaning of the placenta\" (Merja Riij\u00e4rvi, Carina Barreto) (DE / EN / ES) The approach to the placenta differs in many cul- tures. While placenta burial often takes place in African countries, in Germany it mainly ends up in the waste. In this workshop we want to look at how the placenta is approached in different cul- tures and thus develop a way of dealing with the placenta that is appropriate to its nature. What can we do as midwives to introduce a new under - standing into society?15Midwifery 14Specialist conference Anthroposophic Body Therapy How do we heal - what is effective? \"The will to heal cannot be achieved by an inner commandment, but can only be achieved by devoted behaviour of the soul in the world.\" Rudolf SteinerIn the first half of the conference, we will work together in small groups as well as in the ple- nary session on the basis of a case report from the spectrum of immunology. With practical ex - ercises as well as demonstrations of treatment approaches, we want to promote reciprocal per - ception and individual professional exchange. Adam Blanning will give a keynote lecture on the topic: \"Being in harmony with oneself - How the lower senses in childhood support upright - ness for life.\" In the two units that follow, Hannie Bakker and Frank Sloot will encourage us to look further: hu- man physical development, its relationship with the development of the I in the biography and the associated development of immunity.

Andrea Scheer-Nagy M4 Singing in the western stairwell (DE/EN) This course is for everyone who would like to sing! Singing brings us into contact with our-selves, with our voice as our very own potential. In the course you can experience how choral singing can playfully and largely unconsciously convey community-building resonance on a so-cial, spiritua l and on a f unctional-organ ic level. Exercises from the school f or uncove ring the voice of Val borg Werbeck-Sv\u00e4rdstr\u00f6m stimulate the perception of tone, breathing a nd sounds and enliven the voice and strength immunity. Viola Heckel M5 Bothmer\u00ae gymnastics s imple exerc ises, we will explore the question of whether Bothmer\u00ae gymnastics can strengthen the immune forces. Please bring eurythmy shoes. Gudrun Rehberg M6 Loheland gymnastics (DE/EN) With the Loheland movement train ing we want to strengthen our physical and mental life forces at the start of the day. Movement processes of breathing rhythms open our hearts and allow us to exper ience space as well as social together - ness through diverse forms of movement. Please bring comfortable clothing and gym shoes. Sabine PodehlSpiritual deepening Workshops and Class lessons Thursday, 17.15-18.30 / Friday, 09.15-10.30The two units of the workshops build on one another. 1.The meditations of the 11th lecture of the meditative path of knowledge of the Michael School (DE) (For members of the first class of the School of Spiritual Science) Free renderin g of the class lesson on Thursday with conversation on the meditations of the 11th class lesson on Friday. Dr med Matthias Girke 2.The meditations of the 11th lecture of the meditative path of knowledge of the Michael School (EN) (For members of the first class of the School for Spiritual Science) Free-form class lecture on Thursday with con- versation on the meditations of the 11th class lecture on Friday. Adam Blanning MD 3.Forming the T emple (DE / EN) (For members of the first class of the School of Spiritual Science) We will move the essential content of Rudolf Steiner's 11th cl ass lesson togeth er and in doing so also apply ide as and exercises from Spacial Dynamics\u00ae. Jaimen McMillan, Christina Spitta 4.Gospel work (DE) This year in our work on spiritual deepening we want to look at the topic of community building in the Gospels and Luke's Acts of the Apostles. We are guided by the question of the spiritual dimen- sion of the community and its significance for the art of healing. To this end we will deepen selected text passages in a joint dialogue. The goal is torecognise where and in what form com munity building is described in the Gospels. In doing so, we can experienc e that in w orking toge ther on and with these texts, communit y building also begins on a higher level. Georg Soldner 5.Getting to know Vidar CANCELLED! as a guide in the etheric (EN) The new archang el once known by the name Vi- dar provides the etheric sheath for Christ in our time. This being has been an important figure in ancient mysteries and is an important figure in the future mysteries which already begin. How can we develop a relationship t o this being? The activity of Vidar throughout the ages will be explored along wi th his activity in our time, in- cluding his relationship with Michael and C hrist. Vidar is known not only in Norse my thology as the silent Aesi r who overcomes the Fenris Wolf (Ahriman), but also as the angel of Gautama Bud- dha (see GA 121). Susan Overhauser PhD 6.Recollection, stillness of soul and imagination (DE) We want to work with and on the three prompts to practice of the Foundati on Stone Meditation \"Practice spirit recollection - Practice spirit con- templation - Practice spirit v ision\". It is about remembering and forgetting, stillness of s oul and movement of soul, and about becoming con- scious of imaginations. Rolf Heine21 207.Foundation Stone Meditation (EN) Exchange after motion research in the three cos - mic planes. Because of their relationship with our willing, f eeling and thinking, we can connect here with the magic powers of depth, circumfer - ence and height. In the horizontal plane, the great s ecret lies in the attunement between lungs and heart, where cosmic rhythms connect with pulse and blood rhythm. In the rhythm of the solar year , the small human br eath rhythm is harmonically connected with the greatest rhythm of the w orld br eath. \"For Christ's will rules in the surround - ing sphere / Granting grace to souls in cosmic rh ythms\". Hannie Bakker 8.Introduction to the School of Spiritual Science (DE) This workshop is addressed to everyone who wants to familiarise themselves with the School of Spiritual Science and the schooling path o f the c lass lessons. No previous knowledge is necessary. Dr med Marion Debus 9.Introduction to the School of Spiritual Science (EN) The working group is intended for anyone who wants to get acquainted with the School for Spir - itual Science and the path of s chooling within the clas s lessons. Previous experience is not required. Michelle Vette 10. Guided tour of the Rudolf St einer Atelier - October 1924 to March 192 5 (DE, Thursday only) Meditative reflection on the last period in Rudolf Steiner's life, his work and intentions, as well as his support from Ita Wegman, at the location ofthe historical events, of his dying and death. Prof Dr med Peter Selg 11.Rudolf Steiner Atelier, October 1924 until March 1925 (EN, Friday only) Meditative reflection on Rudolf Steiner's last pe- riod of life, his works and intentions as well as his accompaniment by Ita Wegman at the place of the historical event, his death and dying. Prof Dr med Peter SelgFriday, 17.15 \u2014 18.30 / Saturday 11.15 \u2014 12.30 and 17 .15 \u2014 18.00 damage. In this interdisciplinary seminar, we want to report on our therapeutic experiences with the various symptom patterns using anthro- posophic medicines, mistletoe, - thermia, therapeutic eurythmy and art therapies, and enter into an exchange of experiences with you as colleagues. Philipp Busche, Prof Dr Harald Matthes 14. Sepsis and inflammation: bases of understanding and anthroposophical medical therapy (DE) Sepsis is a severe, increasingly frequent and life-threatening disease caused b y infections with bacteria or fungi. What causes a local infec- tion to develop into a hyperinflammation that en- dangers the entire organism? How can we under - stand this pathology in greater depth? What can help to prevent the development of severe sepsis and how can it be treated by anthroposoph ical medicine once it is here? What is helpful for a comprehensive r ecovery a nd c onvalescence? What role do t he various a nthroposophica l med- ical therapies (medication, external applications, rhythmical Einreibung / massage, eurythmy ther - apy, art therapy ...) play in the different phases? We intend to explore these questions in the workshop. It is primarily aimed at physicians and nursing professionals, but is also open to oth er interested therapists. Dr med Thomas Breitkreuz, Ruth M\u00fcnch Multiprofessional conference Workshops The units of each workshop build on one another. 12. T ype 1 diabetes as an aut oimmune dis ease - What is helpful from the perspective of those affected? (DE) People with autoimmune type 1 diabetes are de- pendent on self-dosing their insulin substitution - a full-time job - for the rest of their lives; oth- er areas of life can easily be neglected. Approx. 380,000 people are currently living with t his di- agnosis in Germany, and the trend is rising sharp- ly! We would like to exchange ideas about ways to reduce the risk of the disease and its many se- quelae. What do those affected want from anthro- posophically working physicians and therapists? What is your experience with this diseas e? We present two interprofessional, multimodal, an- throposophically inspired concepts - for children and adolescents and for adults. We look forward to your feedback! Dr phil Bettina Berger, Elvira Menne 13. Long Covid and post-vac syndrome - a therapeutic challenge in the interdisciplinary setting (DE/EN) Long Covid and post-vac syndromes repre sent dys regulation in resp onse the SARS CoV-2 virus or their spike protein epitopes upon vaccinati on. The clini cal spectrum ranges from headaches, joint and limb pain to neurolog- ical disorders, cardiac and pul monary changes, ME / CFS and severe muscle disorders. This leads to the formation of adrenergic agonistic autoan- 2215. Perioperative changes of the immune system (DE) An invitation from the Anthroposophical Perioper - ative Medicine Working Group: The immune system under goes major changes perioperatively, which can be of decisive importance for the postopera - tive outcome. In the first part we want to deal with the question of the influence of surgery and an - aesthesia on the immune system and which spe - cial features we see in the perioperative structure o f the human constitutional elements. What can organ loss or implants mean for this structure? In the second part we will ask specialists about perioperative topics such as nutrition and micro - biome, antibiotic administration and changes inmeridian f low, and in the third part we will look at therapeutic options from different professions . Dr med Luisa Peter, Dr med Sonny Jung 16. FeverApp and FeverFriend app: Workshop to optimise them for global effectiveness, in- cluding the own experiences of participants (EN) In almost every place in the world, the manage- ment of fever is characterised by excessive use of medication and irrational fears. On the other hand, there is a lack of awareness of danger. Many families practice a management that appreciates fever as support for the immune system - and consume highly significantly fewer antibiotics and antipyretics with higher satisfaction. With this in mind, David Martin and Henrik Szo ke have developed a program to optimize the manage- ment of fever worldwide. (www.feverapp.de, www. feverfriend.eu) In the workshop we will share the results of the last years, collect personal expe-riences with the participants and develop ideas to optimise the apps for a worldwide application. Prof Dr med David Martin, Dr Henrik Szo ke PhD17.The development of the immune system in the context of nutrition and the microbiome (DE/EN) There is no doubt that the development and function of the immune system is related to our microbiome, which in turn is related to nutrition. A varied diet with fresh fruit and vegetables, high-quality oils and no additives promotes ahigh diversity in the microbiome and thus a high level of immunological competence. Similarly the quality of the food, the way it is grown and even the microbiome of the soil have a decisive influence. We focus on the connections of caring for the earth, plants and animals with nutrition, strength and health. There are specialist inputs, discussions and exercises. Dr med Karin Michael, Dr Jasmin Peschke 18. Potentised organ prepar ations in the tr eatment of autoimmune diseases (DE/EN) In the treatment of autoimmune diseases, the potentised organ preparations of Anthropos ophic Medicine hav e proved to be valuable medicinal products. In the workshop, Markus Sommer and Georg Soldner report on this topic from their many years of practical experience. The workshop offers opportunities for an exchange of views and a deeper understanding of this therapeutic option. Reports from own experience can be contribut ed as w ell as questions about own patients. Georg Soldner, Dr med Markus Sommer 19. Spirituality and its impact on the im- mune system with a focus on oncology (DE/ES) What experience have we gained in this regar d in our w ork? How can we support people to whom their own spirituality is still alien or not acces - sible? The field of oncology in particular needst o deal with these experiences. In my work I ex - perience that the creative process can be in the cr eatively artistic sphere as well as in the insight into new thoughts, which open up this space of spirituality in the person and thereby have an immunologically strengthening effect. We will im - merse ourselves in the topic in dialogue and with simple eur ythmy exercises that are manageable for everyone. \"The person who does not drink, eat or breathe dies, the person who does not perceive their spirituality falls ill or dies!\" - to summarise Willigis J\u00e4ger. Joseph Ulrich, Susana Ulrich 20. Autoimmune diseases and their treatment with important anthroposophic remedies (EN) Through phenomenologi cal observations and demonstrations of important healing substances and their pharmaceutical t ransformation in an- throposophic remedies, w e try to build up an in- ner picture of healing remedies. A deeper under- standing of their effects should be gained based on impressive experiences and case reports with these remedies that work in the threefold human organism. Kan-anek Kaewthaweesab MD MSc, Albert Schmidli 21. Hay fever in movement (DE / EN) Allergic rhiniti s is the most common allergic disease. Interactively, we move ex ercises from eurythmy the rapy, work on aspects of the un- derstanding of the human being a nd present research on the topic. Comfo rtable shoes and clothing are advised. Dr med Markus Kr\u00fcger, Prof Annette Wei\u00dfkircher22. Speech and bowel - On the inter - dis ciplinary treatment of ulcerative c olitis and Cr ohn's disease through integrativ e gas troenterology and ther apeutic speech (DE) Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases can be physically explained by a kind of immunological dysregulation. Central to the patient's experienc e is the health y integration of the lower human be - ing. In the three units, we take an interdisciplinary appr oach to understanding and treating these in - creasingly common disease entities. Starting from the t ypical phenomena of how they manifest, we translate two essential concepts of Anthroposoph - ic Medicine into practice by means of exercises and patient e xamples. Dr med Leonhard Knittel, Dietrich von Bonin 23. Positive health in biographical perspective (NL / EN) Last year Machteld Huber opened the conferenc e with the t opic Positive Health and show ed us the spider w eb diagram she developed as a conver - sation tool. Human autonomy is central to this . I us e this same spider web model in my 'Positive health in biographical perspective' courses. Her e the par ticipant examines his / her health po tential in a group setting. Each time we treat one o f the six theme s: bodily functions, mental well-being, meaning, quality of life, participation and daily functioning. On the basis of questions per topic about the past, about the present and what the improvement wishes are per topic, participants arrive at new steps to improve their health. The working method is that participants first write down the answers to the questions, and then read it aloud to the group. A maximum of listening and a minimum of reacting is the rule of the game and Multiprofessional conference Multiprofessional conference 25 24offers a safe setting. This workshop offers an ex - perience with this course concept. Hannie Bakker, Frank Sloot 24. Not all warmth is the same - Ho w do warmth therapies differ qualitatively? (DE / EN) Mistletoe therapy and whole-body hyperthermia were developed simultaneously in the twentieth century. Both are used not only in cancer ther - apy, but also in numerous autoimmune diseases. Oil dispersion baths and local heat applications are also effective for autoimmune diseases. How do these therapeutic approaches differ - how can they support each other? Dr med Marion Debus, Rolf Heine, Ute Heitz,Beate Motte 25. The spleen in Anthroposophic Medi- cine - Spiritual scientific understanding of the organs, current physiological resear ch and ther apeutic aspects (DE/EN) The spleen - as a central organ of the immune system - has been perceived as a \"mysterious or - gan\" for thousands of years. In this workshop w e want t o develop Rudolf Steiner's understanding of the spleen by means of keynote contributions and deepen it with the help of scientific studies. Together we will work out consequences for thera - peutic practice up to and including concrete reme - dies. In this context we will also turn to the \"spleen mas sage\" with its indication and execution. Dr med Johannes Weinzirl, Dr med Tom Scheffers 26. Biography work in the house of our life strengthens our experience of self and oursense of community (DE/EN) We are increasingly losing the ground under our feet that until recently we took so much for grant -ed. Biography work in the house of our life rep - resents a contemporary opportunity for self-knowl - edge through which we gain deeper insights into per sonal biographical connections. The golden thread of life becomes visible, this leads to a deep self-identification. This conscious, appreciative re - lationship with our self strengthens our own immu - nity and effectively protects against autoimmune dis eases. At the same time it becomes clear that nothing would have come into being without the encounter with other people. This insight can lead to a shaping of the future from out of the I, which shapes the community with other people and thus the connectedness with the spiritual world more consciously. Keynote presentation on the topic. Deepening: first, through biographical self-knowl - edge and exchange of ideas in groups of two; sec - ond, through an artistic group exercise, the power o f community building can be experienced directly. Dr med Susanne Hofmeister, Karin Jarman 27. Questions of the Heart (EN) Our workshop will be based upon the 'Course for Young Doctors' which was given by Rudolf Steiner in 1924, a series of lectures that we are w orking with in pr eparation for the 100th anniversary in 2024. In the workshop we will compare the young peo - ple's questions from the last century with our o wn que stions today and strive to find Rudolf Steiner' s ans wers within the course. What interests us par - ticularly is the confrontation with materialism in medicine , and how we can develop a more spiritual, 'heart' medicine which recognises the individual and karma. We are not experts on this but want t o shar e questions and ideas, and hopefully get into stimulating discussions . Demi Franco, Matthew Mirkin, Tania Prince, Dr med Sophia Wittchow28. Autoimmune diseases in rheumatology (DE) We will look at the spectrum of autoimmune dis - eases and their spiritual scientific understanding. Important questions relate to the biographical contexts that lead to the body becoming alien. From the work of the Anthroposophical Rheuma- tology Working Group of the Medical Section, thetherapeutic possibilities and clinical experiences will then be presented and worked on. How canwe support the harmonious interaction of the human constitutional elements? What inner de- velopments can be observed on this path? We look forward to the multiprofessional exchange of ideas on these challenging topics. Dr med Matthias Girke 29. Creating bridges between osteopathy and art as prevention and treatment ofautoimmune diseases through a fourfold view of the human being (EN / ES) The workshop is based on the deepening of os - teopathic practice in combination with art thera- py, creating an exchange of balance between the different suprasensitive bodies in the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases. Practical application tools will be presented to strengthen the immune system, considering spiritual devel- opment and evolution. Paul Chaplin, Myriam Orrillo 30. Spiritual potential and its influence on self-identification and immune system (EN / RU) A human being is an individual spirit. This means that individuality has the power to define his or her own life by determining life goals and setting the boundaries of consciousness and its content,and these ground the health at the body level be- cause of the integrity of human being. To realise this spiritual power is not only the possibility but the important task of human development. If it is not fulfilled the integrity of human sheaths cannot be kept and this can lead to addiction at the soul level or to autoimmune disease at the body one. At the workshop we will consider an addiction process and the cases of computer ad- diction and autoimmune thyroiditis with psycho- therapeutic approaches to the treatment. Tatjana Pavlova 31. Activating individual aptitude for self-regulation (DE/FR/RU) In the simple applications of Elemental Health Care developed by Erna Weerts\u00ae, the focus is on the individual person with their own aptitude for self-regulation. This is strengthened and vital- ised through the stimulation of the body's own living warmth and minimal movement with its reflexive effects. All applications can be easily integrated via self-care into family care as well as into interdisciplinary forms of therapy. In addi- tion to practical self-experience, examples fromthe clinical field and the special school sector will be discussed. Dr rer medic Ute K\u00f6ncke, Martina Lechtape 32. Own or alien? (DE / EN) Can my own interaction with my surroundings have an influence on my health - especially the distinction between what I want to take in / ac-cept and what I don't? We will explore this ques - tion together, using patient examples (on thetopic of autoimmune thyroid diseases) and ideas and exercises from Spacial Dynamics\u00ae. Gabriele Hurter, Jaimen McMillan, Christina SpittaMultiprofessional conference Multiprofessional conference 27 2633. Systemic deployments, a possibility for strengthening and developing the immune system in adults (DE/EN) A healthy immune system develops in the first three periods of seven years. The inherited body at birth is individualised at all levels at the age of 21. This process often fails to succeed fully: var - ious organs and organ systems can become the cause of autoimmune diseases. Inhibiting factors for the individuation of the body are very varied. Hereditary or familial predispositions to disease, unhealthy living conditions and traumatic events can destroy the proper incarnation process of soul and body down into the organs. The work with systemic deployments concerning the first three seven-year periods can free entrapments in the etheric body that arose in youth and make a further development of the immune system possible. A workshop with deployments and eu - rythmy healing exercises for the immune system. Hilda Boersma, Marieke Krans 34. On a future mystery medicine: the body as temple (DE/EN) CANCELLED! \" And a real start was made in giving medicine a truly new form\" - as the physician Ita Wegman noted in her notebook 100 years ago after the Summer School in Penmaenmawr in Wales in Au- gust 1923. And further: \"The mystery principle is that we learn to think pictorially, that events inthe whole universe are grasped in images, thus also healing in the cosmos and healing in the microcosm which is only a picture of the mac-rocosm. The images then have to be brought to- gether in meditations.\" In this multiprofessional specialist course we want to address the evolu- tionary development of the human body and the relationship between microcosm and macrocosm in relation to the human being and their body from the perspective of spiritual science. From whom and for whom is this \"temple\"? How have organs developed - and how will they continue to do so? What are our tasks in the therapeutic community in this respect? As a multiprofession- al team, we want to approach these questions to- gether with you - interactively through eurythmy, art appreciation and keynote contributions. The discussion will take place in small groups and in plenary work. Angelika Stieber, Diethard Tauschel 35. Raphael - Inspirer of the new mysteries of the art of healing (EN) Disease and destiny are indissolubly connected. Through the practice of hygienic occultism, it will be possible in the future to avoid all diseases that are not in our destiny, through conscious work on individual and social development. Raphael serves Christ by inspiring people to learn to link their salvation with the salvation of all humanity. The workshop will focus on how we can realise these ideals in our daily lives. In each session,through demonstration and self-experience of external applications, there will be contributionsof care practices from anthroposophic nursing which demonstrate and support the healthy un- folding of the immune system. Dr med Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, Ursi Soldner, Elizabeth Sustick 36. The biology of autoimmune diseases as traces of the spirit in the body - physiopa-thology, salutogenesis and treatment (FR/EN) The immune system is more than an organ of de- fence. Before it can defend, it must be able to distinguish the self from the non-self. On the bi-perspective. At the same time, register by email for the online workshop with Merja Riij\u00e4rvi (merja.riijaervi@medsektion-ikam.org). You will then receive the access information. The online meeting will be held in German. After the confer - ence, we plan to meet again online on 9 October 2023 from 19.00-21.00 to share our insights and experiences. Merja Riij\u00e4rviMultiprofessional conference ological level, the immune system is an organ of self-recognition: in order to reco gnise the oth er, the epitope, it must at the same time recognise the self, t he idiotope. In the e ncounter with t he othe r, self-recognition becomes possible due to the \"inner image s of the universe \". It is this art of encounter that is impaired in au toimmune diseases and that should be supported by salu- togenic therapies adapted to each case. Dr med Robert Kempenich 37. Therapeutic eurythmy for animals (DE/EN/IT) CANCELLED! We would like to exchange v iews with partici- pants and do e urythmy therapy for animals to- gether with them. The discussions will take place indoors, but t he exercises with the c ows, sheep and donkeys will be done outside in the meadows around the Goetheanum. The Goetheanum farmer Paul Pieterse ha s agreed to be p resent during th e workshop. Christine van Draanen, Dr med vet Sabrina Me- nestrina Finding the gems - Workshop for midwives Midwives did not offer the ir own workshop in this multiprofessional conference. Nevertheless, many topics in t he conference programme and in the workshops are also of great interest for midwives. As parti cipants in the conference, we therefore want to d istribute ourselves am ong the various workshops and participate in them from a midwifery perspe ctive. T o prepare this aspect, we will meet before the actual conference on 4 September 2023 from 19.00-21.00 for an online workshop.
