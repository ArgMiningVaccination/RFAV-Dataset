Once upon a time, according to anti-vaccine zealots, the MMR vaccine caused autism. Soon after that, the explanation morphed. No, it wasn't so much the MMR that caused autism; rather, it was the mercury in the thimerosal preservative that used to be in several childhood vaccines in the U.S. until the end of 2001. Then, as evidence accumulated exonerating mercury in vaccines as a cause of autism, it became the \" [toxins](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we.php).\" (Antifreeze, formaldehyde, and human fetal parts, oh my!) Finally, it became \"too many too soon.\" And the anti-vaccine movement rested, because its latest excuse was good. It was vague and very difficult to falsify. But even \"too many too soon\" is no longer enough. Now, according to a press release I received in my e-mail, it's: Press Release Parents of autistic children shed light on controversial vaccinations in new book Michael J. Dochniak and Denise H. Dunn's new book calls for removal of allergy-inducing rubber latex from vaccination packaging to minimize cases of autism MINNEAPOLIS (MMD Newswire) May 10, 2011 -- Autism is on the rise, and the latex rubber often used in vaccine packaging and delivery systems may be one of the causes say authors Michael J. Dochniak and Denise H. Dunn in \"Vaccine Delivery and Autism (The Latex Connection)\" (ISBN 1456570056). Autism Speaks, the nation's largest autism science and advocacy organization, estimates that doctors diagnose the disorder in about one in 110 American children. These scary statistics highlight a condition now more prevalent in children than cancer, juvenile diabetes and pediatric AIDs combined. While researchers have not pinpointed the cause of autism, many find that atypical immunity plays a role. Dochniak and Dunn began investigating the relationship between vaccinations and autism after Dochniak's son was diagnosed and Dunn's son developed unusual behaviors following a routine vaccination. This book collects their research on how allergens found in a natural rubber used in the transportation of vaccines are increasing the chances of autism development. Hevea brasiliensis dry natural rubber (HDNR), derived from the liquid latex found in natural rubber trees, is still used in some vaccine packaging and delivery systems. The authors explain how the naturally occurring proteins found in latex rubber, which are also responsible for latex allergies, can affect the occurrence of allergy-induced regressive autism once one has been exposed to HDNR. \"The increasing prevalence of allergy-induced regressive autism doesn't have to be the inevitable result of immunization,\" Dochniak says. \"If vaccination manufacturers and providers start to reduce their use of HDNR, we will see a dramatic reduction of allergy-induced cases.\" Because vaccinations are required by most states for schooling, the topic has proven controversial among parents, scientists and medical providers. Dochniak and Dunn aim to provide more awareness of a potential cause for the disorder that threatens more and more children each year. \"Vaccine Delivery and Autism (The Latex Connection)\" is available for sale online at Amazon.com and other channels. About the Authors: Michael J. Dochniak and Denise H. Dunn are leading experts in the etiology of allergy-induced regressive autism and have previously authored a book for Nova Science, entitled \"Allergies and Autism.\" Dochniak is a scientific researcher in the field of Hevea brasiliensis natural-latex induced autism. Dunn is an early childhood educator who works closely with autistic children and adults, and has been teaching for more than 15 years.
