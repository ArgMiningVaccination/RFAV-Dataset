No-tably, it requires standardizedtesting for all students in Eng-lish and math every year ingrades 3 through 8, as well asonce in high school. NCLB hasput pressure on U.S. primaryand secondary schools to im-prove the academic perfor-mance of all students, and manyschool districts have certainlyprogressed, but not withoutmany opponents raising an im-portant question: At what cost? Large numbers of student advocates, including schoolcounselors, have criticizedNCLB's stringent accountabil-ity and strict testing require-ments, claiming its implemen-tation is too costly, narrows thecurriculum and does not takeinto consideration the uniqueneeds of every student. Propo-nents of education reform saythe legislation has exposed theachievement gap between mi-nority and nonminority stu-dents, as well as performancediscrepancies between disad-vantaged and affluent students. NCLB is the name given to the most recent version of theElementary and SecondaryEducation Act of 1965, whichis due to expire this year. AsCongress looks to \"reautho- rize\" \u2014 extend or revise \u2014 thefederal statute, school counsel-ing professionals weigh in onwhat's working and whatneeds to change to ensure that,in fact, no child is left behind.

Early that morning, tine's coworker and researchpartner Derald Wing Sue, alsoan ACA member, was told about the noose by a colleague.Sue, a professor of psychologyand education in the universi-ty's Department of Counselingand Clinical Psychology, noti-fied the authorities and imme-diately called Constantine toinform her of the situationbefore she arrived on campus. Constantine, also a professor of psychology and education,as well as director of the Teach-ers College Cultural WinterRoundtable on Psychology andEducation, was stunned andoutraged by the overtly racistact, according to Sue. Counsel- ing Today was unable to reach Constantine for comment. Sueindicated that she had beeninundated with interview re-quests from major news outletsacross the country in the daysfollowing the incident and wascurrently taking a break fromthe media spotlight. \"She was affected powerfully by seeing (the noose),\" Suesaid. \"No doubt it was racialhatred action targeted at African Americans. But herfirst reaction was how this wasgoing to affect her students andthe rest of the campus. That'stypical of her to be concernedwith other people.\" New York City police were summoned to the campus andimmediately began investigat-ing the incident, which they aretreating as a hate crime.

The American CounselingAssociation's Office of PublicPolicy and Legislation hasupdated its chart showing stateand national student-to-schoolcounselor ratios based onrecently released informationfrom the U.S. Department ofEducation's National Center forEducation Statistics. The cur-rent U.S. student-to-counselorratio is 476:1, down from theprevious year's ratio 479:1.The state-by-state ratios arebased on the total number ofstudents enrolled in public ele-mentary and secondary schoolsand the total number of \"guid-ance counselors\" employed inpublic schools during fall of the2005-2006 school year. While the overall number of students enrolled in grades pre-K through 12 grew in sizefrom the 2004-2005 school year,21 states showed a decrease instudent enrollment. The numberof school counselors increasedin most states, with New Yorkgaining more than 300 and Cali-fornia gaining almost 500. How-ever, 11 states showed a decreasein the number of school coun-selors, with Louisiana (362) andFlorida (358) having the greatest losses. Those with the highest stu- dent-to-counselor ratios: Cali-fornia at 920:1, Minnesota The with thelowest student-to-counselor ra- tios (excluding Rhode Island,whose data could not be veri-fied) were Wyoming at 212:1,Louisiana at 221:1, Vermont at224:1, New Hampshire at 249:1and Hawaii at 272:1. ACA recommends a maxi- mum average student-to-coun-selor ratio of 250:1 to ensurethat students have adequateaccess to counselors' services. Updated student-to-counselor ratio charts for public elemen-tary and secondary schools (inaddition to a more complete ver-sion of the chart shown belowfor U.S. schools overall) areavailable on ACA's website atwww.counseling.org/PublicPolicy/TP/ResourcesForSchoolCounselors/CT2.aspx . IACA IN ACTION Student-to-counselor ratios down slightlyFree counseling helps Tech students After compiling final numbers, it was determined that more than 1,000 American Counseling Association and Virginia Counselors Association members volunteered for an initiative toprovide pro bono counseling to Virginia Tech students last sum-mer, according to ACA Chief Professional Officer DavidKaplan. The Virginia Tech counselor education program initiat-ed the effort with ACA because of concern that students stillcoping with the aftermath of the mass shootings on their campuson April 16 would not receive counseling while away fromschool for the summer, either because of financial concern or alack of awareness of where to go to obtain services. After ACA issued a call to members to provide free counsel- ing services, 1,016 counselors signed up to provide as many asfive free sessions to students who were away from campus forthe summer. V olunteers came from all 50 states, as well as Wash-ington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Over the summer, 69 Virginia Tech students made use of the free counseling services, receiving a total of 206 counseling ses-sions from 62 ACA and/or VCA members. Predictably, morestudents from Virginia (29) came forward for counseling ser-vices than from any other state. Overall, however, students in 18states, including California, Arizona, Louisiana, New York,Texas, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, received counseling as part ofthe initiative. Both ACA and the Virginia Tech counseling community believe that these collaborative efforts have produced a model ofsupport that could help mitigate post-traumatic stress in futuredisasters. ACA takes part in TOPOFF drill ACA once again represented the counseling profession in the annual TOPOFF (Top Officials) drill on Oct. 16. TOPOFF is anexercise held by the federal government that simulates a full-scale terrorist attack and gives all involved agencies an opportu-nity to practice a coordinated response. ACA participates in thedisaster mental health aspect of the response as an AmericanRed Cross PEER (Partner for Effective Emergency Response)member. The exact location and nature of the simulated terroristattack is not known until the exercise starts. The simulation on Oct. 16 involved radiological devices being detonated in Guam, Portland, Ore., and Phoenix. ACA wasasked to carry out a simulated call for all licensed professionalcounselors who could respond to the emergency. Ross Trust competition open to students The American Counseling Association is pleased to an- nounce the fourth annual Ross Trust Scholarship competition,designed to reward excellence among counselor education stu-dents who have also engaged in volunteer service in schoolsand communities.

Can-field's column in the Septemberissue of Counseling Todaytitled \"Counselors support thetroops.\" I don't know any coun-selor who doesn't support thetroops. But most U.S. citizensare against this war, and ACAleaders need to help end it andprevent future wars. Dissent is patriotic and an essential tool for ACA leadersto encourage in our profession.Dissent is muffled in the mili-tary (can you say embeddedreporter?), but it is alive andwell in the blogosphere, in thenumber of soldiers going ab-sent without leave and thecourage being shown by GoldStar Families for Peace, Veter-ans Against the War and otherswho challenge this war's inap-propriate conception andimplementation. In the codes ofethics established by theNational Board for CertifiedCounselors and the AmericanSchool Counselor Association,there is no discussion aboutneutrality. But our codes ofethics and competency docu-ments clearly specify our pro-fessional roles in promotingcultural competency, advocacy,diversity and the importance ofdoing no harm. Let's reflect on the words of multicultural counseling expertand Columbia University pro-fessor Derald Wing Sue that\"Counseling is a sociopoliticalact.\" Our sister mental healthprofession, the American Psy-chological Association, hasseen multiple challenges andresignations from membersappalled at its pro-torturestance. Although APA membersrecently restricted that involve-ment, they are the only healthorganization that continues tosupport the use of torture. Whatcan you do, President Canfield,to ensure that ACA bars coun-selors from involvement withtorture? How can we all protectcurrent and future militarymembers from the likelihood ofbeing greater targets of torturedue to failed U.S. torture poli-cies, including disregard for theGeneva Conventions? What canyou do as ACA president tohelp counselors learn accuratehistory about \"the war on ter-ror\"? Please share your sourcesof information about the warwith Counseling Today readers. From reports on Democracy Now! and in The Guardian of London, I have learned that the war on terror is really a war forcontrol of oil and strategicpolitical advantage in the Mid-dle East (i.e., \"U.S. interests\").Scholars and international jour-nalists state that the Talibanhave made a major resurgencein Afghanistan. They have clearevidence that Saddam Husseinand al-Qaeda had no contactprior to 9/11 and were at greatodds with each other. Instead,U.S. intervention and warmon-gering brought al-Qaeda ele-ments into Iraq. The overlyaggressive \"pre-emptive strike\"war policy has brought moreterror and risk for current andfuture generations (includingmilitary personnel) due to inap-propriate uses of war on thepart of the United States. The U.S. military, especially the Army, is strained to thebreaking point. War profiteershave made a fortune (for exam-ple, $9 billion in Iraq \"recon-struction\" cash is missing withno one being held accountablefor mismanagement \u2014 yet).Private contracting firms can dowhatever they want (there areno Iraqi or U.S. rules governingthe mercenary forces of compa-nies such as Blackwater al-legedly murdering Iraqi civil-ians), and their contractors arebetter paid and have betterequipment than publicly fi-nanced soldiers. What aboutNational Guard members whosigned up thinking they wouldbe called on to help out in theirstates and now find themselvesdrafted into what appears anendless overseas war? Whatabout the almost 4,000 U.S.troops who have been killed andthe more than 25,000 wounded?What about the upward of 1million Iraqis killed, with 2 mil-lion to 4 million others dis-placed as refugees? A majorityof the U.S. public resents thewaste of lives and money ourgovernment has caused inAfghanistan and Iraq. I'd like to see ACA leaders focus on what our professioncan do to end this war now andprevent future wars \u2014 Coun-selors for Peace!

CANFIELD Counseling T oday INovember 2007 5The field of counseling has experienced tremendous growth in the past 30 years. Unlike psy-chology, whose founding as aprofession goes back almost150 years, counseling is a rela-tively young profession. Inmany respects, the origin of thecounseling profession can betraced back to the founding ofwhat is now the AmericanCounseling Association. In1952, four groups came togeth-er in partnership to provide agreater political and social voicefor what would become thecounseling profession. Fromthese four original divisions,ACA has grown to include 19national divisions and 38 activestate and international branches. The profession of counseling is currently recognized and reg-ulated in 49 states. Californiaremains the only holdout. Anactive group of professionals,supported in part by ACA, con-tinues to work toward the goalof counselor licensure in Cali- fornia. However, obstacles re-main, as several groups contin-ue to oppose counseling effortsin California. The rationale foropposing counselor licensure inCalifornia \"current groups are ade-quate for meeting communityservice needs, so there is noneed for an additional mentalhealth profession in California.\"Of course, all of these asser-tions are false. Unfortunately,truth is not always the centralconsideration or the foundationfor debate in the legislativeprocess. The reality is that opposition to counselor licensure in Cali-fornia comes down to, as italmost always does, a \"turfissue.\" While legislative effortsare intended to enact laws forthe public good, the process issomewhat Byzantine and oftencomes down to access, influ-ence, money and votes. California is fundamentally different from other states. Our nation's most populous state,with more than 36 million resi-dents, 12 percent of all Ameri-cans live and work in Califor-nia. If California were a nationunto itself, it would have theeighth largest economy in theworld, comparable to that ofItaly. Social and political trendsin California often spread to therest of the United States. Ironi-cally, one such trend that origi-nated in California was profes-sional licensure. In 1962, California established licensure for \"marriage, family and child counselors.\" This lawpreceded every state inestablishing both family licensure. Some of \"licensed marital andfamily therapist,\" effectivelychanging the title tens ofthousands of mental pro-fessionals from \"counselor\" to\"therapist.\" Compared with the approxi- mately 100,000 licensed coun-selors throughout the country,there are about 50,000 licensedmarriage and family therapistsin the United States. However,well over half of these MFTs \u2014approximately 27,000 \u2014 liveand work in California. In thepast, many counselors whomoved to California were com-pelled to seek the MFT licensein order to engage in recognizedprofessional practice, eventhough their training and pro-fessional orientation remainedessentially that of a profession-al counselor. Passage of an appropriate counselor licensure bill in Cali-fornia remains a top priority forACA, and we commend ourmembers and colleagues in theGolden State for their tireless efforts in spearheading thisimportant legislative effort. Wealso appreciate the many profes-sional groups that have eitherpublicly supported or privatelyencouraged our efforts. The mental health field in general and the counseling profession in particular remainworks in progress. Rather thancontinuing to engage in costlyand acrimonious \"turf battles,\" Ibelieve we can better shape ourprofessional futures by collabo-rating on issues of concern andbuilding a consensus of under-standing. To this end, I wouldalso like to call upon the leader-ship of those few remaininggroups that continue to opposecounseling licensure efforts inCalifornia to work with theACA and its partners. As coun-selors, we are ready to listen andhelp move things forward.

Seven percent of full-time workers face depression Rates of depression among full-time workers are highest in personal care and service jobs and food preparationand serving occupations, according toa new report by the Substance Abuseand Mental Health Services Adminis-tration. The report on workers ages 18to 64, \"Depression Among AdultsEmployed Full Time, by Occupation-al Category,\" said that 10.8 percent ofpersonal care and service workers and10.3 percent of food preparation andserving workers experienced one ormore major depressive episodes in thepast year. In the National Survey onDrug Use and Health, the source forthis report, a major depressive episodeis defined as a period of two weeks orlonger during which there isdepressed mood or loss of interest orpleasure and at least four other symp-toms that reflect a change in function-ing, such as problems with sleep, eat- ing, energy, concentration and self-image. Overall, 7 percent of full-time workers faced depression in the pastyear, according to these combined2004-2006 estimates. While rates ofdepression were higher among theunemployed and part-time workers,52.4 percent of the adults who report-ed past year depression wereemployed full time. Full-time workersmake up more than half of the adultpopulation. \"Depression exacts a high price from workers and from their employ-ers, costing the U.S. workplace anestimated $36.6 billion per year in lostproductivity,\" said SAMHSA Admin-istrator Terry Cline. \"Employers,workers and their family membersneed to know effective treatments fordepression are available. Depressionscreening, outreach and enhancedtreatment can improve productivity,lower employer costs and improve thequality of life for individuals and theirfamilies.\" Among full-time workers ages 18 to 64, women were more likely than mento have faced depression. Young adultworkers ages 18 to 25 had the highestrates of depression among all adultage groups. Among this group, 8.9percent reported facing depression inthe past year.

It's impor-tant for them to choose the cor-rect words to adequately de-scribe their former position,\"says Fenson, a former presidentof the National EmploymentCounseling Association, a divi-sion of the American Counsel-ing Association. He adds thatthe O*NET Occupational In-formation Network can helpmatch military occupationalclassification codes and jargonwith corresponding civilian jobtitles and abilities. O*NET(http://online.onetcenter.org) provides information on skills,abilities, knowledge, workactivities and interests associat-ed with occupations. \"Most vets are time-oriented people who can prioritizetasks,\" Fenson says. \"Manyhave good, sound judgment andcan make decisions under pres-sure. Those are people that cango on to be CEOs and CFOs ofcompanies. They have the abil-ity to make quick decisions thatwill impact lots of people and,to me, that says a lot.\" But sometimes, veterans don't want their civilian career path tomatch the track they were on inthe military. In those cases, Fen-son discusses different careeroptions and provides generalinformation. \"We work such as theMyers-Briggs and HarrisonCounseling T oday INovember 2007 8 BY ANGELA KENNEDY Loadmaster Aircraft Armament Systems Operator Combat ControllerMicrowave Systems Operator Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Technician Weather Observer Military job titles are often confusing to civilian employers, and many ex-service membersfind it equally difficult to puttheir military skills into lay-man's terms. Add an average of17 military acronyms to ther\u00e9sum\u00e9, and most employersrisk becoming completely lost. As the coordinator of business career services at the Universityof Texas at Arlington, Bill Fen-son has guided many formermembers of the military in mak-ing the transition to civilian lifeand higher education. \"It is soxxx Career counseling professionals discussemployment challengesfor former members ofthe militaryiStockphototoo structured and regimented, so veterans really have to relaytheir ability to be flexible andadaptable.\" Fenson says former service members may have their ownmisconceptions, such as think-ing that their opportunities toenter the civilian workforcewill be curtailed because ofgeneral public dissatisfactionwith the war in Iraq. \"Theirperception (may be) that no onecares, when we do care and wedo appreciate them. But if theygo through a rough time whenthey return, then they assumethat is the status quo,\" Fensonsays. \"I think vets have done agreat service and deserveemployment preference overanyone. They put their life onthe line to protect our free- doms, and I thank all of themfor that.\" Giving veterans priority Another professional who believes veterans should begiven first priority for employ-ment is William Offutt, directorof HireVetsFirst, a transitionassistance campaign launchedby the U.S. Department of Labor.

Once on their new career path, Fenson suggests militaryveterans join professional asso-ciations and local chapters tomake acquaintances and net-work within their field. Partici-pating in career-related activi-ties, workshops and social func-tions not only helps veteranscareer-wise, he says, but alsoassists them in assimilating intocivilian life. Veterans sometimes find it hard to integrate into the civil-ian workforce, Fenson pointsout. They may have troubleadjusting to a less-structuredlifestyle and might miss theguidance and mentoring thatwere prevalent in the military.\"They are used to having com-pletely structured schedules andknowing exactly what to doevery moment,\" Fenson says.\"Even though vets are able towork independently, to the structure \u2014for example, asking permissionto 'leave task.'\" However, Fenson also advises just havemilitary experience listed ontheir r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn't common misperceptionamong employers is that all for-mer military members are goingto be great employees. Some-times there is a reason they are'former military,'\" he says, not-ing that employers should verifythe individual's discharge statusbefore making a job offer.

Because the House has recently approved legislative language establishing counselor cov erage, we're focusing our attention on similar legislation in the Senate. Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) and the late Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) earlier this year introduced S. 921, the Seniors Mental He alth Access Improvement Act, which would cover both licensed professional counselors' and marriage and family therapists' services under Medicare. Enactment o f this legislation would significantly increase access to mental health care for seniors and individuals with disabilities.

Health plans routinely use discriminatory copayment requirements and arbitrary limits on inpatient and outpatient coverage to restrict access to mental health care. Although most states have enacted mental health parity laws, these laws vary from state to state and don' t apply to self-insured health plans. Separate bills are pending in both the House and the Senate to establish strong federal parity protections. Although the House Education and Labor Committee has approved the legislation \u2014 H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act, introduced by Reps. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.) and Jim Ramstad (R-Minn.) \u2014 two other committees need to endorse the legislation, and it then must be passed on the House floor. ACA is joining a wide array of other mental health advocacy organizations in pushing for swift House approval of the parity legislation to increase its chances for enactment within the next year.

On Oct.15, the House Committee onEnergy and Commerce voted32-13 to approve the legislation.House leaders will now work toreconcile the slight differencesbetween the versions approvedby the Energy and Commerce,Ways and Means, and Educationand Labor committees in prepa-ration for bringing the legisla-tion to a vote on the House floor. Reps. Patrick Kennedy (D- R.I.) and Jim Ramstad (R-Minn.) introduced H.R. 1424.Ramstad has announced that hewill be retiring from Congress atthe end of this session, and hehas expressed a desire to see theenactment of H.R. 1424 as partof his legacy as a public servant. H.R. 1424 is similar to, but stronger than, a version of thelegislation (S. 558) passed in theSenate by unanimous consentthis September. Unlike the Sen-ate's bill, H.R. 1424 wouldrequire health plans to cover thefull range of mental and addic-tive disorders for which mem-bers of Congress and other fed-eral employees are covered; theSenate's bill would still allowhealth plans to choose not tocover certain diagnoses. TheSenate bill also appears to over-ride state health care consumerprotection laws for individualsseeking mental health andaddictive disorder services. The American Counseling Association is working closelywith other mental health, con-sumer and addictive disorderadvocacy organizations to gainswift passage of H.R. 1424 sothat House and Senate negotia-tors can put together a final ver-sion of the legislation beforeCongress adjourns for the year.Passage of parity legislationwould mark a historic step for-ward for millions of Americansand their families affected bymental and addictive disorders.Congress continues appropriations process Congress failed to approve any of the 12 annual appropria- tions bills needed to keep thegovernment operating by thestart of the new fiscal year,which began Oct. 1. In recentyears, Congress has regularlyfailed to meet the deadline buthas kept the government run-ning by passing a temporaryspending bill known as a contin-uing resolution (CR). This year, the House passed a CR on Sept. 26, and the Senatepassed the measure the next day.The CR funds all federal pro-grams, including education andhealth services, until Nov. 16.This gives Congress and theWhite House more time to reachan agreement on spending.Although the House passed itsFiscal Year 2008 Labor, Healthand Human Services, and Edu-cation spending bill (H.R. 3043)on July 19, the Senate has yet toact on its version. The Senate was expected to take up this particular spendingbill the week of Oct. 15. On Oct.3, Senate Appropriations Com-mittee staff called a stakeholdersmeeting to give members of theeducation, health and laborcommunities an update on thestatus of the appropriations bill.Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), chair of the subcommittee onLabor, Health and Human Ser-vices, and Education Appropria-tions, joined members of hisstaff in answering attendees'questions about the legislationand its consideration. House and Senate Appropria- tions Committee staff membersare in discussions to iron outdifferences. Senate Appropria-tions staff would like to approvea bill in conference that is asclose to the House total as pos-sible. This will require moremoney, however, as the House-passed Labor, Health andHuman Services, and Educationappropriations bill calls forroughly $2 billion more in fund-ing. After agreement on aspending total is reached, staffmembers expect the bill to movethrough conference and finalpassage fairly quickly, althoughdebate on provisions related tostem cell research may compli-cate its consideration. Senatestaff have commented that itwill likely be the last appropria-tions bill the Senate completes.They are forecasting the enact-ment of an omnibus bill to pro-vide funding for several otherfederal agencies. ACA is working with other advocacy organizations in sup-port of higher spending figures for federal education and healthprograms. On Oct. 12, ACA senta letter to all 100 senators urgingthem to vote in favor of S. 1710,the FY 2008 Labor, Health andHuman Services, and Educationappropriations bill. No Child Left Behind reauthorization update Work on reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (i.e., No ChildLeft Behind) is picking upspeed. According to congres-sional staff, both the House andSenate Education committeesmay mark up their bills to reau-thorize the legislation beginningthe week of Oct. 22. Given thecontentiousness and complexityof federal education policy,committee consideration will bethorough; the House markup islikely to take three days, withconsideration of dozens ofamendments. After markup,House Education and LaborCommittee Chair George Miller(D-Calif.) hopes to take the billto the floor in early November. In contrast, consideration of a reauthorization bill by the Sen-ate Health, Education, Laborand Pensions (HELP) Commit-tee could be very brief, as thecommittee often defers fightsover (and votes on) key issues to the Senate floor. Senate floorconsideration is not expected tohappen this year. Because thereis no limit on how many amend-ments may be offered, it maytake at least a week or more oftime on the Senate's calendar toconsider the bill. With the Sen-ate already behind on must-passappropriations bills, floor con-sideration of an Elementary andSecondary Education Act reau-thorization bill is not expecteduntil early next year. After the bill passes both houses of Congress, a confer-ence committee of membersfrom both the House and SenateEducation committees mustfinalize the bill. This finalizedbill must then pass the Senateand House before being sent tothe president. Of course, the leg-islation could be held up at anyone of these steps due to politi-cal or policy disagreements,which could cause the bill to bepulled from further considera-tion until after the 2008 election.

I WASHINGTONUPDATEWASHINGTONUPDATE Written and compiled by Scott Barstow, Christopher Campbell and Peter AtleeCounseling T oday INovember 2007 12BY JONATHAN ROLLINS At first glance, Brad- ford Keeney's work seems deeply root- ed in the past. After all, he isone of the world's foremostproponents and practitionersof \"shaking medicine,\" whichhe the oldest form ofhealing medicine on Earth. John Gottman, on the other hand, has earned widespreadacclaim in part for his abilityto look into the future \u2014accurately predicting, afterbriefly observing their inter-actions, whether a couple willstay married or get divorced. But American Counseling Association President BrianCanfield believes both men,despite their radically differ-ent research styles and ap-proaches to therapy, havewords of wisdom to sharethat are equally important forthe present-day practice ofcounseling. \"Brad Keeney is one of the creative and insightfulminds influencing the field ofcounseling,\" Canfield says.\"His work has focused on thefact that all human cultureshave 'healers' and 'helpers'and that, in many ways, coun-seling is a western culturalmanifestation of this agelesshuman tradition. Brad's pre-sentation style is engagingand thought-provoking, and Ibelieve his ideas will help shape the prac-tice of counseling.\" \"Dr. Gottman is one of the few theorists and clinicians inthe field whose work is basedon empirical research,\" Can-field continues. \"His insightsinto the dynamics of maritalrelationships have advanced our knowledge, differentiat-ing between essential andcritical factors and those fac-tors that are merely incidentalto marital satisfaction. Hisresearch continues to informand refine the practice ofmarriage counseling.\" Keeney and Gottman will each offer a keynote address atthe ACA Annual Conference& Exposition in Honolulu inMarch 2008. /ornament23 \"Counselors are the folks I want to hang out withbecause I think counseling iswhere all the therapeutic artsare for the most part,\" Brad-ford Keeney says. \"This iswhere the creativity still the other professionshave turned to simply dis-pensing pills.\" With that statement, you quickly understand thatKeeney doesn't in practicing improvisa-tional therapy and resource-focused therapy. He hasworked at a variety of re-spected psychotherapy in-stitutes, including the Acker-man Institute, the Karl Men-ninger Center and thePhiladelphia Child GuidanceClinic at the University ofPennsylvania. In addition, hehas written numerous books,including Aesthetics ofChange, Mind in Therapy and Improvisational Therapy. He has also served as the directorof several doctoral programsin family therapy. But to quote from Keeney's shakingmedicine.com web- site, at the height of hiscareer, he \"made the radicaldecision to abandon publicwork in order to devote him-self to absorbing and record-ing the fast-disappearing wis-dom and practices of theworld's traditional healingcultures. For over a decade,he traveled the globe, danc-ing, listening and living withspiritual teachers, shamans,healers and medicine peoplewho trusted him to share theirteachings.\" As he explained to Counsel- ing Today in an interview, \"I left it all to go back to school,in villages from the Amazonto Africa. And I don't knowthat I've graduated yet.\" Per-haps not, but today he isaccepted as an elder in numer-ous cultures around the worldand considered a spokesper-son for healing prac-tices, Profiles of Healing, that is acknowledged as one of thebroadest and most intensefield studies of healing andshamanism ever conducted.He is also the subject ofAmerican Shaman: An Odys-sey of Global Healing Tradi-tions, written by mem-bers Jeffrey Kottler and JonCarlson, which a BestSpiritual Book Award fromSpirituality & Health maga- zine in 2005. Currently the clinical director of the Center forChildren and Families inMonroe, La., Keeney says hewants to introduce shakingmedicine and the wisdom ofthe elders to \"those peopleinterested in the widest defi-nition of the healing arts, andI think that includes a lot ofpeople in the counseling pro-fession.\" He adds that hewould \"invite counselors toconsider how young a profes-sion we are and how youngthe culture is that fosters theprofession. We need to putour work in a global and cul-tural context and remind our-selves that other cultures,such as the Kalahari Bush-men, have been practicinghealing arts for 60,000 years.We're barely out of thewomb as a profession, but weexude, sometimes withoutrealizing it, an attitude ofknowing it all.\" Keeney also cautions against what he calls an over-enthusiasm for scientificmodels of therapy. He viewscounseling as being moreclosely related to the per-forming and transformativearts, he believes offermore humanistic ways life's burdensand struggles. He notes thatdepression and existentialdilemmas are still absent insome world cultures \u2014 andyet these cultures don't relysolely on talk therapy. In-stead, members of these cul-tures often use singing, danc-ing or some form of shakingmedicine, Keeney de-scribes legitimized methods (oftherapeutic healing) have tobe scientifically proven,we're potentially being cul-turally insensitive and invali-dating how others do it. I'mnot crying for us to assumean anti-science position. I'mjust saying science is onlyone voice in a very large chorus.\" Keeney again points to the Kalahari Bushmen, whosometimes shake uncontrol-lably as part of their spiritualhealing Despite livingin harsh conditions, he says,the Bushmen have neverdeclared war and do notthreaten the biosphere.\"Here's a people who knowhow to work through 'every-dayness' with a wisdom thatescapes best-selling New Ageauthors,\" Keeney says. \"Thosewho suffer most have had tolearn the most profound waysof surviving. And in the midstof suffering and a lack ofeveryday comforts, they pos-sess a peace and a joy that the'haves' are missing and des-perately trying to find in a spaor a self-help book. Maybethere is something we canlearn from them.\" Keeney is currently work- ing with families in the Mis-sissippi Delta region of north-eastern Louisiana, an areathat Time magazine called the \"poorest place in America.\"He says he is attempting todraw on the soulful resourcesof the people's musical tradi- Bradford Keeney aims to shake up counselors' views of the healing process; Continued on page 45Counseling T oday INovember 2007 13ss; John Gottman looks for the logic behind relationship successes and failures As a young student at MIT, John Gottman assumed that he would spend his professionallife focusing on the relation-ships between numbers, set-ting out to earn a degree inmathematics. That he insteadhas become one of the world'sforemost authorities on rela-tionship dynamics at thehuman level is due in somesmall part to the fact that oneof his roommates was studyingpsychology. \"I found his booksmuch more interesting thanmy own,\" Gottman says. He went on to earn a master of science degree from MIT inmathematics and psychologyand a master of arts in clinicalpsychology and mathematicsfrom the University of Wis-consin. He then obtained adoctorate in clinical psycholo-gy from Wisconsin. One of hisprofessors at Wisconsin wasMavis Hetherington, a pioneerresearcher in the field of fami-ly dynamics, a topic thatgrabbed Gottman's attention.\"I was very drawn to lookingat interacting systems and real-ly learned to favor observa-tional approaches,\" he recalls. Gottman's aptitude for observation has resulted in a treasure trove of informationabout relationship stability.While teaching at the Univer-sity of Washington, Gottmanfounded what the media popu-larly referred to as the \"LoveLab.\" The lab was actually anapartment where couples wereinvited to talk about their day,discuss a cause of conflictbetween them and share a pos-itive aspect of their relation-ship on different occasions.The interactions were video-taped and data were collected, including physiological factors(such as heart rate) and emo-tional interaction (using a cod-ing system to categorize differ-ent emotions). \"We wanted tofind out what these coupleswere thinking and what theywere feeling at differentmoments,\" Gottman says. By analyzing the data, Gottman, Robert Levensonand their colleagues discov-ered they could accurately pre-dict whether couples wouldremain married several yearsdown the road. (Best-sellingauthor Malcolm Gladwell'sbook Blink features a chapter with an in-depth look at thesystem Gottman and his col-leagues developed to makethese predictions.) The any \u2014 criticism,defensiveness, was a major predictor ofrelational instability. Gottman and his team stud- ied both heterosexual andsame-sex couples for as long as 18 years. In manycases, Gottman's observationsspanned couples' major lifetransitions, such as andeven retirement. He conduct-ed seven longitudinal studiesbefore taking the next step \u2014attempting to come up with atherapy model that wouldintervene and actually helppeople improve their relation-al functioning. What's differ-ent about this therapy model,Gottman says, is that it's verystrongly grounded in affectand emotion. He describes thetherapy as \"starkly empirical.It's really about creating a cookbook for relationships.\" Gottman and his wife, Julie Schwartz Gottman, describethe central processes thatmake relationships successfulin \"Gottman Method chapter they wrotefor Alan Gurman's book The Handbook of Couples Thera-py. The five processes are: Down-regulating negative affect during conflict. In this step of what the Gottmans calltheir \"therapeutic recipe,\" cou-ples are taught how the Four Horsemenof the Apocalypse during con-flict. Couples also must besteered away from the \"ex-press it, don't repress it\" theo-ry of anger, Gottman says.\"Simply expressing anger \"Itneeds to be constructive andgentle.\" Up-regulating positive af- fect during conflict and build- ing positive affect during non-conflict. The Gottmans coun- sel couples to follow a four-step blueprint for meetingthese two goals: IConnect emotionally dur-ing everyday IEngage in stress-reducing conversation IBuild affection, good sex,romance and IProcess failed bids foremotional connection Bridging meta-emotion betweenpartners are very criticalthere.\" People have very different reac-tions to specific emotions, heexplains, whether they are experiencing that emotionthemselves or that emotion isbeing expressed by a partner.\"In this part of our therapy,\"the Gottmans explain in theirbook chapter, \"we createmechanisms for people toconnect during times of emo-tional need. Emotion coach-ing is about viewing emotion-al moments as opportunitiesfor intimacy, asking questionsabout feelings, putting experience andunderstanding and validatingone's partner's emotions be-fore problem-solving. ...Using these skills and aware-ness during these moments ofneed, emotion coaching be-comes a source of connectionrather than alienation.\" Creating and nurturing a shared meaning system. The Gottmans say there are twosteps to building this sharedmeaning system: IMaking rituals of (both described by theGottmans, \"A ritual of con-nection is a way of turningtoward one another thateach person can count on.\" IMaking goals and valuesintentional \u2014 talkingabout shared goals, mis-sions and legacy. In addition to conducting continuing research on mar-riage, relationships and par-enting, John Gottman is aclinical psychologist whoworks almost exclusively withcouples. He is the cofounder,with his wife, of the GottmanInstitute, which trains mentalhealth therapists. He is alsothe executive director of the nonprofit Relationship Re-search Institute, where he iscurrently examining interven-tions for the transition to par-enthood. Among his booksare The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work; The Relationship Cure: A 5-StepGuide for Building BetterConnections With Family,Friends and Lovers' The Mathematics of Marriage;and Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child: The Heartof Parenting. He has sharedhis knowledge of relation-ships on TV programs such asOprah, Dateline NBC, Prime- time, 20/20 and Today. The Gottmans, who most recently coauthored And Baby Makes Three, also holdrelationship clinics for cou-ples several times a year. Thefirst day centers on friendshipand intimacy, while the sec-ond day focuses on construc-tive conflict.

ICounseling T oday INovember 2007 16BY ANGELA KENNEDY Last summer, the board of directors of both the Council for Accreditation of Counselingand Related Educational Pro-grams and the Council onRehabilitation Education an-nounced their intent to mergeinto a single accrediting entity.In the ensuing months, repre-sentatives from both partiescollaborated on a task force tohammer out the details of be-coming one organization. Butin an 11th-hour decision,CORE Governing Board mem-bers deemed the merger planunacceptable without revisions. Heading into the task force meetings, both organizations viewed the proposed merger asa step toward strengthening thecounseling profession as awhole. In a joint statement re-leased last year, CORE Presi-dent Linda Shaw and CACREPChair Jack Culbreth said, \"It isimportant to note that theCACREP and CORE Boardsenter into this process withgreat respect for the history andtraditions of both organizationsand determination to preserveand promote both the commonand unique strengths andpotential of each group. Bycombining efforts, both boardsbelieve that there is an opportu-nity not only to promote excel-lence in counselor educationwith a unified voice, but to alsopromote unified recognition forthe counseling profession.\" Over the course of several meetings, the 10-person taskforce (composed of Shaw andCulbreth, both organizations'executive directors, plus sixadditional appointed members\u2014 three representing each orga-nization) worked to develop amerger plan. The final decisionto merge, however, had to beapproved by both organizations'governing boards. A stipulationwithin the merger plan notedthat if either board voted torevise the document prior toadoption, the revisions wouldconstitute a vote against the res-olution to merge and the processwould cease.CORE's viewpoint \"The bottom line is that the task force worked really hard to come up with a merger agree-ment that both sides thoughtwould be in the best interest oftheir organization and counsel-ing as a whole,\" Shaw says.\"That really was the goal. How-ever, the CORE Board decidedthat these new requirements hadthe potential to seriously harmthe quality and availability ofrehabilitation counselor educa-tion programs.\" Shaw notes that both sides made compromises in formu-lating the merger plan, but inthe final analysis by the COREBoard, two specific issues werejudged as being too problemat-ic for the merger to proceed.First was the stipulation toincrease the number of requiredfaculty members for rehabilita-tion counselor education pro-grams. CORE currently re-quires a minimum of two facul-ty members; the merger planwould have required rehabilita-tion counselor education pro-grams to have at least three.Second was the condition thatrehabilitation counselor educa-tion faculty positions wouldeventually be limited to thoseholding doctoral degrees fromcounselor education programs. Shaw says those concerns may have been spurred by thecurrent shortage of rehabilita-tion counselor educators in theworkforce, noting that the pro-fession is in the midst of aretirement wave. \"Our rehabeducation programs expandedin the sixties and seventies, anda lot of the faculty hired inthose programs are retiringnow,\" she explains. \"There is areally strong feeling that therearen't enough people beinggraduated out of rehabilitationcounselor education programs\u2014 that are specifically calledthat \u2014 to fill the void.\" She points out that rehabilita- tion counselor education doc-toral programs go by a numberof different names, includingrehabilitation science, rehabpsychology and rehabilitationadministration. But though thetitle of the programs may be abit convoluted, she says, most have a strong counselor identi-ty. \"For us, we don't reallyhave the same issues or con-cerns in terms of psychologythat exist in other counseloreducation programs,\" she says.\"Also, we draw faculty fromspecial education programs.\"Shaw adds that several COREBoard members regard thediverse backgrounds of facultymembers in rehabilitationcounseling programs as astrength. Shaw says one CORE Board member explained the concernthis way: \"Currently, whenthere is a shortage of rehabeducators, programs may befaced with the decision ofeither hiring a faculty member who has a psychology back- ground or a special ed back-ground (but) who really under-stands the scope of disability(issues in counseling), or theycan hire someone who has acounselor education degreewho isn't a rehab counselor andwasn't trained in that disci-pline. There might be a strongbias to not hire the person whoreally understands disability.\" According to Shaw, most of the concerns expressed byCORE Board members wererelated to ensuring that rehabil-itation counselor educationprograms would remain able tohire the most qualified peopleto teach. There was muchdebate on that issue during thetask force meetings, she says,but the CORE representativeseventually agreed to the mergerstipulations \u2014 understandingthey would cause concern \u2014just to present the document tothe board for a vote. \"We had toput our heads together anddecide if we were going to goforward with this, but, ofcourse, we couldn't necessarilyspeak for the entire board atthat point. There was a feelingthat we should go ahead andcraft the best agreement that wepossibly could and then let theCORE Board work through it.We knew it was going to be aproblem, but we didn't know itwas going to be a problem sogreat that the benefits wouldn'toutweigh the problems.\" The task force members did take those expected concernsinto consideration before pre-senting the merger plan forboard review by including a\"grandfather clause\" for exist-ing rehabilitation counseloreducator programs. The mergeragreement stated that by 2019,all rehabilitation counseling programs in stand-alone acade- mic units would be required tohave a minimum of three full-time faculty appointments. \"The task force worked out a compromise that had a grandfa-thering in of educators current-ly employed by rehab coun-selor education programs butwho did not get their degreefrom a counselor educationprogram,\" Shaw says. \"Therewas also a long phase-in, butthe concern on the part of thefull board was that even thatcould create some real difficul-ty for rehab counseling pro-grams in accessing qualifiedpeople.\" The CORE Board ultimately decided that the new facultyrequirements could potentiallyharm existing programs, Shawsays. Still, the proposed mergerbetween CORE and CACREPcame very close to beingapproved. \"At the CORE meet-ing, a motion was made toaccept the merger resolution,but after discussion, the motionwas withdrawn,\" Shaw re-counts. \"It became clear that these (issues) were going to betoo large. Rather than vote onthe merger resolution as it waspresented to the board, theboard instead passed a differentresolution.\" Because there wassuch a strong desire amongCORE Board members tomerge, she says, they decided itwould be best to agree upon allother statutes in the mergerdocument but include a resolu-tion to amend the two areas ofconcern. The CORE Boardvoted unanimously to pass theamended merger agreement.Because the merger documentspecifically included an \"all ornothing\" clause, however, theaction was moot. The following week, the CACREP Board voted unani-mously to approve the mergeragreement as negotiated by thetask force. \"CACREP felt theywere just very committed togoing forward with the initialagreement,\" Shaw says. \"Indoing so, that meant we wouldnot be merging. It was notunexpected. We had had thisdiscussion in the task forcemeetings. We really workedhard. All the discussions wereapproached with a great deal ofrespect and understanding.Even though the merger didn'toccur, I think both CORE andCACREP came out of it with areally clear understanding ofjust how similar we are in ourgoals, objectives and values.We have a commitment to worktogether and assist each otherwhere we can.\" Shaw says the CORE Board is still interested in movingforward with merger discus-sions but doesn't see compro-mise looming in the nearfuture. \"If either CORE orCACREP changes their mindsor if circumstances change \u2014board members change \u2014there isn't anything preventingit from being raised again,\" shesays. \"We could go down thatroad again, but I don't see thathappening immediately be-cause the CACREP Boardseems very committed to thosetwo standards.\" CORE, CACREP merger falls short \"If either CORE or CACREP changes their minds or if circumstances change ... there isn't anythingpreventing (the merger) from being raised again.\" \u2014 CORE President Linda Shaw CACREP's viewpoint Culbreth, the CACREP chair, says the two key issues raised in the new resolution by theCORE Board were debated asthe task force designed the pro-posed merger plan, but he stoodfirm on CACREP's require-ments. \"I knew our board wouldnot agree to a reduction to two(faculty members per program),nor would we agree to a differ-ent set of standards for rehabprograms,\" he says. \"In the taskforce discussions, I finally said,'No disrespect, but we aren'tgoing to back off of this.' Therewere a lot of things that weworked out and agreed on.There was not a lot, in my opin-ion, that we didn't agree to. Welooked at a lot of very innova-tive things that (CORE) did andthey wanted in place, which wedidn't have a problem with. Wewere fairly agreeable to a lot ofthings.\" \"There were concerns on the issue of counselor professionalidentity and the minimum re-quirement on the number offaculty required in a program,\"Culbreth says. \"We (CACREP)require three, and they (CORE)require two, so they were con-cerned \u2014 rightfully so. Theyhave to look out for the rehabprograms, and going up in thenumber of faculty memberscould hurt some of the smallerprograms in smaller areas. Inorder to resolve this, we put in a10-year window for rehab pro-grams to come up to three fac-ulty and for their doctoral train-ing programs to retool and becounselor identified. They takefaculty for a whole host ofdegree areas well beyond coun-seling. It would really amountto (CACREP) going backwardto adjust on that. We felt likemoving forward and putting ina 10-year window from the timeof adoption would be a reason-able time frame.\" Says CACREP Executive Director Carol Bobby, \"Thefaculty qualifications issueshave a lot to do with profes-sional identity and who isteaching people to be coun-selors. CACREP had beenmoving in the direction torequire a more solid counseloreducator identity through hav-ing a doctorate in counseloreducation rather than someother professional degree, likecounseling psychology or reha-bilitation psychology or evensocial work. CACREP is reallymoving in that direction, andthe merger resolution indicateda willingness to provide moretime to those rehabilitationcounseling programs that may Counseling T oday INovember 2007 17 not be under counselor educa- tion departments. I guess theydidn't feel that 2019 wasenough time, but we've re-ceived no indication on thatissue.\" When Bobby spokewith Counseling Today in October, she said there hadbeen no further discussion ofthe merger with CORE, asidefrom receiving its revisedmerger resolution. Culbreth says the CACREP Board remains fully committedto the faculty numbers and edu-cational requirements includedin the merger plan drawn up bythe task force. \"As we continueto strengthen the counseloreducator professional identity,for us to back off of our stan-dard of the three-faculty re-quirement would be inappropri-ate,\" he says. \"We can't two different criteria.That's just not good practice.\" He adds that thethree-faculty requirement is aminimum number and far fromideal for a successful counsel-ing program. Bobby and Culbreth com- mend the task force members'efforts to develop a fair mergerplan, but a level of frustrationover the ultimate outcome isevident. \"Every member of themerger task force alwaysworked with the idea that wewanted to create an organiza-tion that would work for thefuture, unify the profession anddo no harm to programs in theprocess,\" Bobby says. \"Thatwas the premise that we wereworking from. Both CORE andCACREP worked diligently,professionally and collegiallyand tried to move forward forthe sake of the profession.However, the merger resolutionwas based on negotiations, alldone in good faith, and wenegotiated what we thoughtwas the best organizationalstructure. Each organizationmade good efforts to bend. Weeach gave up things in order togain things in the resolution asproposed. CACREP was verydisappointed in CORE's deci-sion. We had worked very hardand expended a lot of resourcesand a lot of time and hope.\" Despite the disappointment, Culbreth says CACREP has noill will toward CORE, and hecontinues to hope that themerger will happen someday.\"We probably came the closestit has ever come to happening,but it just didn't work,\" he says.\"I've always been a big advo-cate for the unity of the profes-sion, and this merger wouldhave solidified that. Where dowe go from here? I don't know.Where we are now is where wewere when we started. We stillhave a working relationship.CACREP has learned somevery helpful things in our inter-actions with CORE, and theyhave learned from us. I wouldlike to think that both organiza-tions gained from the discus-sions, but beyond that, all thebenefits of the merger aren'tgoing to happen. There's noanimosity. I want to make thatclear. But I still believe it's inthe best interest of our profes-sion for us to be under oneumbrella.\" Commented roles shaping thefuture of professional counsel-ing and the specialization ofrehabilitation counseling, re-spectively. I'm sure bothgroups will continue to collab-orate on issues of mutual inter-est. As the professional associa-tion which represents the inter-ests of all counselors and thecounseling profession, ACA will continue to engage bothorganizations in their ongoingwork.\" ACA Chief Professional Offi- cer David Kaplan also ex-pressed disappointment. \"Themerger talks between CACREPand CORE had been likened toan engagement. Without affix-ing blame, it is to the detrimentof the counseling professionthat the marriage did not occur.Having one accreditation bodyfor graduate counseling pro-grams would have been a majorstep forward in unifying theprofession and would havereduced confusion for legisla-tive bodies, prospective stu-dents and, most importantly, thepublic.\" He says he continues tohope, however, that these recentevents are merely a temporarysetback and that a mergerbetween CORE and CACREPwill occur in the future.

Each candidate was asked to provide information for four questions. Thismonth, they answer the final two ques-tions. Their answers to the first twoquestions appeared in the October issueof Counseling Today . Complete information for all four can- didates, including biographical informa-tion and goals statements, will be fea-tured in the December issue of Counsel- ing Today. That issue will also includebiographical information and goalsstatements for those participating inelections for ACA divisions and regions. Editor's note: The following informa- tion is printed as it was submitted fromthe candidates. Counseling Today has edited only for spelling and minor styleissues. Technology, multiculturalism and global engagement are major societalforces. How can ACA as an organiza-tion engage these forces to benefit itsmembers and those they serve? Marcheta P. Evans: The American Counseling Association is making greatstrides to engage technology, multicul-turalism and global engagement, but Ifeel these are forces in constant fluxwhich require nonstop attention. Tech-nology evolution is occurring on a con-tinuous basis, but one of the areas whichthe association could explore is the uti-lization of webcasting or streamingvideo for meetings such as the Govern-ing Council or other association com-mittee meetings. Additionally, it canserve as a conduit for the branches andregions to conduct their business meet-ings. There are many meeting toolsavailable for usage at nominal cost, suchas GoToMeetings.com, which wouldreduce the cost to the ACA divisions andregions. This would allow the general membership the opportunity to be a partof witnessing what occurs during thesemeetings. I live and work in a diverse multicul- tural community. Multiculturalism andglobal engagement are critical to ourcore as a profession. Multicultural iswho we are as an association. We cannotignore our core. As we become a moreinternational society, we must expandour knowledge base, skills and experi-ences in working with a global society.This will be paramount to our sustain-ability as a professional organization. Michael C. Lazarchick: This is an age of abundant information. The Inter-net allows virtually instantaneous world-wide communication. We are engaged ina global competition of ideas. ACAneeds to have a home page that offersworthwhile information for general pub-lic consumption, a section which mar-kets the association and allows people tojoin and an interactive section of infor-mation and tools available to members.We need to keep pace with 21st-centurytechnology. We are the association for profession- als who call themselves counselors. Wehave published our ethics. We believe ineducation, standards, tolerance. We arepromoters of health and well-being.ACA needs to be as healthy as possibleso its messages reverberate throughoutthe universe with strength. ACA needs toserve the needs of the regions, divisionsand branches so that every counselor isenabled to more effectively transposethe messages of health and well-being toindividual customers. We are each a unique entity, and many of us come from an incredible culturalmixture. We have to learn the nuances ofvarious cultures so that we can commu-nicate effectively with others and berespectful of their traditions. We have tohelp each other interact more efficientlywithin the other's worldview. A. Michael Hutchins: ACA has com- mitted to developing a multicultural competencies signature product. Build-ing on the work of my predecessors, aspresident, I will work with divisions andregions using emerging technology andother resources to move forward withtraining and education based on this sig-nature product. Working with colleagues across the globe, I will encourage ACA support forinternational research, training and dis-cussion addressing such issues as com-parative ethics, the effects of trauma andoppression, social justice advocacy,community mental health, student men-toring, ongoing professional training,the perception of counselors across cul-tures and similarities and differences inindividual, group, family and careercounseling across cultures. I willencourage graduate students and emerg-ing professionals to actively participatein these endeavors and will work withcredentialing and training organizationsto provide credit for such work. The ACA Governing Council has sup- ported \"Counselors Without Borders.\" Iwill work ACAwill collaboratively establish a culturallyappropriate international humanitarianproject to address some of the mostbasic mental health, educational andvocational needs of some of the world'smost disenfranchised and marginalizedpopulations, offering the opportunity forour members to participate as providersof appropriate services. We will work forpeace and hope. Lynn E. Linde: ACA is well posi- tioned to engage the forces of technolo-gy, multiculturalism and global engage-ment. We have begun to look at counsel-ing globally and understand how it looksin other cultures and countries. We needto continue to actively partner with ourinternational colleagues to promote theglobal mission of counseling and devel-op an awareness and understandingamong our members. As the U.S.becomes increasingly more diverse, cul-tural competence is an issue for us here,not just an international issue. It isincumbent upon professional counselorsto examine their practices to ensure cul-tural appropriateness. ACA can assistwith this effort through professionaldevelopment, research and articles innewsletters and journals. Technology is changing the way we learn, communicate and counsel. ACAcan move toward offering more re-sources and professional developmentonline and via teleconferencing. Forexample, professional development inmulticulturalism could be available viathe web, or members could participate ininternational conferences via technolo-gy. And perhaps we can look at member-ship differently and create a categorywhere the member receives no papercopies of resources but can access every-thing via the Internet. The possibilitiesare unlimited if we think differentlyabout how to meet, learn and provideinformation. Graduate students constitute 25 percent of the ACA membership. Howmight we ensure that graduate stu-dents are prepared to lead ACA in thenear future? Michael C. Lazarchick: The leaders of the future are already emerging intoprominence. I am exceptionally im-pressed with so many of the youngcounselors I have met at recent ACAconferences. I also have several youngcounselors on my staff who appearclearly more talented and professionallydeveloped than I remember being whenI was around their age. They look to mefor guidance, counseling and mentoring,continuing a process of personal andprofessional growth that began in gradu-ate school. I make it as easy as possiblefor them to participate and then get outof their way so that I can marvel at thecreativity they bring to the tasks at hand. A. Michael Hutchins Lynn E. Linde Marcheta P . Evans Michael C. LazarchickCounseling T oday INovember 2007 19Many educators are active in the American Counseling Asso- ciation, and I have noticed thatsome bring their students.Those that show up are amongthe most talented. ACA needsto provide the opportunity forgraduate students to participateat every level as often as possi-ble. That will give them adegree of ownership and pre-pare them to lead. The additionof a graduate student on theACA Governing Council wasclearly a good move. Moreexperienced counselors mustaccept the responsibility ofenticing participation to ensurepreparedness. A. Michael Hutchins: Our students have some of the most creative ideas about our future.ACA has a graduate studentassociation upon which tobuild. Through this association,I will encourage meaningfulexperiences within the associa-tion on local, branch, regionaland national levels. Building onour humanistic roots, I willwork to integrate the mentoringefforts of all of our entities,expanding the efforts to includenewly degreed counselors. Using emerging technology, Iwill work with graduate stu- dents, new counselors and men-tors to create online \"open dis-cussions\" and publications fo-cusing on critical counselingissues in our community. I willinvite our doctoral students totake the lead in this endeavor. Inthese discussions, I will invite awide range of worldviews andapproaches. Working together,we will build programs thatchannel the passion for ourwork with advocacy for ourclients and our communities. We are skilled in career development. Most of our stu- dents enter the workforce afterhaving received their master'sdegrees. If they cannot findcounseling positions upongraduation, they will notemerge as leaders. I will workwith our entities to provide acomprehensive career networkfor those seeking positions.Together, we can create avision of hope. Lynn E. Linde: To ensure that graduate students are pre- pared to lead in the near future,there are several things wemust do. First, we must provideleadership development train-ing for students, beginning ingraduate school. Training op-portunities should also beincluded at events offered atlocal, regional and national lev-els. However, it is not enoughto just train our future leaders;we must also give them oppor-tunities to practice what theyhave learned. Graduate students must be encouraged to take on leader- ship roles at all levels of theassociation. ACA currently hasa student member on each com-mittee, but this involves only alimited number of students.ACA could change this modeland make students regularcommittee members as op-posed to special one-year ap-pointments. This would allowstudents full participation in thecommittee and the potential tobecome a committee cochair. In addition to appointed posi- tions, a mentoring programshould be established. ACAmembers in leadership would begiven a graduate student to men-tor, thus helping facilitate thetransition of students into lead-ership positions. ACA couldalso establish internships forleadership development specifi-cally for graduate students. Thisprocess should also be imple-mented within ACA entities and at the grassroots level. Marcheta P. Evans: In developing our leaders for thefuture, collaboration mustoccur between ACA and allcounselor education prepara-tion entities within our \u2014 CACREP, ChiSigma Iota and other student-focused ACA divisions. Wemust look to the counselor edu-cation programs as a trainingground for fostering this lead-ership ability and our bloodlinefor the future. We must advo-cate for the engagement of stu-dents in every aspect of the pro-fession; attention must be givenat the local, branch, region anddivisional levels. As a counselor educator and department chair at one of the largest counseling programsnationally, I realize the impor-tance of role modeling for stu-dents. I realize the importanceof being excited about yourprofessional organization andfinding ways to incorporateyour students in our profession-al organization by offeringfunding and other opportunitiesfor engagement. The associa-tion should explore the possi-bility of two strands of emerg- ing leaders: the brand new pro-fessionals coming into the pro-fession and the professionalwho has experience at thebranch or regional level butwould like to become moreactively involved at the nation-al level. We must continue to work toward offering trainings forthe development of a diverseleadership base by offeringstipends and/or scholarships forbranches, regions and divisionsthat demonstrate exemplaryleadership program develop-ment initiatives for graduatestudents and beyond.

WhileBoesky notes that most adolescents make it through theirteens without major problems, she adds,\"It can be difficult to distinguish what isnormal during the teenage years and whatis cause for worry.\" Every parent has been alerted numer- ous times, perhaps even well in advance, to how awful dealing with their teenageris going to be. My sister-in-law has beenwarning me about the \"terrible teens\" forthe last four years, and my daughter isonly 3. But we can all take heart. Boeskyhas jammed this tome with clear, conciseand comforting information. She tells usnot only what isn't normal (the cue toworry), but also provides plenty of dataabout what is. She hopes that whenarmed with the facts, parents will be morecomfortable talking to their teens abouttheir concerns while also demonstratingan understanding of and familiarity withthe challenges teens face. The author covers a lot of territory in this book, and she does it well. Boesky addresses emotional behaviors, relation-ships with parents, social behaviors,physical and intellectual issues, hobbiesand interests, and risky behaviors. Usingcase studies to demonstrate problematicbehaviors and possible causes for con-cern, she then poses the question \"Is thistypical?\" She goes on to identify \"worrysigns\" and risk factors and also has a sec-tion of FAQs under each category, as wellas a comprehensive \"How You Can Help\"segment. Where warranted, the authorincludes \"This Sounds Like My Teen,But What Else Could It Be?\" WhileBoesky doesn't hesitate to let readersknow when their teen may be in serioustrouble, she also offers comfort andreminds parents that they make a differ-ence. Boesky wraps the book up withinformation on evaluation, obtainingappropriate treatment, positive parentingand the importance of parental self-care. When to Worry is a gem. Boesky's compassion for parents and their childrenshines through on every page. Her solidknowledge, astute appraisals and calls foraction make this book a sound and reli-able reference not only for parents, butfor anyone working with families andteens. Reviewed by Celeste A.

In spite of its signifi-cant role in counselor education, supervi-sion and, more specifically, training ofsupervisors, has not received the attentionit deserves. Fortunately, in 1989, theAmerican Counseling Association adopt-ed the standards for counselor supervi-sion that had been developed by the Asso-ciation for Counselor Education andSupervision Interest Network. CACREP-accredited doctoral programs in coun-selor education now require students totake at least one supervision course, andlicensure boards are starting to requiretraining for practicing professionals inter-ested in providing supervision. Still, asignificant number of counselor traineesand interns are supervised by profession-als who, while quite skilled and talented,have virtually no formal training in super-vision. Various books and articles on coun- selor development and supervision haveestablished a strong foundation of funda-mental knowledge. Synthesizing thisknowledge into a user-friendly format isa challenging, critical accomplishment.Neufeldt's book admirably meets thisneed. The fact that the book is in its thirdedition speaks not only to its popularityamong professionals but also to its abili-ty to address the aforementioned need. Inkeeping with the author's promise for thebook to serve as a manual, this resourcehelps supervisors navigate a rather com-plicated, unique relationship. Carefullylaid out chapters clarify rather efficientlyand effectively the intentions and focusof supervision. Once the foundation isestablished, new concepts are intro-duced, ultimately capturing the complex-ity of the supervision process withoutoverwhelming readers. The author devotes the first section to core issues that provide a much-neededframework for supervisors: counselordevelopment, ethical guidelines applica-ble to the supervision process and cultur-al sensitivity. The work of well-knownexperts such as Janine Bernard and Rod-ney Goodyear (2004), Madonna Constan-tine and Derald Wing Sue (2005),Thomas M. Skovholt and Michael HelgeR\u00f8nnestad (2003) and Elizabeth Hol-loway (1995) is briefly reviewed. DonaldSch\u00f6n's (1983) concept of the reflectivepractitioner, a prevalent theme through-out, is introduced early on. The second section covers the nuts and bolts of the supervision process. Basicsupervision strategies, focusing particu-larly on skills acquisition, are presented.Some of the supervisory skills introducedinclude exploring the emotions of super-visees, assisting supervisees in elucidates more advancedsupervision strategies used in assistingcounselor trainees with the art of caseconceptualization. Vignettes providedafter each strategy demonstrate how theseskills can be used masterfully in a super-visory relationship. Throughout this sec-tion, the author describes the three mainroles a good supervisor plays, namely,consultant, teacher and counselor. The third section is a pleasant surprise to readers who might initially assume thatthe book is exclusively about supervisortraining. In this final section, readers areprovided with detailed descriptions offirst- and second-term practicum classes.Outlines provided for each class sessionencompass objectives and class exercises.Following each class period, studentsusually meet in dyads with a supervisorto process the experiences or exercisesfrom the class. These sessions furthercounselor trainees' knowledge of coun-seling, clinical skills and themselves. Strikingly evident among the pages of this book are the author's years of experi-ence as a faculty member, clinician andsupervisor. This text will help new super-visors, as well as instructors of practicumand supervision-related classes. Its aimsfulfilled, this excellent book will no doubtbecome a frequently consulted resource.

Facing the Challenge of Liability in Psychotherapy: Practicing Defensively, 2nd edition By Lawrence E. Hedges, 2007, Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group Inc., 266 pages, $46.99 (paperback), ISBN 978-0- 7657-0386-6 This slim yet com- prehensive resource deals with every thera-pist's worst nightmare\u2014 the threat of a law-suit from a client or astate licensing board.Author LawrenceHedges identifies strategies to prevent such a situation fromoccurring and provides advice to enabletherapists to practice as freely as possible,without incurring unnecessary risk of alawsuit. The book first covers situationsthat may threaten a client-therapist rela-tionship and deals with potential litiga-tion and sanctions, such as the challengesof a subpoena. The book underscoresHedges' experience with both the ethicalrequirements of the counseling profes-sion and the legal system. He is mindfulof the sensitive issues therapists dealwith, such as childhood trauma, that canlead to unexpected legal pitfalls.Although the book focuses on the chal-lenges faced by psychoanalysts, the infor-mation will be useful to other mentalhealth professionals who face potentiallitigation. Hedges critiques high-profile legal cases by deconstructing the implicationsof Supreme Court decisions about vari-ous issues, such as privilege in the Jaffe v. Redmond (1996) case. In turn, he exam- ines how transference in the psychoana-lytic relationship can present a legal chal-lenge for therapists. Additionally, he pro-vides a section on dealing with chargesbrought by state licensing boards as wellas the judicial system. The book is writ-ten for clinicians confident that they arepracticing ethically but who may still beuncertain of various aspects of the law. Asthe author points out, merely being ethi-cal does not mean that one will avoid lit-igation; the law can be fickle and open tothe interpretation of judges. Therefore,Hedges' \"take-home point\" is best sum-marized by the title of one of his chapters:Practice defensively. Intrusion by the state into the relation- ship between client and counselor is amain concern regarding liability, accord-ing to Hedges. He believes, as many do,that only when clients feel they are ableto speak to their counselors in an unre-strained fashion can they really heal andmake progress. Unfortunately, the liti-gious climate in the United States resultsin increased scrutiny of the therapeuticrelationship, particularly in matters per-taining to juveniles. Hedges stresses theneed to keep records of client meetingsand also provides advice about whichnotes are crucial in cases where a thera-pist thinks litigation may become anissue. Although the topic of litigationmay seem intimidating or irrelevant tosome, it is a subject with which all men-tal health professionals must deal.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org Counseling T oday INovember 2007 22 Department of Labor is striving to make the return to civilianlife less difficult for veterans. HireVetsFirst is just one of many Veterans Employmentand Training Service programs.HireVetsFirst not only providescareer services and counselingto vets but also promotes theunique skills of veterans topotential civilian employers.\"We reach out to employers toimpress upon them how theycan find veterans,\" Offutt says.\"Surveys have shown that morethan 80 percent of employersare favorably disposed to hiringveterans, but less than 20 per-cent know how to integratefinding vets into their recruit-ing efforts.\" The Department of Labor also provides training for facil-itators of Transition AssistancePrograms (TAPS), a series ofworkshops every exiting ser-vices member must attend. TheTAPS workshops teach servicemembers three basic skills: IHow to write a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 IHow to conduct a job search IHow to conduct a success-ful interview \"You have to understand thatfor most of these service mem- bers, it's the first time they haveactually looked for a job,\"Offutt says. \"They have puttheir service into the country,and now they are taking thatuniform off and going into thecivilian workforce for the veryfirst time.\" The average person being recruited into the military hasno substantial career experi-ence prior to enlistment, hepoints out. \"They may have hada job after school or during col-lege. We are talking about theactive-duty sector, not theGuard or Reserve. So some ofthe challenges for them are justthe daunting task of looking fora job and defining who they areand what they want to do.\" Like Fenson, Offutt tries to help veterans define their mili-tary skills by putting them intocivilian language. \"We helpthem understand the job marketand how they may fit into thatwith the skills that they nowhave,\" he says. \"The flipside tothat is that the veteran may nothave many hard skills, but theyhave learned many soft skills,such as being part of a team,leadership, loyalty and beingpunctual. These are some of theskills that employers prize in people, but it's hard for theseservices members to projectthat on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\" He notes that last year alone, the Department of Defenseheld six job fairs specificallyfor wounded and injured ser-vice members. On average, 60companies attended the jobfairs, and some offered severalservice members jobs on thespot. \"About 20 percent ofthose (service members) at-tending accepted positions, butmost were just collecting infor-mation and seeing what the jobmarket is like while they arewaiting to be officially dis-charged,\" Offutt explains. \"Weare being more proactive interms of the wounded andinjured than we have in thepast. We are reaching out tothem and working with themwhile they are still at the med-ical treatment centers and V A(Veterans Affairs) hospitals sothey can be prepared accord-ingly.\" Those with physical dis-abilities often need help toovercome issues of self-confi-dence and to prepare mentallyfor integrating into the work-force, he adds.Russell agrees that disabled veterans should be prepared mentally before returning toemployment. She would like tosee veterans take more time todecompress with the help ofmental help professionals be-fore transitioning into a civilianjob. \"In my opinion, there isn'tenough attention being paid tothose veterans who are return-ing with severe disabilities,\"she says. \"The number of peo-ple coming back from the warwith disabilities is overwhelm-ing. You have to have servicesto these veterans provided bypeople who really understandthe impact of disabilities orrehabilitation on the employ-ment and transitioning process.There is a real disconnect withthis population. There justneeds to be more training andmore staffing.\" Irmo Marini, past president of the American RehabilitationCounseling and acounselor educator at the Uni-versity of Texas-Pan American,says the emotional ofveterans will workforce. \"We've got alarge number of service mem-bers coming back with PTSD(post-traumatic stress disor-der). That seems to be the No. 1 disability we are seeing,\" hesays, noting that the effects ofPTSD aren't always readilyapparent, sometimes takingyears to develop. Research has shown that many Vietnam veterans becamehomeless an average of 12 to15 years after being dischargedfrom the military. According tothe National Coalition forHomeless Veterans, many vet-erans are homeless because \"alarge number of displaced andat-risk veterans live with lin-gering effects of post-traumaticstress disorder and substanceabuse, compounded by a lackof family and social supportnetworks. Military occupationsand training are not alwaystransferable to the civilianworkforce, placing some veter-ans at a disadvantage whencompeting for employment.\" I Counseling T oday INovember 2007 23Veterans Continued from page 9 Angela Kennedy is a senior writer at Counseling Today .

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org HireVetsFirst ( www.hirevetsfirst.gov) is a transition assistance campaign and online career center launched by theVeterans Employment and TrainingService within the U.S. Department ofLabor. The program provides helpfulinformation, tips and resources formatching veterans with civilianemployment opportunities. Its websitelists the top 10 reasons why companiesshould give employment considerationto veterans first: 1. Accelerated learning curve Veterans have the proven ability to learn new skills and concepts. In addi- tion, they can enter your workforcewith identifiable and transferable skills,proven in real-world situations. Thisbackground can enhance your organi-zation's productivity. 2. Leadership The military trains people to lead by example as well as through direction, delegation, motivation and inspiration.Veterans understand the practical waysto manage behaviors for results, even inthe most trying circumstances. Theyalso know the dynamics of leadershipas part of both hierarchical and peerstructures. 3. Teamwork Veterans understand how genuine teamwork grows out of a responsibility to one's colleagues. Military dutiesinvolve a blend of individual and groupproductivity. They also necessitate aperception of how groups of all sizesrelate to one another and an overarch-ing objective. 4. Diversity and inclusion in action Veterans have learned to work side by side with individuals regardless of diverse race, gender, geographic origin,ethnic background, religion and eco-nomic status, as well as mental, physi-cal and attitudinal capabilities. Theyhave the sensitivity to cooperate withmany different types of individuals. 5. Efficient performance under pressure Veterans understand the rigors of tight schedules and limited resources.They have developed the capacity toaccomplish priorities on time, in spiteof tremendous stress. They know thecritical importance of staying with atask until it is done right. 6. Respect for procedures Veterans have gained a unique per- spective on the value of accountability. They can grasp their place within anorganizational framework, becomingresponsible for subordinates' actions tohigher supervisory levels. They knowhow policies and procedures enable anorganization to exist. 7. Technology and globalization Because of their experiences in the service, veterans are usually aware of international and technical trends perti-nent to business and industry. They canbring the kind of global outlook andtechnological savvy that all enterprisesof any size need to succeed. 8. Integrity Veterans know what it means to do \"an honest day's work.\" Prospective employers can take advantage of atrack record of integrity, often includ-ing security clearances. This integrity translates into qualities of sincerity andtrustworthiness. 9. Consciousness of health and safety standards Thanks to extensive training, veter- ans are aware of health and safety pro-tocols both for themselves and the wel-fare of others. Individually, they repre-sent a drug-free workforce that is cog-nizant of maintaining personal healthand fitness. On a company level, theirawareness and conscientiousness trans-late into protection of employees, prop-erty and materials. 10. Triumph over adversity In addition to dealing positively with the typical issues of personal maturity, veterans have frequently triumphedover great adversity. They likely haveproved their mettle in mission-criticalsituations demanding endurance, sta-mina and flexibility. They may haveovercome personal disabilities throughstrength and determination.

They were trying to focus on the present, which is the onlyplace we can actually get anything done. May 30 \u2014 I met CF in the hospital today. She is an older woman whose hus-band of 61 years died last fall. Listeningto her reminisce about life, I was remind-ed of what and who is really important inmy life as well. June 4 \u2014 MC is making progress toward her goals and shared her newinsight. She wants to change from themotto \"Life's a bitch, and then you die\"to one day having an obituary that reads,\"She was happy.\" She is finding supportand accountability in her church commu-nity, which somehow she never thoughtto make use of before. We really do havemore support available to us than werealize. June 5 \u2014 I met a really neat older cou- ple today. The man said, \"Sometimes,it's just one word or something simplethat you say that makes a real differencefor somebody.\" As a counselor whosometimes does not know if what I saymatters, I needed to hear that.June 11 \u2014 I don't typically enter a hospital room when the door is closed because of not knowing if the patientdoes or does not want a visit. For someunknown reason, I didn't follow thatguideline today and entered EB's room.I'm so glad I did because she talkedabout her experiences with \"healingtouch.\" While I was interested in under-standing this more, I also felt the free-dom and comfort of allowing her to tellher story without my having to fullyunderstand it. Her genuine concern forothers was so very evident and beautifuldespite her own dire condition. June 18 \u2014 During today's workshop, I was very aware of how people, ill orotherwise, want to \"know\" what is goingto happen to them but ultimately have tocome to terms with not knowing. Oneman shared how his anxiety only escalat-ed when he surfed the web for cancersurvival statistics. Like him, I want to beprepared for whatever comes my way,but I can't spend so much time worryingInternship in pastoral care services was my first experience working in a hospital. My job was to counsel cancerpatients and their families, create anddeliver psychoeducational supportgroups and cofacilitate inpatient andoutpatient grief and loss groups. Thisseemed like a great opportunity \u2014 if notfor the additional pressures of familyand being a full-time student. Howwould I balance all these responsibili-ties? How could I give so much ofmyself emotionally and physically at thehospital and also stay focused on familyand studies? The semester came and went quickly, and despite the busy schedule, I hadgrown not just professionally but alsopersonally and spiritually. This whirl-wind was put into perspective onlythrough supervision, my journal and themany meaningful things that patientssaid. Four overarching themes becameevident through this process: IIt is hard to accept both the good andthe bad that can happen to people atany given moment IPeace and hope come from some-thing greater than what we alone cansupply IWe can choose how we will view ourcircumstances IWe long to connect to others throughsharing our stories I was invited during my internship to listen to so many awe-inspiring storiesof faith, hope and love. This special priv-ilege was a reminder that, in serving oth-ers, we also receive benefits ourselves,well beyond what we could ever antici-pate. Without revealing names or otheridentifying information, I want to sharesome of the more meaningful com-ments, encounters and insights from myjournal. These experiences helped mesee so many aspects of the world andmyself in important new ways.May 14 \u2014 I led a stress management workshop for cancer patients, and it was interesting just how the group memberspretty much took over the workshop(which I was glad about) by sharingtheir personal stories. Connectingthrough stories seemed to be their No. 1goal. My \"take home\" for today is thatpeople don't always want or need anexpert teacher. They are already expertson the stories of their lives and are mak-ing meaning by connecting with the sto-ries of others. May 16 \u2014 FB called today to ask about her adult daughter's situation andhow she can be most supportive. Shetalked about how her patience has grownwith age, how she has to accept thethings she cannot change and that she \"isnot God.\" I need to develop more of thiskind of patience and acceptance when Ican't just fix problem situations as Iwould like. May 16 \u2014 A longtime volunteer said to my supervisor that she would nolonger be able to volunteer because offailing eyesight. She looked like she wasboth about to cry and had already beencrying. Giving up something that hasbeen so important for so long is hard andpainful even when it is for the best. May 21 \u2014 JB said, \"You know how when you're reading a book and it ends,but you feel like there's more that youwant to know?\" She said this at the endof a group, as if to say she did not wantit to end; she wanted more time withthese people. May 28 \u2014 Two men in this morning's outpatient group talked about how theyhold on to their pasts even though thosepasts are not healthy or happy. Later inthe day, CS talked about how she often isnot appreciative of what is happening inthe present because of overly focusingon the past or future. I think that's whatB and W were also searching for in thisLessons from my clients Continued on page 43 Student Focus - BY SHANNON WARDEN Counseling T oday INovember 2007 26Martinez, an American Counseling Association member and school coun-selor with the New London PublicSchool System in Connecticut. \"Politi-cians have to have some end point, sothey put 2014.\" \"(NCLB) has a strong emphasis on accountability and intense testing. I'mnot for or against it, nor argue the mer-its of whether every grade should betested, but I think it is unrealistic tosubject kids from other countries tothese high-stakes tests when they don'teven know the language. It's reallyunfair and that's my biggest concern,\"says Martinez, who works with a largepopulation of ELL (English languagelearner) students in his district. \"You have to be able to speak, read and write the English language if youare going to be able to negotiate yourexistence in this society. I think 98 per-cent of them absolutely want to do that.But to subject them to this kind of test-ing is incredibly frustrating. If youdon't know the language, how are yougoing to measure something that theydon't even have?\" Martinez adds that, in his opinion, the tests aren't student friendly, and hedoesn't think that relying solely on testscores for accountability is an adequategauge of a school's level of achieve-ment with students. \"The question is,do you want these kids to achieve orfail? If you don't supply them with theresources to acquire the skills that theyneed, testing them all the time isn'tgoing to help them learn the Englishlanguage.\" Carolyn Stone Carolyn Stone, past president of the American School Counselor Associa-tion, a division of ACA, is a schoolcounselor educator at the University ofNorth Florida. She has 22 years of expe-rience in the field of education as ateacher, counselor and supervisor. \"Because I was an educator who was around before NCLB, and because Isaw firsthand what happens to studentswhen there is no accountability, I am avery strong supporter of standards forkids. It really holds the educators whoare in charge of these young lives andtheir learning accountable for whathappens. That said, high-stakes testinghas really done a disservice in manyrespects to students.\" Stone feels strongly that schools should be allowed to use differentforms of assessments for students andthat \"success\" shouldn't be defined byone test. \"We know enough aboutassessments that we should be able, asa nation, to use different types ofassessments and even multiple assess-ments to determine a student's graspand competence within standards. Stan-dards are good, but high-stakes testingis not necessarily (good).\"Paula Stanley With 16 years of experience as a school counselor educator, ACA mem- ber Paula Stanley has a different per-spective on the effects of NCLB. Inworking with her interns at RadfordUniversity in Virginia, she has noticed achange in the perceived roles of schoolcounselors in the past few years. Somuch so, she says, that several individ-uals have entered the university'sschool counseling program only tochange their specialty upon realizingthat they may not get to work with stu-dents in the capacity they had assumed. \"There is just so much paperwork that they feel like they are not able to assistthe students adequately, and it's reallynot what they went into counseling for.They want to have direct contact withstudents, and they are finding it reallyfrustrating managing all the paperworkand also trying to fill their role as acounselor, as indicated by the ASCAstandards. You have counselors whodon't feel like they have the time towork with students on developmentalneeds. In most cases, the school coun-selors are in charge of managing theassessment, managing the success ofstudents over time and working withspecial needs children. They arealready overworked and not able to pro-vide the counseling and services theywant to. With NCLB, their role hasbecome even more administrative.\" Interns are also finding it increasing- ly difficult to meet the required 120direct service hours per semester fortheir internship, Stanley notes. \"Be-cause NCLB (student test results are)tied to funding, teachers don't want stu-dents to leave the classrooms, so it getsmore difficult for counselors to haveaccess to the students who could bene-fit from their services.\" She adds thatschool counselors really do value stu-dents' academic success just as much astheir social development and vocationalaspirations, and school counselors arewilling to work with teachers andadministrations in becoming moreaccountable. However, Stanley says, reducing the developmental role of school coun-selors ultimately works against studentsuccess. \"The focus is just on makingstudents pass this test, but some of thereasons why students aren't doing wellon the tests are personal or social. Theymay have feelings of low self-worth orconfidence, or they may have problemsat home. They come to school withthese problems burning inside of them,and it's hard for them to focus on theirschoolwork.\" Given the chance andtime, school counselors can help thesechildren with coping skills and evenencourage parents to get more involvedwith their child's academic success, shesays. Stanley admits the data gained from analyzing test scores can be beneficialas a means of proving the vital role of school counselors and their services.However, she says, \"Someone withmuch less than a master's degree cancount out tests. School counselors feelthat their skills aren't being used, andmuch of the work (associated withadministering the tests) can be done byclerical staff. The negative aspects ofNCLB do seem to be more prominentin school counselors' minds. \"It's really affecting how we train counselors, the choices that studentsmake in their counseling specialty and,ultimately, their choices once they haveentered the school counseling profes-sion. It's affecting all three points ofthat continuum.\" Christopher Laudo A school counselor at Salisbury Ele- mentary in Gap, Pa., Christopher Laudo's perspective is that, althoughthere are serious flaws in how NCLB iswritten, the legislation has ushered in agreat opportunity for innovation andchange. \"By making the status quounacceptable, the federal mandates ofNCLB have served to create an unparal-leled sense of urgency that has resultedin serious efforts to address equity andsocial justice. For school counselors, ithas meant that we can no longer sit onthe fence and debate whether we shouldbe running a data-driven program.Because other professionals in theschool setting are required to show theirimpact on student academic success,school counselors must hold themselvesto the same standard.\" If school coun-selors fail to demonstrate their impacton student success or take a leadershiprole in helping to remove systemic bar-riers to student success, Laudo says,they run the risk of being perceived asunnecessary. \"This switch to more of a systems focus has resulted in having some verypowerful conversations with my princi- pal. Through the problem-solvingprocess, as we share data and look toremove barriers to learning, we haveformed an even stronger alliance.Before NCLB, such conversationsmight have been too uncomfortable orawkward to have. Now, thanks toNCLB, they are a necessary part of thegrowth process of the school.\" Eric Sparks Serving the Wake County Public School System in North Carolina formore than 13 years, ASCA PresidentEric Sparks says he has witnessed sev-eral positive aspects of NCLB. \"It'shelped us to focus on data and look tosee which students are being successfuland which students need help. It reallyfits in well with the ASCA model interms of using data to identify studentswho aren't being successful academi-cally or behaviorally. In that respect, ithas helped school counselors show howthey are contributing to the overallgoals of the schools.\" Sparks adds that there are some major dilemmas surrounding NCLB,the biggest being funding \u2014 or the lackthereof. \"There are issues on how theformula is set up in terms of howschools are evaluated, so that has beena challenge to some of the schools.\" Hesays many schools don't think theyhave the resources they need to help allstudents achieve and meet the NCLBstandards. He also notes that the num-ber of subgroups as defined in NCLB,which takes into account minority stu-dents, English as a second languageand socioeconomic status, can varygreatly between schools. \"We haveschools that range from four or fivesubgroups all the way up to 24 to 25subgroups.

According to congressional staff, the Education committees in both theHouse and Senate were preparing tomark up their bills to reauthorize thelegislation as early as the week of Oct.22.

That could have a negative impacton students in the long run if schoolsdon't take measures to counteract that. Ifwe aren't providing activities for stu-dents to participate in the arts, we arereally missing out on opportunities tohelp the development of the overall stu-dent. Students who do participate in thearts, there's research that shows they dobetter in other areas, like math and lan-guage.\" He adds that nurturing talent andencouraging students in extracurricularventures promotes self-confidence andprovides balance. \"We do hear also that the level of stress on students has increased. We arehearing that from teachers and coun-selors alike. As school counselors areworking on their plans and programsfor their schools, a lot of times they areadding in additional emphasis on waysto cope with stress, anxiety and provid-ing workshops on test-taking skills.(But) while there are a lot of challengesto NCLB, before NCLB, it was easy tojust look at school data as a whole andnot really dig in and see who isn't beingsuccessful. Now we can help more stu-dents achieve in school.\" Delores Curry A high school counselor at Blooming- ton High School in California, DeloresCurry says it's important for schoolcounselors to advocate for themselvesto be included in the rewriting/reauthorization of NCLB as a necessarycomponent in student achievement.\"One of the concerns we have as theschool counseling profession is makingsure that when the legislation talksabout 'school personnel,' school coun-selors are included within that group.As with any policy or legislation thatmust be followed, there's always goingto be those who are happy and thosewho are not.\"Overall, she believes NCLB has helped ensure that schools are making services and programs available to bothsubgroups of students and individualstudents who are struggling to meetNCLB standards. \"With NCLB, you areidentifying students and catching stu-dents that may have been tossed to thewayside before.\" Organizations grade NCLB According to the ASCA position statement on high-stakes testing,\"High-stakes tests can penalize schoolsand students for factors over which theyhave no control, such as socioeconomicinfluences, naturally occurring yearlyfluctuations or a student's state of readi-ness to perform on the day of the test.The scores resulting from high-stakestests do not take into account importantfactors such as a school's adequacy ofeducational funding, lack of standard-ization of the test's administration,interpretation and scoring, potentialerrors in scoring or barriers to studentperformance. The testing results do notnecessarily indicate student learning.\" While ASCA supports the use of stan- dardized tests as one of many measuresof student and school achievement andsuccess, it rejects the use of high-stakestests or any other single measurementinstrument. According to ASCA's \"The when life-influencing deci-sions are being made.\" In a recent survey conducted by Teachers Network, more than 5,600public school teachers from all 50 stateswere questioned on the effectiveness ofNCLB and its impact on schools. Only37 percent found standardized testing\"somewhat useful.\" Less than 1 percentagreed that it was an effective way toevaluate the quality of schools. ACA Assistant Director of Public Pol- icy and Legislation Chris Campbellsays that, although not optimum, NCLBwas a good start to education reform.\"(ACA) strongly supports the main pur-pose of NCLB: to afford all children anequal opportunity to receive a qualityeducation and, in doing so, to close theachievement gap between disadvan-taged children and their more advan-taged peers,\" Campbell says. \"ACAbelieves that highly qualified teachersare critical to student achievement.However, if children are not physicallyand mentally prepared to learn, the bestclassroom instruction will not producethe desired results.\" Work on reauthorization of the Ele- mentary and Secondary Education Act(i.e., NCLB) is picking up speed,according to Campbell. In August, theHouse Education Committee released apreliminary proposal to reauthorizeESEA. Following release of the draftlanguage, ACA joined other educationgroups in submitting comments. TheCounseling T INovember 2007 28 Counseling T oday INovember 2007 29Though my state \u2014 North Carolina \u2014 has one of the most rapidly growing Latino populations in the nation, I workin a middle school that has low numbersof these students. Because of this smallpresence, I am especially interested inensuring that these students are notneglected. In today's controversial cli-mate, they need to link together with oneanother. Whatever your personal views on the whole immigration debate, can we allagree that kids are kids? These kids areonly here because of their parents and, inmost cases, the parents are here becausethey want a better life for their children.As a school counselor, I feel an obliga-tion to welcome newcomers, whetherthey are from the next county or the nextcountry. We cannot build schools in ourarea fast enough to accommodate therapidly rising numbers of students. Thisleads to overcrowding and all its atten-dant problems. But the children are notto blame. Once they are here, we mustinvite them in and embrace them! Noticing through the years that few Latino students actively seek counselingfrom the guidance department, I havedecided to take the initiative and go afterthem. I know they have serious needsand can benefit from my skills as a coun-selor, and the most efficient means toserve them is through group counseling. To develop the group, I select sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders who areconnected, either by consultation oractual class enrollment, to the English asa Second Language (ESL) program.Students in the ESL program have yet tomaster competency levels in the Englishlanguage, which is usually the result ofliving in the United States for only a brief period of time. I believe these stu-dents share more common ground thanthose who have had adequate time toacculturate. I choose to conduct a girls-only group because of the inevitable dis-traction that boys will cause at this ageof budding hormonal intensity. Plus, wehave the potential for more in-depth dis-cussion of issues that are exclusively thedomain of girls. At the beginning of the previous school year, my school had 10 Latinaswho met the criteria for my group \u2014 aworkable number for a support group.Because the group members come frommultiple grade levels and because ourschool runs three different schedules, Ifind it necessary to set up group meet-ings for either the first or the last 45 min-utes of the day. I hesitate to rile teachersby pulling students out of the same class-es on a regular basis. So, instead of my usual plan of meeting weekly for six ses-sions, I make this group a yearlong affairwith monthly meetings. Operating in thismanner, teachers hardly realize thatthese students are being pulled fromclasses. I include the school social worker as a group coleader, as she shares my desireto welcome our newcomers. If you canfind a coleader who speaks fluent Span-ish, you should consider yourself lucky.But fluency in Spanish is certainly not anecessity. Though I have completed twoSpanish courses in recent years at a com-munity college, I still find it extremelyhard to eradicate all the French wordsthat pop up in my brain.

Exercise caution when responding to Listservs A word to the wise: Double check your distribution list before clicking \"send.\" Circulat-ing a personal response to anindividual through a forum withhundreds of \"lurkers\" couldundermine your professionalgoals. A recent example ... A facul- ty member sent a position an-nouncement to a Listserv. Oneof the faculty member's friendswho was interested in the posi-tion responded, thinking theresponse would go only to thefaculty member. Instead, theresponse was posted to the List-serv, disclosing a variety of information about the person,including a willingness to ac-cept a lower level rank than thisindividual currently held. Two problems here: First, the entire list (including any col-leagues working at the sameinstitution) is now aware thatthis individual is seeking a newposition. Second, any leveragethis person may have had innegotiating for a higher rank hasbeen lost because the disclosureof willingness to settle for alower rank was accidentallymade public. If you are posting informa- tion to a Listserv that mayinvite responses of a personalnature, you can help your col-leagues by providing a person-al e-mail address.

Learning foreign lan-guages is a task truly meant forthe young! Though we conductthe group in English, we keep aSpanish dictionary nearby incase we get stuck because oflanguage difficulties. I believe in assigning each group session a focus ratherthan just providing a meetingplace and allowing free-flowchatting or venting. Middleschool-aged students needsome leadership to initiate dis-cussion. Otherwise, they mightshrink from the tough ques-tions, and the group will be lessmeaningful. I want them tofully explore the omnipresentracism and intolerance theyencounter and ponder theirresponse to it. I want them toexpress the pain and pressurethey experience from parents athome when cultures clash.How will they react if parentsrestrict their dating to Latinos?What if their families do notvalue higher education? Howdo they feel about visits to theirhomeland? I want the girls tosee our group as a friendlyplace to share concerns \u2014 anoasis in the rising storm.To get started, I send individ- ual notes through homeroomclasses requesting that the girlscome to a meeting in the guid-ance office. I spring the noteson them the morning of the ini-tial meeting; that way there isless time for them to worryabout why they are being sum-moned to the office. As theygather in the office with identi-cal notes, they appear a littlenervous, a little excited. Afterthey have all arrived, the socialworker and I welcome them inSpanish. Then we revert toEnglish, occasionally testingtheir understanding by tossingin some Spanish phrases. We discuss the purpose of the group and hand them a sched-ule with meeting topics, datesand times. We explain generalgroup rules, such as listeningattentively and practicing con-fidentiality. We assure themthat we are not asking ques-tions about their immigrationstatus. Copies of parent permis-sion letters in both English andSpanish are provided. To gain support from admin- istration, I have promised anunderlying academic focus forthis group. To honor this com-mitment, I give the girls indexcards and ask them to writetheir first set of academicprogress reports and then setgoals for the actual report cardsthat will soon follow. I thencollect the cards, telling thegirls I'll bring the cards to alater session so we can reviewtheir progress. In the days following our first group meeting, I usually find afew signed parent permissionforms in the box outside mydoor. But, invariably, I have tochase down the girls duringhomeroom or between classesto obtain the majority of theforms. If you want to create anygroup with middle school stu-dents, you have to be very will-ing to go that extra mile. Beforethe time arrives for our secondsession, I'll have every form.These girls want to be membersof a group. They want to beincluded. At the second session, the girls make collages describingwho they are. A pile of maga-zine pictures (precut by me tosave time), scissors, glue andconstruction paper are spreadacross the table in the grouproom. I ask them to search forpictures that show their currentinterests and future aspirations.I always include some gradua-tion scenes and am pleasedwhen they choose them. I try tofind photos of Latinas, but itdoesn't seem to bother themthat there are so few. At the endof the session, they show theircollages to the group and sharewhy they selected certain pic-tures. It's a great way to helpthem get to know one another. Another session is titled \"How You Fit In: Expecta-tions/Dilemmas.\" I providesample scenarios for discussionthat cover divisive topics suchas when family values conflictwith personal wants and needs.I insert the names of the girlsto give the scenarios morepunch. (I have changed thenames for this article.) Example: Karina's little sis- ter Rosa is too sick to go toschool. Their mother is afraidto leave Rosa at home alone,but she needs to go to work.When she misses work, shedoes not get paid. She asksKarina to stay home fromschool to watch her sister. The girls in the group nod at the familiarity of this issue, andwe openly brainstorm alterna-tive solutions. Other samplescenarios include missingschool to interpret for a parentmaking a business transactionand being forced to go to a fam-ily event on the night of aschool band concert. Another session is \"Accep- tance: What You Can/CannotChange.\" The girls pull strips ofpaper, each with a simple state-ment written on it, from a bas-ket. They read the statementsaloud and indicate whether thesituations are something theycan change. Some of the state-ments are a little tricky, and afew trigger dissenting opinions.Many of the statements aredesigned to instill pride andbuild self-esteem. Example: You made an F in science last quarter. (No, youcannot change it; the grade is a\"done deed.\" However, you canwork on improving the gradefor next quarter.) Another example: Your father works at the poultry farm. (No,you cannot change it, but youcan feel proud that your fatheris working hard to support yourfamily.) Another example: Your best Reader Viewpoint Continued from page 29 Counseling T oday INovember 2007 33friend is Felicia. (Yes, you might change your mind about her, decid-ing you like Eneida better.) As you can imagine, each state- ment has the potential for elicitingmuch discussion. Although we talkabout serious matters, the girlshave fun. Our sessions feature noshortage of laughter. In another session, we cover careers. I share information fromthe Hispanic College Fund, hopingto jump-start thoughts of continu-ing education beyond high school.As another part of this session, thesocial worker distributes informa-tion about the Latino/Latina pres-ence in various careers. We empha-size the value of being bilingual inthe world of work and encouragethem to maintain their use of Spanish. At another session, we talk about relationships, which always invitesgiggles. We talk about such issuesas pressure for intimacy, conflict-ing viewpoints from parents aboutdating and families valuing mar-riage at a young age. Still anothersession focuses on cultural cele-brations. We compare holidays inthe United States and Mexico. Thegirls look forward to the quincean-era, their \"coming-out\" party atage 15, which is not very far off forthe eighth-graders. For the last session, we coleaders bring refreshments. We brieflyreview our discussion topics fromthroughout the year and solicittheir input for the following year'sgroup. They toss around ideas suchas including boys in the group,making it more of a club than agroup, meeting after school insteadof during school and including allLatina students rather than limitingit to those on the ESL roster. Why should other school coun- selors consider starting a supportgroup for Latino students? Hereare just a few reasons: IIt gives them an opportunity tobelong to something. Holdingthe group during school hourseliminates the transportationproblem that many of these stu-dents face. IIt provides them with moralsupport as they face increasing-ly toxic attitudes about immi-gration. Remember, these stu-dents can't help where theylive. IIt gives them an opportunity tolearn conflict resolution skillsto deflect the negativism oftenshown to minorities. If fightscan be prevented because stu-dents can vent their feelings ina group, we are accomplishingmuch! IIt gives them a chance to relaxand speak a little Spanish atschool if they desire without someone demanding that they speak English. Thinkhow relieved you feel whenyou are touring a foreigncountry and encounter some-one else speaking English!For a few moments, life iseasier. IIt provides them an oppor-tunity to connect withschool staff members. We all need support, and stu-dents facing dual identitiesespecially need help. Admittedly, the social worker and I are both white and havelittle in common with the girlsin our group. A Latina adultwho has traveled the same pathas the girls would surely be amore desirable leader for thegroup. But waiting around for things to operate \"as theyshould\" has never been mystyle. And the girls seem happyenough that someone is willing to take notice of them, toacknowledge and appreciatetheir rich cultural background.After all, they are just kids whowant to be invited to the party.

Singaravelu and Mark Pope U.S. colleges and universities continue to be highly regarded around the world, drawing large numbers of internationalstudents \u2014 more than 580,000 last year.These students can encounter problemsand issues that are often quite differentfrom those faced by native-born collegestudents.In A Handbook first-hand knowledge of theexperiences of international students.Singaravelu is an associate professor inthe Saint Louis University Departmentof Counseling and Family Therapy.

Mark Pope is a professor and chair of theDivision of Counseling and FamilyTherapy at the University ofMissouri-St. Louis. He is a past presi-dent of the American Counseling Asso-ciation and has written extensively oncareer counseling and cross-cultural andmulticultural issues in counseling. Counseling Today: How do the coun- seling needs of an international studentdiffer from those of a permanent U.Sresident who was also foreign born? Hemla Singaravelu: In both situa- tions, students are adjusting to a newenvironment and social system. Howev-er, foreign-born U.S. residents are oftenfurther along in their adjustmentprocess. In addition, international stu-dents have to deal with the complexitiesrelated to the temporary nature of theirstay in the U.S., ongoing immigrationissues, finances and the long-distanceseparation from family. Mark Pope: International students may also be more reluctant to seek coun-seling help. That may be due to culturalissues, less availability of counselingservices in their native country or simplyfeeling that a U.S. counselor is not goingto understand their needs or problems. CT:What are some of the major chal- lenges that international students face? HS: International students often struggle to meet social, educational andfamilial expectations. Some may expe-rience cultural conflicts, discriminationand feeling very different from themajority. This could lead to feelings of isolation, disillusionment and withdrawal. MP: While international students arrive very excited about studying in theUnited States, they almost immediatelyfind themselves immersed in a new cul-ture and facing social and academicenvironments that often are quite differ-ent from what they've known. CT: What do you see as the primary usage for A Handbook for CounselingInternational Students in the UnitedStates? MP: We wanted this to be a practical handbook. It's organized in three sec-tions. In the first, we help counselorsunderstand the wide range of difficultiesthat international students may face,since those challenges are usually quitedifferent from those faced by U.S.-bornstudents. The book looks at adjustmentand academic issues, as well as the diffi-culties that international students withdisabilities or gay, lesbian and bisexualinternational students may face. HS: In the second section, our experts provide cultural and environmentalinformation about international studentsfrom different continents and offerapproaches needed to work with themsuccessfully. Counseling a student fromEurope often requires a very different approach and set of understandings thanwould be needed in working with anAsian student. We also include case sce-narios to illustrate what a counselormight experience and offer suggestionson ways to approach specific issues. Thefinal section offers suggestions on coun-seling and outreach approaches that helpincrease the odds of working successful-ly with international students. CT:Has the recent emphasis of profes- sional organizations on training in multi- cultural competencies for counselorsmade it easier for counselors to workwith international students? HS:While such training is certainly an asset, in my experience, it often doesn'tprovide the necessary foundation towork with the complexities and culturalsubtleties of this uniquely diverse popu-lation. Internationals bring with them avariety of influences that are not going tobe seen with clients who are full-timeU.S. residents. MP: There are also variables that may seem unimportant at first, yet can direct- ly affect an international student's abili-ty to adjust and work successfully. Beingfrom a non-English-speaking country isa fairly obvious issue, but students arealso influenced by social issues, theirhome country's political environment orwhether they are coming from a culturethat is more collectivistic than individu-alistic. We have structured this book toenable counselors to better understandthe importance of such variables on thestudent. /ornament21 A Handbook for Counseling Interna- tional Students in the United States can be ordered directly from ACA (Order #72849).

I Counseling T oday INovember 2007 39 Of people in psychological distress, more than two-thirds will not seek help from counselors or psychotherapists.Their reasons involve an interaction ofseveral avoidance factors and situationalinfluences. In the Fall 2007 Journal of Counseling & Development, DavidV ogel, Stephen Wester and Lisa Larsonsummarize seven avoidance factors: Social stigma \u2014 People in general make negative judgments about individu-als who seek mental health help. This isone of the strongest influences on atti-tudes toward counseling. Treatment fears \u2014 People expect that counseling will be aversive: They will betreated harshly, the counselor will try tocontrol them or they may be medicated orhospitalized. Fear of emotion \u2014 Many people are generally unwilling to express and dis-cuss their emotions. They avoid bringingup painful experiences and expect thatcounseling would make them do this. Anticipated utility and risk \u2014 People believe that counseling probably won'thelp much, or at least not enough to bal-ance out the potential dangers of seekingtreatment. Self-disclosure \u2014 Many people prefer to conceal personal information, espe-cially from a stranger. Social norms \u2014 If one's family and friends have negative attitudes towardseeking professional counseling, one isunlikely to do so. Self-esteem \u2014 Fears of embarrassment, inferiority or incompetence prevent peo-ple from going to professional counselors. The authors discuss how these factors interact with gender roles, ethnicity, set-ting, problem type and age in predictingwhether someone will avoid counseling.They also suggest ways in which coun-selors can combat the influence of avoid-ance factors. This well-documentedreview of the problem will be useful toinstructors of counseling in particularbecause it organizes a large body ofresearch and includes a rich reference list. Career choice under communism Western models of career development assume that an individual's skills andpreferences play a large role in his or herultimate work pathway and that individ-ual choice exists, enhanced by careercounseling and information. Theseassumptions are based, however, on expe-rience in countries with certain social,political and economic standards. LonaWhitmarsh and Ruxandra Ritter providean eye-opening discussion of careerdevelopment under communist regimesin the September 2007 issue of The Career Development Quarterly. Countries such as Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany andChina experienced long periods of com-munist rule during which individualcareer paths were directed by the numberof workers needed in each sector of thesociety. Obedience and conformity to theinterests of the society were unquestion-able values. The number of educationalslots open in each field reflected predict-ed needs, and after 10th grade, very fewcitizens were accepted into college. Eachstudent was permitted to apply to onlyone department in one specific college,which created early choice and competi-tion among those who desired highereducation. Because each person was required to hold a job, job placements were guaran-teed. These jobs were assigned, not cho-sen. Upward advancement within a fieldwas restricted to members of the Com-munist Party. These conditions engen-dered a very different model of careerdevelopment than those we assume incounselor training in this country. Theauthors support their general discussionwith a case history of a 42-year-oldRomanian man who grew up in the 1970sand 1980s. How healthy are the helpers? The counseling profession emphasizes wellness in practitioners and trainees tocombat burnout and maintain high-quality service to clients. Counselor edu-cation programs rarely use wellness intheir selection criteria, however, and sel-dom have a procedure to monitortrainees' wellness or impairment. Well-ness is conceptualized as self-care, self-awareness and personal development inphysical, mental and spiritual life. In a study of 204 counseling students grouped by three points in their training,Leila Roach and Mark Young tested fortrends in self-reported wellness levels(September 2007 Counselor Education and Supervision ). They expected that stu- dents would increase in overall wellnessfrom beginning (1-12 semester hourscompleted) to midpoint (18-30 hours) mea-sured concepts from the IndivisibleSelf: An Evidence-Based Model of Well-ness (Sweeney and Myers), the threegroups did not differ in wellness levelsbased on time in a counseling program. ACA Journal Spotlight - BY SUSAN X DAY Why troubled people avoid counseling The counseling students did score higher than the measure's norm group of 1,899 persons. Gender, cultural back-ground and a personal counselingrequirement made no significant differ-ence in overall wellness scores amongthe students. The authors discuss theseand other statistical findings, as well asthe results of an open-ended question,\"What, if anything, have you learned in your counseling course work that hashelped you develop knowledge and skillsregarding your personal wellness?\" Carl Rogers today The September 2007 issue of the American Psychological Associationjournal Psychotherapy: Theory, Re- search, Practice, Training includes a spe- cial section on \"The Necessary and Suf-ficient Conditions at the Half-CenturyMark.\" In 1957, Carl Rogers published his paper on the necessary and sufficientconditions for positive change. In theAPA journal, 11 well-known theoreti-cians and researchers comment on howthey view Rogers' ideas 50 years later.Counselors will no doubt be interested inthese scholars' views of a classic work onthe therapeutic relationship.

In 2007, the Empty Plate Project raised $2,877 for the Detroit Rescue MissionMinistries, which provides food, shelter,education and job training to assist home-less people in rebuilding their lives.In 2006, Empty Plate raised $2,590 for SunYouth, a private, nonprofit group ded- icated to assisting children and their fam-ilies throughout the Montr\u00e9al metropoli-tan area. In 2005, Empty Plate raised $3,792 for the Atlanta Community Food Bank, which distributes almost 2 million poundsof food and other donated grocery itemsmonthly throughout metro Atlanta andnorth Georgia. C-AHEAD, the counseling community and the Empty Plate Project have alsomade an impact in New Orleans, SanAntonio, Washington, D.C., San Diegoand many other locations across the Unit-ed States. In 2002, a special donation wasmade to schools in New York City affect-ed by the 9/11 attack on the World TradeCenter. Following the 2000 ACA World Con- ference in Washington, D.C., Empty Platebenefited a Nazarene Church whose min-ister was a former ACA staff member.According to Sunny Vassos, a former Empty Plate chairperson, \"He (the minis-ter) said it was the largest collection theyhad ever had.\" The Empty Plate collectionthat year was close to $6,000. Vassos received a similar testimonial from a nun serving at a Catholic women'sshelter in New Orleans, when the EmptyPlate Project again raised close to $6,000.The nun contacted Vassos and told herthat the sisters cried when they countedthe money. They had never received sucha large donation, and the shelter had beenfinancially desperate. The stories from Washington and New Orleans demonstrate the gratitude ofEmpty Plate's benefactors, which shouldinspire continued efforts to help organiza-tions in areas where the ACA Conferenceis being held. But that's just part of the story. While Empty Plate Project initiatives continueto be a success on the national level, otherorganizations, inspired by C-AHEAD,carry the spirit of the project to the locallevel as well. After the success of C-AHEAD's 2005 fund-raising efforts,the Oklahoma Christian Counselor Asso-ciation introduced a new community pro-ject for the Oklahoma Counseling Associ-ation at its fall conference \u2014 a SoonerState version of the Empty Plate Project.Similarly, other organizations have con-ducted versions of the Empty Plate Pro-ject at annual conferences and meetings. For example, in 2005, the Association forCounselor Education and Supervisioncollected monies at its conference duringthe President's Luncheon and the South-ern Association for Counselor Educationand Supervision Reception. ACES raisedmore than $1,200 for the Women's Centerand Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh.

IQ: I look forward to reading your column in Counseling Today every month. I appreciate your balanced perspective and your clarity aboutyour bias in favor of being on managedcare panels. My wife (a licensed clini-cal social worker) and I (a licensedprofessional counselor) are in theprocess of forming a limited liabilitycorporation together and expandingour respective private practices. Shewants to accept insurance, and I planto continue avoiding it, so I'd be curi-ous to hear your recommendations forhow we might structure our practicein a future column. A:What a great question! It is possi- ble for you to work together and stilldiffer on your billing approach. Wehave evolved as a profession to thepoint of having pretty flexible prac-tices. For you, we recommend using the \"superbill\" outlined in our August andOctober 2007 columns. As a \"pay forservice\" practice, you can chargeclients up front and also have them sub-mit the bill to their own insurance ormanaged care company. Be sure toadvise them that some managed carecompanies require a HCFA/CMS 1500form instead of a superbill. As for your wife, she can use any number of billing software programsoutlined in the \"Private Practice Point-ers\" (members-only) section of theAmerican Counseling Association web-site. In particular, look under the \"Fre-quently Asked Questions\" articles to Pointers.\" Find resourcesfor both references at: www.counseling. org/Counselors/TP/PrivatePracticePointersMembers/CT2.aspx. It will be fun for us to see how you do as you expand your private practicesusing different billing structures. Wewould never encourage competitionbetween you two, of course, but let usknow who wins. Q: I am an ACA member and enjoy reading your column. I have a smallprivate practice in a community ofabout 18,000 folks who are primarilyblue-collar workers. It is a verydepressed area. We have approxi-mately a dozen therapists in town. Isee an average of eight to 12 clientsper week and want to increase mypractice. I have also recently pur- chased a small office building withroom for two to three more thera-pists. I would like to contract withother therapists and provide refer-rals that I will obtain by increasingmy referral base. I have limited fundsfor increasing my business and aminterested in your \"multiple streamsof income\" premise. Any suggestionsor information would be helpful. A:Sounds to us like you are off to a good start. A business plan that empha-sizes multiple income streams includesnot only traditional practice but otherservices and products that could behelpful and produce revenue. You arealready doing this by buying a buildingand looking to have others work foryou. Other income streams may includeproduct development and sales,employee assistance program services,teaching, psychoeducational groups(parenting classes, marriage enrich-ment), owning a clinic, coaching, con-ducting workshops, consulting, part-time employment and so on. Theseother income streams can augment atraditional talk therapy practice thatmay be limited due to economic factorsin the community. Q: A managed care company called and told me that my provider infor-mation on CAQH needed to beupdated. I just posted my informa-tion less than a year ago. What'sgoing on? A:Many counselors have taken advan- tage of applying for insurance and man-aged care contracts through the Councilfor Affordable Quality Healthcare(CAQH.org or 888.599.1771). We would encourage other counselors to apply aswell (see the online \"Private PracticePointers\" for application procedures). Periodically, the information on CAQH will need to be updated. Thismostly relates to renewal of your coun-seling license and/or malpractice insur-ance. Simply log on to CAQH.org and verify that the dates of both yourlicense and malpractice insurance arecurrent. Q: I am interested in getting a tax ID number. The URL printed in yourSeptember 2007 column is incorrect.Can you tell me the correct URL?

As a former college pro-fessor herself, she reminded methat balance is both importantand possible. She also sharedthat my studies and interactionsare a way of serving a highercalling. It meant so much com-ing from someone with such along history of service to others.I need to keep a perspective onthe long-term picture of life andnot get discouraged by what canseem like so little progress onany given day. June 20 \u2014 My supervisor is helping me to become a betterobserver and responder to what'sbeing said or exhibited in themoment. I am often so con-cerned with all the details of anencounter that I overlook impor-tant information being conveyedin the moment. I've got to learnto slow down and pay attention to what's really happening. June 25 \u2014 A client simply said he \"wanted to go home,\" so I assumed he meant that he wasready to die. Those words, thatthinking and that reality happenall too often here. Listening a lit- tle longer, I realized he literallymeant he wanted to go home.His family is a great source ofstrength, and being in the hospi-tal away from home and familywas only making him feel moredepressed. Sometimes simple,straightforward statements arejust that; be careful not to jumpto conclusions too quickly. June 26 \u2014 I can never fully prepare for group work. Thereare a few main goals or themes Ican go for, but then group is justgoing to happen, and the task isto stay with it. If it is good, it isgoing to be different each time.So, go with the flow! You can'tprepare for everything. June 27 \u2014 Just when I was worrying about meeting my\"direct hours\" goal for the day, Ihad an unexpected visit with TR.She is making the most of everyday despite her chronic disease.Her story inspired me to rethinkpriorities and remember thatthere are more important thingsthan schedules. July 2 \u2014 A familiar theme appeared in group today: Why isit easier to do for others than forourselves? That really hits home.I need to keep working on prac-ticing the self-care that I preach!It is so easy to put aside, andthen I and everyone around mesuffers. July 16 \u2014 CS is dying. I can't believe it. We just met a fewweeks ago, and now, there she isin her hospital bed dying. I knowdeath is just part of life, but it'sstill somehow difficult to graspand accept how quickly it canhappen. Her dad is waiting verylovingly beside her bed. CS isnonresponsive. July 17 \u2014 I am having a very hard time believing that CS isdead. When I talked with her afew weeks ago, she was either notaware of how sick she was orchoosing to focus on other partsof her life. There's a part of methat feels like I should haveknown she was dying, but I didn'tand guess I couldn't or maybedidn't want to. July 18 \u2014 MW shared how she came to know that she can'tsee her future because \"God isnot ready\" for her to see it now.She said, \"When I can't knowwhat the future holds, I just try tolisten more closely to what Godmight be telling me.\" There is theimportance of patience and faithagain. July 18 \u2014 As if my emotions are not already on overload, I hada chance encounter with ELtoday. While I listened to her talkabout her faith in the midst of thebattle with cancer, I was over-whelmed with the reality thatinstead of being an encourage-ment to her, she was much moreof an encouragement to me. Herstrength, vision, passion for lifeand religious faith were inspiring.I feel like she was saying:\"Believe! Don't ever lose hope.Change is not all up to you but isthe shared opportunity and hopeof us all!\" These are only excerpts from my journal, offering a fewglimpses of the many people whohelped change my focus from \"Ihave to be here\" to \"I want to behere.\" In fact, I came to believethat I was supposed to be there in part for my own personal andspiritual growth. But before Icould recognize this internshipwas a gift rather than a burden, Ihad to accept my reality andfocus on what sustains me inchallenging times. It is aboutremembering that I not only helpothers through counseling, but also benefit from the many storiesthat people so willingly share.The only way to acquire thesebenefits is by being fully presentwith each and every client everytime. All these things helped bring my internship into proper per-spective. Fitting the internshipinto my schedule was the least ofmy worries. After I gained thatperspective, I became more grate-ful for the privilege of connecting emotionally and spiritually withthe people I encountered. I knowI grew as a result of thoseencounters. I hope and trust that Iwas able to encourage thepatients in meaningful ways asthey so often encouraged me.

New study reveals Latino parents' views on bullying, sexual orientation, prejudice In October, Mental Health America released results from a national study of Latino parents to better understandparent-child communication aboutbullying, sexual orientation and preju-dice. Nearly all Latino parents sur-veyed believe information on sexualorientation should come from parents,yet two-thirds have not started suchconversations with their children. Thefindings coincide with the release of anew Spanish-language brochure,\"Qu\u00e9 Significa Ser Gay?\" part of Mental Health America's ongoingefforts to reduce bullying, particularly regarding sexual orientation. Fordetails, visit mentalhealthamerica. net/go/surveys. \"Bullying and the use of gay slurs in schoolyards and communities arefar too common in America,\" saidDavid Shern, Mental Health Ameri-ca's president and chief has serious effects on chil-dren's self-esteem, schoolwork andoverall development. Talking withchildren about sexual orientation maynot be easy, but it will help them learnto better handle situations of bullyingand to respect and value others.\" In 2005, nearly one-third of stu- dents reported being bullied at schoolduring a six-month period, accordingto the Department of Education. TheSex Information and Education Coun-cil of the United States found that per-ceived or actual sexual orientationand gender identification are two ofthe top three reasons youth in theUnited States are bullied. Young peo-ple who are bullied are at an increasedrisk of mental health problems suchas anxiety disorders, depression andsuicide. Lesbian, gay, bisexual andtransgender (LGBT) youth are at evengreater risk. Studies on youth suiciderates and sexual orientation consis-tently show that LGBT youth are atleast two times more likely than theirsame-sex peers to attempt suicide.More prejudice about LGBT issues abounds in communities of color, and LGBT youth within these communi-ties represent a \"minority within aminority,\" putting them at evengreater risk of being bullied. In fact,LGBT students of color feel less safeat school than white LGBT studentsbecause of their race or ethnicity(16.6 percent compared with 3.8 per-cent, respectively), according to theGay, Lesbian and Straight EducationNetwork. Almost one-quarter of thesestudents experience physical harass-ment due to their sexual orientationalone and 13.2 percent because ofboth their sexual orientation and raceor ethnicity. \"Young people of color who are bul- lied for sexual orientation or genderidentification are not only at risk ofbullying, assault and isolation, but theyare at risk for problems such as depres-sion, school failure and suicide,\" saidDr. Sergio Aguilar-Gaxiola, boardchair Health problems are preventable inpart through improved parent-childcommunication.\" Film focused on schizophrenia hopes for wider release CANVAS, a film about a family's struggle with schizophrenia, pre- miered in Chicago and New York Cityon Oct. 12. Mental health advocacyorganizations were urging their mem-bers to do their part to support themovie, saying it could deepen Ameri-cans' understanding of mental illnessand give Hollywood a reason to makemore movies of a similar nature.\"Together, we can make positivedepictions of mental illness the norm rather than the exception,\"said a release from Mental HealthAmerica. If the movie attracted large audi- ences in Chicago, New York City,Phoenix and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., itwas likely to open in as many as 200additional cities. The film stars Oscar-winner Marcia Gay Harden and Emmy-winner JoePantoliano of Sopranos fame. CAN- VAS is described as a heartwarming family film inspired by director JosephGreco's personal experience as ayoung boy with a mother who battledschizophrenia.

IIn Brief Continued from page 6 Counseling T oday INovember 2007 45 Keynotes Continued from page 12 tions and ancestral stories of survival to \"bring forth renewalin the lives of troubled adoles-cents and families in despair.\" Keeney, the son and grandson of country preachers, saysecstatic spiritual expressions,such as shaking, shouting,jumping and \"speaking intongues,\" have become taboo insociety. In the process, he says,we have chopped off a vitalpart of the natural healingprocess. \"There has been anoverwhelming rush to the med-itative practices,\" he explains,\"but that is only half of thehealing equation. For the mostpart, we assume that healingtakes place by calming thingsdown, and there's truth to that,but it's only a half-truth. As youmove in the other direction \u2014to heightened arousal \u2014 thereare also natural healing re-sponses. The oldest custodiansof healing know that both ele-ments are important.\" Keeney points out that it takes most people a substantialamount of effort to suppress theurge to wiggle and fidget whenthey are trying to force them-selves to relax or quiet theirmind. But practitioners ofshaking medicine first experi-ence heightened arousal, heexplains, exhausting them-selves with ecstatic movement,and then collapse to the groundand enter a meditative state aspart of the natural cycle. In thismovement, Keeney describesshaking medicine as \"both ashaking of our physical pres-ence and a shaking of ourthoughts, our mind.\" Exactly how this process works to heal the body andmind is still something of amystery, Keeney says, but thatdoesn't discount its legitimacy.In fact, he strongly encouragescounselors to retain apprecia-tion for mystery. \"If we makemystery extinct in our profes-sion, then we're in big trouble,\"he proclaims. \"We becomesoulless. We're dead. That'swhat's happened to psychiatry.\" Keeney says he will use part of his keynote at the ACA Con-ference to call for continuedcreativity in counseling. Thatmeans continually pursuinginnovative ways to connectwith clients and push them totake action. Keeney refers to the current work he is doing with clients ascreative action therapy. Insteadof sitting in an hourlong talksession with clients, heexplains, he may immediatelytell them to go to the hardwarestore and bring back anythingthey want as long as it's under$5. \"Sometimes it's important to get clients out of theirchairs,\" he says. \"We need tomove. It's another way toshake things up. The idea thatyou're going to help everyoneget unstuck solely through theuse of words is a very trickyhouse of mirrors. To try tohold back from action isanother way of holding backways we can be present. Ther-apy is either dead or alive, andyou don't need an education tosee it.\" \"I'm not looking to bring spirituality to counseling butrather to bring back spirited counseling,\" Keeney says inclosing. \"Perhaps the godshave sent the clients to helpwake up the counselors.\" IFor information or to register for the ACA Conference & Exposition,March 26-30, 2008, in Honolulu, visit www.counseling.org/conference or call 800.347.6647 ext. 222.

She is regard- ed as a distinguished voice in the field ofmulticultural counseling and has beenvery outspoken on matters of race andequality. \"Madonna is one of the most respected scholars in multicultural studies,\" Suetold Counseling Today . \"People who enter this field know that they are chal-lenging the prevailing ideology, andsome expect to encounter resistance.When you talk about race, you are push-ing powerful buttons, so some reactionsmay not necessarily be positive.\" Constantine was the recipient of the 2001 ACA Research Award for her influ-ential studies of multicultural counselingcompetence.

The video wasturned over to the NYPD Hate CrimesTask Force but showed only the entranceto the building, not the interior offices. Sue said the hate crimes unit has inter- viewed him three times, and he has \"thefeeling that it's going to be very difficultto find the person responsible.\" He notedthat the noose will be tested for DNA evi-dence, but unless the perpetrator is in thenational fingerprint and criminal historysystem maintained by the FBI, there is noway of determining who it belongs to. Speaking with Counseling Today roughly one week after the incident took place, Sue said the campus remained inturmoil as false reports and theoriescontinued to pop up in the college'sclassrooms and in the news media aspolice investigated the possibility thatthe culprit is a disgruntled student or fel-low faculty member. According to opencourt records, Constantine filed a de-famation lawsuit against another profes-sor earlier this year. Constantine wasalso asked to provide a list of all her stu-dents to police. When asked about those theories, Sue responded, \" I'm not going to even com-ment on that. There are people's reputa-tions at stake here. There are rumorseverywhere, and it's all speculative.\" Headded that he sees the disturbing inci-dent as a learning opportunity and hopesthe campus community will continue tohold open discussions about issues ofrace and racism. \"On behalf of the American Counsel- ing Association, of which MadonnaConstantine has been a longtime mem-ber, I want to express sadness over thedespicable act directed toward thisaward-winning and well-respected col-league,\" said ACA President Brian S.Canfield in a statement published on theassociation's website and submitted toseveral counseling Listserv communi-ties. \"This was a senseless expression ofhatred, one that causes understandableanger and outrage in many of us. Ironi-cally, this act underscores the criticalimportance of Madonna Constantine'swork and that of other professionalcounselors who seek to improve societyby helping others gain insight into theirfrustrations and the inappropriatebehaviors which sometime result. \"The ACA Code of Ethics, which serves as a guide to ethical behavior andbest practices in counseling, is infusedwith a strong emphasis on multiculturaland diversity considerations for profes- sional counselors and mandates thatcounselors practice with cultural sensi-tivity. It is unfortunate that the troubledperpetrator(s) of this cowardly act are soout of step with the culturally pluralisticand multiethnic nature of modern Amer-ican society. We can only hope that theperpetrator(s) will be swiftly caught andthat the consequences of their actionmay ultimately lead them down a pathto becoming better members of society.The American Counseling Associationfully supports Madonna Constantineand Columbia University as they contin-ue to investigate this incident.\" IHate crime Continued from page 1 Angela Kennedy is a senior writer at Counseling Today .
