Lut Berben, June 2011 Summary 9 Summary One of the greatest challenges health care professionals, organizations and system will be confronted with in the twenty- first century is the dramatic increase in the number of patients suffering from one or more chronic diseases 1, 2. It is expected that by the year 2020, chronic conditions will be responsible for 60% of the global disease burden in developed countries 2, 3. Yet, as the current health care system is largely organized around an acute, episodic model of care, it does not meet the needs of chronically ill patients. Chronically ill patients need a model of care that pays attention to self -management, prevention and continuity of care, which receive limited attention in acute care models 4. As an answer to the need to shift the model of care, Wagner and colleagues developed the Chronic Care Model. This model provides a guide for the health care organizations and systems to improve the care for their chronically ill patient populations 4, 5. The Wor ld Health Organization (WHO) revised the model to provide a global perspective resulting in the Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) framework 2, 6, 7. Evidence in a limited number of chronically ill patient populations (e.g., asthma and diabetes) support the effectiveness of implementation of (parts of) the model in view of improved patient outcomes (e.g., better glycemic control, improved HbA 1, BMI, triclgyerides), reduction in the number of hospitalization, less emergency room visits , a reduction in the number of unscheduled visits to physicians as well as reducing days missed at work or schoo l and a reduction of the total costs 4, 8-10. Suffering from a chronic disease i mplies that patients have to ado pt their health behaviors. One important health behavior for a treatment to be effective is adhering to pres cribed medications. Despite its importance, 25% 11 to 50% 12 are non - adherent to treatment regimen. Non -adherence can be defined as \"deviation from the prescribed medication regimen sufficient to influence adversely the regimen's intended effect\" 13 (pg. 36) . Non -adherence can have serious consequences including poor clinical outcomes, higher (re)hospitalization rates and increased health care costs 12, 14- 24. To reduce the magnitude of non -adherence, it is crucial to know which factors influence patients' medication adherence. The WHO categorizes the risk factors for non-adherence into: 1) patient -related fact ors (e.g., self- efficacy, patient's beliefs Summary 10 about the efficac y of medications, knowledge, perceived barriers to adhere to regimens); 2) social and economic factors (e.g., social networks, family functioning); 3) therapy -related factors (e.g., symptom distress associated with side effects of the regimen, duration of treatment, dose complexity); 4) condition related factors (e.g., self-care disability, complications, an d psychiatric diagnoses, substance abuse); and 5) health care system and health care team r elated factors 25. As behavior is influenced by the system in which the patient lives, it is crucial to investigate the role of system factors in explaining adherence. However, until now, system level factors have received relatively little attention to explain medication non-adherence. This may explain the limited explanation in the variability in adherence 26. A framework which can be used in explaining the influence of s ystem factors on behavior is an ecological model. In an ecological model three levels of influence on patient behavior are identified: 1) the micro level, which encompasses factors related to the interpersonal or face -to-face relationships with health care professionals, as well as social support 2; 2) the meso level, which refers to the practice patterns or the characteristics of the health care organization where the patient is being treated 2; and 3) the macro level, which includes the characteristics of the health care system in which a patient lives 2. This level includes local, state, and national laws and policies r elated to health. These three levels interact with and dynamically influence each other. Taking factors at these three levels into account in explaining patient behavior is essential. To- date, however, system level factors have received limited attention a s potential predictors of patient medication adherence. Furthermore, existing evidence on the influence of these factors on medication adherence has not been compiled. As a consequence, the magnitude of the effect of different system factors on adherence i s not known, a clear gap in the growing adherence literature. This system perspective is also needed when implementing interventions to improve adherence. These interventions can target the patient, the micro level (i.e., the health care provider), the mes o level (i.e., health care organizations' practice patterns) and the macro level (i.e., health care policy) 27. Interventions targeting the patient can be classified as educational/cognitive , counseling/behavioral, or psychological/affective interventions 28. Although most research to -date has focused on interventions targeting the patient, knowledge concerning which interventions Summary 11 are used in clinical practice is scare. An example of an intervention targeting the health care provider which may influence adherence to medication is training health care professionals in the use of patient -centered methods (e.g., motivational interviewing) 27. Interventions targeting the health care organization mainly focus on changing practice patterns. The implementation of chronic care models, which has been shown to result in better patient outco mes, is an example of changing practice patterns 27, 29. However, the extent to which chronic care models are implemented in practice has not been investi gated in certain chronically ill patient populations such as transplantation. One reason for this lack in evidence is the absence of a valid and reliable instrument to assess the level of chronic illness management implemented in the health care organizati on. Interventions focusing on the health care policy are \"higher order interventions affecting health policy, organization and financing of care and quality of care programs\" 27. An example of an intervention focusing on the health care policy is changes in medical insurance coverage for prescription drugs in the US 30. The overall purpose of this dissertation was to explore the role of system factors in chronic illness manage ment, focusing on medication adherence. Five articles present the results of this work. First, a systematic review was conducted of quantitative studies addressing factors at the mico -, meso -, and macro levels of the health care system that are associated with adherence to medication regimens in individuals with HIV and organ transplant recipients (Chapter 3) . A total of 64 studies (seven in the transplant literature and 57 in the HIV literature) examining the association between characteristics at the micr o (i.e., quality of the patient -provider relationship, medication counseling, satisfaction with the health care provider, relationship with health care providers, health care provider disease -specific experience, trust/confidence in the health care provide r, clarity of health care provider instructions about medications, accessibility to the health care providers, perceived pressure from the provider to take medications, and perceptions of non -judgmental attitudes of health care providers), meso ( i.e., cent er effects, frequency of health care visits, access to disease -specific services, access to medications, quality of care, and satisfaction with the health care setting) and/or macro ( i.e., health insurance, drug costs, distance from and access to clinical site, and Summary 12 country/continent) level of the health care system and medication adherence were identified. The two factors that were most consistently related to medication adherence in these patient populations were trust in the health care provider (a micro level factor) and access to medications (a meso level factor). Both factors support the importance of continuity of care in the treatment of chronically il l patient populations. Across the factors examined, however, study findings about their relationships to adherence varied. One explanation for this variability may be the wide variability in the methodological approaches utilized in studies (e.g., definition adherence, measurement adherence, study design and methods of analysis). The second manuscript, a methodological paper, provides an overview of commonly used statistical measures (i.e., effect sizes) for expressing the strength of the relationships between variables such as system factors and adherence behavior (Chapter 4) . More specifically, formulas utilized to directly calculate common effect sizes from summary data reported in studies, as well as examples of methods utilized to indirectly estimate the effect size from summary statistics are presented. Third, a study was conducted to describe the strategies cardiovascular nurses and allied health professionals utilize to assess patients' adherence to their medication regimens and to enhance adherence (i.e., educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, or psychological/affective interventions) (Chap ter 5) . In this study, a 45-item questionnaire designed to assess adherence assessment and interventional strategies utilised in clinical practice was distributed to a convenience sample of attendants of the 10th Annual Spring Meeting of the European Socie ty of Cardiology Council on Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions conference in Geneva (Switzerland) in March 2010. A total of 137 health care professionals were included in the study. Questioning patients about non - adherence during follow -up visit s was the method used most frequently to assess adherence. Providing reading materials was the strategy used most frequently to enhance patient medication adherence, followed by training patients about medication taking during their inpatient recovery. Acr oss the categories, educational/cognitive adherence enhancing interventions were used most frequently, followed by counselling/ behavioural interventions. Psychological/ affective interventions were less frequently used. Summary 13 The fourth study examined adherenc e assessment strategies as well as the interventions health care professionals report using to improve adherence in transplant patients (Chapter 6) . Furthermore this study examined the health care professionals' perceptions about the effectiveness the inte rventions they utilize. Data were collected at the second International Transplant Nurses Society (ITNS) symposium in Germany held on June 18 th - 19th, 2010. Eighty -six participants are included in this study. The most frequently used assessment adherence strategy was questioning patients about non -adherence during follow -up. Training patients to self -administer medications and providing printed adherence information were the most frequent interventions. More specifically, these interventions were used by 79% of the participants. Providing printed medication instructions was the third most frequently used intervention. The intervention perceived as most effective by the health care professionals was medication self -administration training. Comparing the util ization of interventions per category, educational/cognitive interventions were used most frequently, followed by the counseling/behavioral interventions and the psychological/affective interventions. The average effectiveness ratings for the three categor ies of interventions were very similar. The final study (Chapter 7) describes the development, the content validity testing as well as the inter-rater reliability testing of the Chronic Illness Management Implementation - Building Research Initiative Group : Chronic Illness Management and Adherence in Transplantation (CIMI -BRIGHT) instrument . The development of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument was based on the conceptual framework of World Health Organization's Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) framewo rk, as well as the clinical expertise of the members of the research team. Initial psychometric testing, more specifically content validity and inter -rating reliability testing, were conducted. Content validity was evaluated by 7 experts in chronic illness management. These experts rated the relevance of each item in terms of the construct 'chronic illness management' on a 4 -point Likert scale (ranging from 1= not relevant to 4= highly relevant). Content validity indexes were calculated for each item and th e survey as a whole. Of the 51 items, 42 were had good co ntent validity. Two of the nine items with low content validity were deleted the remaining seven were revised based on recommendations from the expert reviewers. To evaluate inter-rater reliability, a pilot study was conducted in two transplant programs. The percentage agreement between the participants for total CIMI -BRIGHT instrument Summary 14 in each center was calculated by averaging the percent agreement on individual items. The percentage agreement in the two centers fo r the total instrument scores was 84.6% and 74.8% respectively. Synthesizing the findings of the studies yields the following three key results which contribute to the current state of knowledge. First, there remains a significant knowledge deficit in view of the influence of health care system factors on medication adherence calling for further research investment. Second, n urses' practice patterns in view of adher ence-related interventions call for a change in curricula . The health care wor kforce needs to be equipped with the required competencies for behavioral management. Moreover, practice development focused on integrating behavioral strategies to improve adherence management is needed. Finally, The CIMI -BRIGHT instrument is the first an d only tool developed to systematically assess the level of chronic illness management in transplant centers and thus provides a building block for further observational and intervention research in transplantation. These findings have several implication s for future research and clinical practice. Firstly, to fully understand the role of system factors in medication adherence a large multi -continental, multi -country, multi -center study should examine the associations between multiple factors at the micro -, meso -, and macro level and non-adherence to medication regimens. Second, education and training in the utilization of counseling/behavior and psychological/affective interventions are important for health care professionals. It needs to be included in ba sic education programs, as well as in ongoing professional education and training. Health care curricula need to be revised to include competencies in adherence enhancing interventions. Finally, future studies should continue to examine the psychometric properties of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument . This instrument has the potential to contribute to our understanding of chronic illness care in transplant centers and to be a useful tool in evaluating the impact of interventions designed to improve chronic illness management in these centers.

Chapter 1: Introduction 17 Chapter 1 Introduction Chapter 1: Introduction 18 Introduction In order to achie ve good treatment outcomes it is essential that chronically ill patient patients take their medication as prescribed. While patients' medication adherence behavior is known to be influenced by a number of factors, those that have been investigated to -date fail to adequately explain the observed variability in adherence. This may be related to the influence of the patients' environment, i.e., the system in which the patient lives, on medication adherence. System factors have only recently been recognized as potentially important predictors of adherence. To date, there is very limited research examining the impact of system factors on adherence. This dissertation focuses on the influence of system level factors on medication adherence. Chronic conditions The dramatic increase in the number of patients suffering from a chronic condition is a major challenge which health care professionals, organizations, and systems face in the twenty -first century 1, 2. Chronic conditions are defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"diseases which have one or more of following characteristics: they are permanent, leave residual disability, are caused by nonreversible pathological alteration, require special training of the patient for rehabilitation, or may be expected to require a long period of supervision, observation or care\" 3 (pg. 4) . According to this definition, chronic conditions cover a broad range of diseases ranging from persistent communicable diseases (e.g., HIV and AIDS) , non -communicable diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and cancer), and mental disorders (e.g., depression) to ongoing impairments in structures (e.g., amputations and joint disorders) 2. Transplant recipients are also a subset of the growing group of chronically ill patients, as they require ongoing management for the rest of their life in order to achieve successful short and long term outcomes after transplantation. The number of chronically ill patients is increasing globally, and overwhelms high as well as low income countries 1, 2. This increase is mostly due to the rapid aging of Chapter 1: Introduction 19 the population and the greater longevity of persons with many chronic conditions 4. Currently, more than half of the global disease burden is caused by chronic conditions 5. It is expected that by the year 2020, chronic conditions will be responsible for 60% of the global disease burden in developed countries 2, 6. Chronically ill patients are the largest consumers of drugs in the society. The mean number of prescribed drugs per year for a person with no chronic conditions is 2.2; for a patient with one chronic condition this is 11. For a patient with three or more chronic conditions the mean rises to 28.3 7. Chronic care model The shifting balance from patients suffering from acute illnesses to those with a chronic condition requires a shift in the organization of hea lth care. Currently, health care is \"organized around an acute, episodic model of care that no longer meets the needs of many patients, especially those with chronic conditions\" 2 (pg. 4). The Chronic Care Model, developed by Wagner and colleagues is an answer to the need to shift the model of care. It provides a guide for health care organizations in the management of chronically ill patients 4, 8. Chronic illness management refers to a model of care that combines the following building blocks: 1) continuity of care; 2) partnerships with patients, families and communities; 3) support for patients in improving their self -management; 4) attention to preventive measures; 5) decision - making support for health care professionals; and 6) availability of clinical information systems 2, 5, 9, 10 . To provide a global perspective, t he WHO adapted Wagner's Chronic Car e Model. The revised model, the Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) framework (see Figure 1) 2, 11, 12 expanded the community and policy aspects of the Chronic Care Model 11. Chapter 1: Introduction 20 Figure 1: Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework 2 This framework is comprised of fundamental components within the patient , family and the health care provider level; the organization and community level; and the policy level 2, 12. These components are described as \"building blocks\", which can be used to help decision makers or those working in the health care system progressively create or redesi gn health care organizations and systems to expand their capacity to manage long -term health problems 2, 12. Improved patient outcomes are observed when the care system shifts from acute to a chronic care model for the management of chronically ill patients. Empirical evidence in asthma and diabetes suggests the effectiveness of implementation of the combination of building blocks in chronic care management 8, 10, 13, 14 . The extent to which chronic care management has been implemented a nd shows efficacy in other chronically ill patient populations such as transplant recipients has not been examined to date. Chapter 1: Introduction 21 Health behaviors Suffering from a chronic condition implies that patients have to adopt new health behaviors or adapt their healt h behaviors and need to engage in a number of activities to promote physical and psychosocial well -being; interact with health care professionals; adhere to treatment regimens; monitor their health status and make associated care decisions; and manage the impact of their chronic condition on physical, psychological and social functioning 1. The actions patients perform for themselves in daily life to manage their illness and treatment and to avoid functional and health deterioration are called \"patient self -management\" 2, 5, 15 . Chronically ill patients have to perform a number of activities in their daily life. After receiving an organ transplant, for instance, patients need to engage in long term health behaviors including medication taking, avoidance of risk factors for cardiov ascular disease and cancer, and self -monitoring for signs of rejection and infection, as well as regular follow -up visits to prevent poor outcomes related to rejection, graft loss, mortality and the progression or development of co -morbidities. Adherence ( also called compliance) to these health behaviors can be defined as \"the extent to which a person's behavior -in terms of taking medications, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with the agreed upon recommendations of a health care provider 3 (pg. 3) . In renal transplantation, patients take on average 8 to 10 medications a day 16 with a range from 4 to 16 17. Lung transplant recipients take a median of 8 (Q1 -Q3: 6 -11) non - immunosuppressive medications a day, while for both liver and heart transplant recipients the median was 3 (Q1 -Q3: 2 -5) 18. Non-adherence to medication regimen Definition medication non- adherence Adherence to prescribed medication regimens is a fundamental prerequisite for a treatment to be effective. In a report of a 2008 Consensus Conference on non - adherence to immunosuppressive medications, Fine and c olleagues 19 reported that although non- adherence has been examined a number of times, the absence of a taxonomy has resulted in much conceptual confusion, mainly because most Chapter 1: Introduction 22 authors try to identify specific cutoffs or percentages to identify medication intake or drug level. These authors ignore the fact that patients' drug taking behavior is a dynamic process that changes over time. They also fail to distinguish between two important components of adherence -related pharmacotherapy: (1) discontinuation or non -persistence which refers to disengagement from the prescribed regi men and (2) the quality of execution both in terms of taking and timing of medication intake while the patient is engaged with his or her therapeutic regimen 19. This group of adherence experts in transplantation proposed a new definition specifically of medication non -adherence. They defined non -adherence as followed: \"devi ation from the prescribed medication regimen sufficient to influence adversely the regimen's intended effect\" 19 (pg. 36) . In this definition the therapeutic outcome - in contrast to specific medication intake or drug level, is emphasized 19. For transplantation, research has shown that this clinical meaningful definition for non-adherence is a deviation of > 5% of the daily schedule 20-22. Prevalence non- adherence A Cochrane review 23 and a meta- analysis 24 highlight the magnitude of non - adherence to prescribed medication regimens in chronically ill patient populations. On average, 25% 24 to 50% 23 of patients do not take their medications as prescribed. In organ transplantation, 20% to 37% of the patients are non -adherent to their immunosuppressive medications 25-28. A meta -analysis in transplantation showed an overall non -adherence rate of 22.6 cases per 100 persons per year 29. Among cardiovascular patients, an average treatment non -adherence rate of 23.4% was reported in a meta -analysis 30. For HIV patients, estimates of non -adherence to antiretroviral therapy ranged from 30% to 40% 31-34. While these numbers are influenced by the variability in case finding and assessment methods and operational definitions, they demonstrate that non -adherence is a major issue in many patient populations. Chapter 1: Introduction 23 Consequences of non -adherence Non-adherence to medication treatment can have serious consequences in chronically ill patient populations, including poor clinical outcomes, higher (re)hospitalization rates, and increased health care costs 23, 31, 35- 44. A meta -analysis found that patients who were adherent were 26% more likely to have a good clinical outcome compared to patients who did not adhere to their overall treatm ent regimen (not only medication adherence) 36. Non -adherence costs the US health care system an estimated $100 billion annually in direct costs. Indirect costs exceed $1.5 billion in lost patient earnings and $50 billion in lost producti vity 45. It can be assumed that the financial situation for Europe is similar. A recent study in renal transplantation examining the economic costs associated with non -adherence to immunosuppressive medication showed that patients who were persistently non - adherent experienced approximately $21,600 higher medical costs in the first three years after transplantation compared to patients with excellent adherence 43. Factors associated with patients' non- adherence To tackle the problem of non -adherence it is crucial to know which factors influences a patient's behavior, i.e., which factors are associated with pa tients' non - adherence to their prescribed medication regimens. Modifiable factors can then be targeted for intervention. The WHO states that adherence is a multidimensional phenomenon, determined by the interplay of five dimensions (see Figure 2): (1) patient-related factors (e.g., self- efficacy, patient's beliefs of efficacy of medications, knowledge, and perceived barriers to adhere to regimens); (2) social and economic factors (e.g., social networks, and family functioning); (3) therapy -related factors (e.g., symptom distress associated with side effects of the regimen, duration of treatment and dose complexity); (4) condition related factors (e.g., self -care disability, complications, and psychiatric diagnoses such as substance abuse); and (5) health car e system and health care team related factors 46. Chapter 1: Introduction 24 Figure 2: Five interacting dimensions affecting adherence 46 Until now, most efforts to understand the remarkably high rates of non -adherence have focused on patient -related, social and economic, treatment -related and condition -related factors 46, 47. A meta -analysis in transplantation, however, showed that these factors only explain a small part of the variability in non -adherence 29. This indicates that factors not immediately associated with the patients, but rather with health care providers, the system of care or the characteristics of the health care system as a whole might explain more variability in non -adherence than patient or treatment related factors. Health systems can be defined as \"all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health\" 48 (pg. 30) . However, the influence of health system level factors on patients' non -adherence to medication regimens has not been examined to the same extent as patient -, socio -economic -, treatment - and condition -related factors 46, 49, 50 , an obvious gap in the literature. Chapter 1: Introduction 25 Theoretical background A number of theoretical approaches have been suggested to describe factors influencing a perso n's behavior (e.g., non -adherence) 51, 52. A common problem in most of these models is that they ignore the influence of contextual or environmental factors on patients' medication taking behavior 52. As patient behavior is also influenced by factors from his or her environment, it is crucial to integrate these factors in order to explain behavior. System thinking and the ecological model To reach successful behavioral change, it is important that the patient is motivated. However Alemi et al. (2000) also emphasis the importance of the system in promoting change 51. The system refers t o an individual's en vironment. The process of accounting for the influence of various people, circumstances and historical choices on the behavior that is to be modified is called system thinking or ecological thinking 53, 54. The concept of ecology originates from public health and psychology 55. In public health, for instance, environmental influences on diseases have been recognized for centuries 55. In education, it is acknowledged that predicting achievements of students requires not only consideration of student -related variables such as intelligence, motivation or self -efficacy, but also variables on the level of the teacher, the school, and the educational system 56, 57. In 1936, Kurt Lewin coine d the term ecological psychology to describe the study of the influence of the outside environment on the person 55. Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979) was the first person who focused specifically on the multiple environmental levels influencing behavior 55, 58. In Bronfenbrenner's model, behavior is viewed as b eing affected by, as well as effecting, multiple levels of environmental factors 47, 58. These different levels can be divided into patient -, the micro-, the meso -, and the macro levels (see Figure 3) 47. Chapter 1: Introduction 26 Figure 3: Framework for the review: the ecological model of McLeroy et al. (adapted) 58 MicroMesoMacro Health Care PolicyPatient Health care provider Health care organization Patient level factors comprise characteristics of the individual, such as knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes. This level also incorporates the developmental history of the individual 58. Micro level factors encompasses factors related to the interpersonal or face -to-face relationships with health care professionals, as well as social support 2. Examples are the quality of communication between the health care professionals and patients and the degree of trust the patient has in the health care professional. Meso level factors refer to the practice patterns or the characteristics of the health car e organization where the patient is being treated 2. Examples of a health care organization characteristic or a practice pattern is the time available for consultation or the interventio ns implemented in daily clinical practice to enhance patients' medication adherence. Macro level factors include the characteristics of the health care system in which a patient lives 2. This level Chapter 1: Introduction 27 includes local, state, and national laws and policies related to health (e.g., insurance coverage and regulations on reimbursement for medication). As depicted in Figure 3, each of these levels interacts with and dynamically influences the oth er levels. Paying attention to all these levels of patients' environment or system in promoting patients' behavior is essential as the system surrounding the patient is the often reason for success or failure in changing behavior 51. Kidd and Altman (2000) emphasize the importance of taking environmental factors into account in understanding a patient's adherence to a medication regimen 47. This need has also been recognized by others. In 1997, an expert panel of the American Heart Association recommend ed a multi -level approach to improve medication adherence 50 and more recently the American Society of Hypertension recommended a more ecological approach to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications 59. In addition, policy reports from the WHO and clinical practice guidelines from the National Collaborating Center for Primary Care and Royal College of G eneral Practitioners (UK) strongly advocate using a systems approach that transcends the patient level when dealing with the issue of poor medication adherence 46, 60. However, as stated before, most studies to date have examined how characteristics of the patient and of the treatment regimen impact adherence. System level factors have not received much attention so far. Furthermore, existing evidence of the influence of these factors on medication adherence has not been compiled. As a consequence, the magnitude of the ef fect of different system factors on adherence is not known, a clear gap in the growing adherence literature. Interventions improving adherence Given the magnitude of non -adherence and its consequences, leading to describing non-adherence with medication a s a major public health treat developing, implementing and testing the efficacy and effectiveness of preventive and restorative adherence interventions is a high priority on both policy, research and clinical agendas. Chapter 1: Introduction 28 A number of interventions can be impl emented to improve patients' adherence. These interventions can target the patient, the micro level (i.e., the health care provider), the meso level (i.e., health care organizations' practice patterns) and the macro level (i.e., health care policy) 3. Interventions targeting the patient can be classified as educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, or psychological/affective interventions 61. Educational/cognitive interventions present information individually or in a group setting, delivering it verbally, in written form, and/or audio -visually. Counseling/behavioral interventions shape and/or reinforce behavior, empowering patients to par ticipate in their own care, while positively changing their skill levels or normal routines. Psychological/affective interventions focus on patients' feelings and emotions or social relationships and social support 61. However, not all interventions are supported by strong evidence. A Cochrane review 23 focusing on the efficacy of adherence enhancing interventions and measuring both adherence and clinical outcomes included 70 trials testing 83 interventions for long -term treatments. This review showed that for long -term treatments, only 36 of the 83 interventions were significantly associated with improvements in medication adherence 23, while only 25 led to improvement in at least one treatment outcome 23. No simple and few complex interventions resulted in improvement in adherence and clinical outcomes 23. Interventions that were effective to impro ve adherence for long-term treatments included combinations of more convenient care, information, reminders, self- monitoring, reinforcement, counseling, family therapy, psychological therapy, crisis intervention, manual telephone follow -up, and supportive care 23. In a meta -analysis investigating the efficacy of interventions to improve medication adherence in older adults, Conn et al. (2009) reported that a n umber of interventions significantly improved medication adherence, but there were large differences in the effect size associate with these interventions 62. In this meta - analysis, the intervention used most often to improve adherence was education. However, despite an significant improvement in knowledge, these interventions did not improve adherence 62. Similarly, in \" Adherence to long -term therap ies - evidence for action \" the WHO states that adherence interventions at the patient level have usually focused on increasing knowledge, i.e., patient education 3. However, evidence shows t hat knowledge alone is not enough to establish and maintain strong adherence behavior 3. The most effective adherence enhancing interventions Chapter 1: Introduction 29 targeting the patient aim to enhance self -regula tion or self -management capabilities 3. Interventions targeting the health care providers (micro level): Although health care professionals have a significant role in promoting patient adhe rence, only few studies on this topic have been reported in the literature 3. A recent meta -analysis focusing on physician communication and patient adherence to treatment showed that patien ts whose physician communicates poorly have a 19% higher risk for non-adherence compared to patients whose physician communicates well 63. The authors emp hasis that interventions focusing on communication training for physicians is essential and effective 63. Training health care professionals in the use of patient -centered methods has been shown to improve patient satisfaction with treatment and may also improve patients' medication adherence 3. Health care professionals trained to use goal -setting, feedback and ongoing education had better patient outcomes 3. Interventions targeting the health care organization (meso level). Interventions targeting the health care organization mainly focus on changing practice patterns. One example of changing practice patterns which has been shown to result in better patient outcomes is the implementation of chronic care models 3, 64. In the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) report, Hofmarcher and colleagues reported that the chronic care model had positive effects for patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and pati ent knowledge related to their condition 65. However, the extent to which chronic care models are implement ed in practice as well as their relationship to medication adherence is not yet investigated in certain chronically ill patient populations such as transplant recipients. One reason for this lack in evidence is the absence of an instrument which has the capacity to assess the level of chronic illness management implemented in the health care organization in a valid and reliable manner. Prior to introducing interventions to change practice patterns, it is essential to assess the current state of practice. To date, there is limited research examining which interventions are used in daily practice to enhance patients' medication adherence. Interventions targeting the health care policy (macro level): Interventions focusing on health care policy are \"higher ord er interventions affecting health policy, organization and financing of care and quality of care programs\" 3. An Chapter 1: Introduction 30 example of an intervention focusing on the health care policy is change in me dical insurance coverage of prescription drugs in the US. Madden and colleagues investigated the impact of Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) on cost - related medication non -adherence 66. A principle goal of the implementation of Medicare Part D was to increase economic access to medications, especially among vulnerable poor and chronically ill populations 66. The authors demonstrated that the implementation of Medicare Part D was associated with a significant decrea se in the prevalence of cost -related medication non -adherence 66. The Obama's health care reform 67, which would indefinitely provide immunosuppressive drug coverage for kidney transplant recipients has the potential to decrease cost -related non - adherence. Immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplant recipients are currently covered for only the first 36 months post -transplant 68. Non-adherence to medication regimens is a prevalent problem among chronically ill patients and is influenced by a number of factors. However, to -date research on adherence has focused primarily on patient -related factors and those factors failed to explain the broad variability in non -adherence rates. As behavior is influenced by the system in which the patient lives, it is crucial to investigate the role of system factors in explaining adherence. A framework which can be used in explaining the influence of system factors on behavior is the ecological model. However, system factors h ave not received much attention in explaining medication adherence, and their influence is unclear. The systematic review which is part of this dissertation summarizes current evidence about the role of individual system factors at the health care provider , health care organization, and policy levels in association with medication non -adherence. Also in view of interventions to improve adherence, a system perspective is needed. Based on this perspective, interventions will target the patient, the health ca re provider, the health care organization and health related policies. Today most research has focused on patient -centered interventions designed to improve adherence. Even within this domain, our understanding of the interventions that health care profess ionals use with their patients is limited. This dissertation examined health care providers' reported patient -centered interventions utilized to improve adherence. Chapter 1: Introduction 31 The Chronic Care Model, developed by Wagner and colleagues and revised by the WHO emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive system focused approach to improving clinical outcomes in persons suffering of chronic disorders. One of the challenges in doing research on implementation of the chronic care model is the lack of a valid and reliable ins trument that can measure the extent to which the model has been implemented in health care organizations or to examine the impact of interventions designed to integrate the model into practice. Another study in this dissertation describes the development a nd initial psychometric testing of an instrument developed to measure health care professionals' perceptions regarding the implementation of the chronic care model in their clinical setting. In summary this dissertation will address gaps in the literature by: Presenting a systematic review of the evidence describing the association between health care system factors and medication adherence in two chronically ill patient populations, people living with HIV and transplant patients (Chapter 3). Providing an overview of commonly used statistical measures for expressing the strength of the relationships between variables such as system factors and adherence behaviour (Chapter 4). Describing the adherence assessment strategies and adherence enhancing interventio ns routinely used by health care providers in caring for cardiovascular patients (Chapter 5). Examining adherence assessment strategies as well as the interventions health care professionals report using to improve adherence in transplant patients, as well as their perceptions about the effectiveness the interventions (Chapter 6). Describing the development of an instrument designed to assess the level of chronic care implemented in transplant centers as well as its content validity and inter -rater reliab ility (Chapter 7).

Chapter 3: Systematic review 39 Chapter 3 System factors as c orrelates o f medication a dherence in HIV and transplant populations : a systematic review Lut Berben Sandra Engbe rg Susan M Sereika Fabienne Dobbels Martha Hill Sabina De Geest Submitted to: Journal of Behavioral Medicine Chapter 3: Systematic review 40 Abstract Purpose: Medication adherence is influenced not only by characteristics of the individual patient, but also by the micro -, meso -, and macro levels of the health care system. However, most research focuses on patient level factors, which offer limited explanation for medication adherence's broad variability. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize evidence from quantitative studies examining the relationship b etween micro -, meso -, and macro level health care system factors and medication adherence in organ transplant (Tx) recipients and patients living with HIV - two populations for whom strict medication adherence is essent ial in preventing poor outcomes. Methods and Materials : Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cinahl databases. Quantitative studies published in English between January 1999 and December 2009 were included. To be eligible, studies had to investiga te medication adherence as an outcome, describe the adherence measurement method used, and report the relationship between one or m ore micro -, meso -, and/or macro level factors and medication adherence in post -Tx or HIV -positive adults. Results : Electronic searches returned 5,341 citations. Seven articles in the Tx literature and 57 in the HIV literature met all inclusion criteria. For most of the factors examined, the relationship to medication adherence was not consistent across studies. The micro level f actor most consistently related to adherence was trust in the health care provider. At the meso level, it was drug access/dispensing. Cost-related characteristics (macro level), including medication cost, were significantly associated with adherence 50% of the times they were studied. Conclusions: While the findings of studies examining the relationship between the system level factors and medication adherence are inconsistent, this systematic review provides preliminary evidence to suggest that certain sys tem level factors may contribute to the variability in medication adherence. Due to the limited ability of patient characteristics to explain adherence, it is critical to continue to explore the role of system level factors in explaining medication adheren ce. Chapter 3: Systematic review 41 Introduction Adherence to a prescribed medication regimen is influenced not only by characteristics of the indivi dual patient, but also by system level factors in that person's environment. These determinants can be classified into three levels: micro (i.e., factors related to the health care professional, social support), meso (i.e., factors related to the health care organization or setting in which care is received) and macro (i.e., health care system factors) 1. Under standing medication adherence requires awareness of all three levels 2, 3. To date, however, most adherence research has focused on patient level factors (patient, socio -demographic, condition and treatment related matters) with insufficient consideration of those at other levels. Moreover, we are unaware of any previous systematic reviews examining the relationship between such factors and medication adherence. Therefore, our goal was to conduct a systematic review with the aim to summarize evidence from quantitative studies examining the relationship between micro -, meso -, and macro level health care system factors and medication adherence in organ transplant recipients and patients living with the human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV). Background The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adherence (also called compliance) to long-term therapy as \"the extent to which a person's behavior (i.e., taking medication) corresponds with the agreed recommendations of a healt h care provider\" 4 (pg. 3) . Although adherence is a fundamental prerequisite for a prescribed treatment to be effective, non -adherence to medication regimens in chronically ill patient population s is very common, with prevalence rates ranging from 22% to 57% 5, 6. The consequences can include poorer treatment outcomes (including hastened mortality), higher hospitalization rates and increased health care co sts 7, 8. Despite its negative consequences, medication non -adherence in chronically ill patients remains poorly understood. Until now, most efforts to understand it have focused on characteristics of the individual patient (e.g., self -efficacy, knowledge, Chapter 3: Systematic review 42 intentions), the treatment regimen (e.g., regimen complexity, duration of treatment), socio -economic and demographic related factors (e.g., age, race, marital status), along with condition related factors (e.g., depression, number of co -morbidities) 4, 9. Factors related to health care provider, health care organization, and the health care system as a whole have received far less attention 2, 4, 10. This imbalance is well recognized. To tackle medication adherence issues, WHO policy reports and clinical practice guidelines published by the Royal Co llege of General Practitioners' National Collaborating Center for Primary Care strongly advocate system -oriented approaches beyond the patient level 4, 11. In 1997, an American Heart Association expert panel recommended a multi -level approach to improve adherence 2 and more recently the American Society of Hypertension recommended this approach to improve adherence with antihypertensive medication 12. Importantly, a meta -analysis in transplantation by Dew et al. (2007) suggests that system level factors have an impact on adherence. In that report, the authors observed that North American transplant patients had higher rates of non- adherence than European ones, a difference to which they suggested health care system factors may contribute 13. A seven -country study investigating practice patterns in hemodialysis centers found that center characteristics (e.g., size, percentage of highly trained staff) and the country where the dialys is center was located were related to dialysis non -adherence (i.e., failure to attend dialysis sessions) 14, 15. Schoen et al. (2009) conducted an eleven country survey of primary care doctors, finding wide variati ons at a national level in practice systems, incentives, perceptions of access to care, use of health information technology and programs to improve quality 16. In a survey the following year, Schoen et al. found that the eleven countries surveyed also had differing systems of health care coverage, leading t o significant differences in access to care, cost burdens and problems with health care insurance 17. However, they did not investigate the influence of these system factors on me dication adherence. In the Swiss HIV cohort study, which did focus on medication adherence, patient followed -up centers, a meso level factor, accounted for significant variability in adherence rates 18. A meta - analysis focusing on patient treatment adherence and physician communication Chapter 3: Systematic review 43 across diverse illness populations and settings found that the risk of non -adherence was 19% higher when communication with physicians was poor 19. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and summarize quantitative studies addressing factors at the micro -, meso -, and macro levels of the health care system that are associated with adherence to medication regimens in individuals with HIV and o rgan Tx recipients. These populations were selected because both conditions require complex, lifelong medication treatment. Furthermore, medications are life - saving in both populations. In contrast to other chronically ill populations, even minor deviation s from the prescribed regimen can seriously impact these patients' clinical outcomes. In transplantation, for instance, non -adherence is associated with poor kidney function, acute rejection, and graft loss 20-23. In HIV, even slight deviations of the prescribed anti -retroviral treatment regimen (e.g. < 95%) are associated with poorer virological outcomes including higher viral loads, lower CD4 cell counts and the development of HIV drug resistance 24-28. Conceptual framework for a multi-level approach to a system An approach whereby several levels of a system are considered when explaining a phenomenon (e.g., adherence) is called an ecological perspective 1, 9 (see Figure 1). From an ecological perspective, a patient's activities overlap numerous settings - within self, within family, with friends, at work, during recreational activities, in the health care setting and within society - each of which influences his or her behavior. As depicted in Figure 1, each level of contact interacts with and dynamically influences the others. When the patient -, micro -, meso -, and macro level factors work effectively within and among themselves, th e system is efficient and effective 1. Micro level The micro level encompasses factors related both to interpersonal or face -to-face relationships with health care providers and to social support 29, e.g., the degree of trust the patient has in the health care provider and the overall quality of the patient -provider relationship. For the purpose of t his review, we focused on micro Chapter 3: Systematic review 44 level factors related to p rofessional relationships, and not to personal social support factors, the significance of which was confirmed, regarding treatment adherence, in DiMatteo's 2004 meta -analysis of 122 studies 30. Meso level The meso level encompasses the characteristics of the health care facility where the patient is being treated 29 (e.g., time available for consultation, treatment team skill mix). Macro level The macro level includes the characteristics of the larger health care system and policy that influence how the patient uses the system 29. These include local, state, and nat ional legislation and policies related to health (e.g., insurance coverage and regulations regarding reimbursement for medication). Recognizing and understanding factors related to medication adherence are essential to the development of adherence- enhancin g strategies, the identification of patients at risk of non -adherence and the design of interventions to target modifiable factors. As each style of intervention targeting medication adherence has significant weaknesses, the most effective systems have com bined a number of approaches on the different levels 6, 31. Such combinations are recommended by policy reports and clinical guidelines 4, 11. However, to implement interventions effectively, it is essential to know which health care system factors at each level are associated with adherence to medication regimens and which explain the most variability in medication adherence. Methods We conducted systematic electronic literature searches of the PubMed, EMBASE and Cinahl databas es to identify relevant studies published in English from January 1999 to December 2009. For the PubMed database, for example, our search terms for articles on transplant recipients were: (complian* OR noncomplian* OR non -complian* OR adheren* OR nonadhere n* OR non -adheren* Chapter 3: Systematic review 45 OR concordance OR non -concordance OR concord* OR non -concord*) AND transpl*. For the population: OR noncomplian* non OR non- concordance OR concord* OR non -concord*) AND HIV. Table 1 shows the specific search strategies utilized for each database. These strategies were kept deliberately broad as there is a wide use of terminology in the literature and we wanted to identify as many studies as possible. We included studies that met the following eligibility criteria: 1) quantitative analysis; 2) publication between January 1999 and December 2009; 3) publication in English; 4) adult samples ( 18 years old) who were Tx recipients or had HIV; 5) use of medicat ion adherence as an outcome; 6) description of adherence measurement methods ; and 7) examination and reporting on relationships between micro -, meso -, and/or macro level health care system characteristics and medication adherence. Studies were excluded if 1) they focused on treatment refusal (the medications was never prescribed or initiated); 2) they included institutionalized subjects and did not report findings separately for subjects who were not institutionalized; 3) their participants suffered from ps ychiatric disorders; 4) they examined a group of factors including those at the patient level but did not report findings separately for the micro -, meso -, and/or macro level factors; 5) they used qualitative designs; 6) they described intervention studies examining only the relationships between the determinants and adherence following an intervention; or 7) they focused on social support. If two or more studies involved the same sample, only one study was included in this review. Decisions on which studie s to include were based on the number of system factors examined. We selected those examining the greatest numbers of system factors. The reference lists of retrieved studies were also examined to identify additional relevant studies. Using a review prot ocol, a single researcher (LB) reviewed all titles and abstracts to determine their eligibility. If any uncertainty existed, a second researcher (SE) was consulted. Next, both researchers (LB & SE) read and evaluated the full text of the studies correspond ing to the selected abstracts. To extract data from the articles, we developed a data extraction sheet. The following information was extracted: design, sample characteristics, definition of adherence, factor(s) examined, and results. One author (LB) revi ewed the extracted Chapter 3: Systematic review 46 data from the included studies; a second author checked the extracted data (SE). If disagreement occurred, it was resolved by discussion between the two authors. Quality assessment of studies included in a systematic review is essential to ensure that the original research is systematically appraised and evaluated 32. To assess the quality of studies included in this review, we adapted a criteria -based c hecklist used in prior systematic reviews 33, 34. The result was a list of 15 categorical questions (see Figure 3). Using this checklist, two authors (LB & SE) independently evaluated all included studies. Any disa greements were resolved through discussion. Data analysis Adherence definitions, measurements and reporting methods varied across the studies. Therefore, meta -analysis was not performed. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported or calculated (Tables 3, 4 and 5) as measures of the strength of the relationship (effect size) between the micro -, meso - and macro level factors and adherence in this systematic review. When studies reported an OR and CI for non -adherence, it was conver ted into an OR and CI for adherence. If OR were not reported in the article but sufficient data were available, an OR and a 95% CI were calculated 35. If data were insufficient, we contacted t he authors and asked them to provide data which would allow us to calculate an OR with a 95% CI. In cases where only p -values were available, a Cohen's d was calculated, then converted to an approximate OR using the Effect Size Generator - Professional Edi tion version 4.1 software package (Melbourne, Australia). Chi - square tests of independence were utilized to examine the relationship between study characteristics (patient population, study design, continent on which the study was conducted, method of meas uring adherence, method of analysis and system factors examined) and reporting a significant relationship between a system factor and adherence. Chapter 3: Systematic review 47 Results Study selection The electronic searches of the three databases returned 5,341 citations (see Figu re 2). After eliminating duplicates (HIV n= 515; Tx n= 512), and including additional records identified through other sources, 4,370 citations were screened for eligibility by title and abstract. Of the 4,370 citations, 258 articles were selected for full -text review. Of these, 7 articles in the transplant literature and 58 articles in the HIV literature met all eligibility criteria. One 36 of the 58 HIV studies was, however, excluded because of inconsistencies in the results section and the tables. Our attempts to contact the corresponding author to resolve these inconsistencies were unsuccessful. Study characteristics A summary of the characteristics of the included studies is shown in Table 2. Almost half of the studies (n= 29; 45.3%) were conducted in North America; just over one -fifth (21.9%) took place in Europe. Prospective designs were used in 23.4% of the studies. A cross -sectional or retrospective design was used in 76.6% of the studies. Most studies (76.6%) used patient self -reports (either interviews or self - administered questionnaires) to assess medication adherence. Four studies in the HIV population (7%) and none in the transplant population used multiple methods to assess adherence. Of the studi es using multiple methods, we used the method that detected the highest prevalence of non -adherence. The studies' adherence assessment periods varied widely, ranging from \"ever\" to the previous 2 days. The most prevalent time periods were the previous 4 we eks (20.3%), followed by the previous 3 days (14.1%). Most of the includ ed HIV studies focused on micro level factors, while the transplant studies focused more on macro level factors. Chapter 3: Systematic review 48 Quality assessment None of the studies fulfilled all 15 of the defined quality appraisal criteria. In HIV, the total quality score ranged from 7 (2 studies) to 14 (7 studies) (Mean= 11.65; SD= 1.75). For HIV studies, the quality scores ranged from 6 (one study) to 14 (3 studies) (Mean= 11.86; SD= 3.13). Almost all articles p rovided a definition of adherence (see Figure 3). The quality criteria fulfilled by the fewest studies was \"information about psychometric properties of used instruments\". No studies were excluded on the basis of the quality appraisal. Micro level factors (health care provider related factors) The relationship between micro level factors and adherence was analyzed multivariately 46 times across 31 studies, and 17 times bivariately in 5 studies (see Table 3). The majority of these studies (56.5% of multivari ately and 76.5% of bivariately) reported that the micro level factor examined was not significantly related to adherence. The factor most commonly examined was the patient -health care provider relationship or some aspect of it (e.g., communication, trust, satisfaction or quality) . Of the 56 times where it was examined, 23 (41.1%) showed a significant positive relationship between positive patient -provider relationships and adherence. The specific micro level factor most consistently related to adherence was trust in the health care provider (examined in 8 studies), which was significantly associated with higher adherence in 62.5% of the studies that assessed it. The reported or calculated effect sizes (OR and 95% CI) between micro level factors and adherence are presented in Table 3. Effect sizes were not reported and could not be calculated for 10 of the relationships examined. None of these relationships were statistically significant. Meso level factors The relationship between meso level factors and adh erence was examined multivariately 24 times across 18 studies and bivariately in two (see Table 4). The factors examined were drug access/dispensing related (n= 4 studies multivariately, 2 bivariately), center differences (n= 7 studies multivariately), visit-related Chapter 3: Systematic review 49 characteristics (n= 5 studies multivariately), specialty care/case managements (n= 4 studies multivariately), clinic -related factors (e.g., satisfaction, quality of care, or access) (n= 4 studies multivariately). Drug access or the method of dis pensing the drugs was the only meso level factor consistently related to adherence, with 75% of the studies that examined it multivariately and both of studies that examined it bivariately reporting significant relationships. Treatment center was significa ntly related to adherence in 28.6% of the studies examining it multivariately. In most of the studies, the remaining meso level factors were not significantly related to adherence. In all of the studies with non -significant findings, the meso level factor was not significantly related to adherence bivariately and therefore not examined multivariately. Effect sizes were not reported and could not be calculated for eight of the relationships examined. None of the relationships were statistically significant. Macro level factors The relationship between adherence and a macro level factor was examined multivariately 26 times in 21 studies and bivariately 4 times in 3 studies (see Table 5). The factor examined most frequently was cost related characteristics (e.g., type of health care coverage, cost to patient for medications). In half (50%) of the cases where it was examined multivariately, no significant relationship was found between this factor and adherence; however, it was significantly related to adherence in two of the three studies that tested for that relationship bivariately. The higher the cost for the patient, the lower the adherence rates. Transportation related issues were examined multivariately in 5 studies, none of which found significant relationships to adherence. One study examined the relationship between the continent and/or country where transplant care was delivered and adherence, with multivariate analysis showing a significant relationship for three of their four comparisons (i.e., the U.S. vs. Europe; the Netherlands vs. Belgium; and Switzerland vs. Belgium). Another study only examined the relationship between the country where the transplant occurred and adherence bivariately and reported no significant relationship. In seven (22.6%) of the 31 cases where a macro level factor's relationship to adherence was examined multivariately, the OR and/or 95% CI were not reported and could not be calculated. None of these seven analyses found a significant relationship between the examined macro level factor and adherence . Chapter 3: Systematic review 50 Relationships between study characteristics and significant findings We analyzed for relationships between 5 study characteristics - patient population (HIV/AIDS or transplant), study design (prospective vs. cross -sectional and retrospective), continent on which the study was conducted (North America, Europe or other), method of adherence measurement (self -report or other [e.g., pill count, electronic monitor, blood assay or a combination of methods]), method of analysis (multiva riate or bivariate), and the level of the systems factor examined (micro, meso or macro) - and whether a significant relationship was reported between systems factors and adherence. Although study design approached statistical significance, none of the study characteristics were significantly related to the likelihood of finding a significant relationship. Statistically significant relationships were reported in 43.0% of cross -sectional or retrospective studies compared to 24.0% of prospective studies (p= 0.08). Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of quantitative studies examining the association b etween micro -, meso -, and macro level health care system factors (see Figure 1) and medication adherence in any population. Overall, the relationships between the factors examined and adherence were inconsistent across the studies, with the majority the relations not being statistically significant. In an attempt to explain the inconsistent findings across the studies, we examined the likelihood of significant relations being reported in relation to a number of study characteristics (study design, patient population, method of measuring adherence, method of analysis and the level of system factor examined). Of these, the only characteris tic that approached statistical significance was study design (p= 0.08) with almost twice as many of the relationships examined in cross -sectional or retrospective studies reported as significant than those examined in prospective studies. In this review, however, the proportion of factors examined in prospectively designed studies was relatively small (21.2%). It is possible that other study characteristics not examined in this review (e.g., differences in the definition of adherence or the period over whi ch it was measured) can explain the inter -study variability. The need for a consistent definition of adherence was recognized by the Chapter 3: Systematic review 51 Ascertaining Barriers for Compliance (ABC) project, a multinational group of researchers and clinicians in adherence resear ch. This group is currently working to achieve international consensus on the terminology used to describe adherence and related concepts, with the immediate goal of standardizing the way adherence is defined, measured and reported 37. Major variability also occurred in the definitions and measurements of the various micro -, meso -, and macro level factors examined by the studies included in this systematic review. In this review, the factors most consistently related to adherence were dr ug access (i.e., the better the drug accessibility, the better the adherence rates) and the method of dispensing drugs (e.g., dispensing at the physician's office or off- site). All of the studies examining the relationship between drug accessibility and th e dispensing of drugs were conducted in the HIV population. The only other factor related to adherence in more than half of the studies was trust in the health care provider. The literature contains a number of definitions of trust 38-40; however, according to Hall et al. (2001), most emphasize \" the optimistic acceptance of a vulnerable situation in which the truster believes the trustee will care for the truster's interests\" 39 (pg. 615) . Still, trust in the healt h care provider is only part of the patient -provider relationship. When the association between the overall patient -provider relationship and adherence was examined, it was only significant in 41.1% of cases. Another aspect of the patient -provider relatio nship is communication. Few of the studies in our review specifically examined provider -patient communication. Again, the findings were mixed, with most reporting no significant relation to adherence. In contrast, a recent meta -analysis by Zolnierek & Dima tteo, focusing on physician - patient communication and its association with adherence to treatment regimens for varying medical conditions, concluded that physician communication is significantly positively associated with adherence 19. More specifically, that meta - analysis linked poor physician communication with a 19% higher risk of non - adherence. Pos sible explanations for the inconsistency between our findings and those of Zolnierek and Dimatteo include the small number of studies in our review that specifically examined this factor, as well as the methods used to assess communication quality. Future studies should consider using a combination of methods (e.g., patient report and direct observation) to assess patient -provider Chapter 3: Systematic review 52 communication. Our results suggest that it is not the overall relationship with the health care provider, but rather specific as pects of this relationship (such as trust in the health care provider) that are more important predictors of adherence. Although the continent and country where patients were followed -up was investigated multivariately in only one study, this factor seems to influence non - adherence. This is consistent with the findings of Dew et al. who reported that non- adherence rates were higher in North -American studies than those from Europe and other continents 13. Denhaerynck et al. 41, 42 suggest that the differences in adherenc e found between countries or continents could be based on differences in transcultural factors (e.g., illness beliefs) or differences in health care system characteristics such as health insurance coverage and regulations regarding reimbursement for drugs and medical treatment. In the current systematic review, however, two -thirds of the studies examining cost related factors multivariately found no significant relationship with adherence. In our systematic review, 3 of the 6 studies examining medication -related costs (50%) reported a significant relationship to adherence. Of these, 2 showed that receiving anti -retroviral therapy (ART) at low or no cost increased the likelihood of adherence. The third 43 showed the opposite - i.e., that receiving the medication for free was as sociated with lower adherence. The study's investigators speculated that this finding may have occurred because patients who paid for their medications received more counseling and/or had more advanced disease at the time of treatment initiation than those who received their medication at no cost 43. Consequently, medication cost may have served as a proxy for other system or disease -related factors. In a different patient population, a study of hemodialysis patients in 12 countries reported that medication non -adherence was associated with patients reporting any out -of-pocket costs (R 2= 0.298) and their average out -of- pocket costs (R2= 0.396) 44. Another recent study, examining the insurance related experiences of adults in eleven countries in Europe, North -America, Australia and New Zealand, found significant differences in access, cost burdens, and problems with health insura nce associated with insurance design 17. No other factors examined in more than three studies were consistently related to medication adherence. One of the issues we faced in this systematic review was that most of the factors showing a significant relationship to adherence were examined Chapter 3: Systematic review 53 in a low proportion of studies, which measured those factors in diverse ways. Visit - related factors, for example, were examined as more than 6 mon ths interval between visits in one study, as the number of visits a month in another and as having scheduled appointments in a third study. In addition, a number of factors were only examined in a small number of studies. Such limitations made it difficult to draw confident conclusions about many of the factors' impacts on medication adherence. Strengths, Limitations, and Research Recommendations To the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review comprehensively examine the relationship betwe en health care system factors and medication adherence. This review points out the methodological challenges inherent in comparing findings across studies using difference methods. It identifies the need for additional research to understand the role of he alth care system factors in medication adherence. This systematic review has several limitations. The first is that only articles in English were included. As a result, relevant studies may have been missed. Second, the review of citations to select artic les for review was conducted by only one individual. Despite the careful procedure followed in searching the literature, it is possible that eligible citations were overlooked. A further limitation is that the gray literature (i.e., studies that are unpubl ished or not easily located) was not searched. Another is that some factors were not clearly defined in the studies, e.g., scheduled vs. non -scheduled appointments. Further, we limited this review to two chronically ill patient populations. Because the ma ny methodological differences across the reviewed studies, we strongly recommend conducting a large multi -continental, multi -country, multi - center study to test for associations between factors at the micro -, meso -, and macro level and non -adherence to med ication regimens. Another recommendation for further research and its dissemination is that authors of future studies should report the magnitude of the various system factors' effects on adherence. Chapter 3: Systematic review 54 Conclusion Most reviewed studies on system factors assoc iated with adherence in the HIV and organ transplant populations were conducted in the HIV population, with little research in transplant populations. While the relationships between the examined system level factors and adherence are inconsistent, this sy stematic review provides preliminary evidence that at least two of these factors (trust in the health care provider and method of dispensing medications) are important contributors to adherence. Further, considering the limited variability of patient level explanations of non -adherence, it is critical to further explore system level relationships.

Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 92 Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 93 Chapter 4 Effect s ize calculation: methods and examples Lut Berben Susan M Sereika Sandra Engberg Submitted to: Journal of Behavioral Medicine Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 94 Introduction It is standard practice in nursing research to examine whether a study's result is statistically significant. However, a common mistake in the interpretation of the results, is equating statistically significant results (i.e., a p -value of 0.05 or 0.01) with a clinically meaningful effect. A p -value is the probability of that t he results are due to chance alone, or in other words, the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis 1, 2. It does not, ho wever, provide any information about the practical importance of the findings. Furthermore, p -values are dependent on the sample size. This means that a small effect could be statistically significant if the sample size is very large and, conversely, there can be a large effect in a small sample size without the p -value being significant 1. The advantage of effect size estimates is that they are independent of sample size and measure the extent of a treatment effect or strength of the association between variables. Mays and Melnyk (2009) define effect size as \"a measure of the magnitude of the influence of an independent or predictor variable on a dependent or criteria variable\" 3 (pg. 125). Effect size estimates information on both the magnitude and direction of influence. In addition to providing important information about the impact of a treatment on the outcome of interest, it also provides a common metric to compare the direction and strength of the relationship between variables across studies, which is key to conducting a meta -analysis. Meta -analysis is \"a technique for quantitatively combining and integrating the results of multiple studies on a given topic\" 2 (pg. 723). Meta -analyses are considered the highest level of evidence for clinical practice 2. For meta -analysis it is crucial to define a common effect size metric which is capable of representing the quantitative findings of a set of research studies in a standardized form and permits meaningful numerical comparison and analysis across the studies 4. Although guidelines such as the CONSORT statement, an evidence- based minimum set of recommendations for reporting randomized clinical trials 5, and the American Psychological Association manual 6 recommend reporting effect sizes even when resul ts are not statistically significant, a number of research articles, even more recent ones, do not report effect sizes. The researcher conducting a meta -analysis must then rely on summary and test statistics reported in the article to calculate the effect size. Because the sample in a research study rarely totally represents the characteristics of the target population for the study findings, effect size estimates are only Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 95 estimates of the true effect in the target population. The extent to which the estim ated effect size accurately reflects the effect in the target population will vary. Therefore, when investigators report the effect size for their studies, they should also include a measure of its precision, i.e., a confidence interval 1. The confidence interval is the range of values within which a population parameter is estimated to lie for a given probability 2. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the estimated effect size is 1. While the effect size is not influenced by the sample size, its precision, conveyed through the confidence interval, is. In general, the larger the sample size, the more precise the effect size estimate (as evidenced by a narrower confidence interval) will be. This article will focus on effect size calculation based on data and statistics reported in published studies. We will provide the formulas utilized to directly calculate common effect sizes when researchers report summary data from their studies, as well as examples of methods utilized to indirectly estimate the effect size from summary statistics. Methods to ca lculate effect sizes The method utilized to calculate an effect size will vary with the results reported in the primary study. The effect size can be calculated directly when the published study results include certain basic information such as the mean an d SD, exact correlation coefficient or the number events and non -events in two groups. Unfortunately, many published studies fail to report the summary statistics needed to directly calculate an effect size. While one can (and should) attempt to contact the author(s) to obtain the missing data, such attempts are often unsuccessful. When the basic information needed to directly calculate an effect size is not available, there may be methods available to estimate the effect size from less than optimal statist ical information 7. We will present and i llustrate methods utilized to directly calculate an effect size and its 95% confidence interval based on reported (1) means and standard deviations, (2) correlation coefficients and (3) number of events and non -events in two groups. These summary statistics are utilized to calculate the most common effect size indices used in meta -analysis, the standardized mean difference (e.g., Cohen's d), correlation coefficient (r) and odds Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 96 ratio (OR) 8. We will also present examples of methods utilized to indirectly estimate the effect size from summary statistics. Effect size based on means and standard deviations When studies compare continuous outcomes in two groups and report the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) in both groups, the raw mean or standardized mean difference are the preferred effect sizes 9. If the outcome of the studies was measured using a meaningful scale and all of the studies for which an effect size is being calculated used the same scale, the effect size can be calculated as the raw mean difference between the two groups: Mean difference = M group 1 - Mgroup 2. In reality, however, is rare to have a set of studies that all measure the outcome of interest using the same scale. This is particularly true in behavioural research. More commonly, studies use different methods of measu ring the outcome of interest. When this is the case, the most commonly used effect size calculation is the standardized mean difference which is calculated as the difference between the two group means divided by their pooled standard deviation. This effec t size (ES), the standardized mean difference, is often referred to as Cohen's d or Hedge's g 7. The standardized mean difference is calculated as 10: =12 where =(11)12+(1)12 1+22. Calculation of the confidence interval around the standardized mean differences requires calculation of the variance. The formula used to calculate the variance is 10: =1+2 12+2 2(1+2) . The standard e rror of the standardized mean difference is the square root of its variance: ESsm= effect size: standardized mean difference M1= mean of group 1 M2 = mean of group 2 Spooled = pooled s tandard deviation s21 = squared standard deviation in group 1 s22 = squared 1standard deviation in group 2 Vsm = the variance of the standardized mean difference 2 = the squared effect size n1 = the sample size in group 1 n2 = the sample size in group 2 Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 97 = and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) around the standardized mean differences is calculated as: 95% CI = ES sm \u00b1 (1.96 x SE sm). Example This fictitious study examined the impact of motivational interviewing on medication taking adherence to antihypertensive drugs in patients identified as poor adherers after baseline screening with electronic event monitoring (EM). Those whose adherence rate during the 6 weeks of baseline monitoring was less than 80% were eligible to participate in the intervention phase of the study. These subjects were randomly assigned to a motivation interviewing intervention or to a usual care group. The outcome was the percent chan ge in adherence rates measured by EM at the end of the 8 week intervention compared to baseline. The mean taking adherence rate increased 10.54 (SD=2.11) percent in the intervention group (n=66) and 3.21 (SD=2.00) percent in the usual care control group (n =65; p<0.001). To calculate the effect size, we first need to calculate the pooled standard deviation: =(11)12+(21)22 1+22=(661)2.112+(651)2.002 66+652=545 .39 129=4.23 =2.06 The pooled standard deviation is then is used to calculate the standardized mean difference: =12 =10.543.21 2.06= 7.33 2.06=3.55. Next, we need to 4209+12.60 262=0.03+0.05=0.08 The standard of the standardized mean difference effect size (SE sm) is calculates as the square root of the variance V sm: == 0.08= 0.28 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the standardized mean difference as: 95% =\u00b1 1.96()= 3.55\u00b1(1.96 \u00d70.28)= 3.55\u00b10.55= the effect size and its 95% CI are 3.55 (3.00, 4.10). Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 98 Effect size based on correlation coefficients When stu dies examine the associations between scores on two variables the correlation coefficient itself can serve as an effect size estimate: ES r = r. In order to calculate the 95% CI around the correlation coefficient, its standard error needs to be calculated. Because simply using the correlation coefficient to calculate the standard error is problematic, correlations are generally transformed using Fisher's Zr transformation prior to calculating the effect size and its 95% CI 4, 10. Fisher's Zr is calculated as: =0.5\u00d71+ 1. To calculate the 95% CI, the standard error of Zr () needs to be calculated by first calculating the variance ( ) and then its square root: =1 3 and = . The 95% CI can then be calculated as: 95% =\u00b11.96\u00d7. This is the confidence interval for the transformed effect size. While this will be used for meta - analysis, when reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals in a table or forest plot in a systematic review or meta -analysis you need to report the effect size for the original correlation coefficient (ES r) and its corresponding 95% CI. To do this, you will need to transform the upper and lower bounds of the Z r confidence interval back into the standard correlational form. The formula to transform th e 95% CI back to a ES r 95% CI is: =21 2+1. This transformation needs to be done for both the lower and upper bound of the ES r 95% CI. Example Papelbaum and colleagues (2010) examined the association be tween quality of life and the characteristics of subjects with type 2 diabetes (n=100) and reported that the univariate correlation between duration of diabetes and quality of life (measured by the Problem Areas of Diabetes scale) was r = 0.30 11. First, we need to transform r to Fisher's z ( ): =0.5\u00d71+ 1= .05\u00d71+0.30 10.30=0.5\u00d7ln(1.86)=0.31. variance =1 3=1 1003=0.01 and the standard error: = Fisher transformed effect size for the correlation coefficient (r) ln = the natural logarithm e = the base of the natur al logarithm = the effect size based on Fisher's z Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 99 ==0.01=0.10. Finally, we calculate the 95% CI: 95% =\u00b11.96\u00d7 =0.31\u00b1(1.96\u00d70.10)=0.31\u00b10.20=0.11,0.51. If you are doing meta -analysis, you will use the , but if you are reporting the effect size in the manuscript or table of studies, the r and its 95% CI are easier to interpret than the and its 95% CI. Thus, experts recommend conv erting the upper and lower bound of the CI back to the r metric 4: and its 95% CI are 0.30 (0.11, 0.47). Effect size based on the number of events and non-events in two groups Studies often report dichotomous outcomes in two study groups, e.g., the number and proportion of subjects whose adherence improved in a treatment and control group or the number of patients who were and were readmitted after hospital discharge for heart failure. While there are several effect size indices that can be calculated to describe the direction and magnitude of the relationship between a dichotomous independent and dependent variable (e.g., relative risk, risk ratio, risk difference and odd s ratio), odds ratio is probably the most commonly reported effect size. The odds ratio (OR) is based on a 2 x 2 contingency table such as the one below. Adherent Not Adherent = Treatment A B n1 Control C D n2 The odds ratio is the odds of an outcome (e.g., being adherent) in one group (e.g., the treatment group) relative to its odds in the other group (e.g., the control group). To compensate for the fact th at the odds ratio is centered around 1 (which indicates no relationship) rather than zero, all analyses are preformed on the natural log of the odds ratio (lnOR) 4. First, the lnOR (ES lnOR) and its standard error (SE lnOR) are calculated: Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: =ln () and =1 95% CI: 95% = \u00b11.96\u00d7. While the natural log values will be used during meta -analysis, they should be transformed back in to the odds ratio and its 95% CI when reported in the text or tables of a manuscript or in a forest plot. The following formulas are used to calculate the lower and upper limits of the 95% CI around the OR: =(ln1.96 ) and =(+1.96 ). Example Beeckman et al. (2010) examined the effectiveness of the Pressure Ulcer Classification education tool in increasing nurses' ability to correctly class ify photographs of pressure ulcers and incontinence -associated dermatitis (IAD) 12. Following the educational intervention nurses in the intervention group correctly classified 70.2% of the photographs of IAD compared to 35.8% of photographs that were correctly classified by the control group. IAD Correctly Identified = =1360 \u00d71058 577 \u00d7587=4.23 Yes No Treatment 1360 577 Control 589 1058 After calculating the odds ratio, we need to calculate the natural log of the OR (ESlnOR) and its standard error (SE lnOR): used to calculate the 95% CI for the natural log of the OR. 95% = \u00b11.96\u00d7 =1.44\u00b1(1.96\u00d70.07)=1.44\u00b10.14=1.3, 1.58. Finally, to present t he effect size in a manuscript, we need to transform the lower and upper bound of the 95% CI for the natural log OR to a 95% for the OR: =(ln1.96 )=(1.44(1.96\u00d70.07))=3.67and =Chapter 4: calculation: methods and examples 101 (+1.96 )=(1.44+(1.96\u00d70.07))=4.85. In this example, the odds ratio effect size and its 95% CI are 4.23 (3.67, 4.85). When using OR's as the ES measure in a systematic review or meta -analysis, you need to b e sure that they all reflect the same outcome (e.g., that all reflect the odds of adherence). If you use the OR and 95% CI reported in studies, this may not be the case. For example, some studies report the OR/95% CI for adherence and others for non -adhere nce. To change the direction of a OR for the reported outcome to the desired outcome, e.g. from modeling non -adherence to modeling adherence, you need to compute the inverse of the OR: =1 . The standard error of the lower limit of the natural log odds ratios of the original 95% CI also needs to be calculated. The formula to do this is: =(ln ln []) 1.96. This value is utilized to calculate the 95% CI for the inverse odds ratio: =(ln[Inverse OR](1.96\u00d7SELLln [OR]]))and =(ln[Inverse OR](1.96\u00d7SEULln [OR])). Example examined the ass ociation between patients' perceptions of clinician's knowledge about them ( knowledge of patient) and adherence to HIV medications 13. They reported that the OR and 95% CI for knowledge or patient and non -adherence was 0.97 (0.94, 1.01). In our review, we want to report the effect sizes for adherence so we need to convert this OR and 95% CI for non -adherence to the odds of adherence and its 95% CI. First we need to convert the OR for non -adherence to the OR for adhe rence: =1 =1 0.97= 1.03. Then, we need to calculate the standard error for the log odds ratio based on the lower limit of the original 95% CI: =( ) 1.96=(ln[0.94]ln[0.97]) 1.96=0.016. The is used to 95% for the inverse and =(ln[Inverse in this example, the OR and 95% CI for adherence is 1.03 (0.998, 1.063). Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 102 Indirect methods to calculate the effect size As previously noted, published studies often fail to report the summary statistics needed to directly calculate an effect size. If one is unable to obtain the missing data from the author(s) of the manuscript, there may be methods available to estimate the effect size from less than optimal statistical information 7. Readers are referred to the Lipsey and Wilson (2001) 4 or Rosenthal (1991) 14 books for procedures for calculating effect sizes from a variety of reported statistics. One example of indirectly calculating the effect size when summary statistics (means and stan dard deviations) are not reported is calculating it from a reported t - statistic in a study comparing a continuous outcome in two independent groups (student's t -test). If the author(s) report(s) a t -statistic and the sample size for each of the two groups, a standardize mean effect size (ES sm) can be calculated as4: =1+2 1\u00d72. Example A fictitious study examined the impact of an intervention on perceived barriers to regular exercise. They compared scores on a barrier scale in treatment (n=25) and control subjects (n=26). The test st atistics reported were t=7.2, p<0.001. Using the formula above, we can calculate: =1+2 1\u00d72=7.225+26 25\u00d726=2.017. If only the total sample is reported, Rosenthal 14 suggests that the effect size can be calculated as: = 2. The estimated effect size will be a somewhat less precise than when using the Lipsey and Wilson formula 4. In some studies, the only test statistic reported is a p -value. As long as an exact p - value and sample size are reported, an estimated effect size (ES) can be calculated. Calculation of ES requires p-value to be converted to a Z score (standard normal deviate). This can be done using a table of Z score. There are also websites that will convert p -values to z scores. One example is: http://sampson.byu.edu/courses/z2p2z- calculator.html . If the p is two tailed, convert it to a one -tailed (p divided by 2) before entering it into the program. Once you have the Z score, the following formula can be used to calculate an effect size Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 103 correlation (ES r): = 14. If you want to report standardized mean effect sizes rather than correlation effect sizes, ES r can be converted to a Cohen's d (a standardized mean effect size measure): =2 12. Example If a study only reports that the p -value was 0.043 and the sample size is 150, we can estimate the effect size (ES r). First, we need to find the Z score that corresponds to the reported p -value. If there is no reason to assume that a one tailed test was used (e.g., explicitly stated by the author(s) or the presence of a hypothesis that stated that a one -direction outcome was expected), it is probably best to assume that the study used a two -tailed test and divide the p -value by 2 prior to finding in the corresponding Z score. In our example, we assumed a 2 -tailed test was used and divided out reported p -value (0.043) by two and used a p -value of 0.0215 to find the corresponding Z score of 2.024. Now we can calculate th e effect size for r: = =2.024 150=0.17 and use to compute Cohen's d: =2 12 2\u00d70.17 10.172=0.345. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to find that in addition to not reported the summary statistics need to directly calculate an effect size or the test statistics need to indirectly calculate it, authors do not report an exact p -value which means that you cannot estimate the effect size with any degree of confidence. This is particularly problematic if you wan t to statistically combine the result of studies included in a review (perform meta -analysis) or to graphically display them in a forest plot. Not uncommonly when study findings are negative, the p -value is simply reported as not significant or p >0.05. Ev en when the study findings are positive (i.e., significant), the exact p -value may not be reported. Instead, authors may report p<0.05 or may include a table legend that indicates which p -values are less than pre -determined levels (e.g., *p<0.05, **p<0.001 , ***p<0.0001). The first approach when there is insufficient information to calculate an effect size is to contact the author(s) to request the needed information. Unfortunately, this is not always successful for a variety of reasons. Lipsey and Wilson (2 001) discuss several other approaches to dealing with studies where an effect size cannot be calculated 4. The first is to only include studies where an effect size can be calculate d. This issue with this approach is that studies with negative findings are Chapter 4: Effec t size calculation: methods and examples 104 generally less likely report the data needed to calculate an effect size. If these study findings are ignored, it is likely that the effect in the target population is overestimated. Another approach is to code all effect sizes for studies that reported that their findings were non- significant as zero. If studies report that the findings were significant without an exact p -value or simply report that p0.05, the effect size calculat ion can be based on the assumption that p=0.05. These approaches are, however, conservation and will result in downward bias in the mean effect size across studies and underestimate the population effect size. If the author(s) do not report an exact p -value for significant findings but instead report that p -values are less than several predetermined levels (e.g., p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.001), it will be somewhat less conservative to use p -values that are half between the adjacent p - values when estimating the ef fect size. For example, we would assume (based on this example) that all effects noted to have a p -value less than 0.05 are half way between 0.05 and 0.01 and those noted to have a p- values <0.01 to have a value half way between 0.01 and 0.001. Software to calculate effect sizes Fortunately, there is software available to help with many effect size calculations. There are a number of freeware programs available on the web. One of sites that the authors have used and recommend was developed by David Wilson, co-author of the Lipsey and Wilson book on meta -analysis (2001) 4. This website, The Practical Meta -Analysis Effect Size Calculator (http://gunston.gmu.edu/cebcp/EffectSizeCalculator/index.html ), was recently updated and can be utilized to compute effect sizes and 95% CIs based on a variety of reported statistics. There are also a number of commercial softw are packages that calculate effect sizes such as Effect Size Generator -Pro (Melbourne, Australia) and Comprehensive Meta -Analysis (Biostat, Englewood NJ). Interpreting effect size results While Cohen (1988) suggested rules of thumb for interpreting effect sizes for Cohen's d (small= 0.20, medium= 0.50 and large= (r: Chapter 4: Effec t and examples 105 small= 0.10, medium= 0.30 and large= 0.50) for the social sciences, the interpretation of effect sizes in terms of their magnitude and clinical significance varies with the area of scientific study 15. More specifically, it varies with the how precisely the independent and dependent (or X and Y) variables are measured. In behavior research, there is generally a lot of noise in the measurement of variables, making them less precise than many physiologic measures. Consequently, effect sizes often need to be higher in physiologic than in behavioral research to be considered clinically significant. Conclusions Secondary to limitations of many traditional test statistics and the p -value in providing information about the clinical significance of research findings, most current research guidelines recommend that investigators also report the effe ct size for the interventions or association that they examined. Unfortunately, effect sizes are not included in publications of many research studies. In these situations, clinicians and researchers need to be able to calculate effect sizes and their 95% confidence interval in order to know if statistically significant findings are also clinically meaningful and are a precise representative of the effect in the target population.

A survey of c urrent clinical practice Lut Berben Laura David R Thompson , Sabina De Geest , on behalf of th e UNITE research group European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing, 2011, 10(1), 14 -21 Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 108 Abstract Background: Complex medication regimens are often required to manage cardiovascular diseases. As non -adherence, which can have severe negative outcomes, is common among cardiovascular patients, various interventions to improve adherence should be implemented in daily practice. Aim: To assess which strategies cardiovascular nurses and allied health professionals utilize to (1) assess patients' adherence to me dication regimen, and (2) enhance medication adherence via educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, and psychological/affective interventions. Method: A 45 -item questionnaire to assess adherence assessment and interventional strategies utilised by he alth care professionals in daily clinical practice was distributed to a convenience sample of attendants of the 10th Annual Spring Meeting of the European Society of Cardiology Council on Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions conference in Geneva ( Switzerland) in March 2010. Respondents not in direct clinical practice were excluded. Descriptive statistics were used to describe practice patterns regarding adherence management. Results: Of 276 distributed questionnaires, 171 (62%) were returned, of w hich 34 (20%) were excluded as respondents performed no direct patient care. Questioning patients about non -adherence during follow -up was the most frequently reported assessment strategy (56%). Educational/cognitive adherence enhancing interventions were used most frequently, followed by counselling/behavioural interventions. Psychological/affective interventions were less frequently used. The most frequent intervention used was providing reading materials (66%) followed by training patients regarding medi cation taking during inpatient recovery (48%). Slightly over two -thirds (69%) reported using a combination of interventions to improve patient's adherence. Conclusion : Educational interventions are used most in clinical practice, although evidence shows th ey are less effective than behavioural interventions at enhancing medication adherence. Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 109 Background Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide 1, 2, accounting for approximately 17.1 million deaths in 2004 1. In the UK alone, about 2.6 mill ion people currently suffer from cardiovascular disease 3, while in the US a third of all people aged 18 and more live with one or more car diovascular disease 4. Managing a cardiovascular disease generally necessitates a complex regimen of medications to prevent and/or delay the disease's progression, control symptoms, decrease re - hospitalization and improve survival 5. For a prescribe d treatment to be effective, adherence to the medication regimen is essential. Medication adherence (also called compliance) can be defined as \"the extent to which a patient acts in accordance with the prescribed interval and dose of a dosing regimen\" 6 (pg. 46) . Medication persistence, on the other hand, is \"the duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of therapy\" 6 (pg. 46) . Non- adherence to medication regimens in the cardiovascular patient populat ion is common. A meta -analysis showed an average adherence among cardiovascular patients of 77% (CI: 73.4 -79.8) 7. In a group of 58,744 medication naive patients with a cardiovascular disease , 32% discontinued their medication treatment during the first 30 days of treatment 8. Large variations in adherence rates among studies are observed, partly due to variations in measurement methods and operational definitions. Medication non -adherence can have serious consequences, including poor clinical outcomes, higher (re)hospitalization rates, increased health care costs, and higher mortality 9-16. Non -adherence is as sociated with a significantly elevated risk of recurrent myocardial infarction 9, 10, 12 . Examining the reasons for hospital readmission in heart failure patients, Annema et al. (2009) found that one-third of patie nts described improvement of adherence to their treatment regimens as the most important condition to prevent readmission 17. The reasons for medicat ion non- adherence in patients suffering from chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, are only partially understood 18. However, associated factors have been identified and can be c ategorized in five dimensions: (1) patient -related factors (e.g., self- efficacy, knowledge, intentions), (2) therapy -related factors (e.g., dose frequency, duration of treatment), (3) socio - economic factors (e.g., social isolation, cost of treatment), (4) condition -related Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 110 factors (e.g., depression, number of co -morbidities), and (5) health care team - and system -related factors (e.g., quality of provider communication, trust in the health care worker) 18. Adherence can be measured using different strategies (e.g., self -report, collateral report, pill count, electronic monitoring, pharmacy refill, observation, assay) 19-21. Once an adherence issue is identified, a range of interventions can be implemented to target the patient, health care provider, health care organization or health care system 22. Interventions focusi ng on the patient can be classified as educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, and psychological/affective interventions 23. Educational/cognitive interventions present information individually or in a group setting, delivering it verbally, in written form, and/or audio -visually. Counseling/behavioral interventions shape and/or reinforce behavior, empowering patients to participate in their care, and building skills or routines. Psychological/affective interventions focus on the patient's feelings, emotions, relationships and social support 23. Not all types of interventions are supported by evidence. A Cochrane review 24, focusing on the efficacy of adherence enhancing interventions and measuring both adherence and clinical outcomes , included 70 trials testing 83 interventions for long-term treatments. This review showed that for long -term treatments, only 36 of the 83 interventions showed significant associations with improvements in medication adherence 24, while o nly 25 led to improvement in at least one treatment outcome 24. No simple and few complex interventions resulted in improvement of adherence and clinical outcomes. Conn et al. (20 09), in a meta -analysis investigating the efficacy of interventions to improve medication adherence in older adults, showed that a number of interventions significantly improved medication adherence, but reported large differences in the effect size of dif ferent interventions on medication adherence 25. In this meta -analysis, interventions also significantly improved knowledge and diastolic blood pressure; however, no significant effects were found for systolic blood pressure, other health outcomes or health services utilization 25. In a recent study focusing on physicians of patients wit h chronic myeloid leukemia, it has been shown how widely perceptions of the utility and applicability of adherence enhancing interventions differed among physicians 26. Although the importance of developing interve ntions to enhance patient adherence is recognized, little is known which interventions are implemented in routine cardiovascular care. Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 111 The aim of this study was therefore t o assess the strategies cardiovascular nurses and allied health professionals utili ze to (1) assess patients' adherence to their medication regimens, and (2) enhance their medication adherence (educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, or psychological/affective techniques ). Methods Design, setting and sample This study used survey methodology. All attendees of the 10th Annual Spring Meeting of the European Society of Cardiology Council on Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions (CCNAP) in Geneva (Switzerland) on March 12th & 13th, 2010, were invited to participate in this stud y. To be included in this study, participants had to have direct patient contact. This study was supported by the UNITE budget and by Eli Lilly. Variables and measurement A structured questionnaire in English assessed the following set of variables: Demo graphic information: Demographic information was collected from all participants (Table 1). Adherence Assessment and Intervention Strategies: The questionnaire presented 29 items to survey adherence assessment and interventions. Participants were asked to indicate on a 5 -point Likert -type scale, ranging from never (1) to all the time (5), the frequency with which they utilized each of three strategies to assess medication adherence: (1) questioning patients about medication adherence during follow -up visits; (2) screening patients for risk factors for medication non -adherence during follow -up; and (3) using an electronic monitoring device to assess adherence/risk factors. Furthermore, participants were given a list of educational/cognitive (6 items), couns eling/behavioral (11 items), and psychological/affective (9 items) interventions and asked to indicate on a 5 -point Likert -type scale ranging from never (1) to all the time (5) the frequency with which they used each to increase patients' medication adhere nce. Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 112 The questionnaire was developed for this study. The interventions and assessment strategies in the list were derived from interventions found in the literature 18, 24, 27- 29. The draft questionnaire was discu ssed and adapted a number of times in the research group before being finalized. To evaluate the understandability and feasibility of this scale, it was piloted on 13 health care professionals working with patients post organ transplantation in the US and the UK. As findings showed highly skewed answer patterns for most items, responses to the Likert -scale questions were collapse d prior to analysis, into never= 0 ('never'), seldom = 1 ('occasionally' a nd 'sometimes'), and frequently = 2 ('frequently' and 'all the time'). Data collection All delegates attending the 2010 Spring Meeting of the European Society of CCNAP were informed about the study at the time of registration and given a copy of the questionnaire. The study was also introduced at the opening ses sion of the conference. Attendees were asked to put their completed questionnaires into the designated collection boxes. Questionnaires could be submitted during both conference days. The distribution process guaranteed that only one questionnaire was dist ributed per attendee. Research associates were available throughout the conference to provide information and support to the attendees on filling out their questionnaires as well as to motivate them to participate in the survey. Data analysis Data were an alyzed using descriptive statistics: frequencies, percentages and, where appropriate, measures of central tendencies and variability. We calculated the mean proportion of interventions in each of the three categories (education/cognitive, cognitive/behavio ural and psychological/affective) that participants reported using frequently or all of the time. Participants who reported that they frequently or always used one or more intervention from at least two of the categories were classified as frequently utili zing a combination of methods to enhance medication adherence. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Il). Data were analyzed at the item level. Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 113 Human subject considerations All conference attendees were informed twice r egarding the aim of the study: once when the questionnaires were distributed at registration, and once during a short oral presentation at the beginning of the conference. Informed consent of the participants was implied by the completion of the questionna ire. No identifying data were collected from the participants assuring anonymity of the data. Results Demographic information Of the 276 distributed questionnaires, 171 (62%) were completed and returned . Thirty -four respondents (20%) provided no direct p atient care and were therefore excluded from further data analysis. The demographic characteristics of the final sample (Table 1), show that the majority of participants were women (83%) with a mean age of 41 years. Most (85%) worked with adult patients , and more than half (56%) worked in inpatient departments. Just over one -quarter (27%) reported receiving formal training in health behaviour modification. Strategies to assess adherence Figure 1 shows the findings regarding use of the different adherence a ssessment strategies. Questioning patients about non -adherence during follow -up was the strategy most often reported, used frequently by 56% of the participants. Next came screening for risk factors for non -adherence during follow up, which was used freque ntly by 40% of the respondents. Using an electronic monitoring device to assess non -adherence was rare : 86% never used this method. Interventions to enhance adherence Educational interventions were used most often, followed by behavioral and least often, affective interventions (Figure 2). More specifically, participants reported using a higher proportion of educational/cognitive interventions (mean= 36%, SD= Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 114 24) than counseling/behavioral interventions (mean= 23%, SD= 25). Examining the data at the intervention level, we found that providing reading materials about cardiovascular care was the most used adherence -enhancing intervention , with 66% of respondents using it frequently (Table 2). Almost half of the p articipants (48%) reported that they frequently trained patients about how to properly take their medications at home during their inpatient recovery. Nearly half of the clinicians (47%) frequently offered individual patient/family instructions about medic ation adherence. Using electronic monitoring devices for feedback was the least commonly reported method of improving adherence. Establishing support groups or peer mentor programs to reinforce adherence were never used in daily practice by 66% and 62% of participants, respectively. The other intervention used infrequently was computer assisted educational programs: with nearly 60% never using this technology. Furthermore, we examined the proportion of the sample reporting frequent use of a combination of methods. Ninety -five participants (69%) reported that they frequently combined at least two interventions from the educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral and/or psychological/affective categories to enhance adherence in daily cardiovascular care. Discussion The high prevalence of non -adherence in the cardiovascular patient population and its links to poor clinical outcomes, high (re)hospitalization rates, increased health care costs and higher mortality 9-15 demand the implementation of adherence enhancing interventions in daily clinical practice. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the types of medication assessment strategies and adherence enhancing interventions used by cardiovascular nurs es and allied health professionals in daily clinical practice. Assessment strategies The most frequently used medication adherence assessment method in our sample was questioning patients about medication adherence during follow -up visits. This Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 115 self-report method is a simple, inexpensive and feasible method to assess adherence in daily care, but is prone to recall and socially desirable response bias 19, 20. However, no gold standard exists for assessing patients' adherence 19 and all methods have their strengths and weaknesses 19-21. Osterberg & Blaschke state that a combination of different adherence measures is the best approach to maximize accuracy 19. Educational/cognitive interventions Although evidence shows that educational interventions do not effectively enhance medication adherence 25, educational approaches were used most often in this study. A recent meta -analysis showed that despite evidence showing variable associations between know ledge and adherence, many interventions in older adults are educational 25. In our sample the most frequently utilized method was providing reading materials about cardiovascular care. Interesting to note is that the previously mentioned meta -analysis did not find significant differences in adhere nce improvement following interventions using written information about medication or disease with those that did not. The effect of this intervention on knowledge, however, was significant 25. Furthermore, larger adherence effect sizes could be found in participants taking 3 -5 medications 25. In order for educational interventions to be effective, the information materials should incorporate simple text and pictograms 30. Patient education is likely to have more impact on adherence when it is consistent over time, presented by health care providers and tailored to patient characteristics including cognitive, educational, developmental and intellectual capabilities 22. Moreover, the WHO report 'Adherence t o long -term therapies - evidence for action' states that, while adherence interventions at the patient level have usually focused on increasing knowledge by providing education, knowledge alone is not enough to establish and maintain good adherence behavio r 18. Counseling/behavioral interventions The method used least frequently in practice was employing electronic monitoring devices as a feedback system. Electronic monitoring devices are pil l bottles or Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 116 blister packets that continuously record the date and time of each opening, which presumably corresponds with medication intake 22. Data can be uploaded to a computer and printouts of the device's data show the user's medication dynamics, which the patient and health care team can discuss to jointly establish adherence goals. In cases of improved adherence, patients received positive feedback, inducing master y experiences 31. Although electronic monitoring can offer a powerful tool to enhance patients' adherence , it is not often offered in daily practice. This could be because electronic monitoring devices are rather expensive, may be too complicated for some patients to use and may be too time -consuming for the health care provider. Although computer based information packages for patients have been shown to have a positive effect on self -efficacy and on behavioral outcomes 32, assisted learning programs were not frequently used in our sample. Cardiovascular health care professionals may be reluctant to use computer assisted programs due to t he typically older age of their patient population. T o benefit from such programs, the patient requires access to a computer and, for some programs, internet access, as well as the skills necessary to use computer hardware and software effectively. These r equirements may be barriers to utilization of this type of intervention in older patient populations. It has been shown, however, that older patients with chronic diseases can be trained to use a computer and computer programs effectively 33, 34. Psychological/affective interventions Neither support groups nor peer mentor programs were used by most of the participants in this study, although a recent systematic review reported mixed outcomes from the use of non -professional volunteers 35. In the literature examining non-adherence, one study in three r eports a significant effect from these interventions 35. Regarding patients' experiences of peer support, a qualitative study in kidney patients found that they greatly valued peer support and that it helped them to adapt to their chronic illness by normalizing adherence to their demanding treatment regimens 36. Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 117 Limitations of this study This study has several limitations, the foremost of which is that the questionnaire focuses only on adherence enhancing interventions at the patient level. Interventions at the micro level ( strategies focusing on patient -provider interactions), the meso level (characteristics of the treatment center or hospital), and the macro level (interventions focusing on the health care system or on the society in which a patient lives) are also crucial to improving adherence 37. A further limitation is the limited generalizability of the findings as conference attendees may not accurately represent the population of cardiovascular clinical practice nurses and allied profess ionals. Compared to surveys conducted in previous years (with response rates of 33% 38 and 48% respectively 39), this conference's survey had a high response rate of 62%. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the non-responders so it is not possible to see if they had a different socio- demographic profile or if there were more or less nurses/allied professionals not directly working in clinical practice among the non -responders. Recommendations Health care professionals working with cardiovascular patients are strongly advised to implement adherence enhancing interventions in their daily practice. Moreover, they are advised to implement multi -dimensional interventions combining educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, and psychological/affective interventions. To enable health care workers to deliver interventions that optimize adherence, they need to receive training in health behavior modification strategies. Further research should address which interventions at the micro -, meso -, and macro level are most effective to enhance patien ts' adherence to their medication regimens. Future studies are also needed to examine health care workers' perceptions of the effectiveness of the adherence enhancing interventions they utilize. Chapter 5: Adherence interventions used by cardiovascular p rofessionals 118 Conclusion A variety of interventions are used in daily ca rdiovascular care to improve medication adherence. The most frequently used interventions in this sample were educational/cognitive interventions, although evidence shows these are less effective than behavioural interventions at enhancing medication adher ence. For clinicians committed to positively influencing medication adherence, it would be more effective to focus on combining interventions, especially implementing alternatives to educational interventions.

A survey of c urrent clinical practice Lut Berben Fabienne Dobbels Christiane Kugler Cynthia L Russell Sabina De Geest Submitted to : Progress in Transplantation Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 130 Abstract Context: Although medication non -adherence is associated with severe complications including graft rejection and loss, its prevalence remains high among organ tran splantation (Tx) recipients. Still, little information exists on clinical use of interventions to improve medication adherence (MA). Objective: To identify Tx health care professionals' MA assessment methods, classify the used interventions, and measure th ose interventions' perceived effectiveness. Design, Setting & Participants: A 46- item questionnaire on adherence assessment and interventions was distributed at the 2010 International Transplant Nurses Society symposium in Germany. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of 141 distributed questionnaires, 94 (67%) were returned. Respondents with no direct patient contact (9%, n= 8) were excluded. The most frequently used assessment strategy was patient self -reporting (61%, n= 52). On aver age, participants reported using 47% of the educational/cognitive and 42% of the counseling/behavioral interventions listed. Training patients to self -administer medications and providing printed adherence information were the most frequent interventions ( 79% each, n= 68), followed by providing printed medication instructions (69%, n= 59). Most respondents (90%, n= 77) reported combining interventions. The intervention perceived as most effective was medication self - administration training. Conclusion: Although available alternatives are demonstrably more effective for MA enhancement, this sample relied significantly more on educational interventions. Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 131 Background For solid organ recipients, maintaining graft health following transplantation (Tx) demands li felong medication intake. Successful outcomes are linked closely to medication adherence (also called \"compliance\"), which the World Health Organization (WHO) defines as \"the extent to which a person's behavior (e.g. taking medications) corresponds with th e agreed recommendations of a health care provider \" 1 (pg. 3) . Conversely, the effect of post -Tx non -adherence on short - and long -term outcomes - and associated health care costs - can be ca tastrophic: 15% to 60% of late acute rejections and 5% to 36% of graft losses are associated with non -adherence 2-6. In a meta -analysis of renal transplantation data, Butler et al. showed that the odds of graft fai lure were seven times higher in non -adherent patients than in their adherent counterparts 5. Even faced with such risks, a substantial proportion of solid organ recipients fail to take their medication as prescribed 2-4, 7-9. A 2005 meta -analysis found that, among adult transplant (Tx) recipients, the magnitude of non-adherence to immunosuppressants was 22.6 cases per 100 patients per year across transplant groups 7. A first step in tackling the major problem of non -adherence is measuring adherence during follow -up. This can be done using different strategies (e.g., self -reports, collateral reports, pill counts, electronic monitoring), each of which has its strengths and weaknesses 10-12. The most accurate adherence data are gathered using a combination of measures 10 e.g., triangulation of electronic monitoring, self - reports and pill counts. Once a patient's adherence rate is known, if necessary, interventions aiming to improve adherence can be implemented. These intervent ions can be classified as educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, or psychological/affective 13. Educational/cognitive interventions present information individually or in a group setting, delivering it verbally, in written form, and/or audio -visually. Counseling/behavioral interventions shape and/or reinforce behavior, empowering patients to participate in their own care, while positively changing their skill levels or normal routines. Psychological/a ffective interventions focus on patients' feelings and emotions or social relationships and social support 13. A systematic review examining medication adherence interventions after transplantation showed a serious shortage of intervention research in transplantation 13. We recently Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 132 conducted a study assessing which strategies cardiovascular health care professionals use to assess patients' medication adheren ce and which interventions they apply to enhance medication adherence. In the sample surveyed, participants reported using a range of interventions to improve medication adherence 14. Russell (2005) examined perception of 59 transplant health care providers regarding medication non -adherence 15. Yet, both studies did not assess the health care professionals ' perceptions of their chosen interventions' effectiveness. In another study, focusing on physicians of patients wi th chronic myeloid leukemia, Noens et al. showed how widely physicians' perceptions differed regarding the utility and applicability of adherence enhancing interventions 16. This wide variation highlights the princ iple that, although medication adherence enhancing interventions are clearly necessary, little is known either of which ones health care professionals actually use for Tx recipients' routine care or of how they perceive the results. This study therefore h as three aims: (1) to identify which strategies Tx health care professionals utilize to assess their patients' medication adherence; (2) to classify the medication adherence enhancing interventions used (i.e., educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, or psychological/affective); and (3) to assess how these professionals perceive their chosen interventions' effectiveness. Methods Design, sample & setting This study used survey methodology, replicating earlier research on health care professionals work ing with cardiovascular patients 17. All participants attending the 2nd European International Transplant Nurses Society (ITNS) symposium in Berlin (Germany) (June 18th - 19th, 2010) were invited to participate. To be included, participants had to perform direct patient care. No other inclusion - or exclusion criteria were applied. Variables and measurement The questionnaire was originally developed for our earlier study in cardiovascular health care professionals 17 and adapted for transplantation. The listed interventions and assessment strategies were drawn from those described in the literature 18-22. The draft questionnaire was disc ussed and adapted a number of Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 133 times in the research group before being finalized. To evaluate the understandability and feasibility of using the scale, we pilot -tested it with 13 Tx health care professionals who did not participate at the conference . The structured questionnaire was available in two languages: English and German. Following Brislin's guidelines 23, it was first translated from German to English, then back -translated and compared to the original. After a number of items on participants' demographic characteristics, the remaining sets queried the participants on their medication adherence assessment st rategies, the interventions they utilized to improve patients' medication adherence, and their perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the interventions they reported using. Demographic information included : age in years; gender; highest level of educa tion; current position (staff nurse, advanced practice nurse, Tx coordinator, head nurse/nurse manager, or other); the patient population they worked with; work setting (pre -Tx program, post -Tx program, or both); total years of clinical practice; years of clinical experience in Tx care; years worked in the current Tx program and percentage of working time spent in their Tx program; formal training in health behavior modification (yes/no); country (location) of the Tx center; what kind of transplants were pe rformed in the Tx program; type of hospital where the Tx program was located; and whether there was an Advanced Practice Nurse working in the Tx program. Adherence Assessment and Intervention Strategies: On a 5 -point Likert scale, ranging from never to al l the time, participants were asked to indicate the frequency with which they utilized three strategies to counter non -adherence (questioning patients about non -adherence during follow -up; screening for non -adherence risk factors during follow -up; and usin g electronic monitoring devices to assess non - adherence). Furthermore, given a list of educational/cognitive (6 items), counseling/behavioral (11 items), and psychological/affective (9 items) interventions, participants were asked to indicate on a similar scale the frequency with which they used each to increase patients' medication adherence. The intervention and assessment strategy lists were comprised of interventions found in the literature 18-22. For any interv ention they reported using (occasionally, sometimes, frequently or all the time) participants were asked to indicate on a three -point scale (not at all, somewhat or extremely) how effective they considered that intervention. Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 134 Data collection All attendees of the 2nd European ITNS symposium were given the study questionnaire at the time of registration and informed about the study by two research assistants. The study was also introduced at the opening session of the conference. Attendees were asked to depo sit their completed questionnaires into any of the designated collection boxes. Questionnaires could be submitted during both conference days. The distribution process guaranteed that only one questionnaire was distributed per attendee. Research associates were available throughout the conference to provide information and support in filling out the questionnaire as well as to motivate attendees to participate in the survey. Data analysis Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics: frequencies, percen tages and, where appropriate, measures of central tendencies and variability were calculated. For each of the three intervention categories (education/cognitive, cognitive/behavioral and psychological/affective), we calculated the mean proportion of interv entions that participants reported using frequently or always. Participants who reported frequently or always using one or more intervention from at least two of the categories were classified as frequently utilizing combinations of methods to enhance med ication adherence. Prior to analysis, because of the highly skewed answer patterns for most items measuring medication adherence assessment strategies and adherence enhancing interventions, the Likert scale response data were a ssigned numerical values: nev er= 0 ('never'), seldom = 1 ('occasionally' a nd 'sometimes'), and frequently = 2 ('frequently' and 'all the time'). To analyze the perceived effectiveness of interventions, we ranked them by category, from the highest to the lowest proportion of respondents rating them extremely effective. Perceived effectiveness was only rated if the health care professional personally used the intervention to enhance medication adherence. We calculated descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and median) to describe the average ratings of effectiveness for each category of interventions. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Il). Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 135 Human subject considerations The questionnaire was reviewed and approved by ITNS. Informed consent of the participants was implied by completion of the questionnaire. Participants were free to decide whether they anted to complete the questionnaire or not. Data were collected anonymously (i.e., no identifying data were collected from the participants). Resul ts Demographic information Of the 141 questionnaires distributed, 94 (67%) were completed and returned. Eight respondents (9%) indicated not being involved in direct patient care and were therefore excluded from further data analysis. Table 1 shows the dem ographic characteristics of the final sample (N= 86). The majority (86%) of participants were female, with a mean age of 41 years (SD: 8.52). Most (76%) worked with adult patients; more than half (51%) were working in inpatient Tx departments. Strategies to assess medication adherence The assessment strategies used are shown in Figure 1. Questioning patients about non-adherence during follow -up was frequently used by the majority of the sample (61%). Screening for non- adherence risk factors was performed frequently by 43% of participants. Other methods participants reported using were monitoring blood levels (two participants (2.3%) reported using this strategy frequently), and using medication diaries (reported by one participant). Interventions to enhance medication adherence Figure 2 shows the percentage of participants who reported frequently using each intervention. On average, participants reported frequently using 47% of the educational/cognitive interventions, 44% of the counseling/behavioral inter ventions and 42% of the psychological/affective interventions listed. Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 136 The frequencies at which participants used interventions to promote medication adherence are shown in figures 3 -5. The two interventions used most frequently were providing reading mater ials (educational/cognitive intervention) and training patients during inpatient recovery how to take medications (counseling/behavioral intervention). Seventy -nine percent of the sample reported using both interventions frequently. The next most commonly used intervention, used frequently by 69% of the participants, was providing printed medication instructions. Almost two -thirds of the sample (63%) reported teaching patients to use cueing to increase medication adherence. The intervention employed least frequently was using reports from electronic monitoring devices to provide adherence feedback. Most participants (75%) reported never using such devices. Fifty -seven percent indicated never using counseling by a pharmacist to improve adherence. More than h alf (54%) never used computer assisted educational programs. We also examined the proportion of the sample that reported frequently using a combination of methods. Of this group, 77 (90%) reported frequently combining at least two adherence enhancing inte rventions from the educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral and/or psychological/affective categories in daily Tx patient care. Perceived effectiveness of used medication adherence assessment strategies and MA enhancing interventions The intervention perceived as most effective in increasing adherence to the prescribed medication treatment was training patients during inpatient recovery how to take medications (Figure 6). Of the 73 participants who rated its effectiveness, 57 (78%) considered it extre mely effective. The second most effective intervention was providing medication organizer dispensers. Thirty- eight of the 60 participants (63%) using this intervention considered it extreme effective. Sixty percent of participants reported that establishin g a partnership with patients and significant other(s) was extremely effective in promoting adherence. Comparing the effectiveness ratings per category, the average effectiveness ratings for the three categories of interventions were very similar used by transplant professionals 137 Discussion As non -adherence after organ transplantation has a high prevalence 2-4, 8, 9 and is associated with poor clinical outcomes and increased health care costs 2-6, 24, 25 , it is imperative that Tx health care professionals implement medication ad herence promoting interventions in daily practice. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the types and frequencies of Tx health care professionals ' medication adherence assessment strategies and adherence to the medication regimen enhancing i nterventions. Assessment strategies Our sample's most frequently used adherence assessment method was questioning patients about their adherence during follow -up visits. As this strategy is simple, inexpensive and feasible for daily care, this result supp orts our earlier findings in cardiovascular health care professionals 14 and the findings by Russell in a small sample of transplant health care providers 15. However, this assessment method is particularly prone to re call and socially desirable response bias 10, 11. As no gold standard exists for assessing patients' medication adherence 10, i.e., all methods have significant weaknesses 10-12, Osterberg and Blaschke promote a combination of adherence measures as the most reliable and accurate approach 10. An example of an optimal combination is the triangulation of self -repor t, assay and physician or nurse report. Educational/cognitive interventions The most frequently used method to promote medication adherence in this study was providing reading material on transplant care; providing printed medication instructions was ranked third. Overall, educational approaches to i mprove medication adherence were applied more than any other intervention type, despite compelling evidence that educational interventions have particularly limited effectiveness - a result consistent with our previous research in cardiovascular health car e professionals 14. These findings are consistent with findings of Hathaway and colleagues 26 who also found that health care providers reported that they would used primarily educational interventions to improve adherence. That Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 138 study, however, did not focus specifically on medication adherence but also included adherence to other aspects of the treatment regimen (e.g., diet, exercise and non- smoking). The WHO report 'Adherence to long -term therapies - evidence for action' conclud es that, while adherence interventions at the patient level have usually focused on increasing knowledge, i.e., patient education, knowledge alone is not enough to establish and maintain strong adherence behavior 22. A recent meta -analysis showed that, although providing written medication or disease education improves knowledge , it is much less effective at translating that knowledge into more desirable behavior, i.e., improved adherence 27. However, Mansoor and Dowse (2006) had earli er argued that the specific design of the printed material influenced its value, i.e., that in order for printed material to be effective at improving adherence, it should employ simple text and pictograms 28. Earlier still, Turnbull (2003), posited that producing good patient information required a team effort between professionals and patients 29. Although computer based information p ackages for patients have been shown to have positive effects on self -efficacy and behavioral outcomes 30, computer assisted learning programs were not frequently used in our sample. This result is not surprisingly, as only very limited computer assisted patient education programs are currently available in transplantati on. A study evaluating the validity and usability of one computer -based training and assessment program developed for transplant recipients revealed that the program deviated significantly from current medical practice regarding content and language 31. Furthermore, h ealth care professionals may be reluctant to use such programs due to the increasing average age of their patient population in follow -up. Such programs require that the patient have both access to a co mputer (sometimes with internet access) and the skills necessary for effective computer hardware and software use - prerequisites that might deter many older patients from using this type of intervention. Responding to such concerns, Marziali (2009) showed that older patients with chronic diseases can be trained to use computers and software packages effectively 32. The implementation of computer assisted learning programs in clinical practice could also save valuable health care professionals' time, as patient/users can receive considerable amounts of information from a program rather than a highly -trained professional, and can later address specific questions and concerns to their health care providers. Once issues such as these have been addressed, and well -designed, accurate computer -Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 139 assisted patient education packages become available, the savings they offer will make them difficult to ignore. Counseling/behavioral interventions The method least frequently used in practice was using reports from electronic monitoring devices as a feedback system. Electronic monitoring devices are pill bottles or blister packets that automatically record the date and time of each manipulation of the system that presumably corresponds with medication intake 33. Data can be uploaded to a computer and printed out to show the user's medication dynamics, which can be discussed with the patient and used to establish adherence goals. In cases of improved adherence, patients receive positive feedback, inducing mastery experiences 34. Yet, while this is a powerful intervention to enhance patient's medication adherence 34, it is not often offered in daily practice, possibly because electronic monitoring devices are rather expensive, may be complicated for some patients and may be time consuming for the health care provider to administer. However, in a study among older kidney transplant recipients, most participants gave positive responses regarding their experiences with the electronic monitoring device 35. Another intervention our sam ple used infrequently to enhance adherence was medical counseling by a clinical pharmacist. This low usage rate of medical counseling by clinical pharmacists as an adherence -enhancing method may result from the general rarity of clinical pharmacists in European hospitals. Unlike a traditional pharmacist, a clinical pharmacist works directly with health care providers and patients, providing a broad range of specialized services 36. A literature review evaluating the effects of interventions by clinical pharmacists on processes and outcomes of care in hospitalized adults showed that medication adherence, knowledge and appropriateness improved in 7 of the 11 studies reviewed 36. Furthermore, the involvement of clinical pharmacists in Tx cases has been associated with decreased mortality, lower complication rates, lower hospita l charges and reductions in preventable adverse drug events 37. In our sample, a large majority of participants (90%) frequently combined two or more interventions from the educational/cognitive -, counseling/behavioral - and/or psychological/affective categories to enhance adherence in the daily care of Tx patients. This is much highe r than in our cardiovascular health care professional Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 140 study, where 69% used multi -dimensional interventions 14. Evidence clearly indicates that the most effective method of enh ancing medication adherence was the use of multi -dimensional interventions, i.e., combining educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, and psychological/affective interventions 18-21, 38 . A Cochrane review of 70 trials, testing 83 interventions aiming to improve long -term adherence, showed that fewer than half (n= 36) of the interventions were significantly associated with improvements in medication adherence, while only 25 could be linked causally to improvement in at least one treatment outcome 20. No simple and few complex interventions resulted in improvement of medication adherence and clinical outcomes 20. The inter ventions most effective for long -term care included combinations of more convenient care, information, reminders, self - monitoring, reinforcement, counseling, family therapy, psychological therapy, crisis intervention, manual telephone follow -ups, and suppo rtive care 20. In a recent meta - analysis of studies regarding older adults, Conn et al. (2009) showed that a number of interventions significantly improved medication adherence; however, they also reported large differences in the effect sizes of different interventions 27. Perceived effectiveness of interventions Of the medication adherence enhancing interventions listed on our questionnaire, training patients during inpatient recovery on medication self -administration was perceived as the most effective: 78% of participants who used it rated it as extremely effective. This method was also used most frequently. The other most frequently used intervention, providing reading materials, was perceived as extremely effective by fewer than half of the participants (45%) who used it in daily practice. As mentioned above, evidence shows that written medication and disease information has limited effect on adherence improvement 27. Interestingly, while this intervention was used most often, it was not perceived as effective at medication adherence improvement. At the bottom of the usage scale, the intervention least frequently employed in practice - using reports from electron ic monitoring devices as a feedback system - was ranked second most often as extremely effective. As stated above, this is clearly an effective system of improving patients' adherence 34. Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 141 Limitations of this study This study has several limitations, beginning with our questionnaire's focusing only on medication adherence en hancing interventions at the patient level. Interventions at the micro level (e.g., focusing on the patient -provider interaction or on the patient's social support system), the meso level (i.e., the treatment center or hospital), and the macro level (i.e., the patient's health care system or society) are also crucial in improving adherence 39. A further limitation of this study is the limited generalizability of its findings, as the participants were conference attendees and m ay not have accurately represented the majority of health care professionals working in transplant clinical practice. Although we provided the questionnaire in two languages, language barriers may still have existed for participants fully fluent in neither . However, one notable strength of this study is its 67% response rate, which is high compared to many research studies conducted at conferences 40, 41. Recommendations Health care professionals working with transplant recipients are strongly recommended to implement evidence- supported medication adherence enhancing interventions in their daily practice. Moreover, they are advised to implement multi - dimensional interventions, i.e., to combine educational/cognitive , counseling/behavioral, and psychological/affective interventions. Further, enabling health care professionals to deliver effective interventions that optimize adherence will require training in health behavior modification strategies. Further research should also assess which interventions are utilized at the health care provider -, health care organization -, and health care system level to enhance transplant patients' medication adherence 33. Conclusion Tx health care professionals apply a variety of interventions to improve Tx recipients' medication adherence. Although evidence shows that educational/cognitive interventions are less effective than behavioral intervent ions, they were used most frequently by members of this sample. For clinicians Chapter 6: Adherence interventions used by transplant professionals 142 committed to enhancing medication adherence, it would be advisable to focus more on implementing alternatives to educational interventions.

Aim: The aim of this study is to describe the development of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument and to assess initial content validity and inter -rater reliability. Method s: To evaluate content validity, the relevance of each 'chronic illness management' construct item (N= 51) was rated on a 4 -point Likert scale ranging from 1= not relevant to 4= highly relevant by 7 experts (3 from USA, 4 from Europe) in chronic illness ma nagement. Content validity indexes were calculated for each item and the instrument as a whole. To evaluate inter -rater reliability, we conducted a pilot study in one abdominal and one renal transplant program. Participant agreement by center for the total CIMI- BRIGHT instrument was compared by averaging the percent agreement on individual items. Results: Of the 51 items, 42 had a good content validity. Two of the nine items with low content validity were deleted and the remaining seven were revised. The percentage agreement in the two transplant programs for the total instrument was 84.6% and 74.8% respectively, indicating good inter -rater reliability. Conclusion: The results of this initial validation of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument are promising, suggesti ng its value as a measure of the extent to which the chronic illness model is being implemented in transplant programs. Further validation is needed to fully evaluate the validity and reliability of this instrument. Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 157 Background Over the past decades, patient as well as graft survival rates improved for solid organ transplant (Tx) recipients. This is mainly due to improvements in immunosuppressive management. One year patient survival rates for heart transplant patients, for instance, increased from 86.1% in 1998 to 89.2% in 2007, for renal transplant patients (deceased donor), this increase was from 94.9% in 1998 to 96.5% in 2007, and for heart lung transplant patients it even increased more from 7.2% in 1998 to 90.3% in 2007 1. However, survival gains are limited to the first 6 to 12 months after transplantation, with long -term survival rates remaining large ly unchanged 2-5. Improving long -term outcomes is considered a priority in transplantation 3, 4. Receiving an organ transplant implies that recipients have to adopt a numb er of long-term health behaviors, including medication taking, self -monitoring for signs of rejection and infection, as well as regular follow -up visits to their physician. Based on these requirements, transplantation does not cure patients, and hence tran splant recipients should be perceived as chronically ill patients. To-date, however, health care for Tx recipients has most common been organized around an acute, episodic model of care. In a care system designed to address acute health problems the purpos e is to diagnose and to treat a patient's presenting complaint 6. There is generally no need to follow the patient over time. Yet, this model of care does not meet the needs of Tx pat ients who are chronically ill 6-8. Providing optimal care for the chronically ill implies a shift in the organization of care from an acute focus to a system where the principles of chronic care are integrated, namely continuity of care; partnership with patients, families and communities; support for patients in improving their self-management; attention to preventive measures; decision -making supp ort; and the availability of clinical information systems 6, 7, 9- 11. Studies in asthma and diabetes, for instance have reported improved patient outcomes when care systems to manage chronically ill patients shift from an acute to a chronic care model 11-14. Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 158 The World Health Organization's (WHO) Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) framework (see Figure 1) presents a framework for health care systems to improve car e for the chronically ill 6, 15, 16 . This framework can help decision makers or those who are workin g in the health care system to progressively create or redesign health care organizations and system to expand its capacity to manage long -term health problems 6, 16. The framework is based on a set of guiding principles acting at three levels 7. The micro level emphasizes the partnership between patients and families, and the health care pro fessionals. The meso level refers to the health care organization and the community. The macro level refers to policy and financial contexts 6, 7, 16. Within the health care organization or meso level, there are f ive essential building blocks that health care organizations need to focus on to improve the care of chronically ill patients (see Figure 1). First, they need to promote continuity and coordination , which refers to the need of chronically ill patients for services that are coordinated across levels of care (i.e., primary, secondary, and tertiary care) and across providers 6. Second, they need to encourage quality care through leadership and incentives; senior and other influential leaders need to lend clear support and sponsorship for improving the care of chronic conditions in their health care organization. Third, they need to organize and equip health care teams by providing them with the skills and knowledge (e.g. , effective communication ab ilities) to manage chronic conditions 6. Forth, they need to support self -management and prevention ; health care professionals need to be informed about self -management strategies an d know how to educate patients and families about self -management 6. Finally, the last building block, the use of information systems, means that health care organizations must provid e timely information about individual patients and populations of patients. Information systems are needed to gather and organize data about epidemiology, treatment and health care outcomes. The goal is to use information systems to improve planning and th e general standard of care 6. Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 159 Center effects, which can be defined as \"differences in outcome among centers that cannot be explained by identifiable differences in patients treated or specific treatments applied\" 17 (pg. 417), are presumed to result from differences in the ways health care is delivered. A number of studi es demonstrated that variations in the practice patterns influence patient outcomes. A study in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the United States identified the following center factors to be associated with decreased 100 -day mortality: the presence of physicians answering after hours calls and higher patient -per- physician ratio 18. The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), a prospective, observational study among hemodialysis centers in seven different countries sh owed that center characteristics such as the size of the center and the percentage of highly trained staff and the country where the dialysis center was located were related to dialysis non -adherence rates 19, 20. These center -specific differences regarding outcomes indicate that processes at the level of the health care organization are influential and should be further examined. Assessment of level of chronic illness management The level of chronic illness manage ment implemented in a health care organizations can be assessed either from the patient perspective 21 or from the perspective of the health care provider 22. The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) questionnaire was developed by the MacColl Institute for Health care Innovation to assess the implementation of the CCM from t he patient perspective 21. To assess the level of chronic illness care through health care provider information, Bonomi et al. 22 developed the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) questionnaire. There were, however, poor correlations between ACIC scores and chronic disease experts' ratings of team performance (r= 0.28 to 0.52) 22. Furthermore, the ACIC questionnaire was not specifically developed for transplant populations, identifying a clear gap i n the literature on how to assess the level of chronic illness care from the meso level perspective. Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 160 The aims of this study therefore were: 1) to describe the development of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument 2) to assess the content validity of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument 3) to assess the inter -rater reliability of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument Methods 1) Development of CIMI-BRIGHT The development of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument was based on the previously described conceptual framework of ICCC, as well as on clinical experti se of the members of the research team. Based on this framework, we generated items to capture each building block of the health care organisation. To test the completeness of the instrument , the clarity of the items and the clarity of the answer scoring, a focus group interview with a group of 7 international nurses who work in transplantation was conducted. The feedback received during this interview was integrated in the instrument . After content validity testing (see content validity testing) the instru ment was adopted (i.e., items deleted and items revised) resulting in the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument which was used for the pilot study (see inter -rater reliability testing). 2) Content validity testing The framework used to validate this instrument was the St andards for Educational and Psychological testing proposed by the American Educational Research association, American psychological Association and the National Council on Measurement in Education 23. The AERA defines validity as \" the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores implied by the proposed uses of a test \" 23 (pg. 9) . In this study, we tested the content validity of our instrument empirically, in order to provide evidence on content area of the measurement 23, 24. Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 161 Sample and setting: An interdisciplinary group of international ( Europe and US) experts in chronic illness management were selected by the research team. We defined an expert in chronic illness management as a person who was recognized in the chronic illness scholarly world as evidenced by at least two publications or p resentations on chronic illness management. Two authors (LB & SE) searched on the World Wide Web for experts, a third author (SDG) approved the choices. The expert group was composed of nurses, physicians and health policy professionals. Measurement: For each individual item, the content experts were asked to rate the relevance of the item on a 4 -point Likert scale (1= not relevant, 2= somewhat relevant, 3= quite relevant, and 4= highly relevant) in relation to the construct 'chronic illness management' 25 on the Content Validity Form Data collection: The identified chronic illness management experts were contacted by mail and asked to participate in this study. The CIMI -BRIGHT instrument and the Content Validity Form were mailed to those agreeing to participate. During a scheduled phone call, the background, aims and methodology were briefly described by the first author (LB), as we ll as information on the purpose and use of the Content Validity Form. Participating experts were asked to return the completed Content Validity Form by either electronic mail or regular mail. If the Content Validity Form was not returned within one month, the participants received a reminder mail to return the Content Validity Form. If they did not respond to the reminder, they were considered non -responders. Data were collected in Autumn 2009. Data analysis: To evaluate the content validity of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument, content validity indexes (CVI) were calculated. CVI's were calculated for each item (content validity for item, I -CVI) and the instrument as a whole (content validity index for scales, S -CVI). The I -CVI was computed as the number of exper ts giving a rating of either 3 (quite relevant) or 4 (highly relevant) divided by the total number of experts 25. To evaluate the content validity on the scale level, we averaged the item -level CVI's. More specifically, the I -CVI's were summed and divided by the number of items 25. An instrument is considered to Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 162 have excellent content validity if it is composed of items with a I -CVI of .78 or higher and the S -CVI is .90 or higher 25. 3) Inter-rater reliability testing To be able to calculate inter -rater reliability of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument, we conducted a pilot -study in two Tx programs. Reliability is defined as \"the consistency of measurements when the testing procedure is repeated on a popu lation of individuals or groups\" 23 (pg 25). Reliability can be generated in terms of stability, equivalence or internal consistency 24. For the purpose of this study we tested reliability as equivalence, more specifically inter -rater (or inter - observer) reliability, which represents the agreement among raters. Sample and setting: The pilot study of the CIMI -BRIGHT study was conducted in one abdominal and one renal Tx program in the US. Health care professionals were eligible to part icipate if they were working in the Tx program for longer than six months, were employed 50% or more in clinical practice and had knowledge about the content of care provided in the outpatient Tx program. Student nurses, nursing assistants, and float pool nurses were excluded from the sample. The instrument was also completed by the medical Tx director of each center. All health care professionals who met the inclusion criteria were invited to complete the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument. Data collection: The abdomi nal and kidney Tx programs were identified and contacted by a member of the research team. A contact person at each Tx program was identified. Data collection for the pilot study was conducted in the Tx programs between March and December 2010. Health care professionals were surveyed voluntarily and anonymously. The CIMI -BRIGHT instrument was distributed by the contact person at the respective Tx program and were collected in a secured box located at each of the participating Tx programs. The contact person of each Tx program mailed the completed instruments to the principal investigator. Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 163 Ethical considerations: Approval was obtained from each Tx program's ethical committee prior to data collection. Informed consent of health care professionals was implied by the completion and return of the CIMI -BRIGHT instruments. Data analysis: The percent agreement between the different health care professionals in each Tx program was calculated for the total CIMI -BRIGHT instrument assessing the 5 building blocks of the ICCC framework. Due the small sample size and few participant selecting some of the response options, they were collapsed into 1) strongly disagree & disagree; 2) agree and strongly agree; 3) don't know, not applicable or missing. Percentage agreement for the instrument of > 60% was interpreted as indicating substantial inter -rater reliability, 80% or more as almost perfect agreement 26. Results 1) Development of CIMI-BRIGHT Examples of items included in the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument are shown in Table 1. The first version of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument consisted of 51 items covering the five ICCC building blocks f or the health care organization level: 1) promote continuity and coordination (14 items), 2) encourage quality through leadership and incentives (6 items), 3) organize and equip health care teams (7 items), 4) support self -management and prevention (19 ite ms), and 5) use of information systems (5 items). After integrating the results of the content validity testing, the instrument was composed of 49 items, namely 14 items for promoting continuity and coordination, 5 items assessing encouragement of quality through leadership and incentives, 6 that assessed organization and equipping health care teams, 19 that measured supporting self -management and prevention, and 5 that inquired about the use of information systems. Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 164 2) Content validity testing Demographic i nformation Eleven experts in chronic illness management (six from USA and five from Europe) were indentified and asked to participate in the content validity evaluation of the CIMI -BRIGHT. Seven agreed to participate (three from USA and four from Europe), a response rate of 64%. One of the seven experts only rated part of instrument. Content Validity Index The experts evaluated the 51 items of the first version of the CIMI -BRIGHT. Forty -two items were rated having good content validity with content validity indexes ranging from 0.83 (22 items) to 1.00 (15 items). Nine items had low content validity. Two of these were deleted (i.e., \"we have a highly organized quality improvement process, whereby we focus on a small number of important problems or conditions over sufficient time to ensure improvements are implemented and sustained\" and \"innovations (e.g., virtual teams linked through information or communication technology) are used by the transplant team\"), the remaining seven items were revised based on sugg estions from the experts. The Scale Content Validity Index (S -CVI) was 0.83. With the deletion on the two items, the S- CVI was 0.86. 2) Inter-rater reliability Demographic information The characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 2. In total six health care professionals of the abdominal and five of the renal Tx program completed the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument. All participants in both groups were women. The percentage of work spent in transplant care in the abdominal Tx program ranged from 50% to 100%, in the renal Tx program all participants were working 100%. Most participants worked in the outpatient transplant unit. The median years working in the particular transplant program was 3 years (IQR: Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 165 0.9 - 6.5), for the abdominal Tx program this was 7 years (IQR: 5.5 - 12.5). In the renal Tx program, following transplantation all patients followed by the Tx program until the time of death. In the abdominal Tx program, liver and intestine Tx patients are followed by the Tx program until the time of de ath. Not all renal Tx patients in this abdominal Tx program are followed by the program, some of them were followed by their referring nephrologist after their transplant. Percentage agreement The percentage agreement over all participants included in the abdominal Tx program was 84.5%. Excluding the dietician from the calculation, the percentage agreement improved to 86.9%. For the renal Tx program, the overall percentage agreement was 74.8%. Discussion As practice patterns (i.e., the presence of physic ians answering after hours calls and higher patient -per-physician ratio 18) are observed, processes at the level of the health care organization should be further examined. We, for the first time, developed an instrument assessing the extent to which chronic illness management is implemented in the follow -up care of transplant patients. By developing the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument, we will be able to assess differences in practice patterns related to implementation of chronic illness management among transplant programs. In this study we conducted the initial validity and reliability testing of the instrument. This instrument shows preliminary evidence of adequate content validity. While the item CVI was good for 42 of the original 51 items, two i tems with low I -CVI scores were excluded from the instrument based on recommendations from the expert reviewers. The scale CVI (S -CVI) was 0.86 with the two items removed. The I -CVI for seven additional items varied from 0.50 (one item) to 0.67 (six Chapter 7: CIMI-BRIGHT I nstrument 166 items) . Comment from the reviewers suggested that these items were too vague. We revised these items to clarify their meaning. We measured inter -rater reliability within each of the two Tx programs where we pilot tested the instrument. In one of the Tx programs , the percentage agreement between the health care providers indicated near perfect agreement on the extent to which the chronic illness models, as measured by the CIMI - BRIGHT instrument, was being implemented in their Tx program. In the second Tx program, while the percent agreement was somewhat lower, there was still satisfactory agreement. A limitation of this study is that the pilot -testing was only conducted in US Tx program, excluding European Tx programs. This early testing of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument suggests that it has promise as a measure for the extent to which the chronic illness model is being implemented in transplant centers. Additional testing is, however, needed to fully evaluate the validity of the instrument and to confirm that its int er-rater reliability is acceptable in other transplant programs. If additional testing supports the validity and reliability of the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument it could be a valuable instrument in not only assessing the current level of chronic illness manageme nt, but in also evaluating the impact of interventions designed to improve the organization of care for chronically ill patients.

One health behavior which is a crucial prerequisite for a t reatment to be effective is patients' adherence to their medication regimen. Yet, the prevalence of medication non -adherence among chronically ill patients is high and associate with poor clinical and economic outcomes 2-4. Non -adherence to a medication regimen can be defined as \"the deviation from the prescribed medication regimen sufficient to influence adversely the regimen's intended effect\" 5 (pg. 36). Current research has focused mainly on patient and treatment related factors to explain non -adherence. Yet, patient behavior is also influenced by factors from the patients' environment, i.e., system level factors. However, to -date there is only very limited research examining the impact of system factors on the health behaviors such as medication taking in chronically ill patients. This lack of focus on the broader system in which patients live as a possible explanation for non -adherence rates may explain why currently only a small part of the variability in non -adherence can be explained 6. Until now, health care system factors have received relatively little attenti on as an explanation for patient behavior. This is in contrast to other disciplines, such as education where it has long been acknowledged that predicting achievements of students requires not only consideration of student -related variables such as intelli gence, motivation or self -efficacy, but also variables on the level of the teacher, the school, and the educational system 7,8. Health care system factors may impact patient behavior, e.g., adherence to their medication regimens, in much the same way as educational system variables affect student achievement. Today, most health care systems are mainly b uild around an acute model of care. However, this model of care does not meet the needs of patients suffering of a chronic disease 1,9-12. There are substantial differences between acute and Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 175 chronic diseases 13. Acute diseases are episodic, and if the patient responds to treatment, his/her health returns to normal. There is gen erally no need to follow the patient over time. In contrast, chronic diseases are persistent, and there is generally no cure. Chronic conditions are associated with ongoing treatment and require behavioral changes to prevent worsening of the disease 13. It is of extreme importance that care models are adapted to fit the special needs of patients suffering of one or more chronic conditions. This implies that there needs to a shift in the organization where care ta kes place 14-16 from an acute care focus with limited attention for aspects of self -management, prevention and continuity of care to a system where the principles of chronic illness management are integrated 1,10,14,17,18. These principles of chronic illness management are continuity of care; partnership with patients, families and communities; support for patients in improving their self- management; attention to preventive measures; decision -making support; and the availability of clinical information systems 1,10,14,17,18. Moreover, in providing high quality and eff ective care for the chronically ill, health care providers need to have the competencies to work in these new system of care and to support patients in their self management such as correct medication taking 19. From this it can be inferred th at the health care system in which the patient lives and receives care for their chronic condition(s) is of upmost importance to achieve favorable outcomes. This dissertation took an innovative perspective as it explored the role of system factors in chro nic illness management with a special focus on medication adherence in the chronically ill. An ecological model (McLeroy et al.) 20,21 and the World Health Organization's Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework 11,12,14 served as the theoretical frameworks for the studies performed. The patient populations addr essed in this dissertation were organ transplant recipients, persons living with HIV and patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases, all chronically ill patient populations were non -adherence to medication regimen is associated with poor clinical outc omes, higher (re -) hospitalizations rates and increased health care costs 2,22-30. Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 176 The findings of these stud ies strengthen the knowledge base on medication adherence as (1) they highlight the state of science about system factors related to adherence to medication regimens; (2) they provide insight into current practice patterns of health care professionals rela tive to the assessment and support of medication adherence; and (3) they present findings related to the development and preliminary psychometric testing of an instrument to assess the level of adherence -related chronic illness management implemented in transplant centers. These three contributions provide a solid basis to the further understanding of the role system related factors and adherence to medication regimens play and provide impetus for furthering the research in this field. The manuscripts that are part of this dissertation are following: 1) A systematic review of quantitative studies addressing factors at the micro - , meso -, and macro levels of the health care system that are associated with adherence to medication regimens in individuals with HIV and organ transplant recipients (Chapter 3). 2) A methodological paper describing the most commonly effect size measures and how they are calculated (Chapter 4). 3) A study describing the strategies cardiovascular nurses and allied health professionals utilize t o assess patients' adherence to their medication regimens, and the strategies they use to enhance adherence (i.e., educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, or psychological/affective techniques ) (Chapter 5). 4) A study describing the strategies transplan t health care professionals utilize to assess and promote medication adherence, as well as t heir perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the adherence prompting strategies they utilize (Chapter 6). 5) A study describing the development as well as the content validity and inter-rater reliability testing of the Chronic Illness Management Implementation - Building Research Initiative Group: Chronic Illness Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 177 Management and Adherence in Transplantation (CIMI -BRIGHT) instrument (Chapter 7). We discuss the findings of this dissertation below taking a perspective that goes beyond the discussion of the individual manuscripts (Chapters 3 to 7). Implications for further research and suggestions for clinical practice will also be presented. Synthesis and discussion of key findings This discussion will focus on following key messages: 1) There remains a significant knowledge deficit in view of the influence of health care system factors on medication adherence calling for further research investment. 2) Nurses' practice patte rns in view of adherence -related interventions call for a change in curricula. The health care workforce needs to be equipped with the required competencies for behavioral management. Moreover, practice development focused on integrating behavioral strateg ies to improve adherence management is needed. 3) The CIMI -BRIGHT instrument is the first and only tool developed to systematically assess the level of chronic illness management in transplant centers and thus provides a building block for further observational and intervention research in transplantation. 1) There remains a significant knowledge deficit in view of the influence of health care system factors on medication adherence calling for further research investment. We performed the first systematic rev iew that examined the relationship between multiple factors at the micro -, meso -, and macro levels of the health care system and adherence to medication regimens in individuals living with HIV and organ transplant recipients (Chapter 3). This systematic re view Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 178 included published studies examining the association between characteristics at the micro - (i.e., quality of the patient -provider relationship, medication counseling, satisfaction with the health care provider, relationship with health care providers, health care providers' disease -specific experience, trust/confidence in the health care provider, clarity of health care providers' instructions about medications, accessibility to the health care providers, perceived pressure from the provider to take me dications, and perceptions of non-judgmental attitudes of health care providers), meso- (i.e., center effects, frequency of health care visits, access to disease- specific services, access to medications, quality of care, and satisfaction with the health ca re setting) and macro (i.e., health insurance, drug costs, distance from and access to clinical site, and country/continent) levels of the health care system and medication adherence. Overall, the relationships between the factors examined and adherence va ried across studies, making it difficult to reach firm conclusions in view of which system factors explained most of the variability observed in medication adherence. The two factors that were most consistently related to medication adherence were trust in the health care provider (a micro level factor) and access to medications (a meso level factor). Trust in the health care provider can be defined as \"the optimistic acceptance of a vulnerable situation in which the truster believes the trustee will care for the truster's interests\" 31 (pg. 615). While trust/confidence in the health care provider was one of the system factors m ost consistently related to medication adherence, the relationship was only statistically significant in 62.5% of the eight studies that examined it. Methodological differences in study settings, sample characteristics, definitions and assessment of adherence and the methods used to measure trust in the health care provider may have contributed to these inconsistencies 32. An increasing number of studies have examined trust in health care providers 33. One of the factors contributing to this increased interest for trust in health care providers is the perceived threat that managed care systems might impose to the doctor -patient relationship 33. In previous studies, trust in the health care provider was related to a number of clinic ally important outcomes including 34,35 lower blood glucose levels 36-41, earlier detection of the cancer 42, fewer post operative complications 43, Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 179 symptom imp rovement 44, better mental health related quality of life 45-47, higher acceptance of medications 47,48, higher satisfaction with the physician 47,48, higher general satisfaction with ca re 47,48 in addition to higher adherence to physicians' advice and recommendations 34,35. Of the studies included in this review, only those focusing on adherence to HIV medications examined the relationship bet ween trust and medication adherence. It was not examined in any of the transplant studies included in our review. Future studies examining predictors of medication adherence in the transplant population should examine the role of trust in the health care provider. We integrated therefore trust in the health care provider into the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study, the first and only nationwide cohort study in transplantation that embraced a biopsychosocial perspective assessing not only biomedical but also sele cted psychosocial and system related factors from pre - transplant to life -long post -transplant 49. The finding that trust in the health care provider is s ignificantly associated with non- adherence has also implications for clinical practice. As trust in the health care professional does not happen instantaneously but evolves over time 50, continuity of care is an important aspect of the care of chronically ill patients. Therefore, to the extent possible, patients should be followed by the same health care provider. Furthermore, as health care providers with good communication skills instill more trust, clinical practice settings need to focus on providing education and training to improve communication between providers and patients 33. Drug access refers to the availability of drugs. In their report \"The World Medicines Situation \" (2004), the World Health Organization states that essential medicines should be continuously available for patients 51. In our review, access to drugs was associated with better medication adherence. However, in the studies that examined the relationship between medication availability and adherence multivariately, th e relationship was significant in developing countries but not in developed countries. This finding is not unexpected given the issues with drug access in many developing countries 51. One reason why drug access in developing countries is often not guaranteed is the fluctuating production of essentia l drugs 52, which leads to stock shortages in hospitals or Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 180 pharmacies. This finding has implications for clinical practice sites but also implications for health policy and international aid for developing countr ies. Unfortunately, methodological limitations of the studies included in the review, hamper firm conclusion regarding the role of individual system factors in promoting or inhibiting medication adherence. Major variability across the studies was observe d in the definition of medication adherence. Different cut - offs were used to define adherence across the studies. This variability may, in part, explain the variability we found in the associations between the health care system factor(s) examined and adhe rence. In addition, there were variations in the adherence assessment time period (ranging from \"ever\" to \"the previous two days\") and the method used to assess adherence. Furthermore, variations in study designs (cross- sectional versus prospective designs ), the system factors examined and how they were measured, the methods of analysis (bivariate versus multivariate analysis techniques), and incomplete reporting of statistical findings made the combination of study results (meta -analysis) inappropriate. Based on these limitations, we strongly recommend conducting a large multi -continental, multi -country, multi -center study to examine the associations between multiple factors at the micro -, meso -, and macro levels and non- adherence to medication regimens. To address this research gap, we designed the Building Research Initiative Group: Chronic Illness Management and Adherence in Transplantation (BRIGHT) study, an international multi - center cross -sectional study to explore the relation between selected patient level, health care system factors and non -adherence with immunosuppressive drugs in transplant recipients. Forty heart transplant programs (20 from North - America and 20 from Europe) will be included in this study. A further recommendation for future resea rch evolving of this systematic review is that authors report the magnitude of the examined system factors' effect on adherence. Our methodological manuscript, which describes the most commonly used effect size measures and how they are calculated, will as sist and encourage authors to provide this essential information in their manuscripts (Chapter 4). Additionally, most of the studies included in this review did not base their factor selection on a theoretical framework such as the ecological model. Use of such a Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 181 framework will guide the selection of factors to be examined, ensure that all important factors are included and contribute to building scientific understanding related to the complex phenomena of medication adherence. It is only with this knowledg e, that we can develop effective strategies to address this major public health issue. Future studies are strongly encouraged to use a theoretical framework to underpin the selection of the patient -related - as well as of the system -related variables includ ed in their study. 2) Nurses' practice patterns in view of adherence-related interventions call for a change in curricula. The health care workforce needs to be equipped with the required competencies for behavioural management. Moreover, practice development focused on integrating behavioural strategies to improve adherence management is needed. We examined practice patterns related to interventions used to promote patients' adherence to medications by performing two surveys of health care professionals, p rimarily nurses, working with cardiovascular and transplant patients, respectively. At two conferences we invited all participants to complete an instrument assessing the frequency with which they used 26 adherence enhancing interventions. The interventions were identified from the literature 2,53-56 and classified as educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral and psychological/affective based on the classification proposed by De Bleser 57. Educationa l/cognitive interventions present information individually or in a group setting delivering it verbally, in written form, and/or audio -visually. Counseling/behavioral interventions shape and/or reinforce behavior, empowering patients to participate in thei r own care, while positively changing their skill levels or normal routines. Psychological/affective interventions focus on patients' feelings and emotions or social relationships and social support 57. In both samples, participants reported using a higher proportion of educational/cognitive interventions than of counseling/behavioral and psychological/affective interventions. In the study of transplant nurses, we also Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 182 asked the participants to rate the perceived effectiveness of the interventions used. Their average effectiveness ratings for the three groups of interventions were very simi lar. This is contrary to current evidence that indicates that educational interventions are not very effective in promoting adherence 2,56,58. There are a number of possible explanations for this finding. First, educational/cognitive interventions are relatively simple and inexpensive to implement and, therefore, f easible in most clinical settings. Evidence, however, indicates that counseling/behavioral and psychological/affective interventions are more effective in promoting long -term behavioral changes 59 such as ongoing medication adherence 60. Yet, they are time consuming to implement, require more skills and require more follow -up to be successful. They necessitate continuity of care i.e., supervision of the chronically ill patient by the same health care professional(s) 61. This may be a major barrier in their use as in many health care set tings where care is still mainly built around an acute model of care which does not meet the specific needs of patients suffering of chronic illnesses 1,9-12. However, like health care organizations, curricula in health science schools are often outdated and static resulting in graduates who are ill equipped to address the rapidly shifting balance between acute and c hronic health problems 19,62,63. In most education settings there is a serious mismatch between the development of professional competencies and existing and emerging patient and population needs such as the needs of the chronically ill. Indeed, the curricula in most health sciences colleges and universities focus much more on acute care than on chronic care 13,64-66. While schools address so me aspects of chronic care in their programs, it is rarely central to their curriculum 13. This need has also been recognized by the Institute of Medicine which strongly recommend in their 2010 report The Future of Nursing that nursing curricula need to be reexamined, updated and adaptive to change as patients needs and advances in science and technology 63. In response to concerns about the lack of emphasis on chronic care in the US, a curriculum task force was established to increase the proportion of schools of medicin e, nursing and allied health whose basic curriculum includes the core competencies in health promotion and disease prevention 67. The Task Force Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 183 published a Clinical Prevention and Population Health Curriculum Framework . One of the recommended domains in this curriculum is counseling for behavioral change. This domain includes approaches to behavior change that incorporate diverse patient perspecti ves (e.g., counseling skills training and motivational interviewing), clinician -patient communication (e.g., patient participation in decision making, informed consent, risk communication, advocacy, and health literacy), criteria for successful counseling (e.g., effectiveness, benefits and harms, cost, and acceptance by patient), and evidence- based recommendations 67. Curricula also need to integra te interprofessional education. Interprofessional education occurs when two or more professions (e.g., doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers) learn with, from and about each other to improve collaboration and the quality of care 68. A growing body of evidence shows that interprofessional education leads to closer collaboration between health care professionals as well as between health care organizations. Thi s improved collaboration can, in turn, improve the quality of care for patients 68. Since the majority of practicing nurses do not have the educational foundation recom mended in The Future of Nursing 63 report and the Clinical Pr evention and Population Health Curriculum Framework 67, they often lack the training and competencies necessary to provide effective chronic illn ess care including skills needed to promote long term -changes in behavior such as medication adherence 69. Therefore, it is essential that educational and organizational leaders support the preparation of nurses and other health care professionals with the required competencies by providing ongoing education and training. An example health care organizations could offer is training in motivational interviewing. Motivational interviewing i s a client -centered, directive method for enhancing the intrinsic motivation to change one's behavior by exploring and resolving ambivalence 70,71. Motivation interviewing has been shown to be an effective method to change patient behavior and improving clinical outcomes 72. Efforts in curriculum reforms as well as the development of continuous education programs are urgently needed to enhance the competencies of nurses and other health care professionals in view of interventions to enhance adherence to medication regimens. Future studies should evaluate the extent to Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 184 which these investments 1) increase health care professionals' competencies in implementing counseling/behavioral and psychological/affective interventi ons and 2) improve long -term clinical outcomes for patients with chronic illnesses. 3) The CIMI-BRIGHT instrument is the first and only tool developed to systematically assess the level of chronic illness management in transplant centers and thus provides a building block for further observational and intervention research in transplantation. Survival gains after transplantation have been limited to the first 6 to 12 months with long- term survival rates remaining unchanged 73-75. Transplant outcomes are determined by the interplay of a number of factors including biomedical, behavioral, psychosocial, and socio- demographic as well as system factors (e.g., practice pat terns in transplant centers) 76-79. In the past, most research and clinical interest focused on biomedical factors. Improving long -term outcomes is one of the mos t important future challenges. This need has also been recognized by the European Commission, that as part of the EU 7 th Framework programs, recently launched a call for proposals addressing novel strategies to improve long -term outcomes after transplantat ion. Given the fact that transplant patients belong to the group of the chronically ill, which means that they are in need of continuity of care, support for self -management and preventive measures, it can be put forward that transplant care could be stren gthened by adopting a care model that follows the principles of chronic illness care. Indeed, a shift in attention toward the long -term follow -up of transplant patients will have to occur to really make an impact on long -term outcomes 74,75. We, for the first time, developed a tool assessing the extent to which chronic illness management is implemented in the follow -up care of transplant patients. The development of the Chronic Illness Management Implementation - Building Research Initiative Group: Chronic Illness Management and Adherence in Transplantation (CIMI -BRIGHT) instrument was based on the conceptual framework of WHO's Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) framework, as well as the clinical expertise of the Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 185 members of the research team. As part of this dissertation, we completed initial testing of its content validity and inter -rater reliabili ty. The results suggest that the CIMI -BRIGHT instrument has promise as a measure of the extent to which the chronic illness model is being implemented in transplant centers. The work we performed with the development of the CIMI -BRIGHT provides a building block for future studies designed to examine the extent to which transplant centers implement chronic illness management principles. Data from such studies will allow investigators to determine whether differences in chronic illness practice patterns impa ct patient outcomes. These differences may be related to the differences to \"center effects\" that have been observed in some studies 80-85. Center effects refer to differences in outcome that cannot be explained by identifiable differences in the patients treated or specific treatments applied 80. Center effects are presumed to result from differences in the ways health care is delivered. For instance, individ ual centers may have different long -term follow -up programs that could potentially influence outcomes 80. A number of studies have demonstrated that variations in practice patterns influence patient outcomes. In a study in hematopoietic stem cell trans plantation in the United States, two center factors, 'presence of physicians answering after hours calls' and a 'lower patient -per-physician ratio', were associated with decreased 100 -day mortality rates: 81. The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), a prospective, observational study among hemodialysis centers in seven different countries showed that center characteristics such as the size of the center and the percentage of highly trained staff, and the country where the dialysis center was located were related to dialysis non -adherence rates 82,83. The Swiss HIV cohort study also found that the center where the patient is followed up accounted for significant variability in adherence rates 84. An 11 country survey of primary care doctors by Schoen et al. (2009) found wide variations at a n ational level in practice systems, incentives, perceptions of access to care, use of health information technology and programs to improve quality 85. The mere fa ct that center - specific differences regarding outcomes for chronically ill patients are observed indicates that processes at this level are influential and require to be scrutinized. Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 186 The first step in improving chronic illness management in transplant cent ers should be to design studies to explore the extent to which the principles of chronic illness care are implemented by transplant centers. The relationship between implementation of elements of the model and adherence -related outcomes should also be exam ined. This knowledge will provide the basis for developing interventions designed to improve implementation of the model. The CIMI- BRIGHT instrument, if further validation supports it use for these purposes, could also be relevant to assess the impact of t hese interventions on medication adherence. Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 187 Conclusion As patient behavior, i.e., patient adherence, is prone to the influence of system factors it is of upmost importance to scrutinize these factors. Yet, there is limited research examining the impact of system factors on adherence. This dissertation contributes to the science of adherence by systematically examining current evidence related to the role of system factors in adherence and by identifying important gaps in nursing practice and knowledge re lated to adherence -promoting interventions. The findings of this dissertation emphasis the need for nurses and other health care providers to be prepared with a foundation in systems thinking and competencies to ensure the delivery of effective and high qu ality care. Furthermore, this dissertation points to the need for continuous efforts to improve outcomes in chronically ill patients. The evidence from this dissertation provides a strong foundation for future research. Chapter 8: Synthesis, discussion and perspectives 188 References 1. Nolte E, McKee M.
