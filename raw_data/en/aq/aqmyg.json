It reflects experience in research and clinical laboratories throughout the world with a broad range of microbes. Very few of the microbes discussed will be studied at the National Bio and Agro- Defense Facility (NBAF). United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Department of Agriculture have identified several disease agents that potentially would be studied at the NBAF. These agents are foot and mouth disease viruses, Rift Valley fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendrah virus, classical swine fever virus, African swine fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Mycoplasma mycoides. The NBAF will be designed specifically to mitigate risks involved in working with these pathogens as described in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement. The NBAF research mission would be based on current pathogen and disease risk assessments, subject to change as threat and risk assessments change. A RE VIEW OF BIOCONTAINMENT LAPSES AND L ABORATORY -ACQUIRED INFECTIONS B.1 G ENERAL HISTORY OF LABORATORY -ACQUIRED INFECTIONS Accounts of laboratory -acquired infections (LAI) appear in the literature as distantly as the late 19th century (Harding and Byers 2000). State policies have varied widely with regard to the requirements for reporting LAI, and until the advent of the Select Agent Program in 2002, there was no federal requirement. As a result, the collected data have necessarily been incomplete (Schell 2006; CDC and NIH 1999). Also, it has been suggested that these reports might under -represent the true number of LAI because they do not account for subclinical (asymptomatic) infections. Collection of accurate data regarding LAI continues to be \"hampered by an indifference to and, frequently, an unwillingness to report these incidents\" in part \"due to fear of reprisal and the stigma associated with such events\" (Harding and Byers 2000; Harding and Byers 2006). Recent Congressional testimony has suggested that a no -fault reporting system for biocontainment failures, similar to that used by the Federal Aviation Administration, could be beneficial (U.S. House of Representatives 2007). The potential advantage of such an approach is two-fold. First, incidents could be reported without fear of penalty or stigma. Second, root cause analysis of failures often will demonstrate common factors that, when identified and shared, can be used to reduce the likelihood of similar events in the future. It is significant th at LAI have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. Experience with 109 LAI at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), between 1947 and 1973 showed that no secondary infections occurred among family or community members (CDC and NIH 1999). The National Animal Disease Center (NADC), Agriculture Research Service (ARS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) (Ames, Iowa), similarly found no secondary infections associated with 18 LAI at their institution between 1960 and 1975. Two secondary infections were reported between 1975 and 1999, and these involved agents (smallpox virus and monkey B virus) that required biosafety and biocontainment precautions in excess of biosafety level -3 (BSL -3) (CDC and NIH 1999). Comparison of the recent literature with previous reports suggests that the number of LAI is generally decreasing (CDC and NIH 2007; Harding and Byers 2000; Harding and Byers 2006). However, there has been an increase in LAI with Neisseria meningitidis (often fatal), and there is some evidence to suggest that the number of viral and parasitic LAI is not decreasing (Harding and Byers 2006). Although it is not possible to conclude with certainty that the app arent overall decrease in LAI has been real, it has been suggested that, from this point forward, an overall decrease in LAI can be expected (CDC and NIH 2007; Harding and Byers 2000; Harding and Byers 2006). This expectation, even during an era of acceler ated construction of biocontainment facilities, is based on progress that has been made in the design of safety equipment and laboratory facilities, safer work practices, and refinement and implementation of biosafety programs. An NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statem ent December 2008 B-2 additional safeguard was published in 1976 and reiterated in 1994 when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiated a requirement that an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) be established for any NIH - funded entity that conducts research with genetically recombinant mater ial. B.2 NIH/CDC' S NATIONAL GUIDELINES Primary and secondary biocontainment barriers were established by the NIH and the CDC, who first promulgated national guidelines for safe work with a broad range of infectious microorganisms in 1980. Four levels of increasing physical biocontainment and work practices were designated for pathogens with differing virulence for humans, different relative risks of infection from aerosols induced by laboratory manipulation, and different availabilities of vaccines or the rapies. BSL -4 is assigned to microorganisms posing a high individual risk of life -threatening disease by infectious aerosols and for which no treatment is available. Examples include Nipah and Hendra viruses. BSL-3 is assigned to microorganisms having a po tential for respiratory transmission and which can cause a serious and potentially lethal infection. Examples include Mycobacterium tuberculosis and West Nile virus (WNV). For such agents, all procedures must be carried out in biosafety cabinets (BSCs) fit ted with high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. Centrifuges require sealed rotors or cups that ensure that if a tube breaks during operation, the contents will be contained until the rotor or cups are opened inside the BSC. In addition to pathog ens known to be aerosol -transmitted, microbiological science continues to confront newly discovered viruses and bacteria for which aerosol infectivity is uncertain. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has adopted a policy for such microorganisms that stipulates BSL -3 equipment and practices in BSL -2 laboratories with negative pressure. B.3 R EVIEW OF BIOSAFETY AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES : 1982-2003 A review was undertaken in 2003 in which resea rchers were interviewed regarding laboratory conditions and practices. This review was limited to work done during the past two decades by scientists at intramural laboratories of NIAID located on the Bethesda campus, at a neighboring facility in Rockville , Maryland, and at the Institute's Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, Montana. Senior scientists were interviewed to ascertain pathogens studied, the variety of research programs that evolved over two decades, animals employed - if any, labora tory space, daily number of workers in the laboratories, and specific histories of laboratory accidents and consequences. Problems with function of facilities also were solicited and recorded. Independent records of reported laboratory accidents that might expose workers to infection were reviewed. During those 21 years, all such accidents were to be reported quickly to the NIH Occupational Medical Service (OMS) for epidemiological and medical evaluation, as well as immediate prophylactic treatment if indicated. Invasive wounds received in course of laboratory work and clinical care of persons with chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are of continuing concern. The OMS is now able to provide antiviral therapy within 2 hours of a n accident on a 7-day/24- hour basis when circumstances indicate the need for therapy. Intake records of all accidents on the NIH campus were initially paper documents. Copies were forwarded to the Occupational Safety and Health Branch (OSHB) in the Director's office t o follow up circumstances of an accident and for remedial action, when indicated. In addition to such immediate reaction to accidents and facility emergencies, the OSHB has developed standardized protocols for periodic review of all laboratories for compli ance with NIH safety practices. Laboratories at BSL -3 level are reviewed at 6 -month intervals; all others are done annually. For the past decade, all records are computerized and electronic copies go from OMS to OSHB instantly. Records for this 21 -year int erval were cross- checked for details by staff of both NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statem ent December 2008 B-3 offices, together with specific scientist memory, in constructing the biosafety record for NIAID since 1982. Records for the RML were reviewed with biosafety and scientific staff at that facility. The detailed report is organized by laboratory within the NIAID Division of Intramural Research. Pathogens, research agendas, biocontainment levels, animal use, location, and space for laboratories are presented in tabular form, together with histories of labo ratory accidents and of facility problems that have affected work in those laboratories. By any measure, the safety record at intramural NIAID laboratories, where work is done with the Institute's most pathogenic agents, is outstanding. No pathogen has esc aped from any laboratory to cause infection in adjacent civilian communities. Indeed, this record stretches to almost 70 years at RML where several agents now on the national Select Agent List have been studied for decades. If one takes the number of 8- hour person- days estimated by senior research staff during direct conversations and translates these into 2,000 person- hours per year in exposure to microbial organisms, impressive numbers of safe operation emerge as shown in Table B.3- 1. Similar reviews wer e undertaken for experience with BSL-4 level pathogens from 1972 to 2003 at three agencies: U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), CDC Special Pathogens Branch, and National Institute for Communicable Diseases, which is a branch of the South Africa National Health Laboratory Service (NICD). Results are shown in Table B.3- 2. During the 1970s and 1980s, biocontainment procedures were developed to assure the safety of personnel and the environment from the biological material s being handled. The development of standardized laboratory practices, equipment, and facility design was established in 1984 with the publication of the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Labora tories (BMBL) by CDC and NIH. It is an evolving gui dance document that has become a mandatory compliance requirement for biomedical and clinical laboratories. The BMBL specifies laboratory practices, biosafety equipment, and facility design requirements for each biosafety level that is necessary to maintai n biocontainment of biological materials, for the safety of the workers, the public, and the environment. Table B.3 -1 summarizes LAIs under past practices and work conditions. The data reference partial BSL -2 and BSL -3 facilities, which refers to the appli cation of biosafety practices, microbiological techniques, and/or equipment to augment biocontainment; nevertheless, the addition of such measures does not meet the requirements for achieving the next level of biocontainment. The partial (P) designation pr ecedes the BMBL and is no longer recognized as an authorized work environment for work with biological materials. The term \"partial\" refers to the absence of single- pass directional air flow through a HEPA filter within the laboratory. In partial laborator ies, all bench work was conducted within a BSC, which incorporated HEPA filtration within the BSC before air was exhausted from the BSC to the facility heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. BSL-2 and BSL -3 ventilation requirements have become more stringent since 2003. NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statem ent December 2008 B-4 Table B.3 -1 \u2014 Personnel Hours Worked and Outcomes of Accidental Exposures to Infectious Agents: Intramural NIAID 1982 -2003 Hours Outcomes of Accidental Exposures Clinical Infections Silent Infections Other Exposures, No Infections BSL-3 1 2 9 BSL-2/3 Pa 0 2 15 Total 1 4 24 aP refers to partial, which was used in past practices preceding B MBL requirements. Partial laboratory status refers to the absence of single -pass directional air flow through a HEPA filter within the laboratory; however, all bench work was conducted within a BSC, which incorporated HEPA filtration within the BSC before air was exhausted from the BSC to the facility heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. One clinical infection without secondary consequences and four silent infections in more than 3 million hours of exposure is a remarkable record, especiall y when continuous exposure of personnel to fluids containing HIV virus over many years is a significant part of that record. Indeed, only a single instance was considered worthy of immediate prophylaxis for that agent, and no infection occurred.

Particular attention is given to LAI. Biocontainment failures and other protocol lapses that did not result in a LAI are included for certain cases that may have posed potential risk to workers and/or the community. It is important to not e that federal requirements for reporting such incidents are limited to agents specified by the Select Agent Program. Therefore, incidents involving other serious agents of disease may be incompletely represented in the tables. Table B.4 -4 reviews laborat ory-related outbreaks from livestock pathogens that require high biocontainment precautions during experimental research. A special category of biocontainment precautions has been delineated for research involving experimentally infected animals that are t oo large to be kept in individual biocontainment enclosures. Such animals include cattle, pigs, and horses. In such cases, primary biocontainment of the pathogen is provided by the room itself through an elaborate set of biocontainment design features. This level of biocontainment is classified as BSL -3Ag. The BSL -3Ag facility can be a separate building, but more often it is an isolated zone contained within a facility operating at a lower biosafety level, usually BSL -3. The following tables are designed t o show that working with certain biohazards, especially those that can infect via the respiratory route, carries significant risks and that all safety equipment and facility protocols NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statem ent December 2008 B-5 should be taken seriously and followed at all times to minimize the chances of contracting and spreading infections. In October 2007, the CDC released to Congress a compilation of 111 incidents involving materials covered by the Select Agent Program (U.S. House of Representatives 2007). Not all of those incidents are included in the tables.

The identity of these infections was not recognized until the mother of one of the workers sickened as well. The mother died, and six other persons in contact with the two individuals became infected. An intense lab investigation revealed that two other workers had experienced SARS -compatible illnesses in Feb. 2004 and were found to have the antibodies of t he etiologic SARS -CoV. Vector Laboratory, in Novosibirsk, Russia May 19, 2004 Ebola virus (BSL -4) A researcher several days earlier had suffered an accidental finger stick with a hypodermic needle that contained the Zaire strain of Ebola virus. She was working with a guinea pig model of the infection at the time. The researcher died from Ebola infection on May 19. No information available. The National Defense University in Taipei, Taiwan December 10, 2003 SARS -CoV On Dec. 6, 2003, a senior research scientist working with SARS in a Class III BSC cleaned up waste fluid that leaked from a tightly docked transfer chamber connected to the main cabinet. From the main cabinet, he sprayed alcohol into the chamber, waited 10 min, opened the chamber to spray more , and finally physically cleaned it up. The next day he attended a SARS meeting in Singapore. On Dec. 10, 2003, he noted fever and fatigue, which progressed into a dry cough and severe myalgia. He was hospitalized Dec. 16 and experienced moderately severe clinical illness. Contacts, especially plane passengers, were monitored or quarantined; no secondary infections occurred. An investigation of the lab revealed that SARS -CoV nucleic acid was on the handle of an alcohol bottle in the transfer chamber and on the light switch in the Class II cabinet . A BSL -3 lab at an Institute in Singapore August 26, 2003 West Nile virus (WNV) ; SARS - CoV A graduate student working on a virulent recent New York strain of WNV became sick with fever and myalgia after making sever al passages of the new virus in Vero E6 cells also used to grow SARS -CoV. The student had minimal training and help from an institute technician. On Sept. 3, he was admitted to the hospital with a dry cough and signs of pulmonary inflammation. He was tran sferred to isolation and developed a moderately severe evolution of the disease. The technician was not infected. Surveillance and quarantine was maintained on several dozen contacts, but no sec- ondary infections occurred. An investigation of the lab prove d that the WNV was contaminated with the SARS -CoV. Vector Laboratory, in Novosibirsk, Russia 1988 Marburg virus (BSL -4) Two workers were infected in 1988 with no further details available. It is not clear whether the two infections occurred at the same ti me. One of the infections was fatal. No information available.

NIH advised that all work during the 2005- 2006 period should have been conducted under BSL -4 biocontainment as specified under Section III-D-2 of NIH guidelines for Research Involving Recom binant DNA Molecules. The research was halted at Madison and moved to the National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg, Canada, which is a BSL -4 biocontainment facility. Ft. Detrick, MD February 10, 2004 Ebola virus U.S. Army officials reported that a ci vilian scientist accidentally grazed her hand with a hypodermic needle while injecting mice that had been infected 2 days earlier with an attenuated strain of Ebola virus. The report does not specify the contents of the syringe and needle, but a February 1 9 report by CNN specified that the needle contained the virus. The scientist was sequestered in the biocontainment care suite until it could be concluded that no infection ensued. No further information.

Four people apparently were exposed to Bacillus anthracis . Prophylaxis was refused. No infections resulted. Procedures were modified to require that centrifuge buckets be opened only within a BSC and inspected and decontaminated after each us e. Texas A & M University (TAMU), College Station, TX December 21, 2006 Coxiella burnetii (Q Fever) A mouse infected with Coxiella burnetii was found to be unaccounted for and was believed to be missing. A report to CDC was filed on Dec. 22. The discrep ancy never was resolved. University of Texas at Austin, TX April 2006 Recombinant Influenza A H3N2 virus, containing genes from strain H5N1 (bird flu) A centrifuge secondary container lid broke during centrifugation of virus, causing the rotor to become unbalanced. The researcher noted loss of volume in one viral tube and, suspecting viral leakage, undertook decontamination of centrifuge, centrifuge tube, work area, adjacent equipment, and himself. A decision was made to treat the researcher empirically us ing Tamiflu. Secondary decontamination of lab room was undertaken the following day. Responsible officials maintain that it is unclear whether a leakage of virus occurred. However, their records show that proper decontamination protocol was not followed f or the suspected leak.

She later required prolonged administration of intravenous and oral antibiotics. Responsible officials did not report this infection to federal auth orities as required by federal law. CDC issued a cease and desist order to TAMU on April 20, 2007, which was expanded on June 30 to include work with all Select Agents. Other serious violations were found during a site visit inspection in July 2007. Yeshi va University, New York, NY December 2005 Mycobacterium tuberculosis Two lab workers converted to skin test - positive status, indicating an infection with M. tuberculosis . One of these worked in both the BSL -2 and BSL -3 labs, whereas the second worked only in the BSL -2 lab. Infections were sub - clinical. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment was administered. All other workers were given tuberculosis (TB) skin tests. Neither of the two positive employees worked with the TB aerosolization animal chamber. No accid ents had occurred in the labs. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Livermore, CA September 2005 Bacillus anthracis (Anthrax) A total of 1,025 vials were shipped to a Palm Beach, FL, laboratory. Two of the vials were missing caps, and a third v ial had a loosened cap. A subsequent shipment to a second laboratory contained an incorrect number of vials. Two workers possibly were exposed to Bacillus anthracis . The workers were prophylactically treated with antibiotics. LLNL was fined $450,000 for th e violations.

An investigation by the CDC and FBI ruled out theft and concluded that lab error, mouse cannibalism, and unauthorized removal all are possibilities. Medical University of Ohio, OH 2005 Coccidioide s immitis (Valley Fever) A potential aerosol exposure of a student was reported. Medical evaluation was provided. The BSL -3 facility director, who was in charge of the C. immitis research, resigned as Director and was replaced both as Animal and Biosafety Protocol Principal Investigator and as advisor to the students (see 2004 C. immitis incident elsewhere in this table).

The error was discovered in March by a participating lab in Canada. This virus requires Enhanced BSL -3 biocontainment precautions. CAP was requested by the U.S. government to notify all participating labs to destroy the virus, to invest - igate, and to report to national health authorities any respiratory infecti on in lab workers. CAP sent out notifications on April 8 and 12, 2004. No infections were reported as of April 12, 2005. University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL September 2004 Not specified (redacted by IBC) Both doors of the double -door biocontain ment entryway were propped open by laboratory staff while experiments were in progress.

Two researchers became infected with Francisella tularensis in May and were not correctly diagnosed until a third scientist became infected with the bacterium in September. An investigation revealed that researchers unknowingly used a mixed culture that contained both a non- virulent and a virulent strain. It also found that the researchers failed to fol low proper biocontainment protocol. Medical University of Ohio, OH 2004 Coccidioides immitis (Valley Fever) An infection, possibly laboratory acquired, was diagnosed. However, the employee previously resided in an endemic area and previously had worked with C. immitis in another laboratory. Therefore, it could not be proven when and how the infection began. The infected employee was provided with medical treatment and re- assigned to other duties. Safety policies were revised, video surveillance was installed, serologic monitoring of staff was reviewed (see 2005 C. immitis incident elsewhere in this table). Infectious Disease Research, Inc., Seattle, WA Late 2003 - March 2004 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tuberculosis) Three researchers became skin test - positive for tuberculosis after using a newly acquired aerosolization chamber for experimental infection of animals.

Following this and the July 19 incidents, \"new animal care protocols were instituted to restrict access to all animal rooms.\" Restrictions included clothing exchange, mandatory exit showers, and \"decontamination of all laboratory samples leaving/removed from the animal rooms.\" PIADC, Plum Island, NY September 2003 FMDV; others An investigation to assess security at PIADC in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks is concluded. The report enumerated fundamental concerns that pathogens were not adequately secured from unauthorized access. Security recommendations were incorporated into the operations of the facility. PIADC, Plum Island, NY August 18, 1991 FMDV; others Main electrical power lines to one lab were knocked out due to hurricane -force winds. Back -up power was unavailable due to deferred repairs on an inoperable emergency transmission line. Disposal systems for virus - laden waste were inoperable for 32 hours, causing a back up of infectious sewage. No infections in animals were reported. No further information available. PIADC, Plum Island, NY May 26, 1987 FMDV One heifer without previous inoculation or known exposure to FMDV was found to be infected with type O virus. Type O had been used in nearby rooms, and these animals from these rooms had been euthanized and then transported through the corridor. Actions were taken to replace equipm ent used in transport and to decontaminate corridors more thoroughly. PIADC, Plum Island, NY February 24, 1981 FMDV Four steer vaccinated with FMDV type O were found to be infected with type A. The cause was not identified, but it was surmised that cross - contamination from another lab area was most likely. None specified.

It was surmised that a laboratory worker could have accidentally transmitted the virus to the animals. None specified. PIADC, Plum Island, NY September 15, 1978 FMDV FMDV escaped from the biocontainment facility. The suspected cause was construction work in pro gress. Cattle outside of the laboratory facility were found to be infected with FMDV. All animals on the island were euthanized and incinerated. The virus outbreak was limited to the island. PIADC, Plum Island, NY April 12, 1974 FMDV Two steers that had never been inoculated with FMDV were found to be infected. It was determined that FMDV probably came into the room through leaks in the walls, possibly in conjunction with a power failure that may have caused a difference in air pressure between the two r ooms. Preventive maintenance of the rooms was conducted to prevent recurrence. Source: GAO 2003; Caroll 2004; Health and Safety Executive 2007; DHS response to GAO 2008.
