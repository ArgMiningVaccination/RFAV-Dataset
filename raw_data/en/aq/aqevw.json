FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 1 INDICATIONS AND US AGE HIBERIX is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive dis ease caused by Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) type b. HIBERIX is approved for use in children aged 6 weeks through 4 years (prior to fifth birthday). The evaluation of effectiveness of HIBERIX was based on immune responses in children using serolog ical endpoints that predict protection from invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) , Clinical Studies DOSAGE ADMINIS TRATION 2.1 Reconstitution HIBERIX is to be reconstituted only with the accompanying s aline diluent. The reconstituted vaccine should be a clear and colorless solution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. Figure 1. Cleanse both vial stopper s. Withdraw 0.6 mL of saline diluent from accompanying vial. Figure 2. Transfer 0.6 mL saline diluent into lyophilized vaccine vial. Figure 3. Shake the vial well . Figure 4. After reconstitution, withdraw 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine and administer intramuscularly . Use a separate sterile needle and sterile syringe for each in dividual . After reconstitution, administer 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 and 46\u00b0F) and administer within 24 hours . If the vaccine is not administered immediately , shake the solution well again before administration . 2.2 Administration For intramuscular use only . HIBERIX is administered as a single dose ( 0.5 mL ) by intramuscular injection into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or deltoid. Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. If HIBERIX is administered concomitantly with other injectable vaccines, they should be given with separate syringes and at different injection sites. HIBERIX should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial . 2.3 Dose and Schedule HIBERIX is admin istered as a 4 -dose series (0.5-mL each dose ) given by intra muscular injection. The series consists of a primary immunization course of 3 dose s administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, f ollowed by a booster dose administered at 15 through 18 months of age . The first dose may be given as early as 6 weeks of age. 3 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND ST RENGTHS HIBERIX is a solution for injection supplied as a single -dose vial of lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted with the accompanying vial of saline diluent. A single dose, after reconstitution, is 0.5 mL. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any H. influenzae type b- or tetanus toxoid- containing vaccine or any component of the vaccine is a contraindication to administration of HIBERIX [see Description (11)] . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome If Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome has occur red within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid- containing vaccine, including HIBERIX, should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. 5.2 Syncope Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including HIBE RIX. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual distur bance, paresthesia, and tonic -clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. 5.3 Apnea in Premature Infants Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. Decisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including HIBERIX, to infants born prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant's medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. 5.4 Preventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the patient's immunization history for possible vaccine hypersensitivity. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the control of immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute anaphylactic reaction occur. 5.5 Altered Immunocompetence Safety and effectiveness of HIBERIX in immunosuppressed children have not been evaluated. If HIBERIX is administered to immunosuppressed children , including children receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained. 4 5.6 Interference with Laboratory Tests Urine antigen detection may not have a diagnostic value in suspected disease due to H. influenzae type b within 1 to 2 weeks after receipt of a H. influenzae type b-containing vaccine, including HIBERIX [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. 5.7 Tetanus Immunization Immunization with HIBERIX does not substitute for routine tetanus immunization. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clini cal trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There is the possibility that broad use of HIBERIX could reveal adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials. Across clinical trials, c ommon solicited adverse reactions (20%) were pain and redness at the injection site, irritability, drowsiness, fever, loss of appetite, fussiness, and restlessness. Study 1: In a randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S., children were vaccinated with HIBERIX (n = 2,963) , a U.S.- licensed PRP -T) (Sanofi Pasteur SA ) (n = 520), or a U.S. -licensed combined D iphtheria and T etanus T oxoids and A cellular Pertussis Pasteur Ltd.) (n = 520) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. HIBERIX and Control PRP -T (Sanofi Pasteur Wyeth Pharmaceuticals with Doses 1, 2, and 3 and ROTARIX [Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral ] with Doses 1 and 2. DTaP - IPV/Hib was administer ed concomitantly with PCV13 and ENGERIX -B [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] with Doses 1, 2, and 3 and ROTARIX with Doses 1 and 2. If a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine was received, ENGERIX -B was given with Doses 1 and 3. In the total population, 51.2% were male; 61% were white, 8% were Asian, 9% were black, and 22% were other racial/ethnic groups . In Study 1, children received a booster dose of either HIBERIX (n = 2,336) , a Haemophilus PRP -T) (Sanofi Pasteur SA ) (n = 435), or a combined D iphtheria and T etanus T oxoids and A cellular Pertussis Pasteur Ltd.) (n = 400) at 15 to 18 months of age (mean age : 15.6 months) following primary vac cination at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with the same vaccine. The booster dose of HIBERIX and Control PRP -T (Sanofi Pasteur 5 SA) was administered concomitantly with INFANRIX [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed In 7 additional clinical studies, 1,008 children received HIBERIX as a booster dose following primary vaccination with either HIBERIX (n = 530), Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Control PRP-T) (Sanofi Pasteur SA) (n = 235), Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine ( Merck & Co., Inc.) (n = 26), or Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.) (no longer licensed in the U .S., n = 217). None of the studies included a comparator group that received a booster dose with a U .S.-licensed Haemophilus b Conjugate V accine. Studies were conducted in Europe, Canada, and Latin America. Across these studies, the mean age of subjects at the time of booster vaccination with HIBERIX ranged from 16 to 19 months . At the time of vaccination, 172 (17.1%) subjects were aged 11 t o 14 months, 642 (63.7%) subjects were aged 15 to 18 months, and 194 (19.2%) subjects were aged 19 to 25 months . Approximately half of the subjects were male. Among subjects for whom information on race/ethnicity was available, nearly all subjects were whi te. In these 7 studies, HIBERIX was administered concomitantly with non- U.S. formulations (containing 2.5 mg 2 -phenoxyethanol per dose as preservative) of one of the following U .S.- licensed (DTaP) were administered in dosing reg imens not approved in the U .S. Some subjects received DTaP -HBV (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , not licensed in U.S.) concomitantly with HIBERIX .

Serious Adverse Reactions In Study 1, one of 2,963 subjects who received HIBERIX and coadministered vaccines given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age experienced a serious adverse reaction which was in temporal association with vaccination and had no alternative plausible causes (convulsion on D ay 14 after Dose 1). One of 2,336 subjects who received a booster dose of HIBERIX concomitantly with 9 INFANRIX experienced a serious adverse reaction which was in temporal as sociation with vaccination and had no alternative plausible causes (new onset febrile seizure on D ay 1 after Dose 4). In the 7 additional studies , 2 of 1,008 subjects reported a serious adverse reaction that occurred in the 31- day period following booster immunization with HIBERIX. One subject developed bilateral pneumonia 9 days post -vaccination and one subject experienced asthenia following accidental drug ingestion 18 days post -vaccination. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to reports in clinical trials for HIBERIX , the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of HIBERIX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccination. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb, injection site induration. Immune System Disorders Allergic reactions (including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions), angioedema. Nervous System Disorders Convulsions (with or without fever), hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode (i.e., sudden onset of cyanosis) , and Mediastinal Disorders Apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash, urticaria. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Interference with Laboratory Tests Haemophilus b capsular polysaccharide derived from Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines has been detected in the urine of some vaccinees.1 Urine antigen detection may not have a diagnostic value in suspected disease due to H. influenzae type b within 1 to 2 weeks after receipt of a H. influenzae type b-contai ning vaccine , including HIBERIX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. 7.2 Concomitant Vaccine Administration In clinical studies, HIBERIX was administered concomitantly with routinely recommended 10 pediatric vaccines [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )]. 7.3 Immuno suppressive Therapies Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune response to HIBERIX . 8 USE IN SPECIFIC PO PULA TIONS 8.1 Pregnancy HIBERIX is not approved for use in individuals aged 5 years and older. No human or animal data with HIBERIX are available to assess vaccine -associated risks in pregnancy . 8.2 Lactation HIBERIX is not approved for use in individuals aged 5 years and older. No human or animal data are available to assess the impact of HIBERIX on milk production, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breastfed infant . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of HIBERIX in children younger tha n 6 weeks and in children aged 5 to 16 years have not been established. 11 DESCRIPTION HIBERIX [ Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate )] is a solution for intramuscular injection, supplied as a sterile, lyophilized powder which is recons tituted at the time of use with the [PRP]), a high molecular weight polymer prepared from the H . influenzae type b strain 20,752 grown in a s ynthetic medium that undergoes heat inactivation and purification. The tetanus toxin, prepared from Clostridium tetani grown in a semi -synthetic medium, is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified. The capsular polysaccharide is covalently bound to the te tanus toxoid. After purification, the conjugate is lyophilized in the presence of lactose as a stabilizer. The diluent for HIBERIX is a sterile saline solution (0.9% sodium supplied in vials . After reconstitution, each 0.5 -mL dose is formulated t o contain 10 mcg of purified capsular polysaccharide conjugated to approximately 25 mcg of tetanus toxoid, 12.6 mg of lactose , and 0.5 mcg of residual formaldehyde. HIBERIX does not contain a preservative. The lyophilized vaccine and saline diluent vial s toppers are not made with natural rubber latex. 11 12 CLINICAL PHARMACO LOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action H. influenzae is a gram -negative coccobacillus. Most strains of H. influenzae that cause invasive disease are type b. H. influenzae type b can cause invasive disease such as sepsis and meningitis . Specific levels of antibodies to polyribosyl -ribitol- phosphate (anti -PRP) have been shown to correlate with protection against invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b. Based on data from passive antibody studies2 and a clinical efficacy study with unconjugated Haemophilus b polysaccharide vaccine3, an anti -PRP concentration of 0.15 mcg/mL has been accepted as a minimal protective level. Data from an efficacy study with unconjugated Haemophilus b polysaccharide vac cine indicate that an anti -PRP concentration of 1.0 mcg/mL predicts protection through a t least a 1-year period.4,5 These antibody levels have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines, including HIBERIX. 13 NONCLINICAL T OXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility HIBERIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Immunological Evaluation Primary Series Vaccination (Doses 1, 2, and 3) The immunogenicity of HIBERIX was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (Study 1). HIBERIX or control vaccines were administered concomitantly with U.S.- licensed vaccines [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . rates 1 of HIBERIX , Control PRP -T (Sanofi Pasteur SA), or D TaP-IPV/Hib are presented in Table 4. 12 Table 4.

In this study, pre -vaccination sera may have been obtained up to 1 week prior to booster va ccination with HIBERIX. b Canadian study in children aged 16 to 19 months who previously received 3 doses of DTaP - IPV and HIBERIX . The booster -IPV. The DTaP -IPV dosing regimen is not approved in the U .S. c German study in children aged 16 to 23 months who previously received 3 doses of DTaP - HBV (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , not licensed in the U .S.) and HIBERIX . The booster dose of HIBERIX was coadministered with DTaP -HBV. 14.2 Concomitant Vaccine Administration Primary Series Vaccination (Doses 1, 2, and 3) In U.S. Study 1, subjects who received HIB ERIX concomitantly with PEDIARIX (DTaP -HBV- IPV) and PCV 13 at 2, 4, and 6 months of age had no evidence for reduced antibody response s relative to the response in contr ol subjects administered Control PRP -T (Sanofi with o pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and pertactin), diphtheria toxoid (antibody levels 0.1 IU/mL), tetanus toxoid (antibody levels 0.1 IU/mL), poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 (antibody levels 1:8 to each virus), PCV 13 (antibody levels 0.2 mcg/mL and GMC to each serotype) , or hepatitis B ( anti-hepatitis B surface antigen 10 mIU/mL) . The to P EDIARIX (DTaP -HBV -IPV) and PCV 13 were evaluated 1 month following Dose 3. Subjects in both groups received ROTARIX at 2 and 4 months of age. Booster Vaccination (Dose 4) In U.S. Study 1, subjects who received a booster dose of HIB ERIX concomitantly with INFANRIX at 15 to 18 months of age had no evidence for reduced antibody response s to pertussis antigens (GMC to pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and pertactin), diphtheria 16 toxoid (antibody levels 0.1 IU/mL), and tetanus toxoid (antibody levels 0.1 IU/mL) , relative to the response s in control subjects administered Control PRP -T (Sanofi Pasteur SA) concomitantly with INFANRIX . In 7 additional studies, a booster dose of HIBERIX was administered concomitantly with non- U.S. formulations of INFANRIX, K INRIX, and PEDIARIX . Non -U.S. and PEDIARIX were administered in dosing regimens not approved in the U.S. Sufficient d ata are not available to confirm lack of interference in immune responses to vaccines other than INFANRIX administer ed concomitantly with a booster dose of HIBERIX. 15 REFERENCES 1.
