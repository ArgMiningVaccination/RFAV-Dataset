This approach has yet to be evaluated in children andinfants. We assessed this vaccine strategy among 138 Gambianand Burkinabe children in four cohorts: 2- to 6-year olds inThe Gambia, 5- to 17-month-olds in Burkina Faso, and 5- to12-month-olds and 10-week-olds in The Gambia. We assessed induction of cellular immunity, taking into account the distinc- tive hematological status of young infants, and characterizedthe antibody response to vaccination. T cell responses peaked7 days after boosting with modi ed vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), with highest responses in infants aged 10 weeks atpriming.

INTRODUCTION Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective health care interven- tions available, and currently used vaccines prevent an estimated2.5 million deaths each year. 1Most vaccines are administered during infancy and protect primarily through the induction of antibodies.2,3The exception is Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), where protection appears to involve mainly CD4+T cells. However, there is a range of diseases affecting infants, for which vaccines are yet to be devel-oped, where an ability to induce potent CD8 +T cell responses could be important. These include r espiratory syncytial virus (RSV), HIV, tuberculosis, and vaccines targeting malaria parasites at the liver stageof infection. 4An extensive literature in murine immunology docu- ments frequent reductions in CD8+T cell induction in newborn mice, suggesting that generation of such T cell responses in humaninfants might be dif cult. 5-8Limited studies in infants demonstrate reduced Th1 and proliferative responses to vaccination;9-11however, data are lacking on the capacity to induce CD8+T cells in early infancy. A highly effective malaria vaccine against the most lethal malaria spe- cies, Plasmodium falciparum , could help to save half a million lives each year.12The primary target population for a vaccine is young in- fants in sub-Saharan Africa because from 6 months of age, infants and Received 31 May 2016; accepted 15 November 2016; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2016.11.003 . 8These authors contributed equally to this work. 9These author contributed equally to this work. 10Present address: Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Cookson Building, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 12Deceased Correspondence: Katie J.

This stage lasts between 5.5 and 7 days in humans,25-27thus prolonging the opportunity for antigen-speci c CD8+T cells to locate and kill infected hepatocytes. We have previously described vaccination approaches employing the sporozoite antigen thrombospondin-related adhesion protein(TRAP) fused to a multiple epitope string (ME) in a number of deliv-ery platforms including DNA and replication-de cient viral vectors. 28 Most recently, we have demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous prime-boost approach using a chimpanzee adeno-virus (ChAd63) and modi ed vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both en- coding the ME-TRAP subunit. 29-31This regimen induces cellular immunity comprising both IgGantibody responses in malaria in a further 36% of vaccinees.34Ef- cacy was strongly associated with monofunctional interferon-gamma(IFNg)-secreting CD8 +T cells. In a recent eld trial in Kenyan adults, 67% ef cacy against malaria infection was induced by the same im- munization regime, and again, a T cell vaccine ef cacy. 33 We present here a detailed evaluation of the high-level T cell and anti- body responses induced by this regimen in young children and in-fants. Infants have very different hematological parameters to olderchildren and adults: total blood volume is substantially lower andnumbers of circulating lymphocytes per ml signi cantly higher. 36 We propose an alternative approach for calculating T cell responses following vaccination, which takes account of the higher lymphocytecount in infants and young children. This methodology is especiallyrelevant when comparing cellular immunogenicity across age groups. Here, we report T cell and antibody immunogenicity across four pe- diatric age strata ranging from 6 years to 10 weeks old, from three clinical vaccine studies using the ChAd63 ME-TRAP and MVAME-TRAP regimen in malaria-exposed African children and infants.Responses are also compared to those of malaria-naive and malaria-exposed vaccinated adults. Given that each clinical trial was a smallphase I study, combining the datasets together into a single analysisfacilitates the observation of trends across age groups and between co-horts with differing malaria exposure. Two clinical trials were per-formed in the western region of The Gambia in Sukuta, where modestmalaria transmission is still observed following seasonal rains, despitea substantial decline in incidence since 2003. 37A third study was un- dertaken in Burkina Faso with highly seasonal transmission and a far greater incidence of malaria than in The Gambia, averaging morethan one con rmed clinical episode per child per year. 38,39An effec- tive malaria vaccine would be useful in both settings. RESULTS Study Design Two hundred children were screened for eligibility across the threetrials and 138 eligible children were enrolled, vaccinated, and fol- lowed up ( Figures S1 A and S1B) Trial groups are shown in Table 1 .

Notably, responses in 10-week-old Gambian infants were comparable to those in adults and higher than in Burkinabe children aged 5 -12 months and 13 -17 months ( Figure 1 A; p < 0.0001, Krus- kal-Wallis test with Dunn 's correction for multiple tests). No differ- ences were measured between responses in United Kingdom (UK)and Gambian adults (data not shown 32). Due to the observation that children under 17 months have signi cantly higher lymphocyte counts per milliliter of blood than older children and adults ( Fig- ure 1 B; p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn 's correction for multiple tests), expressing ELISpot responses using the number of pe-ripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as the denominator maynot accurately re flect immunogenicity across age groups. We there- fore express ELISpot responses as spot-forming cells (SFC) per milli- liter of blood by integrating lymphocyte counts collected duringroutine hematology tests at each time point. Using this arguablymore physiologically relevant denominator, T cell responses werecomparable between adults, children, and older infants. Furthermore,responses in 10-week-old infants were almost 3-fold higher than UKand Gambian adults ( Figure 1 C, p = 0.0017, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn 's correction for multiple tests against adult control group). No differences were measured between responses in UK and Gambianadults (data not shown). Responses remained higher in Gambian10-week-old infants compared to both Burkinabe age groups ( Fig- ure 1 C; p = 0.0007, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn 's correction for multiple tests between all pediatric groups). T Cell Responses Assessed by Flow Cytometry Flow cytometry is reported for samples from Gambian 5- to12-month-olds and Burkinabe 5- to 17-month-olds. Due to limitedPBMC availability and technical issues with the assay, older childrenand young infants were not assessed.

Antibody Responses after Vaccination Antibody responses to vaccination in Gambian 2- to 6-year-olds(group 1) were weak, irrespective of priming or boosting dose ( Fig- ure 3 A). IgG titers in Gambian and Burkinabe infants and young chil- dren (groups 2, 3, and 4) markedly increased 7 days after boostingwith MVA ( Figure 3 B). In Gambian 10-week-olds IgG ti- ters were signi cantly higher post-boost in the group that received the higher dose of ChAd63 ME-TRAP (p = 0.0008, 2-tailed Mann Whit- ney test, group 3a versus 3b), were no signi cant ef- fects of ChAd63 ME-TRAP dose in other age groups ( Figure 3 B). Re- sponses in all groups of infants and children under 2 years were verysubstantially and signi cantly higher than responses in UK and Gam- bian adults ( Figure 3 C; p = < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn 's correction for multiple tests comparing between all groups). Re-sponses in Gambian 2- to 6-year-olds (group 1) were similar inmagnitude to those in adults. IgG subtypes were also measured foreach group. IgG1 and the highest increaseabove baseline, with signi cantly higher titers in infants and young children (groups 2, 3, and 4) than older children (group 1) or adults (Figures 3 D and 3E). Titers of IgA antibodies at the peak of the im- mune response were more frequently detected in the Burkinabe in-fants, than in the Gambian groups ( Figure 3 F). IgM antibody re- sponses were low after vaccination and did not vary betweengroups (data not shown). Avidity of IgG antibodies was measured at the peak time point ( Fig- ure 4 A) and was signi cantly higher in Burkinabe infants and chil- dren when compared with Gambian 10-week-olds (p = 0.0006, Krus-kal-Wallis test with Dunn 's correction for multiple tests). A similar trend in IgG avidity was seen in Gambian 5- to 12-month-oldsFigure 2. T Cell Responses by Flow Cytometry Responses were assessed from cryopreserved PBMC forgroup 2 (5- to 12-month-olds in the Gambia, N = 8) andgroup 4 (5- to 17-month-olds in Burkina Faso, N = 12).

Children aged 2 -6 years (group 1) were not included in this analysis due to the low number of individ-uals with high enough titers to perform theassay. Differences in antibody avidity betweengroups were further studied by measuring theavidity of IgG1 and IgG3 subtypes in youngerchildren and infants (groups 2, 3, and 4; Figures 4B and 4C), which revealed that the lower IgG avidity in 10-week-olds was largely due to lower avidity of IgG1 antibodies as IgG3 avidity was comparably low across all groups of infants and children. Avidity of IgG1 antibodies was highest in Gambian infants aged 5 -12 months and signi cantly higher than that in Burkinabe infants of comparable age (Figure 4 B; p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn 's correction for multiple tests). A clear effect of age was apparent in Burkinabe5- to 17-month-olds (group 4), in which IgG1 avidity was positivelyassociated with age at rst vaccination (Spearman 's r = 0.47, p 0.02, Figure 4 D). Total IgG avidity signi cantly increased between 1 and 7 weeks post-boost in both Gambian 5- to 12-month-olds and10-week-olds (p = 0.0015 and p = 0.0010, respectively, Wilcoxon matched pairs test between time points within the same group, Fig- ure 4 E). The magnitude of the increase in avidity after boosting was the same for both age groups with the ratio of the avidity at 7 weeksto 1 week post-boost comparable for 5- to 12-month-olds and10-week-olds ( Figure 4 F). Neutralizing antibodies to the adenovirus vector were measured prior to vaccination in group 1 only and were weaker than those measuredpreviously in Gambian adults (74 ELISA units [EUs], 95% con dence interval [CI] 35 -155 in group 1 versus 192 EUs, 95% CI 104 -422). 32 Neutralizing antibody titers were not correlated with T cell or anti- body responses at the peak time point 7 days after MVA ME-TRAP vaccination ( Figures 4 G and 4H). DISCUSSION We demonstrate here that immunization of children and infants with a prime-boost regimen using ChAd63 and MVA ME-TRAP induceshigh level T cell and antibody responses to a pre-erythrocytic malariaantigen that has previously demonstrated ef cacy against CHMI in malaria naive adults and against natural infection in semi-immuneadults. 33-35Levels of TRAP-speci c T cells and IgG were highest in infants who received their priming immunization at 10 weeks of age and an MVA ME-TRAP boost 8 weeks later.Molecular Therapy 550 Molecular Therapy Vol. 25 No 0.11anti-TRAP Gambia adultsGambia 2-6y Burkina Faso 13-17mo Burkina 5-12mo Gambia 5-12mo IgA - pre-vaccination (ELISA Units)*** *** **AB C ED F Figure 3.

However, comparisons of immunogenicity in de-escalating agegroups are complex due to differences in body mass and total bloodvolume of participants receiving similar doses of vaccine. More spe-cically, variations are observed in the numbers of lymphocytes circu- lating per milliliter of blood between adults and children and betweeninfants and older children. To address this, we have incorporated thelymphocyte count from the full blood count performed at the sametime into the denominator of the units used to report ELISpot re-sponses. Using this approach to take account of the much higherlymphocyte frequencies measured in young children and infants, we have quanti ed comparable T cell responses between adults, chil- dren, and older infants. Responses in 10-week-old infants were almost3-fold higher compared with adults, indicating that ChAd63 andMVA ME-TRAP T cell immunogenicity is increased and not reducedwith administration to young infants. While T cell responses between the two sites were comparable be- tween 5- to 17month-olds, overall lower responses were measuredin Burkina Faso, potentially due to a combined effect of age anddiffering malaria exposure by site. Malaria-related immunosuppres-sion could lead to reduced vaccine immunogenicity or differences in innate immunity may exist in the early weeks of life in these chil- dren. Congruently, malaria transmission in the Gambia is markedlylower than in Burkina Faso, 37,39,41thus these effects would likely be seen in older Gambian children who have had more years of lowerlevel malaria exposure; and in younger infants in Burkina Faso wheretransmission is higher. 42,43 Higher frequencies of antigen-speci c cells per milliliter of blood traf- cking through the spleen may increase the likelihood of antigen recognition from antigen-presenting cells following vaccination, giv-ing rise to greater cellular immunity. The level of antigen-speci c T cells per milliliter is likely to correlate better with vaccine ef cacy than T cells per million PBMC, as the former should correlate betterwith the rate at which antigen-speci c T cells enter the liver, which is the relevant target organ in malaria. Anti-TRAP IgG titers at the peak time point were, remarkably, /C2420-fold higher in the youngest groups of children and infants than those at the same time point post-vaccination in malaria-naiveand semi-immune adults. Interestingly, titers in 2- to 6-year-old chil-dren were lower than those in adults and younger children or infants,which when assessed in combination with the similar observation in T cell frequencies, suggests vaccination of older children may be less effective at preventing malaria infection. A recent study with theseviral vectors expressing TRAP and circumsporozoite protein (CS)in malaria-naive adults, proposed a role for both anti-CS and anti-TRAP antibody responses in reducing parasite density during the liver-stage of malaria infection. 33This suggests that the additional component of antibody immunogenicity elicited in the youngestage groups here may improve the ef cacy of this vaccine regime to a level above that observed in adults undergoing CHMI. InRTS,S/AS01 trials a reduction of anti-CS IgG responses in a compa-rable group of 6- to 12-week-old infants compared with adultsassociated with decreased vaccine ef cacy. 44Thending that viral- vector-induced antibody levels are not decreased in this age groupis therefore very encouraging, because this is the preferred targetage group for a malaria vaccine. Avidity of antibodies measured 7 days after boosting was lower in young infants than in 5- to 12- or 5- to 17-month-olds, althoughthe kinetics of avidity maturation were comparable between the Burkinabe infants, IgG1 avidity was signi cantly lower than in Gambian infants of the same age, perhaps again dueto increased malaria exposure in Burkina Faso. Avidity of IgG anti-bodies alone has been shown not to be predictive of malaria vaccineefcacy for RTS,S/AS01, however, an association between the change in avidity, as well as IgG titers following the second and third dosewere strongly associated with a reduction in the risk of malaria. 45 This suggests that the kinetics of antibody avidity maturation as well as the magnitude of the IgG response contributes to vaccine ef- cacy. Further work to determine the potential for antibodies induced by this regime to inhibit parasite invasion using in vitro functional as-says is underway. Previous studies have demonstrated a reduction of cellular responses to vaccines in infants with reduced or defective secretion of Th1 cy-tokines in response to oral polio and protein-in-adjuvant vaccines,such as DTaP. 10,11,46Similarly, preferential differentiation of B cells into memory cells rather than plasma cells is associated with reducedIgG responses to protein and polysaccharide antigens in infants. 8,47 The preliminary observations reported here demonstrate that replica-tion-de cient viral vectors can elicit immune responses in infants that appear to be superior to those in comparable adult populations. De-livery of antigens by viral vectors may overcome the limitations of theimmature infant immune system, which have been shown to limitseroconversion to EPI vaccines. 48,49This is consistent with strong CTL following congenital infectionwith cytomegalovirus and Trypanosoma cruzi , demonstrating that under certain conditions, the immature human immune system isindeed capable of potent CTL activity. 50,51 In this study, we have assessed the ability of a virally vectored primeboost regime to induce immunity to a protective pre-erythrocytic ma-laria antigen in two populations with very different malaria endemic-ities.

Our immunogenicity ndings combined with the acceptable safety prole observed in these studies40show clear potential utility of this approach for immunization against malaria and other childhood ill-nesses where either antibodies or cellular immunity are relevant toprotection, for example RSV. 52Further studies are underway to assess optimal regimes for immunization with co-administration of WHOExpanded Program of Immunisation (EPI) vaccines and to determineefcacy against clinical and severe malaria in a cohort of infants and children in a region of high malaria transmission. MATERIALS AND METHODS Objectives The primary objective of these trials was to evaluate the safety and re-actogenicity of the ChAd63 ME-TRAP and were to evaluate the cellular and humoral immunogenicityof the vaccines in two settings of varying seasonal malaria transmissionwhile the tertiary objective was to compare the immunogenicity of thelow and high doses of MVA ME-TRAP (Gambian children only). Study Setting Therst clinical trial (group 1) took place from December 2010 to December 2011 in the Sukuta eld site of Medical Research Council, The Gambia. Sukuta is a peri-urban Gambian village located about30 km south of the capital Banjul. The Sukuta eld site previously served as the base for the phase I trials of ChAd63 MVA ME-TRAPvaccine regimen in adults (18). In this region, malaria transmission ishighly seasonal, occurring almost exclusively during the rainy season(July to December) with greatest incidence from September toNovember. Anopheles gambiae is the principal malaria vector. Previ- ous studies have documented decline in incidence of malaria in The Gambia. 37,41The second clinical trial (groups 2 and 3) took place in the same setting between September 2011 and March 2013. The third clinical trial (group 4) took place from December 2012 to September 2013 in Banfora Health District in the Cascades regionof South Western Burkina Faso, about 400 km southwest from thecapital Ouagadougou. Malaria transmission is stable during theyear, with increased levels during the rainy season from May toNovember, peaking from May to September. 38A. gambiae is the prin- cipal malaria vector. Immunogenicity analyses of group 4 are split into two age groups: 5 -12 months and 13 -17 months, permitting direct analysis of 5- to 12-month-olds in the Gambia and BurkinaFaso. Ethics and Regulatory Approval An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) was ap-pointed before the trials began to provide oversight and to review thesafety data reports as the trials progressed. Experienced local pediatri-cians served as local safety monitors (LSM) and, along with theDSMB, reviewed all safety data between dose escalations. In addition, trials were conducted according to ICH Good Clinical Practice guide-lines and were monitored by an external organization (Appledown Clinical Research). The Gambian Government/Medical Research Council Joint Ethics Committee, The Gambia Medicines Board, theBurkina Faso Ministry of Health and Institutional Bioethics Commit-tee, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority,and Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTRECNumbers: 64-09, 26-11, 41-12) granted approval of the study proto-col. three trials were registered with https://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01373879, NCT01450293, PACTR201401000363170, PACTR201208000404131). Study Design We conducted three phase Ib studies. The rst study (group 1, aged 2-6 years) in The Gambia was the pediatric arm of a phase Ib sin- gle-blind, randomized controlled, dose-escalation study in adultsthat has been reported previously. 31,32The second study, also in The Gambia, was a subsequent single-blind randomized controlled,dose-escalation study in children aged 5 -12 months (group 2) and 10 weeks (group 3) at vaccination with ChAd63 ME-TRAP. The third study was a phase I open-label safety lead-in group of a larger phaseIIb study in Burkina Faso in children aged 5 -17 months at rst vacci- nation (group 4). CONSORT diagrams are provided in the Supple- mental Information . Protocol S1 (group 1, The Gambia), protocol S2 (groups 2 and 3, The Gambia), protocol S3 (group 4, BurkinaFaso), and checklists S1 -S3 are given in the supplemental information of the paper reporting the clinical outcomes of these studies. 40All vac- cinations were intramuscular with group 1 receiving doses in the del-toid region of the arm, while all other groups were vaccinated in theanterolateral thigh. A control group was added to group 1 because ofthe anticipated high frequency of concurrent diseases in the study age group of 2 -6 years and also to aid objective assessment of the relation- ship of adverse events to vaccination. Human diploid cell rabies vac-cine (HDCRV) (Sano Pasteur MSD) was chosen as the comparator vaccine because rabies is endemic in The Gambia and anti-rabies vac-cines were not readily accessible for pre-exposure prophylaxis; hence,the investigators deemed that giving HDCRV might bene t the study participants. In groups 2 and 3, no-treatment controls were included,but there was no control group in group 4 as the subsequent largerphase II study had a rabies vaccine control arm. For group 1,36 eligible children were randomized to receive either group 1a: lowdose ChAd63 PFU]); group 1b: low ME-TRAP /C21010vp) MVA 1e: high MVA ME-TRAP (2 /C2108PFU); group 1f: Control HDCRV 1 mL followed by HDCRV 1 mL intramuscular (IM). Allvaccinations were separated by an 8-week interval. For groups 2 and 3, 36 eligible children in each group were ran- domized to receive either group a: low dose ChAd63 ME-TRAPMolecular Therapy 554 Molecular Therapy Vol. 25 No 2 February 2017(1/C21010vp) followed by low dose MVA ME-TRAP (1 /C2108PFU); group b: high dose low dose MVA ME-TRAP (1 /C2108PFU); group c: no vaccine. For group 4, all children received high dose ChAd63 ME-TRAP (5 /C21010vp) followed by low dose MVA ME-TRAP (1 /C2108PFU). Pediatric groups are compared to malaria naive adult vaccinees in the UK and semi-immune adult vaccinees the Gambia, who all received5/C210 and 2 /C2108PFU MVA ME-TRAP. Randomization in Groups 1, 2, and 3 and Blinding An independent statistician at the Centre for Statistics in Medicine,Oxford performed a strati ed randomization of participants (strati- ed by age into two categories and split by the median values of ages of children recruited). The list of eligible children after screening was sent to the statistician who carried out the randomization. The statistician had no knowledge of the participants, except the age, asthis was required for the strati cation. The children were randomly allocated to six groups in dose-escalated fashion. This was done todetermine the tolerable doses as this was the rst time ChAd63 and MVA ME-TRAP vaccines were being administered in Gambian chil-dren. The investigators and the vaccinators were un-blinded to thegroup allocations. However, the study children 's parents/carers andeld workers who conducted post-vaccination assessment of re- actogenicity and solicited symptoms were blinded to the groupallocations. Sample Size These phase Ib trials were not powered to detect differences betweengroups. The sample size was based on general acceptance of this sizefor initial assessment of safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the investigational vaccines in a malaria endemic area and this size balances the need to avoid exposing a large group of study partici-pants to an unknown risk with the need for useful safety and immu-nogenicity data from an adequate sample size. Interventions The Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility (CBF; University of Oxford,UK) and IDT (Germany) manufactured ChAd63 ME-TRAP andMVA ME-TRAP respectively under Good Manufacturing Practiceconditions, respectively as previously described. 34 Blood Processing Blood samples were stored at room temperature prior to processing,which was completed within 6 hr of venepuncture. PBMC were sepa-rated by density centrifugation from International), 1% 1% peni-cillin/streptomycin. Cell counts were performed using trypan bluestaining and a microscope according to an established standard oper- ating procedure (SOP) in the lab.Ex Multiscreen ELISpot containing 10%heat-inactivated, sterile- ltered fetal calf serum, supplemented with 1%L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Antigens were tested in duplicate with either 200,000 or 250,000 PBMC added to each well of the ELISpot plate. TRAP peptides were 20 amino acids inlength, overlapping by 10 amino acids (NeoBioLab), assayed in sixpools of seven to ten peptides at 10 mg/mL. Plates were counted using an AID automated ELISpot counter (AID Diagnostika GmbH, algo-rithm C), using identical settings for all plates, and counts wereadjusted only to remove artifacts. Responses were averaged acrossduplicate wells, responses in unstimulated (negative control) wellswere subtracted from each individual pool, then responses to individ-ual pools were summed for each strain of the TRAP antigen. Re-sponses to the negative control were always <142 SFC/10 6PBMC, with a median of 18 SFC/106PBMC. Pools were considered positive if the response was greater than the median plus 2 SDs (59 SFC/106) of all negative control wells after subtraction of the autologous back-ground. The lower limit of detection for the assay was 28 SFC forME-TRAP. phyto- hemmagglutinin-L (10 mg/mL) were used as a positive control, whereby responses of >800 SFC/10 6passed quality control (QC). Re- agents and methods were standardized between the two trial sites.Lymphocyte counts per milliliter of blood were taken directly fromthe hematology breakdown or calculated by multiplying the numberof white blood cells per milliliter of blood by the lymphocyte differen- tial percentage. These data were routinely obtained at post-vaccina- tion time points as part of the safety assessments. This value wasthen multiplied by the number of SFC per million PBMC to producethe per of were frozen in FBS containing 10% DMSO and stored in thevapor phase of liquid nitrogen. Of the 30 PBMC samples available ingroup 4, we selected samples where the ELISpot on fresh PBMC at daygave a response over 250 SFC per million PBMC, as responses lowerthan this would not be detectable by flow cytometry. Thawing was performed rapidly in a water bath and cells were rested for 2 hr with benzonase at 25 U/10 6PBMC (Novagen) before stimu- lation CO 2, either with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, a pool of 56 peptides at 2 mg/mL spanning the entire length of the TRAP protein from the T9/96 strain of P. falciparum (Neopeptide) or an and monensin (eBioscience) 1 mg/mL were added af- ter 2 hr into the incubation and left to incubate for a further 16 hr.Cells were then washed in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]and 0.01% viability with LIVE/DEAD aqua amine reactive dye (Life Technologies) for 20 min at roomwww.moleculartherapy.org Molecular Therapy Vol. 25 No 2 February 2017 555temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed in FACS buffer and permeabilized for 20 min with Cyto x/Cytoperm Biosciences) then washed in 1:10 permeabilization buffer cocktail of antibodies for surface and intracellular staining wasadded and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.The antibody cocktail is described in Table S2 . Cells were again washed in permeabilization buffer and resuspended in PBS contain-ing 1% paraformaldehyde, prior to acquisition on a BD were stained the manufacturer 's instructions using the same concentra- tion of antibody used for cells to for compensation between parame- ters, and unstained cells were used to adjust forward and side scatter photo-multiplier tube voltages. Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data At least 29,000 live CD3+cells were analyzed per sample. Data were prepared and analyzed using FlowJo v9.6.2 (Treestar) with a hierarchi-cal gating strategy. A sample strategy is shown in Figure S2 . Re- sponses to peptide were determined after subtraction of the response inthe unstimulated control for each sample. Samples where a response tothe positive control of >1% cytokine positive CD4 +or CD8+T cells af- ter subtraction of the unstimulated control could not be detected were excluded from the analysis. All samples had a minimum of 31,000CD4 +or 8,000 CD8+T cells in the parent population, thus the lower limit of detection for the assay was 0.0042% for CD4+T cells and 0.022% for CD8+T cells. A response was classi ed as positive if the response to peptide was greater than the medium control for the cor-responding sample. Analysis of polyfunctionality was not undertakendue to low event numbers acquired from small pediatric samples. Anti-vector Neutralizing Antibody Assay One day prior to performing the assay, GripTite 293 cells (Invitrogen)were seeded in 96-well plates Heat inactivated test samples 7vp/mL) for 1 hr at 37/C14C. Serum and virus were then added to 293 cells in a volume of 200 mL in duplicate for 1 hr, after which sample and virus were aspirated and replaced withfresh 10% FB DMEM. A virus-only control was included. After22-26 hr at 37 /C14C, 50 mL of medium was assayed for SEAP activity us- ing a Phospha-Light TROPIX (Applied Bio-systems) in black assay plates, and luminescence was measured after 45 min on a Thermo-Fisher Varioskan Flash Luminometer. Anti-vec- tor neutralization titers were de ned as the dilution of serum showing 50% reduction in SEAP activity, based on observed % inhibitionvalues relative to SEAP activity from virus alone. For trial A, anti-vec-tor antibodies were measured in serum and for trial B plasma wasused, however, we have determined that these sample types are equiv-alent for this assay. TRAP-Specic Total IgG ELISA Standardized ELISAs for TRAP-speci c antibodies were conducted as previously described35. Brie fly, a reference standard of pooledanti-TRAP antibody positive serum was serially diluted to produce a standard curve, which was included on all plates. The standard sam- ple was assigned a value in arbitrary ELISA units (EUs). The standardcurve was then used to convert absorbance values of individual testsera (diluted to fall within the linear range of the curve) into EUs.A\"seropositive cut-off \"value was calculated using the mean plus three standard deviations of the EU values of 42 serum samplesfrom unvaccinated UK volunteers. For the total IgG standardizedELISA, this cut-off value was 88 EUs. TRAP-Specic Isotype ELISA Isotype ELISAs were conducted as previously described53except plates were coated with 0.5 mg/mL of TRAP antigen in carbon- ate-bicarbonate coating buffer and left overnight at 4/C14C. Brie fly, sera were diluted 1:100 in 0.2% BSA in PBS/Tween-20 (dilutionbuffer) and added in duplicate to each of six 96-well plates. After2 hr, plates were washed and one of six secondary antibodies wasadded to each plate at 1:1,000 in dilution buffer, 50 mL per well. Secondary IgM (Sigma). ExtrAvidin alkaline phosphatase (Sigma)diluted dilution buffer added to all plates (exceptIgA, to which only dilution buffer was added). After 30 min, allplates were washed and development buffer was added as for totalIgG ELISA. Blank wells and internal development controls wereincluded on each plate. A\"seropositive cut-off \"value was calculated for each isotype or sub- class using the mean plus 3 SDs of the EU values of 42 serum samplesfrom unvaccinated UK sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN)-displacement ELISA. The assays were conducted as for total IgG ELISAs except that sera were individually diluted in dilution buffer to a level calculated to reach an OD405 of 1.0 (using total IgG EUs)and plated at 50 mL/well in 16 wells of a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature (RT) before chaotropic agentNaSCN was added in duplicate at increasing concentrations down theplate (0 -7 Molar [M]). Plates were incubated for 15 min at RT before washing, incubation with secondary antibody and development as forthe total IgG assay. The concentration of NaSCN required to reducethe OD405 to 50% of that without NaSCN ( = IC 50) was used as a measure of avidity. This was calculated from the intercept of the curvefor each sample with the line of 50% reduction of the OD405 in the NaSCN-free well for each sample.Molecular Therapy 556 Molecular Therapy Vol. 25 No 2 February 2017IgG1 and IgG3 avidity was assessed using the same protocol, except that two dilutions were made for each sample to levels calculated to reach an OD405 of 1.0 (using the OD values from the IgG1 andIgG3 ELISAs) and added to two plates, one of which was incubatedwith anti-IgG1 and the other with anti-IgG3. Secondary antibodiesused were the same as used for the Isotype ELISAs. Statistical Methods Group data display geometric mean or median. Matched pairs ana-lyses were conducted where time points within a group werecompared and excludes volunteers with missing data at any time point. UK and Gambian adult data were combined for several ELISpot and ELISA analyses due to no statistically signi cant differ- ences between the two populations. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used tocompare ELISpot and ELISA data in children against the adult controlgroup, with Dunn 's multiple comparisons post-test. Kruskal-Wallis tests for comparisons between all groups were also used, with Dunn 's multiple comparisons post-test. For statistical analyses, an alpha-levelof 0.05 was considered signi cant and all p values are two-tailed. All analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism, Mac version 6.(GraphPad Software).
