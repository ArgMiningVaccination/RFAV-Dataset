Smith, Mary L. Chavez, Micheline Goldwire, A. Coon, Rena Gosser,Anne L. Hume, Megan Musselman, Jennifer Phillips, and Andrew M. Abe, American College of Clinical Pharmacy The American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) published an initial white paper on herbal prod- ucts in 2000. Since then, the global market for natural products has continued to expand, with tens of millions of consumers using such products on an annual basis in the United States alone. However, despite this expansion, natural products remain largely unregulated compared with prescription medi- cations, have moderate- to low-level clinical evidence for efficacy, and continue to have safety con- cerns, including adulteration and misbranding. As comprehensive medication management experts, clinical pharmacists are uniquely qualified to navigate these concerns and advise patients appropri- ately. To develop and recommend a suitable care plan involving natural products, clinical pharmacists must establish a strong pharmacist-patient relationship, assess the appropriateness of therapy, educate the patient regarding key issues, and continuously monitor and follow up on the effectiveness of the care plan. This process should not only occur in an individual community or hospital setting, but also whenever a patient transitions from one care setting to another in cooperation with other clinicians. KEYWORDS natural products, herbal products, botanicals, supplements, alternative, complementary. (Pharmacotherapy 2017;37(1):e1-e15) doi: 10.1002/phar.1874 The U.S. market for natural products contin- ues to expand, even though the clinical evidence to support the effective and safe use of many of these products is still limited. In 2000, the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) published a white paper on herbal products thatrecognized the emerging role of natural products as a common self-care therapy among patients and the need for pharmacists to actively embrace the responsibility for educating individuals on their appropriate use.1The current white paper on natural products replaces the 2000 document and discusses regulatory issues, provides a brief overview of the efficacy and safety evidence regarding natural products, reviews contempo- rary natural product resources, and provides rec- ommendations for the clinical pharmacist on how to incorporate natural products into medi- cation histories and medication reconciliation, transitions of care, and discharge planning. In addition, this paper recommends a process for clinical pharmacists with respect to educating patients specifically on the use of natural prod- ucts. The scope of this paper is limited to a dis- cussion of natural products and does not include homeopathy, traditional Chinese medi- cine, medical marijuana, or caffeine supplement products. According to the National Center for Comple- mentary and Integrative Health, the term natural products includes a diverse group of substancesThis document was prepared by the 2016 Publications Committee: Michael Andrew M.

Many natural products are widely available and marketed to consumers as dietary supplements. A dietary supplement is defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a product intended for ingestion that contains a dietary ingredient intended to add further nutritional value to the diet.3Patients and clinicians may use a variety of other terminology interchange- ably when discussing natural products, including herbals, botanicals, supplements, alternative, and complementary. Consumers continue to embrace natural prod- ucts. It is estimated that they will spend $115 billion on herbal supplements globally by 2020.4 In 2014, consumers spent around $6.4 billion on herbal supplements in the United States.5 This represents a 6.8% increase over 2013 and the 11th consecutive year of increased market growth. However, although sales of natural products have increased steadily, results from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) indicate that the percentage of individuals who have ever taken a natural product actually decreased from 2002 (25.1%) to 2012 (23.6%), with an estimated 40 million adults stating they had used a natural product in the past 12 months.6Further analysis of the NHIS data reveals that factors associated with natural pro- duct use include being 45 -64 years of age, being uninsured, being of the female sex, having a higher education, living in the western part of the United States, using over-the-counter medi- cations, and choosing \"non-Hispanic other\" as race.7In addition, a survey of practices at 29 centers for integrative medicine affiliated with a hospital, health care system, and/or medical or nursing school revealed that natural products are commonly recommended by clinicians for various chronic and acute conditions.8More than 20 centers reported using natural products to treat allergies, arthritis, chronic pain, depres- sion, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, head- ache, and stress. Regulation The FDA regulates many natural products through a set of regulations separate from those used for conventional medications.9Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of1994 (DSHEA), manufacturers and distributors are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded, whereas the FDA is responsible for enforcement actions against any product that is already marketed and found to be adulterated or misbranded.9, 10Clinical phar- macists should be aware of federal regulatory issues and advise patients regarding the follow- ing, if needed11: DSHEA requires that all natural products classified as dietary supplements be labeled with either the term dietary supplement or a similar term (e.g., herbal supplement or iron supplement). Dietary supplements do not require FDA approval and are not required to be proven effective or safe before marketing, which is in contrast to the approval process for con- ventional medications. For most labeling claims of dietary supple- ments, federal law does not require the man- ufacturer or distributor to prove to the FDA that the claim is accurate before marketing the product. Marketing of a dietary supplement for the treatment or cure of a disease, or to specifi- cally alleviate the symptoms of a disease, is illegal (e.g., a dietary supplement label may not state that it \"cures diabetes,\" but it may state that the product \"positively affects blood glucose levels\"). Once a dietary supplement is available for purchase to consumers, the FDA monitors mandatory reporting of serious adverse events potentially related to the use of these products by manufacturers or distributors as well as voluntary adverse event reporting by consumers and clinicians. In addition, the FDA may review package inserts, product labels, and other material as resources per- mit to ensure that misbranding does not occur. Unlike the evaluating of claims made within the product labeling, evaluating the integrity of claims made in dietary supplement advertising (print and broadcast ads, infomercials, and direct marketing materials) does not fall to the FDA but to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), although both agencies work closely to ensure the consistency of enforcement efforts.11, 12Application of FTC law to dietary supplement advertising may basically be summa- rized in two statements. First, all advertising related to the product must be truthful and note2 PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 37, Number 1, 2017misleading.12Second, advertisers must have ade- quate data (competent and reliable scientific evi- dence) to substantiate all objective product claims before an advertisement is disseminated for that product. When evaluating the health claims of these products within advertising, the FTC initially identifies all express and implied claims and then evaluates the scientific evidence to determine whether the data provide adequate support for the claim. The FTC gives great def- erence to an FDA determination of whether there is adequate support for a health claim, and usually, both agencies arrive at similar conclu- sions when assessing unqualified health claims. Although natural products are not regulated like conventional medications, many such prod- ucts do follow current good manufacturing prac- tices (CGMPs) and may be taken safely by patients. In 2007, the FDA announced a final rule that established regulations requiring CGMPs for dietary supplements, including ensuring quality throughout the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and storing processes.13 This rule also discusses requirements for quality control procedures, design and construction of manufacturing facilities, recordkeeping, handling of consumer complaints, and testing of ingredi- ents and final products. The goal of this rule is to establish CGMPs industry-wide to ensure that dietary supplements are manufactured consis- tently with respect to identity, purity, strength, and composition. In addition, independent orga- nizations analyze the quality of natural products that are voluntarily submitted. These include theUnited States Pharmacopoeia (USP) and the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). United States Pharmacopeia -verified products are evalu- ated to ensure that what is stated in the label is what is in the bottle in the declared potency and amounts, that the product does not contain harmful levels of certain contaminants, that the product will be metabolized and eliminated from the body within a specified time, and that it is manufactured according to the FDA's CGMPs.14 The NSF certification process includes a toxicol- ogy and label review to verify product formula- tion and labeling claims, a formulation review that ensures that what is on the product label is actually in the product, contaminant testing, and a CGMP facility inspection.15Because of issues related to efficacy and safety as discussed in the text that follows, clinical pharmacists should recommend USP-verified or NSF-certified prod- ucts to patients, whenever possible.16 Beyond the federal level, some states also regulate aspects of natural products. For exam- ple, California has specific regulations that require warnings on dietary supplements that contain stimulant laxative ingredients (e.g., senna, cascara sagrada, aloe latex, rhubarb root).17Clinical pharmacists should be aware of applicable regulations within their state of practice, many of which may be identified through state Department of Public Health (or equivalent agency) websites.

The 10 most commonly used natural products among adults in 2012 were fish oil/omega-3 have a mixed quality of RCT evi- dence. The quantity of trials available for these products allows for characterizing the evidence available through systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses; however, clinicians must take great care when evaluating systematic reviews and meta-analyses to ensure that appropriate methodology is used and limitations are commu- nicated. Efficacy studies involving natural products are generally not as robust and rigorous as those required for prescription medications. These studies are further complicated by the fact that a natural product may not have the same consistent ingredients and quality among manufactur- ers.20, 21A Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement published in 2006 provides a checklist of items necessary when reporting RCTs of herbal interventions.22The checklist describes items commonly seen in RCTs for prescription medications; however, it also rec- ommends a qualitative and quantitative descrip- tion of natural product ingredients. Despite this recommendation, many trials may not conduct or adequately describe quantitative analyses for the natural product under examination.20In addition, the CONSORT statement is a recommendation, not a rule; therefore, researchers are not required to abide by its conventions. More compelling and robust trials on the efficacy of natural products are needed to better inform natural product use for patient care, and clinical pharmacists are encouraged to engage in research efforts to add to the body of clinical evidence regarding the effi- cacy of these products.Safety Historically, one of the main concerns regard- ing the safety of natural products was a lack of standardization and quality measures before marketing. Moreover, despite many reports of contamination and product substitution (i.e., an ingredient in the bottle different from what is on the label), this problem is ongoing.23In 2001, an Office of Inspector General report on dietary supplement adverse events found that 77% of products reported to the FDA lacked actual labels, and ingredients could not be determined for 32% of products.24In addition, adulteration, contamination, misidentification, and substitu- tion of natural product constituents may occur. Published adverse events involving natural prod- ucts are often in the form of case reports that include incomplete medical histories or lack product identification, which makes interpreting the actual adverse events secondary to the natu- ral product suspect. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System contains information on the adverse events and drug error reports submitted to the FDA.25In 2013, the FDA received greater than 3000 adverse event reports related to dietary supple- ments, which resulted in hospitalizations, life- threatening illnesses, mortality, or other serious adverse events. This was 4 times the number of adverse event reports received in 2008. Accord- ing to nationally representative surveillance data of U.S. visits to 63 emergency departments (EDs) from 2004 to 2013, an estimated 23,000 visits and 2000 hospitalizations occur annually secondary to adverse events related to dietary supplements.26Of the actual visits to EDs, 58.3% were female, and 28% involved young adults 20 -34 years of age. Products most often implicated were for weight loss (25.5%), energy (10%), and sexual enhancement (3.4%). The most commonly reported adverse events were cardiac (palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia). For patients 65 and older, choking or supple- ment-induced swallowing difficulty accounted for 37.6% of ED visits. Although cardiac symp- toms predominated in the aforementioned study, other types of harm may occur. One such harm that is becoming increasingly apparent is liver toxicity. Increased marketing, lack of standard- ization, contamination, inappropriate use, and drug interactions are all likely causes of increased reporting of liver toxicity.27-29Overall, adverse events related to natural products are dramatically underreported.25The many barrierse4 PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 37, Number 1, 2017to adequate reporting of adverse events include lack of knowledge in how and where to report adverse events, fear of legal ramifications, uncer- tainty about causality, lack of time or incentive for reporting, and complacency. However, clini- cal pharmacists should strive to report adverse events related to the use of natural products using MedWatch or Natural MedWatch Another major safety concern with using natu- ral products is the potential for interactions with other medications. Research on natural product - drug interactions is often based on hypothetical possibilities because most published data involve in vitro and/or animal studies.30In addition, marketed natural products may include a mix- ture of bioactive ingredients with varying potency and purity, which can make it difficult to concretely identify the cause of an interac- tion.31Similar to conventional medications, nat- ural product -drug interactions have two main mechanisms \u2014pharmacokinetic and pharmacody- namic. However, in contrast to most conven- tional medications, the exact mechanisms of natural product -drug interactions are not fully understood. The mechanism behind the bulk of known natural product -drug interactions involves oxidative metabolism by the CYP sys- tem (more than 78 dietary supplements poten- tially interact with this system) or effects on theP-glycoprotein drug transporter.31Natural prod- ucts that contain hydrocolloidal fibers, gums, and mucilage may impair the absorption of med- ications, and others can inhibit renal tubular uptake, thus affecting drug clearance. Pharmaco- dynamic natural product -drug interactions are less well studied; however, additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects have been observed. For example, the sedative effects of benzodiazepines are enhanced by concurrent valerian use, and the hepatotoxic effects of prolonged high aceta- minophen doses may be increased with con- comitant administration of comfrey.31Because of the lack of quality published data, clinical phar- macists may find educating patients on natural product -drug interactions difficult. Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety When evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of an individual natural product to make patient care decisions, clinical pharmacists may initially consider using a straightforward benefit-risk method, as depicted in Figure 1.32This method compares the current efficacy and safety of a natural product in four categories. Natural prod- ucts with no efficacy and great risk should be avoided, or use discouraged, whereas those with great efficacy and low risk may potentially be Figure 1.

Contemporary Natural Product Resources Many online databases and websites are avail- able for both patients and clinicians that provide evidence-based information on using natural products. Table 2 contains a list of databases and corresponding websites that provide infor- mation on natural products, including a descrip- tion of the type of information provided, whether it is free or requires a subscription, whether it is referenced, and how often informa- tion is updated. In addition, print resources are available. However, online databases and web- sites are generally considered more current than print resources. When recommending online resources to patients, clinical pharmacists should encourage patients to evaluate the quality of the informa- tion to ensure that it is current, accurate, and reliable. The National Library of Medicine has a tutorial on MedlinePlus that patients can use to evaluate the health information they find on the Internet. This may be a useful tool for clinical pharmacists to recommend to some patients.33 In addition, when discussing online resources with patients who are interested in natural prod- ucts, clinical pharmacists should caution individ- uals that some sites may be misleading and potentially dangerous. For example, patients should be wary of websites touting their prod- ucts as \"miraculous cures\" or \"breakthroughs\" that can replace \"dangerous prescription drugs\" for chronic diseases. Terminology such as detox- ify and similarly impressive-sounding words should raise concerns, as should statements that the product is \"an ancient, all-natural remedy that pharmaceutical companies and the govern- ment have been suppressing.\" Although some natural products may have efficacy, a clear risk of quackery also exists as companies promote potentially useless or even dangerous products. Natural Products: Clinical Pharmacists and Patient Care Patient-Centered Approach Clinical pharmacists are medication use experts who are readily accessible members of the health care team. As a result, pharmacists are uniquely qualified and positioned to advise patients on the use of all medications, including naturalproducts.34The crucial first step in the clinical pharmacist's patient care process is establishing the pharmacist-patient relationship, which allows open communication with the patient, family, and caregiver. Knowledge of patient experiences and expectations is fundamental to providing patient- centered care. The clinical pharmacist should understand the patient's health care circum- stances and preferences. Patients need to be com- fortable discussing behaviors, concerns, preferences, health beliefs, and goals with their pharmacist, particularly with respect to natural product use. Clinical pharmacists can empower patients by providing them with the knowledge to make shared rational decisions. Involving patients in health care decisions will help them feel more involved and in control of their care. Clinical pharmacists walk a fine line when discussing the use of natural products with patients. Many patients who actively use natural products do so secondary to strong beliefs that they are helping their current ailment, that the product is their only option because conven- tional therapy has failed, or that the product provides overall health promotion. However, some patients are hesitant to use such products because of their belief that these products are unorthodox and not part of traditional medicine or because of concerns regarding product effi- cacy or safety. Therefore, when discussing these products, clinical pharmacists should take a proactive, nonjudgmental approach and focus on shared decision-making between the patient, the pharmacist, and other health care providers. As part of this nonjudgmental method, phar- macists should avoid the use of product labels such as \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" when engaging patients in a discussion about natural products because patients may perceive these labels as biased toward \"conventional\" therapies.35 As t e p - b y - s t e pa p p r o a c hi sr e c o m m e n d e dt h a t focuses on patient safety, extensive patient involvement in the decision-making process, and thorough documentation of the plan and associ- ated goals.36The main goal of the discussion should be to help patients make informed deci- sions by providing them with objective informa- tion about the natural product. This information should include an assessment of the validity of the claims made about the natural product as well as the available evidence regarding its safety.37Open, respectful communication between the clinical pharmacist and the patient will develop trust and allow patients to be moree6 PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 37, Number 1, 2017Table 2.

Regardless of the patient's decision with respect to natural prod- ucts, it is imperative that the clinical pharmacist keep timely documentation of the medication therapy plan and continue to be supportive of the patient. Patient Assessment The ACCP Standards of Practice for Clinical Pharmacists provide a framework for delivering comprehensive medication management and related care that can be applied to the natural product arena.38The standards recommend that the clinical pharmacist assess the patient's medi- cation-related needs by: Reviewing the medical record using a prob- lem-oriented framework (e.g., interpreting and analyzing subjective and objective infor- mation) to determine the patient's clinical status; Meeting with the patient/caregivers to obtain and document a complete history to identify all of the patient's current medications (in- cluding regimens and administration routes for any prescription or nonprescription drugs, vaccines, or natural products), medi- cation-taking behaviors, adherence, allergies, and attitudes and experiences with therapies; Obtaining, organizing, and interpreting patient data; and Prioritizing patient problems and medica- tion-related needs. For patients using natural products, clinical pharmacists should determine the appropriate- ness and safety of the product and ascertain whether conventional medication or another nat- ural product would be more appropriate. Clinical pharmacists should also review the patient's drug regimen and disease states to eliminate product duplications or products that do not provide ther- apeutic benefit. Moreover, they should caution against using natural products when assessing patients who are pregnant, immunosuppressed, or being treated for cancer. Allergies must be carefully reviewed because many natural products produce cross-reactivity to other natural products (e.g., similar plant species, pollen).1 Patient Education Clinical pharmacists delivering direct patient care are well positioned to integrate a consistentTable 2 (continued) Database Description Free/Subscription Updates RxList.com -Vitamins, Herbs, and Dietary SupplementsPublisher: RxList Incorporated Content: Monographs contain indications and evidence for use, how the drug works, safety concerns, drug interactions, and dosing considerations Advantages: Comprehensive list of agents.

Available data indicate that pharmacists are more objectively knowledgeable about natural products relative to other clinicians and health food store representatives.39, 40However, phar- macists' self-perceived preparedness and basic knowledge about natural products remains low, despite regular questions from patients. This deficiency is exacerbated by a poorly defined role, barriers to effective communication, and missed opportunities for patient engagement and education.41, 42 Initiating the conversation about natural prod- ucts with patients can be challenging for clinical pharmacists. Eisenberg suggests that all clinicians begin conversations about natural products by connecting the use of a natural product with a patient's chief concern.36Skillfulness in this approach requires pharmacists to have adequate general knowledge about natural products so that targeted questions can ease patients into a diffi- cult conversation. An example of a targeted ques- tion would be: \"Some people have used saw palmetto for problems urinating. Have you used or thought about using a natural product for symptom relief?\" Although many patients use nat- ural products complementary to conventional therapies (vs alternative to conventional thera- pies), there is still concern that patients may self- treat in place of seeking out medical care.34, 35 Clinical pharmacists in a community setting, in particular, where natural products are often sold, have the unique opportunity to affect patient care at the point of sale, which may hasten assessment or referral for a patient's unmet medical need. Similar to how clinical pharmacists first engage in a discussion about natural products, the information collected merits consideration and tact. Recognizing also that pharmacists often have significant time constraints, the data col- lected must be prioritized to maximize patient safety. If patients are taking natural products for a specific indication, this should be clarified during the discussion. Ideally, after the principal symptom is identified, patients should be edu- cated on how to track progress using a symptom diary. Within this diary, patients should keep a daily and objective record of natural product use, especially when reported safety and efficacy data are sparse.35, 36Other important considera- tions are patient preferences and expectations (i.e., symptom relief vs curative properties) for natural products. At every opportunity, clinical pharmacists should discuss the risks, benefits, andcost-effectiveness of natural products in the con- text of evidence-based therapies and applicable alternatives. Patients using natural products for general health improvement (i.e., not for a speci- fic indication) must also be educated on the per- tinent risks and costs. In addition, even when safety and efficacy are well defined for a particu- lar natural product, variability in manufacturing creates opportunities to educate patients on the risk of adulterated and misbranded products (e.g., impurities or products containing FDA- banned substances). Patients stabilized on a combination regimen of a natural product with any conventional med- ication (nonprescription or prescription) should be informed not to suddenly discontinue the use of either without consulting their prescriber or pharmacist. The potential for adverse events from a drug interaction may result when a natu- ral product is discontinued or initiated.34An adverse event may also occur when the dose of either product is changed without consulting the prescriber. Given the widespread and indiscrimi- nate use of natural products, pharmacists have a professional obligation to detect and prevent drug interactions and adverse events between natural products and conventional medication. Monitoring and Follow-up The clinical pharmacist should also monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the care plan involving the natural product. The clinical phar- macist's patient care process includes continuous monitoring and evaluation for appropriateness, effectiveness, safety, patient adherence, and patient feedback.43Clinical end points should be established that contribute to the patient's overall health. In a recent survey, Canadian stakeholders, including consumer groups, con- ventional and alternative medicine practitioners, and natural product industry groups and phar- macy leaders, expressed a consensus that it is the pharmacist's responsibility to monitor the safety of natural products.44This survey was small, but it reinforces the pharmacist's impor- tant role in therapy monitoring. Unfortunately, ensuring the safety and efficacy of natural prod- ucts is difficult, given the paucity of reliable and reproducible data on natural products. Out- comes of care, including how the patient is pro- gressing toward, or has achieved, the goals of natural product therapy, must be evaluated. When enough data are available, clinical phar- macists should also share this information,WHITE PAPER ON NATURAL PRODUCTS Gabay et al e13including monitoring strategies, timelines for intended or unintended outcomes, and patient satisfaction. Care Transitions/Discharge Planning The clinician's acknowledgment of natural pro- duct use should not end after an accurate medica- tion history has been obtained but should be integrated into the patient's individualized treat- ment plan. The clinical pharmacist should com- plete a thorough evaluation of natural products to optimize medication therapy and reduce the pos- sibility of natural product -drug interactions and natural product -disease interactions.38, 45A patient-centered approach is vital during all points of transition of care. The clinical pharma- cist should evaluate each natural product to deter- mine whether it is clinically appropriate to continue, suspend, or discontinue. If natural products are unfamiliar, a literature review of the patient's medications and possible interactions should be completed. All products should be eval- uated for their evidence of benefit or harm, cost, and appropriateness, depending on the patient's clinical condition.38If natural products are deemed to be suspended or discontinued because of lack of evidence supporting their use during hospitalization, it is important to develop a plan to taper or discontinue them, depending on their pharmacologic properties. For example, if a patient has been using exogenous hormones, it may be necessary to complete a testosterone taper with repeated laboratory tests. It is important to ensure that an open dialogue exists between health care providers and the patient that is nei- ther negative nor dismissive. The discharge process is a crucial step to ensure that the patient and all members of the health care team are in agreement with the med- ication regimen, including natural products, on discharge. The clinical pharmacist should openly and effectively communicate with patients and their outside health care providers regarding the optimized treatment plan. The plan should include the medications and/or natural products being discontinued at discharge and the medica- tions and/or natural products being added. More specific discussion should describe the indica- tion of the medications and/or natural products, goal of the therapeutic regimen, and possible adverse reactions.37If, at the time of discharge, it is decided to discontinue a natural product, the clinical pharmacist and patient should dis- cuss the reasoning, including the availableefficacy and safety evidence, for no longer using the product. Likewise, if a natural product is ini- tiated, the patient should be educated on pro- duct selection (i.e., a USP- or NSF-certified product), dosing, administration, and adverse effects, and patient follow-up and monitoring should be coordinated with outside providers. Clinical pharmacists should document the addi- tion of this natural product to the medication plan of care in the medical record, and a copy should be provided to the patient and the patient's outside providers, including pharma- cies. Documentation should include the specific medication therapy plan (e.g., dose, route, fre- quency, and relevant monitoring parameters), a detailed synopsis of the education provided to the patient regarding the medication therapy plan, and a collaborative plan for evaluating and monitoring the new regimen, including follow- up and future visits.38 Summary Natural products are widely used by patients, despite limited high-quality efficacy and safety data to support their use. Clinical pharmacists can play a key role in educating patients on effi- cacy and safety concerns, availability of natural product references, and regulatory issues. Because of their accessibility, clinical pharma- cists can also form a strong patient relationship that provides a framework for the delivery of comprehensive medication management for nat- ural products. This approach will allow the clin- ical pharmacist to assess patients, ensure smooth care transitions, and strengthen collaboration among clinicians regarding the appropriate use of natural products.
