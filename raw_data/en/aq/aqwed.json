These suicides leave bereaved family, friends, colleagues and others. It is estima ted that on average one suicide has a significant effect on six people. One of the aims of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England is to promote the mental health of thos e bereaved by suicide. Evaluation of the available interventions for those bereaved by suicide is believed to be limit ed. Anecdotal claims and brief reviews of these interventions, suggest that the bereaved have been helped. However, it is unclear what is the optimum type of intervention, for wh ich bereaved individuals and when. Aim A systematic review was undertaken with the primar y aim of evaluating the ef fects of interventions aimed at persons bereaved by suicide. A secondar y aim was to provide a descriptive overview of interventions for persons bereaved by suicid e that have been reported in the literature. Methods Search strategy A total of 37 databases and other resources were se arched from their inception to October 2005 and update searches of seven key databases to 1st October 2007. In addition, eight organisations as well as other experts in the field, we re contacted, to ask whether they knew of any additional relevant studies. The reference lists of all full papers were scanned for further relevant studies. No language restrictions were applied and non-English language studies meeting the inclusion criteria were translated. Inclusion criteria Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts and, where relevant, full papers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and studies with a control or comparison group evaluating any type of intervention, in any setting, for any persons be reaved by suicide were e ligible for inclusion. To achieve the secondary objective of the review, rele vant studies using all other evaluative designs and studies describing the implementation of an inte rvention without any evaluation were included. Data extraction and quality assessment Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second. Synthesis Given the diversity of the studies in terms of se ttings, interventions, outcomes and outcome measures used, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. The study findings were described, organised, explored and interpreted, taking into account the methodological adequacy. Studies included for the purposes of the secondary objective were not synthesised, but have been de scribed briefly to provide an overview of interventions for perso ns bereaved by suicide that have been reported in the literature. Results Eight studies were identified that met the primary inclusion criteria: four RCTs, one controlled study and three observational studies with a control or co mparison group, one of which was retrospective. The participants, interventions assessed, outcome s and outcome measures used were diverse across the studies. In six of the included studies the partic ipants had various, mainly fa milial, relationships to the deceased. One study focused on classmates of the deceased and in one study the relationship was not reported, but the participant s rated themselves as being close to the deceased. No controlled viiistudies were identified that had evaluated interven tions directed at healthcare professionals or other occupational groups. With the exception of one recent RCT, methodological problems were identified in all of the studies. Of the four RCTs, two were truly random, one wa s not (participants were assigned in alternating order), and one did not report how randomisation wa s carried out. One reported concealed treatment allocation and none used an intention-to-treat analysis, therefore there is a risk that the effectiveness of the interventions was overestimated. The re maining studies used various methods to assign participants to the intervention and comparison group, a ll of which had a high risk of selection bias. In most of the studies the groups were not balanced at baseline, or it was unclear whether this was the case. Apart from three studies with a one year follow-up, participants were not followed for a period of time adequate to allow a meaningful assessment of the effectiveness of the interventions. It was also unclear whether the studies were appropriately powered to detect an effect. There was some evidence of effective interventio ns. A brief cognitive behaviour therapy family intervention, with a psychiatric nur se resulted in fewer maladaptive grief reactions and less self-blame but there was no benefit for complicated grief, dep ression or suicidal ideation. A bereavement group intervention for children led by psychologists was more effective than no intervention in reducing anxiety and depression, but not more effective in reduc ing post traumatic stress, or in improving social adjustment. A group intervention for adults delivered by a health professional and a volunteer resulted in greater changes in eight of the nine em otions assessed than no intervention. An active outreach intervention led to a shorter time taken to se ek help at a crisis centre than no intervention. Finally, in a school setting implementation of a cris is intervention involving 'first talk through' and psychological debriefing close to the time of suicide may lead to lower levels of high intensity grief, but not stress response, than a less intense crisis in tervention. For the remaining studies either no significant differences were detected between groups or benefits from the intervention were marginal. However, these were all small studies and ma y not have been appropriately powered to detect an effect. There were 41 studies that met t he eligibility criteria for the second objective. Seven of these studies were evaluative in design, such as before and after studies and observational studies. The interventions evaluated were diverse, though suppor t groups were most common, with mental health professionals, health professionals and volunteers in volved in the delivery of the interventions. The remaining 34 studies described the implementation of an intervention, but were not evaluative. Again, the interventions were diverse, though group su pport and school based interventions were commonly reported. Generally, mental health professionals, he alth professionals or counsellors delivered these interventions. Conclusions The evidence we have identified and appraised is not robust enough to provide clear implications for practice though some tentative conclusions are ma de about the effectiveness of a psychiatric nurse led CBT family intervention, psychologist-led gro up therapy intervention for children and a combined health professional and volunteer led group therapy intervention for adults. There is a pressing need for methodologically sound RCTs to confirm whether such interventions are helpful and, if so, for whom. 1INTRODUCTION Bereavement It is generally accepted that the death of someone clos e is one of the greatest stressors in life. Grief is the natural reaction to a loss.1 Such losses can have an impact on the psychological and physical health of the bereaved.4 Common responses to bereavement include varying levels of negative emotions, such as numbness and disbelief, depression, anxiety and despair. A normal grief reaction has often been characterised as having a series of phases, though response to a bereavement is very individual and there may not be an orderly progression through these: people may move back and forth between the phases and the time frame may vary considerably.5 Within a few days of the initial shock and disbelief there may be feelings of agitation and pining, which can peak at around two weeks. This may be followed by depressive sympto ms which can peak four to six weeks following the bereavement. Then, over time, these emotions lessen. 4 These phases are generally regarded as descriptive guidelines; phases overlap and, as noted above, a movement back and forth between the phases can occur.1 This staged conceptualisation has been criticised as implying that the bereaved individual passively goes through a series of phases.2 Worden described the mourning process as a series of tasks that need to be accomplished to ad apt to loss: he likened this to Freud's concept of grief work. Four tasks of mourning to be accompli shed were identified: accepting the reality of the loss; working through the pain of grief; adjusting to an environment in which the deceased is missing, including internal, external and spiritual adjustm ents; and, emotionally relocating the deceased and moving on with life.2 Grief is a natural, healthy reaction to any significant loss. As well as bereavement, other significant types of loss include incapacitation or disability, job loss and separation from loved ones.6 A distinction has been drawn between normal and what has been variously called complicated, traumatic or pathological grief. Stroebe et al. 1 have defined pathological grief as grief which represents a deviation from the cultural norm in t he time course of the grief response or in the intensity of the symptoms of grief. Diagnostic crit eria for complicated or traumatic grief have been proposed by two groups.7, 8 The majority of bereaved people do not experience pathological grief. When it occurs, however, professional support may be required.1 Several theories have been proposed to attempt to explain the way in which the bereaved person responds to their loss. Psychoanalytic theories, st age theories, stress theories and social support theories all suggest that unexpected, sudden losses are more damaging and take longer to resolve than an expected loss. 9 Bereavement by suicide In England an estimated 5000 people take their own lives each year.10 In many countries, suicide is one of the ten leading causes of death and one of the three leading causes of death for young males. It has been estimated that, worldwide every year , up to six million people are bereaved through suicide.11 This figure is based on earlier suggestions that there are around on e million suicide deaths worldwide per year and for each suicide there are, on average, six bereaved individuals who will experience intense grief. The similarity of response to bereavement by su icide and other forms of bereavement is somewhat unclear, mainly due to a paucity of high quality research. Traditionally, opinion has been that mourning the loss of someone who has died through suicide is a particularly difficult and unique grieving process, different from mourning death from other causes such as illness. 12 The general conclusion of the earlier literature on suicide bereavement was that those bereaved by suicide experienced greater guilt, less social support and felt more of a need to understand why the death occurred than those bere aved by natural causes.12 However, it has been recognised that there were considerable methodological limitations in this early research, such as a lack of comparison or control groups, small sample sizes and a lack of information or large variation in potential risk factors such as length of time since bereavement and closeness of the relationship.13, 14 There now exists a growing body of evidence from comparative studies, which has addressed some of the methodological limitations of earlier work (e.g . larger sample sizes and a variety of standardised 2instruments to measure outcomes13). This has led to a revised general consensus that there are more similarities than differences between individuals bereaved by suicide and those bereaved through other causes,11 and that the mode of death plays only a marginal role in adaptation to bereavement.11, 15 There are aspects of grieving that have been id entified through qualitative research as being characteristic of suicide bereavement, although not necessarily unique. These include shock, disbelief, horror, guilt, blame, anger and the need to know how and why the suicide occurred.11 Further research has found that t hose bereaved by suicide tend to feel more ashamed, stigmatised, rejected and abandoned than those bereav ed by different modes of death.16, 17 Although grief responses should never be regarded as universal, thes e characteristic grief t hemes mean that there may be some commonalities amongst those bereaved by suicide.14 This allows some understanding of grief needs and the term 'postvention' has been used to describe interventions for those bereaved by suicide. This can include interventions to prev ent further suicides and/or help the bereaved cope with their loss. It can encompass support for individuals, community-based or public health interventions, and policy initiatives.3 Many potential predictors of response to ber eavement, other than the mode of death, have been identified. These include age of the deceased; relationship to the deceased; age, gender, religion and culture of the bereaved; attitude to the loss; quality of the relationship with the deceased; and time since bereavement.14 Personality traits, such as being prone to guilt and anxiety, past psychiatric illnesses, and interpersonal risk factors, such as a lack of social support, are believed to have an impact on the grief response.18 These factors can be categorised as being at the individual, family or global level, all of which may combine in a 'Pandora's box' to have positive or negative influences on bereavement outcome. 16 Many of the predictive factors for poor bereavem ent outcomes are more common for people bereaved by suicide, and the grieving processes can o ften be complicated by pre-existing problems.19 These factors include a higher prevalence of psychiat ric illness in the family, more disturbed family dynamics, more discordant relationships with t he deceased, and lack of support in bereavement.11 This may lead to survivors of suicide being at risk of poor bereavement outcomes, psychosocial problems and suicidal behaviour themselves.14 The relative importance and interplay between these factors remain unclear. In any situation, the process of normal adjustment to the loss of a close relationship can take many years and the level of grief has been reported to remain high for up to two and a half, four,11 and five years.4 Levels of grief and adjustment are naturally individual reactions which may evolve over time, and intensify at anniversaries and other significant da tes. For those bereaved by suicide, there may be specific triggers for intense emotion: at the site of suicide (such as discovering the body and official forensic or resuscitation procedur es); twenty-four hours after the su icide (such as telling others about the cause of the death) and at follow-up or review (such as contact with specific agencies). All of these may have an impact on an individual's grief needs and grief response.11 A study of relatives and friends bereaved through the suicide of an older person (60 years and above) identified media interest in the suicide as a key source of distress for the bereaved.17 The Coroners' inquest was also identified as a common source of distress. Who are the people bereaved by suicide? When considering who might be affected by a suicide, the focus is naturally on immediate family members and close friends, often described as 'survivo rs' of suicide or survivors after suicide, though there is debate about the most appropriate terminology. 14, 20 However, the determination of exactly who the survivors after suicide are, is subjec tive. There may be an impact on relatives beyond immediate family, school friends, neighbours, work colleagues or acquaintances. There also may be an impact for complete strangers: those who find t he body; train drivers if t he death has occurred on the rail network;21 and for emergency services who attend the scene.14 There is evidence that suicide can have a major im pact on health professionals. A recent survey was conducted to identify the effect of patient suicide on consultant psychiatrists in Scotland. Of 315 eligible consultants, 247 responded, with 167 of t hese reporting that a patient under their care had died by suicide. Conclusions based on the \"most di stressing\" suicide experienced by the consultants 3suggest that patient suicide has a substantial em otional and professional effect on consultant psychiatrists.22 Other surveys that considered the experiences of trainee psychiatrists,23 community mental health teams,24 and rural general practitioners25 found that up to 86% of the responders had experienced the suicide of a patient and such ex periences had adverse effects on professional practice and personal life.22 Interventions available A survey of all of the representat ives of the International Associat ion for Suicide Prevention (IASP) was undertaken in 1997.26 Of the 52 countries surveyed, 31 responded, and it was found that the number of agencies providing bereavement servic es varied widely in each country, with some countries reporting that the initiation of services we re 'in preparation'. A later survey of 42 European countries was condu cted in 2000, of which 31 were I ASP members and of these 20 responded.27 Data on the number of people a service had been pr ovided to, were not available for some of the services, but an approximate estimate of was made of 10,000 people per year receiving a service across all the countries. The greatest number of services was reported in north-western and mid- European countries, with some countries such as Spain and Hungary reporting no services for those bereaved by suicide. The European directory of available services was pu blished in 2002, and provides brief details of the programmes for people bereaved by suicide. 28 Generally, the survivor programmes identified appear to vary widely, with some being lead by professional s only, survivors only, or a mixture of survivors and trained volunteers, for example Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide and Cruse. Services tended to be directed towards adults who had been bereaved by suicide; the number of services aimed at children or clinicians was low. The majority of pr ogrammes were in the form of support groups with either closed (membership stays the same) or open membership (membership keeps changing).28 It was also stated that a number of 'ad hoc' groups ha d been formed, mainly by survivors, which proved difficult to monitor and survey. Evaluation of the postvention programmes that ar e available is believed to be limited. Anecdotal claims and brief reviews of studies of postv ention suggest that the bereaved have been helped. 11 However, there remain gaps in knowledge, such as the optimum type of intervention, for which bereaved individuals and the most appropriate timing for an intervention. Aims of the project One of the aims of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England is to promote the mental health of those bereaved by suicide.10 As part of the work to meet this aim, the Department of Health Policy Research Programme commissioned a scoping revi ew of the research literature investigating interventions for people bereaved by suicide.29 No previous systematic reviews were available of interventions used in the UK or other countries, t hough primary studies evaluating interventions were identified. The current project is a systematic revi ew of interventions for people bereaved by suicide. The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of interventions aimed at persons bereaved by suicide. A secondary aim was to provide a de scriptive overview of interventions for persons bereaved by suicide that have been reported in the literature: these c ould either be evaluated interventions (using a non-controlled design) or desc riptions of interventions without any evaluation. 4METHODS Search strategy Literature searches were run to identify published and unpublished studies of interventions for people bereaved by suicide (see Appendix A). Over thir ty databases were searched up to October 2005 including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Science Cita tion Index, ASSIA: Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Caredat a; Index to Theses, Inside Conferences, International Bibliography of Social Sciences (IBSS), ProQuest Digital Dissertations, Social Policy and Practice Database and Social Services Abstracts. The detailed sear ch strategies are reported in Appendix A. Update searches were conducted on 1st October 2007, to search for controlled studies only. The searches were run on the seven databases from which relevant studies had been identified in the earlier searches: British Nursing Index, CINAHL, EMBASE, HMIC, M edline, Medline-In and PsycINFO. In addition, the following organisations were cont acted to ask whether they knew of any other, published or unpublished, potentially relevant stud ies: The Compassionate Friends; Survivors of Bereavement by Miserably); PAPYRUS; Samaritans; MIND; SAVE (Suicide Awareness Voices of Education). The reference lists of all full papers were scanned for further relevant studies. No language restrictions were applied and relevant non-Englis h language studies were translated. Authors were contacted for clarification where necessary. A list of studies meeting the inclusion criteria for the review was circulated to the advisory group and other ex perts in the field to identify whether they were aware of any studies missing from the list. Inclusion criteria Citations from the literature search were downloaded into an Endnote library. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts. Fu ll paper manuscripts of any titles/abstracts that were considered relevant by either reviewer were obtained where possible. The relevance of each study was assessed according to the criteria set out below. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and if necessary a third reviewer was consulted. Interventions All types of intervention were eligible for inclusion. Participants Adults and children who have been bereaved by suic ide either through a personal (or professional relationship in the case of adults) were eligible. There was no restriction on the age of participants or their relationship to the person who had died through suicide. Outcomes All outcomes were considered relevant to the revi ew. Qualitative as well as quantitative measures were included. Study design To achieve the primary objective of the review, ran domised controlled trials (RCTs) and studies with a control or comparison group were eligible for inclus ion. Originally the prot ocol had specified that only RCTs or controlled studies without randomisation, i.e. quasi-randomised studies were eligible. However, this was amended to use a more relaxed definition of 'controlled' following initial screening of the studies as so few studies were identified. 5To achieve the secondary objective of the review, relevant studies using a ll other evaluative designs such as before and after studies and observational studies as well as studies describing the implementation of an intervention for indi viduals bereaved by suicide were collated. Data extraction Data from each study meeting the inclusion criter ia were extracted by one reviewer and independently checked for accuracy by a second. Disagreements were resolved through consensus, and if necessary a third reviewer was co nsulted. Data were extracted into a database set up in Microsoft Access. Following piloting of the database, information about each study was extracted in a systematic way and included: study details; the interv ention; the participants; the setting; the outcome measures used and results. In relation to the studies included for the purpos es of the secondary objective of the review, the following information was extracted: country; setting; relationship of participant to the individual who had died; description of the interv ention; who delivered the interventi on and whether or not a formal evaluation was conducted. These studies were not quality assessed and data on outcomes, where available, were not extracted. Quality assessment The quality of the individual studies was assessed by one reviewer and independently checked by a second. Disagreements were resolved through co nsensus, and if necessary a third reviewer was consulted. Both RCTs and controlled studies were assessed using criteria based on CRD's guidance for undertaking systematic reviews30 and a recent report on ev aluating nonrandomised studies.31 In order to assess the integrity of the interventi on we drew on the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.32 The results of the quality assessment were used to describe the overall quality of the included studies and not used to score the qua lity of each individual study. Full details of the quality assessment items used are reported in Appendix C. Data synthesis Given the diversity of the studies in terms of se ttings, interventions, outcomes and outcome measures used, we undertook a narrative synthesis. The narrative synthesis involv ed describing, organising, exploring and interpreting the study findings, taki ng into account the methodological adequacy. As part of this process we have investigated the simila rities and differences between study findings. This included consideration of the following stud y dimensions: study design (RCTs and the non- RCTs); quality; whether the study was appropriat ely powered; intervention characteristics and delivery; participants and outcome measures. Wher e particular patterns of findings have emerged, we have presented possible explanations for the findings. The guidance developed by Popay and colleagues on conducting narrative synthe sis was used to guide the synthesis (http://www.lancs.a c.uk/fass/projects/nssr/index.htm ). Studies included for the purposes of the secondar y objective were not synthesised. These are included for illustrative purposes only, to provide a descriptive overview of the range of interventions for persons bereaved by suicide that have been reported in the literature. Advisory panel An advisory panel of clinical experts was establ ished on commencement of the project. Comments were invited from the panel on the protocol and the draft report. 6 RESULTS In total, the original searches and update identifie d 4,872 potentially relevant articles. After screening the titles and abstracts of these articles for inclus ion in the review, 320 records were ordered as full papers. Of these 320 papers, six could not be scr eened for inclusion as they were unavailable. A further five full papers were ordered; however in the process of locating them, the authors were contacted and the studies were deemed ineligible a nd the orders were cancelled. Full details of the studies not screened for inclusion are available in Appendix B. A total of 309 full papers were screened for inclusion in the review. Eight studies met the eligibility criteria for the first objective. 33-40 The interventions in these studies were described in eight further publications which were excluded.41-48 There were also 41 studies (described in a further four publications) that met the eligibility criteria for the second objective.49-89 These were studies that described an intervention without evaluation, or th e evaluation was not controlled, for example before and after studies. The interventions in these studi es were described in four further publications.90-93 A total of 268 papers were excluded from both parts of the review, mainly because there was no intervention, or the intervention was not aimed at people that had been bereaved by suicide, or they were duplicates of papers already ordered. A full lis t is available from the authors. Six studies were excluded because, although they included partici pants bereaved by suicide, they also included participants who had been bereaved by other causes but the outcomes for the former were not reported separately. 69, 94-98 These studies were reported in four additional papers.99-102 Aim 1: Evidence from controlled studies We identified eight relevant studies with a control or comparison group. They were published between 1992 and 2007. One French-language paper required translation.39 There were four RCTs, 35-37, 40 one controlled study38 and three observational studies with a control group,33, 34, 39 one of which was retrospective.34 None of the studies had been conducted in the UK: one was conducted in Finland,33 one in Canada,39 one in the Netherlands40 and five were conducted in the USA. The number of participants ranged from 44 to 134 across the studies. Table 1 provides a summary of the main study characteristics and further details are prov ided in the data extraction tables (Appendix D). Participants In six of the included studies the participants had vari ous relationships to the deceased. In five of these the relationships were mainly fam ilial, such as spouse, son or daughter.34, 37-40 One study focused on classmates of the deceased, including friends and non-friends;33 one included spouses of the deceased only;35 and in one study the relationship was not reported.36 No controlled studies were identified that had evaluated intervent ions directed at healthcare professionals or other occupational groups. Methods of recruitment to the interv entions were researcher recruitment,36, 37, 40 professional referral33, 34 and recruitment from multiple sources such as self referral and professional referral.35, 38, 39 Due to the diversity of assessment instruments used, it was difficult to assess the similarity of participants across groups in relation to baseline severity of grief, anxiety or depression and other responses to bereavement. In two of the studies t he intervention was delivered immediately or within days of the bereavement33, 34 and in the remaining studies the mean time since ber eavement ranged from 3 to 17 months. Where available, the ran ge and standard deviations for length of time since bereavement indicated considerabl e variability within studies. 7Figure 1: Process of study selection Potentially relevant papers ordered n=320 Unavailable/not received, n= 6 Deemed ineligible after contact with author, n=5 Excluded as irrelevant/duplicates, n=238 Excluded as 'mixed' participants groups, n=6 (reported in 10 publications).

The complexity of these interventions is such that one cannot be sure that the only difference is treatment duration. High risk of confounding I: intervention group, C: control or comparison group a Data not available separately for the two groups; b Estimates 10There were three studies of adults only,35, 36, 39 one of adults and adolescents over 15 years old,40 one of children only,33 and two studies that included a small number of children in their comparison group.34, 38 One study included both adults and child ren and reported the outcomes separately for each group.37 In most of the studies the majority of par ticipants were women: the proportion of male participants ranged from 17% to 52% across studies . In the four studies where ethnic data were reported, participants were predominantly Caucasian.34-37 Data on other participant-related prog nostic factors were not reported co nsistently across the studies. One study reported data on the educational level and income of participants, though this information was not reported separately for the two groups, 35 one reported educational level, whether participants were in paid employment, marital status and whether they had lived with the deceased40 and another reported social class.37 One study included self-report data on other major life changes since the suicide, further bereavement, and activities used to cope with loss, including psychotherapy and support from family and friends.38 Another reported whether the suicide had been anticipated.39 Very little information was available on the quality of participants' relationship to the deceased. One reported participants' closeness to the dece ased and how upset they were at the death,36 and two reported how long participants had had a relationship with the deceased.39, 40 These data are available in Appendix D. Apart from participants' relationship to the deceas ed, very little additional information was available about the deceased. Two studies reported no information about the deceased,34, 38 four reported the method of suicide,33, 35, 37, 39 though for both groups combined in two of these studies, and three reported the age of the deceased. 36, 39, 40 Interventions The settings in which the interventions were carri ed out were diverse. One study was delivered in a school setting;33 one in the family home;40 one at the scene of the suicide;34 one in a laboratory at a university;36 and two at a suicide prevention centre, though it was unclear whether this was a community or healthcare setting.38, 39 The setting was not explicitly stated in two studies.35, 37 We classified one study as a self-help intervention, though researchers were closely involved in administering the intervention.36 The intervention was delivered on a one-to-one basis. In the other studies the intervention was delivered in a family or group context by mental health professionals33, 35, 37, 39, 40 or mental health professionals in conjunct ion with volunteers who had been bereaved by suicide.34, 38 The content of the interventions and comparat ors were diverse. Four studies compared an intervention to no intervention.34, 37, 38, 40 One of these studies investigated the effectiveness of an outreach programme where a team provided comfort and advice to those bereaved by suicide at the scene of the suicide and as close to the time of death notification as possible compared with no intervention.34 Three studies evaluated a group therapy intervention.37, 38, 40 The remaining studies used an active comparator. One compared a bereavem ent group postvention (B GP) to a social group postvention (SGP);35 one compared a profound writing conditi on (PWC) to a trivial writing condition (TWC);36 one compared different responses by school authorities to student suicides in three schools33 and one compared group interventions of different lengths.39 Three studies explicitly stated the theoretical underpinnings of the intervention. In one study35 the intervention was described as being based on Yalo m's 12 curative factors group psychotherapy and in another it was based on Bowlby's models of attachment, responses to loss and Lazarus and Folkman's cognitive coping.37 The third study evaluated a cognitive behaviour therapy programme designed to address the problems of the complete fa mily system rather than individual participants.40 Two further studies provided some information about their underlying philosophy or background to the approach used: one described the group therapy as bei ng based on a view of suicide \"survivors\" as normal people subjected to huge emotional stress rather than as people with psychiatric problems38 and in one the intervention was based on P ennebaker's experimental writing paradigm.36 11Outcomes A range of outcomes were assessed across the studies, though most used standardised measures (Table 2). With the exception of the Beck Depr ession Inventory (BDI) and Impact of Event Scale (IES), which were common to three and two studies respectively, each of the studies used different outcome measures. Length of follow-up ranged from two to 13 months in the seven prospective studies. Table 2: Outcome measurements used Campbell34 Constantino35 De Inventory (BSI) Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESDS) Childhood Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPSRI) Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) Grief Experience Inventory (GEI) Grief Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) Grief Recovery Questionnaire (GRQ) Hogan Sibling Inventory of Bereavement (HSIB) Intensity of emotion Inventory of Traumatic Grief (ITG) Impact of Event Scale (IES) Maladaptive Grief (TRGR2L) Non-routine healthcare visits Perception of being to blame Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) Social Adjustment Inventory for Children & Adolescents (SAICA) Suicidal ideation Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L) Tessier Scale of Grief Treatment seeking* Intensity of emotion rated as high, moderate or low See data extraction table (Appendix D) for details of how this was measured *Length of time between intervention and seeking treatment 12Methodological quality Table 3 provides an overview of the methodological criteria met by individual studies and the quality assessment for individual studies is provided in Ap pendix C. The key threats to validity are noted in the description of individual studies (Table 1). With the exception of one study conducted in the Netherlands,40 substantial methodological problems were identif ied in all of the studies. Of the four RCTs, two were truly random,35, 40 one was not (participants were assigned in alternating order),37 and one did not report how randomisation was carried out.36 Of these four studies, one40 reported an attempt to conceal treatment allocation and none used an intention-to-treat analysis, therefore there is a risk that the effectiveness of the interventions was overestimated. Howe ver, it is worth noting that in one study those who dropped out had slightly more favourable scores at baseline for depression, complicated grief and self-blame. 40 The remaining studies used various methods to assign participants to the intervention and comparison group, all of which had a high risk of se lection bias. In most of the studies the groups were not balanced at baseline 36-38 or it was unclear whether this was the case.33, 35 Four studies did report data on potential prognostic or confounding variables separately for each group, however this was for a minimal number of variables, for example, age and gender36-38 and time since bereavement and length of relationship with the deceased.39 In addition, most of the studies were small and, with the exception of one40 it was unclear whether they were ap propriately powered to detect an effect on all the outcomes measured. Apart from three studies with a one year follow-up,35, 39, 40 participants were not followed for a period of time adequate to allow a meaningful assessment of the effectiveness of the interventions. It was possible to assess the fidelity of the intervent ion in one study which measured consistency of delivery.37 Consistency of delivery was not assessed in the other studies. Four of the studies indicated explicitly or implicitly that the intervention was implement ed based on a treatment protocol or manual.35-37, 40 13Table 3 Quality of Kovac36 Pfeffer37 assignment to treatment groups really random?

Studies were therefore grouped based on whether or not they had an active comparison group. However, due to the diversity within these groupings studies are described individually. Visual display of the treatment effects across studies using a common statistic (in this instance mean difference) can provide a useful summary of study results and aid interpretation. Unfortunately, due to the lack of appropriate data for the majority of studies it was not possible to do this. The results of the studies are summarised below and also briefly in Table 1 in conjunction with a summary of the main threats to validity. Further det ails of the results of the individual studies are available in the data extraction tables (Appendix D). Intervention compared to no intervention All four studies comparing an intervention to no intervention reported a positive effect of the intervention on at least one outcome. The most recent study carr ied out by de Groot et al.40 in the Netherlands was also the best quality study identified. This was a cluster randomised tr ial of family-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) compared to usual care and was targeted at spouses and first-degree relatives over 15 years of age. The intervention was delivered in the home of each participating family who received counselling from one of two experienced psychiatr ic nurses. There were four, 2 hour, planned sessions at two to three week intervals. The interv ention was targeted at the complete family system rather than individual participants. The aim of t he intervention was described as being to offer a reference frame for the grief reaction of participants, to engage emotional processing, enhance effective interaction and improve problem-solving. There were some fixed topics covered in the sessions, in particular cognitive restructuring and co nsolidation of support. There were also a range of optional topics that families could choose from depending on their needs. The sessions were supplemented by a manual: the contents included information on suicide, bereavement, homework, a bibliography and contact details for additional support. This was the best quality study included in the review and there were no substantial threats to validity. There was an adequate method of randomisation and there was an attempt at allocation concealment; the method of allocation concealment was not ideal (a list was used) however an independent secretary administered the procedure. The sample size calculation took into account the cluster design as did the analysis. An appropriate method was used to adjust for baseline differences and loss to follow-up was low. Thirteen months a fter bereavement, there was no beneficial effect on the primary outcome of self reported complicated grie f (measured by the Inventory of Traumatic Grief) in the intervention group compared to control (adjus ted mean difference -0.61, 95% CI: -6.05, 4.83, p=0.82). There was also no statistically signific ant difference between intervention and control on the secondary outcome measures of the CESDS, and suicidal ideation (see Appendix D). The intervention group was less likely to have a perc eption of being to blame for the suicide than the control group (adjusted OR 0.18, (95% CI: 0.05, 0.67, p=0.01) and fewer maladaptive grief reactions (TRGR2L), though the latter was at the margins of stat istical significance (adj usted OR 0.39, (95% CI: 0.15, 1.01, p=0.056). Based on the unadjusted ana lysis none of the outcomes were statistically significant. Pfeffer et al. 37 conducted a study targeted primarily at ber eaved children, most of whom had lost a parent. The intervention was delivered in 10 weekly sessions of 1.5 hours by psychologists to groups of children from 2-5 families. Eligible families we re identified from the medical examiners' lists of suicide victims and then contacted by researchers. Children were grouped by age (6-9 years, 10-12 years and 13-15 years) and siblings were generally in the same group. The intervention had psycho- educational components, such as discussion of th e concept of death and why people take their own life, and supportive components such as facilitating children's expressions of grief. The intervention was offered separately but simultaneously to parents. Children were allocated alternately to receive the intervention or no intervention. Children in t he latter group were free to seek formal support elsewhere and 20% did so. 15After three months there was a statistically signi ficant, greater improvement in anxiety (RCMAS) and depression (CDI) for children who received the inte rvention compared to those who did not: anxiety was higher at follow-up than baseline and depression remained the same for children who did not receive the intervention. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in parental depression (BDI) or in children's social adjustm ent (SAICA) or posttrau matic stress (CPSRI). However, this was a small study and it was unclear whether it was appropriately powered to detect an effect on these measures. This study benefited from the use of outcome measur es that were completed through semi-structured interviews conducted by psychologists trained for th e purpose, who were blind to group allocation. However, a number of factors weak en the validity of the findings of this study. The method of allocation of participants to group was susceptible to selection bias: children were generally allocated alternately, but sometimes consecut ively to ensure that at least two families were available to receive the intervention. The groups were not balanced at baseline: children in the control group were significantly older and had poorer social adjustment than children in the intervention group. The length of time since bereavement also seemed lon ger in the control group (17.2 months (SD 33.6)) than the intervention group (10.2 months (SD 12.5 )). Although analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to take into account baseline assessment scores, age and length of time between baseline and follow-up assessment, this was likely to have been an inappropriate analysis given that there were less than 10 individuals from the control group in cluded in the analysis. Seventy-five percent of control participants were lost to follow-up compar ed with 18% in the intervention group and the analysis was based only on those part icipants who completed the study. The study by Farberow et al. 38 was targeted at adults. They assessed an eight week group therapy intervention delivered by a mental health prof essional and a person bereaved by suicide who had already gone through the programme and received ad ditional training. The intervention was based on the underlying philosophy that su icide survivors are normal people subject to huge emotional stress who need help in working through their grief. The comparison group was made up of individuals who had completed a pre-programme assessment as well as a follow-up questionnaire but who did not attend the sessions or dropped out after one session. The groups were different at baseline in terms of kinship to the deceased, their health since the suicide and general feelings: the intervention group reported greater feelings of grief, shame and guilt than the comparison group and this was statistically significant. Outcome was assessed by asking parti cipants to rate a range of emotions as low, moderate or high. A statistical analysis was not reported for differences between groups. The authors state that the intervent ion group experienced significant im provement in eight of the nine emotions assessed (anger towards deceased, ange r towards self, anxiety, depression, grief, guilt, puzzlement, shame) after two months. There was improvement in the comparison group on one of the nine emotions. However, this seemed to be based on change within groups over time and a statistical analysis was not reported. As with the previous study, a number of factors weaken the validity of the findings. As noted, the reliability and validity of the outcome measure is unclear and conclusions about significant change do not appear to be based on a statistical analysis. In addition, the comparisons appear to be within group over time and not between groups. The method of allocation to groups introduces the possibility of selection bias. Given the baseline di fferences between the two groups, it seems that individuals with higher levels of distress were more likely to take part in the intervention. Therefore, this group was probably more likely to show improv ement than the control group, particularly over the short time-scale involved. Participants incl uded in the study appeared to be only those who completed the programme and completed the before and after questionnaires. It is unclear how representative these individuals are of all t hose who received treatment at the centre. The fourth study, conducted by Campbell 34 was of individuals attending a crisis centre for assessment and treatment. This study reported a statistically significant, shorter length of time lapse between bereavement and attending the centre for those had received an active outreach intervention at the time of the suicide compared to those who had not . The intervention was delivered by mental health workers and volunteers, who had t hemselves been bereaved by suici de, following notification from the local coroner. The team attended the scene of the suicide as close to the time of death notification as possible with the aim of providi ng comfort and advice to the bereaved. The key limitation of this study is the inadequacy of the out come measure to assess the effectiveness of the 16intervention. The outcome measure is based on the assumption that seeking help following the intervention is a positive outcome. In the absence of any information about individuals who received the outreach intervention but did not seek assessment at the crisis centre it is unclear whether this was an appropriate assumption. Additionally, t he comparison group was made up of a mixture of historical and geographical controls. Studies using an active comparator The findings from the studies comparing two or mo re active interventions were mixed. A study evaluating writing therapy amongst undergraduat es who had been bereaved by suicide in the previous two years reported positive findings.36 This study, by Kovac et al. compared a profound writing condition (PWC) to a trivial writing condition (TWC). Participants were recruited based on a moderate to high level of closeness to the decea sed and moderate to high level of upset by the bereavement (based on five-point likert scales). Part icipants receiving the PWC spent four sessions of 15 minutes over two weeks in a laboratory room, wh ere they were instructed to write about events and emotions around their loss, especially issues they had not widely disc ussed with others. Individuals assigned to the TWC were instructed to write an objective and precis e description of their bedroom and their activities that day and avoid m entioning emotions and feelings. After two months there were statistically significant differences between groups on the GEQ total score (described as assessing grief specific to bereavement by suicide) , but not on any of the other measures (GRQ and IES). There was an improvement over time in bot h groups on the GEQ but t he profound writing group had less severe grief at 2 months, though they also had less severe grief at baseline. Although there were no between group differences, there was al so improvement over time in both groups as assessed by the IES and GRQ, non-r outine healthcare visits and one subscale (unique grief) of the GEQ. As only a total of 30 participants were included in the analysis it is possible that this study was underpowered. The two groups were not balanced at baseline; the PWC gr oup reported a closer relationship to the deceased and a lower score on the GEQ. The potential for generalisability is a key limitation of this study. The participants were co llege students who were given extra course credits for participation; therefore the ex tent of dropout is probably less t han would be expected in a real-life setting. It is unclear how applicable the findings of th is study would be to different populations of people bereaved by suicide. Interpretation of the study by Poijula et al., based in a school setting, is difficult as the interventions in the three schools where student suicides had occurr ed were very similar and there were a different number of suicides in each of the schools, whic h may have had a confounding effect (school A had three suicides, school B had two and school C had one). 33 School A had no contingency plan in place to deal with student suicide: following two suicides th ere was no crisis intervention but following a third suicide there was an 'adequate' crisis intervention comprising a first talk through (FTT) and psychological debriefing (PD). School B had a cont ingency plan but it was not fully implemented until after the second suicide in the school. Sc hool C had no contingency plan but an 'adequate' intervention following the single suicide. The propor tion of students with high intensity grief, based on scores from the HSIB, 4 to 9 months following t he interventions, was 25% for school A, 5% for school B and 0% for school C and the difference was statis tically significant. A comparison was also made between those who received an intervention and t hose who did not: there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants who were classified as being at high and low risk for intense grief. Given that all of the schools had an intervention at some stage it is unclear what is being compared here. There was no statistically significant difference between schools when the IES was used to classify ri sk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The remaining two studies are similar in that they included only adults and followed up participants for 12 months. However, only one reported a statistical analysis. Constantino et al. state that there was no statistically significant difference in outcome s 12 months after a bereavement group intervention compared to a social group intervention for women who had been bereaved through the suicide of their spouse. 35 However, this was a small study and may not have been appropriately powered to detect an effect. Participants were recruited by a variety of means including professional referral and self referral following advertisement in local m edia. The bereavement grou p intervention, conducted in groups of 4-6 participants in weekly, 1.5 hour sessions over 2 months, aimed to promote adaptive coping strategies and enhance remodelling of relati onships. The authors stat e that a psychotherapy model was used. The groups were conducted by on e of two leaders who had minimum of a Master's 17degree in mental health nursing and received a 16 hour training programme specifically related to the intervention. There were also weekly one hour supervisory meetings and notes were taken of individual sessions though details of the consistency of implementation are not reported. The social group intervention was also led by two professionals with similar qualifications to the individuals running the bereavement group, who also received an equivalent training programme. Socialisation groups were a similar size to the other group an d the duration and frequency of the intervention was also the same. Members of the group were encouraged to plan weekly activities with the aim of promoting socialisation, recreation and leisure. The authors reported that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at baseline or at any of the follow-up points, though the data were not reported. The two groups were then combined to investigate change over time. Al though this data was extracted, it is emphasised that this is before and after data and studies reporting only before and after data have been excluded from the review. There was statistically signifi cant improvement in the combined group on the majority of the scales and subs cales used (BDI, GEI, BSI and SAS) and the significant changes were mainly from baseline to two month follow-up. The study was an RCT with a 12 month follow-up. The participants were reported as being similar at base line on the assessment measures though it was unclear whether this referred to all participants at baseline or only those who completed the study and were included in the analysis. As highlighted by the authors of this study, due to the lack of a no intervention control group it is not possible to conclude that any impr ovement was due to the intervention rather natural improvements that would have taken place over time anyway. In the final study, Seguin et al. compared four, heal th professional-led, closed group interventions of two, four, six and 12 months duration that were offe red to the bereaved on a self -referral basis in four different areas of Canada. 39 The authors state that although not identical, the interventions were generally the same except for the length of treatmen t. The number of sessions ranged from eight for the two month group to 17 for the 12 month group (see Table 1). A statistical analysis was not conducted. From the data reported, there wa s a trend in all four groups towards decreasing depression over the 12 month follow-up period. There was some variation between groups in the decrease in BDI score (least reduction in the two mo nth group and greatest in the four month group). However, this cannot be attributed to the duratio n of the intervention due to the considerable and unequal loss to follow-up across groups (ranging fr om 52% retained in the two month group to 7% retained in the six month group at 12 months), the po ssibility of differences in the content and delivery of the interventions at the different centres, and what appear to be baseline differences between the groups. The authors state that grief scores remained stable though this is not clear from the tables reported Summary We found eight studies with a control or comparison group that met the inclusion criteria for the primary objective of the review. The participant s, interventions, outcomes and outcome measures were diverse across the studies. There was some evidence of effective interventions. Firstly, a bereavement group intervention for children led by psychologists was more effective at reducing anxiety and depression, but not social adjustment and post traumatic stress, than no intervention. Secondly, a group intervention for adults delivered by a health professional and a volunteer was more effective than no intervention in terms of scores for eight of the nine emotions assessed. Thirdly, an active outreach intervention led to a shorter time taken to seek help at a crisis centre than no intervention. Fourthly, in a school setting, impl ementation of a crisis intervention involving FTT and PD close to the time of suicide may lead to lower levels of high intensity grief, but not stress response, than a less intense crisis intervention. Finally, a family-based CBT programme was more effective at reducing maladaptive grief reactions and perceptio n of being to blame for the suicide, but not complicated grief reaction, suicidal ideation or depression. There were also studies where no statistically si gnificant differences were detected between the intervention and comparison, though these studies ma y have been too small to detect an effect. Thus a bereavement group intervention was not more effe ctive than a social group intervention provided for widows. The effectiveness of a group intervention did not seem to vary with different treatment durations. Amongst undergraduates, a profound writ ing intervention had marginal benefits compared to a trivial writing condition, at reducing grief as measured by the GEQ overall score but not on its subscales and not on the other measures of grief and stress. 18However, robust conclusions about the effectiveness or ineffectivenes s of these interventions cannot be reached due to either considerable methodological limit ations across the studies or, in the case of one methodologically sound study due to the lack of a beneficial effect on the primary outcome. The nature of the limitations, means that it is difficult to assess with any certainty whether the effect of the intervention was overestimated or underestimated in individual studies. It was not possible to identify any common characteristics between those studies t hat found some evidence of an effect and those that did not. Of the adult studies using standardised outcome measures, there was evidence of improvement only on the grief or bereavement meas ures. There was no improvement on any of the psychological measures such as the BDI and the I ES (though this was not entirely clear in one study due to lack of statistical analysis 39), or the BSI and SAS. However, given the small number of studies it is not appropriate to draw strong conclusions from this. Due to the paucity of data it was not possible to ex plore whether the effects of interventions varied with factors such as age and gender of the bereaved, whether or not the intervention was received on the basis of self-referral, charac teristics of the deceased and the nature of the relationship between the bereaved and the deceased. Aim 2: Publications d escribing an intervention A secondary aim of the review was to provide a descriptive overview of interventions for people bereaved by suicide that have been reported in t he literature. These could be either evaluated interventions using a non-controlled design (and theref ore did not meet the inclusion criteria for the primary aim) or descriptions of interventions without any evaluation. These criteria were quite difficult to apply. There were occasions where the inclusio n of papers as descriptive studies was resolved by discussion, and some of the studies included may be co nsidered as 'borderline' descriptive studies. At times it was unclear whether an actual planned intervention wa s being described, whether an already implemented intervention was being descri bed or whether the paper contained a general discussion of the components an effective intervent ion should include. Our aim was to focus on descriptions of actual planned or implemented intervent ions to provide an overview of the types of interventions being used, that might be available for evaluation, rather than theoretical descriptions. When considering the interventions described it must be remembered that these are simply the interventions that we identified in the literature and they may not reflect the full range of support available to people bereaved by suicide. A total of 41 studies (45 papers) were identifi ed that described an intervention. These are summarised in Table 4 and further details are available in Appendix E. Five papers required translation to extract the relevant information. 63, 66, 71, 78, 84 Seven of the studies (from eight papers) evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention.61, 84-89, 93 These were before and after studies, surveys or observational studies, and thus did not meet the inclusion criteria for the main review. Five of these studies were conducted in the USA or Canada and the remaining two were conducted in Norway and Australia. The study from Norway was a survey of the special su pport services available across the country and did not evaluate an individual intervention. The interventions evaluated were diverse, though support groups were most common. Mental health professionals, health professionals and volunteers, some of whom had been bereaved by suicide, were involved in delivering the interventions. The remaining 37 papers described 34 interventions but did not report an evaluation. The majority were implemented in the USA (56%), and the remaining papers were from Canada, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, Israel and Australia. Where the setting was not clearly stated, most of the interventions appeared to be community based. Where the setting was reported, the interventions were most commonly in a school setting. Outsid e the school setting, most of the interventions provided counselling or support in a group setting. The majority of interventions were delivered to groups of bereaved individuals (56% ). There were a small number that appeared to be targeted at individual families or used group support in addi tion to individual counselling/therapy. The interventions that were grouped into the 'other' cate gory were mainly school based interventions that provided support in numerous ways, on a short-term basis, such as: provision of information at school assemblies or in the classroom; group discussions and follow-up for individuals who were considered vulnerable. The interventions were targeted at peer s (35%), family members (27%), children (6%) or any person bereaved by suicide (26%). Only tw o papers were identified where the intervention was targeted at people who had a professional relationsh ip with the deceased. Generally, mental health 19professionals, health professionals or counsellors de livered the interventions (62%). The intervention was delivered by 'survivors' after suicide in six st udies (18%), some of whom were also healthcare professionals.

Studies were included regardless of type of in tervention, participants (provided they had been bereaved through suicide), setting or outcomes assessed. The key restriction applied was that studies had to have a co ntrol or comparison group, which was viewed as particularly important due to the changing nature of grief over time.11 Despite extensive searches and no language restrictions we identified very few re levant studies. Although we identified many papers that described an intervention, we identified only ei ght controlled studies; six studies of adults and two of children. Four of these were RCTs , though only two reported an adequate method of randomisation. Apart from three one-year studie s, length of follow-up was probably not long enough to allow a meaningful evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervent ions. Even the studies with one year follow-up are arguably too short. Overall the studies do not provide a robust evidence-base on which to reach firm conclusions about the effe ctiveness of interventions for people bereaved by suicide. The main common characteristic of the studies ident ified was the evaluation of group interventions of eight to 10 weeks duration. The average length of time since bereavement in these studies tended to be about one year though there was a fairly wide ran ge within studies. The majority of participants were female and Caucasian. No study was ident ified that had evaluated an intervention where a professional relationship to the deceased had existed. Overall the studies were diverse in terms of: the content of the interventions; the setting; outco mes and outcome measures. This reflects the findings of a systematic review of bereavement care interventions for general population groups.103 Although a much larger body of evidence was identifi ed in this review, it was described as having excessive theoretical heterogeneity, stultify ing study heterogeneity, inadequate reporting of intervention procedures and few repl ication studies. Methodological flaws in study design were also identified as an area of concern.103 Similarly, the studies in the current review had a number of methodological limitations. The most significant issue was the risk of selection bias, ei ther through self-selection or selection by the investigators due to non-randomised methods of allo cation. The circumstances in which, and the extent to which, non-randomised studies are susceptible to bias is not fully understood, though an important determinant may be the extent to which prognosis influences selection for a particular treatment as well as outcome. 31 Due to non-randomised methods of group allocation, four of the studies were at risk of having systematic diffe rences between the comparison groups, possibly leading to different responses to the intervention. There was evidence in two of these studies, plus an additional study with an unclear method of ran domisation, that the co mparison groups were not balanced at baseline. The included studies repo rted a very limited range of potential prognostic factors, which means there may be other important sources of imbalance that remain unknown. A number of other methodological limitations were identified. The studies were generally small and may have been underpowered, especia lly given the possibility of cl ustering where more than one person delivered the intervention or where the inte rvention group consisted of a number of small therapeutic groups.104 The fidelity of interventions (i.e. t he extent to which the intervention was implemented as planned) was generally not assessed in the studies, nor was any relevant information presented. The quality of administration of interventi ons has been identified as an important aspect of study quality;105 however, this potentially important sour ce of study heterogeneity could not be investigated due to lack of data. In general, st udies used standardised outcome measures, though there was some use of measures of unknown reliab ility and validity. In addition, two of the studies relied on before and after comparisons and did not directly compare groups, thereby rendering the evaluation to that of a before-after design. Giv en that before and after studies were excluded from this review due to their methodological limitations, the findings of these studies must be treated with caution. Six of the eight studies showed evidence of benefit from parti cipants receiving the experimental intervention rather than the com parator on at least one measure. However, due to the differences between studies and the methodological limitations of the studies, care needs to be taken against the assumption that some kind of intervention is be tter than none. While some of the methodological 21limitations, such as small sample size or the cont rol group receiving support from elsewhere, could be leading to a masking or underestimation of the effe cts of the interventions, other limitations may have led to an overestimation of the effect. Weak evidence of an effect has also been found in relation to interventions for general bereaved populations.9, 103, 106 Suggested reasons for this included the methodological flaws of the studies,9, 103 masking of effects due to no control for gender in the design and statistical analysis,9 and use of researcher-recruited participants rather than self-selected participants.106 There was one well-designed, random ised study from the Netherlands without any significant sources of potential bias.40 Despite some positive findings from this study in favour of the intervention, uncertainty remains, as there was no evidence of benefit found in relation to the primary outcome of self-reported complicated grief. This early st age intervention has the advantage of being brief, however, replication and evidence of stronger effect would increase co nfidence in the effectiveness of such an intervention. It was not possible in the current review to explor e whether the effects of interventions varied with factors such as age and gender of the bereaved, wh ether or not the intervention was received on the basis of self-referral, characte ristics of the deceased and the nature of the relationship between the bereaved and the deceased. It has been suggested that an important factor in whether or not bereaved individuals benefit from an interventi on may depend on whether or not they are experiencing complicated grief.107 However, from the data available it was not possible to explore this issue. Implications for practice and research The evidence we have identified, appraised and synthesised is not robust enough to provide clear implications for practice. However, based on the limi ted evidence available, the following tentative suggestions are made: a psychologist-led group therapy intervention for children, most of whom had lost a parent, was found to reduce anxiety and depression but not social adjustment and post traumatic stress when compared to no intervention;37 and a combined health professional and volunteer led group therapy intervention for adults who had mainly lost a family member was found to improve anger towards the deceased, anger towards self, anxiety, depression, grief, guilt, puzzlement and shame. 38 There is also recent evidence that a brief CBT family intervention with a trained psychiatric nurse resulted in fewer maladaptive grief reactions and less self-blame but there was no benefit found on complicated grief, depression or suicidal ideation. This is an under-researched area and there is a pressing need for methodologically sound RCTs to evaluate the effectiveness of in terventions aimed at supporting people who have been bereaved by suicide. While this is a challenging study design to implement in this field, the recently published RCT of family-based CBT illustrates that it is feasible. Some specific issues to consider are: Studies need to be large enough to detect an e ffect, where one exists. When the inclusion criteria of studies are likely to lead to a heterogeneous sample, sample size calculations should take into account the need for analys is investigating the impact of key potential prognostic factors such as gender and length of time since loss. Group therapeutic interventions can be defined as complex and this needs to be given consideration when designing studies and especially in relation to defining the intervention. Complex interventions have been described as interventions that have several components which may act independently or interdependently resulting in difficulties in defining, developing, documenting and reproducing the intervention. 108, 109 A framework for the evaluation of complex interventions has emph asised the importance of preliminary work, using qualitative or quantitativ e methods, prior to the main trial. The framework recommends identification of the probable active comp onents of the intervention and the underlying mechanisms to identify the optimum intervent ion followed by an exploratory study to investigate acceptability and feasibility of t he intervention as well as defining the most appropriate comparator.108, 109 In addition, using process evaluation embedded within an RCT of complex interventions can help to distin guish interventions that have failed from interventions that were poorly implemented.110-112 22 Currently it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between studies because of their diversity in outcomes and outcome measures . It would help development of the evidence- base in this field if a core set of outcome measures could be used across all future studies. This would involve consideration of the reliab ility and validity of individual measures; whether to use generic scales of anx iety and depression and/or specific measures of grief;113 and whether there are aspects of grief specific to bereavement by suicide that need to be measured. Given that grief related to bereavement can be culture-specific, consideration should be given to likely generalisability to differ ent ethnic groups. Research is required on the effectiveness of interventions in different ethnic groups. The potentially different responses of males and females, people of different ages and social backgrounds, as well as those experiencing complicated grief also needs investigation. The field would benefit from better reporting of studies through adherence to the guideline provided in Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement114 and, where relevant, the Transparent Reporting of Eval uations with Non-randomised Designs (TREND) W, Schut H.

Survivors of suicides that took place between January 1999 and December 2001 in East Baton Rouge Parish received the intervention. Individuals in the control group either lived outside of the area or the suicide occurred prior to January 1999 Participants Number of participants recruited Intervention: n = 50 Comparison: n = 76 There were a total of 83 suicides Age groups participating Adults and children Ages Intervention: Mean 40.62 (SD 12.12), Range 18-61 years Comparison: Mean 38.97 (SD 15.37), Range 14-85 years Relationship to deceased Intervention: Mixed group - Wife (18%); mother (16%); sister (4%); (10%); father (14%); friend (6%); girlfriend (8%); son in law (4%); other relationships with a frequency of less than 3% (14%) Comparison: Mixed group - Wife (13%); (6.5%); friend (7.9%); husband (6.5%); son (7.9%); other relationships with a frequency of less than 3% (18.6%) Time since bereavement Intervention: Mean 1.26 months 42.11 months (108.46), Range 0.1-534.2 months Males Intervention: n = 18 Comparison: n = 27 Interventions Setting Intervention: Intervention was administered at scene of suicide Comparison: Not applicable Family, group or individual intervention Intervention: Group Comparison: Not applicable Professionally led or self-help Intervention: Professionally led Comparison: Not applicable Description of intervention and comparison Intervention: Active postvention model known as the Local Outreach to Survivors of Suicide program (LOSS). Staffed by a team of responders to the scenes of suicide as close to time of death notification as possible. The aim of the LOSS team is to provide comfort and advice for those bereaved by suicide Comparison: Survivors that had not been visited by the LOSS team (passive model of postvention) Description of delivery Intervention: Calls to the LOSS team initiated by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office. The response team is in addition to the traditional first responders - such as police, coroners etc. and aims to refer survivors for help. Comparison: Not applicable Length of treatment Intervention: Unclear-responders assisted the newly bereaved at the scene of suicide Results Number of participants lost to follow up None - retrospective study Reasons for dropping out Intervention: Not applicable - all individuals bereaved by suicide who came to the crisis centre for an assessment between January 1 1999 and December 31 2000 were included. Comparison: Not applicable - as above Any differences between those who dropped out and those who didn't Intervention: Not reported Comparison: Not reported Details of statistical analysis Used t-tests and chi-squared tests to investigate differences between those receiving the intervention and those who did not in terms of age, gender, race, relationship to the deceased. Primary outcome was the time elapsed from suicide to assessment at the urban crisis centre Results Outcome: Length of time between suicide and bereaved seeking treatment (days) Intervention: Mean 37.7 days (SD 61.2) Comparison: Mean 222.2 days (SD 240.7). p<.001 This was an independent t-test with nine outliers (for length of time since bereavement) in the control group excluded Comments Statistical analysis seemed inappropriate as parametric tests were used (t-tests) and the data did not appear to be normally distributed - the standard deviations were larger than the means. Although patients were recruited to the study through self-referral, the actual intervention was received on the basis of professional- referral (the coroner). Nine study participants were eliminated from the comparative analysis as extreme outliers (more than 3 years had elapsed between the time of suicide and assessment). This gave an adjusted control mean time since bereavement of 7.41 months (SD=8.02 months) - used in the subsequent analyses. The intervention was categorised as a group intervention as it appears to be whoever is present at the scene is involved, however it could also have been administered on a one-to-one basis. Very limited range of potential prognostic criteria measured. It was unclear if the study was appropriately powered. 46Ethnicity Intervention: Caucasian (n=48) Black (n=2) Education Intervention: Not reported Comparison: Not reported Any other socioeconomic or cultural data None reported Any other additional potential prognostic factors reported? No Were there any baseline differences between the groups? No - statistical analysis (t-tests and chi-square) showed no significant differences between the two groups for race, gender or age How were the participants recruited? Self-referral Any information reported about the deceased? No Were there any inclusion/exclusion criteria? No - all individuals bereaved by suicide who came to the crisis centre for an assessment between January 1 1999 and December 31 2000 were included Comparison: Not applicable Length of follow-up Retrospective study Implemented by Intervention: Mental health workers and survivors of suicide Comparison: Not applicable Details of professional background Intervention: LOSS team comprises of centre staff (8 mental health workers) from a 24-hour crisis intervention centre and volunteers (4) who are survivors of suicide. Comparison: Not applicable Specific training to implement intervention Intervention: Yes. Trained in crisis intervention, critical incidence stress debriefing, facilitating survivor grief recovery and in responding to the scenes of suicide. No details provided of content of training Comparison: Not applicable Any further details Intervention: Members of the intervention team completed the BDI, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Hayes- Jackson Bereavement survey each 60 days Comparison: Nine study participants were eliminated from the comparative analysis as extreme outliers (more than 3 years had elapsed between the time of suicide and assessment). This gave an adjusted control mean time since bereavement of 7.41 months (SD=8.02 months) - used in the subsequent analyses 47 Study details Author Constantino(2001)35 Related to Constantino (1996)41 Title Group intervention for widowed survivors of suicide Country US Study design RCT How were participants assigned to groups?

The group leader had an active role in defining, setting and assisting participants to achieve realistic goals. It emphasised the 12 curative factors of group psychotherapy as formulated by Yalom (1985). Groups of 4 to 6 participants were set up Comparison: Social Group Postvention (SGP) Promoted socialisation, recreation and leisure. Reflected the work of Iso-Ahola (1980) and Neulinger (1981). The focus was on encouraging group members to engage in planning weekly activities. Groups of 4 to 6 participants were set up Description of delivery Intervention: The sequence of content for the sessions were planned, structured and phase Results Number of participants lost to follow up Total: 13 (excluded from analysis as they attended less than 4 group sessions) Not reported separately for intervention and comparison Reasons for dropping out Not reported Any differences between those who dropped out and those who didn't Intervention: Not reported Comparison: Not reported Details of statistical analysis One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess change from baseline to the three follow-up points. The Bonferroni correction was applied and a significant p-value was set at <.001. Where there was a significant time effec t, post-hoc analysis was used to assess whether there was a significant difference between baseline and 2 months; between 2 months and 6 months; and between 6 months and one year. Number of participants in analysis: total n=47 Results The authors reported that there were no statistically significant differences between the SGP and BGP at baseline or at any of the follow-up points (data not reported). The follow-up data was reported for both groups combined BDI Mean tests: the change from baseline to 2mth follow-up was One way ANOVA p=.0001. Post hoc tests: the change between baseline and 2mth follow-up Comments Outcome assessment was by self-report Details of analysis not reported for between group comparison and the two groups were combined for the before and after analysis Self-selected group of participants No information on dropouts and whether they differed in the two groups Both groups receive an active intervention. Due to the lack of control group it is difficult to establish whether the improvement over time would have happened regardless of the interventions Limited range of potential prognostic data reported and this was reported for both groups combined It was unclear if the study was appropriately powered 48lived with their children, 60% were Protestant Not reported separately for intervention and comparison * This demographic data refers to the 47 participants who attended all eight group sessions and were included in the analysis Any other additional potential prognostic factors reported? No Were there any baseline differences between the groups? Unclear- the authors reported that there were no statistically significant differences between the SGP and BGP groups at baseline (data not reported) but this seemed to refer to the participants who were included in the analysis and not all participants at baseline. It was unclear whether the groups were similar at baseline on demographic variables How were the participants recruited? Self-referral and professional referral Any information reported about the deceased? Method of suicide: gunshot (n=25) and carbon monoxide poisoning (n=19) Were there any inclusion/exclusion criteria? Unclear specific (no details provided). Delivery of BGP and SGP was monitored. Group content, focus and activity were assessed from group progress notes kept by the group leader and observations. Comparison: The sequence of content was primarily determined by the group participants and the group leader was responsible for creating a conducive environment.

An independent secretary administered randomisation and the numbers were concealed from the counsellors Participants Number of participants recruited Intervention: n = 41 families (74 participants) Comparison: n = 33 families (60 participants) Age groups participating Adults and adolescents >15 years old Ages Intervention: Mean 43 (SD 13.7) Comparison: Mean 43 (SD 13.5) Relationship to deceased Intervention: since Intervention: baseline measurement 2.5 months after the suicide Comparison: as above Males Intervention: n = 48 (41%) Comparison: n = 12 (22%) Ethnicity Intervention: not reported Comparison: not reported Education Comparison: high 43%; middle 34%; low 23% Any other socioeconomic or cultural data Intervention Setting Intervention : family home Comparison : usual care settings Family, group or individual intervention Intervention : family Comparison : usual care Professionally led or self-help Intervention : professionally led Comparison : n/a Description of intervention and comparison Intervention : family-based grief counselling programme using cognitive behaviour therapy. The programme addressed the problems of the complete family system rather than individual participants. The programme aimed to provide a reference frame for grief reactions, engage emotional processing, enhance effective interaction and improve problem solving. Participants were provided with an information manual on suicide and bereavement, homework, a bibliography and a list of further sources of support. Comparison : usual care (no further information provided) Description of delivery Intervention: The content of the sessions was discussed with the family at the first session. Cognitive restructuring and consolidation of support were fixed topics provided in the first and second sessions. Optional topics were also provided. Each family was counselled by one nurse Comparison: n/a Results Number of participants lost to follow up Intervention: 2 families (6 participants) Comparison: 2 families (6 participants) Reasons for dropping out Intervention: geographic objection n=2; removed n=2; unable to arrange sessions within timeframe n=2 Comparison: wanted to leave trouble behind n=2; untraceable n=1; reason unknown n=3 Any differences between those who dropped out and those who didn't The withdrawal group showed slightly more favourable mean baseline scores for depression, complicated grief and self blame compared to the group who completed (these differences were statistically significant) Details of statistical analysis Primary outcome: self-reported complicated grief (Inventory of Traumatic Grief) Secondary outcomes: Depression (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESDS)); suicidal ideation (using four questions used in a prevalence study); perception of being to blame for the suicide (three questions using a Likert scale); Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L - a semi-structured questionnaire administered by trained nurses not involved in the counselling) The authors state that data were analysed on an intention to treat basis. t-tests were used for normally distributed cont inuous variables and x\u00b2 for dichotomous vari ables. Analysis of covariance was used to compare between group follow-up scores adjusted for baseline differences in sex, having lived with the deceased, and closeness of relationship. The analyses were also adjusted for clustering of symptoms within families. The analysis of suicidal ideation and self-blame were also Comments The study was powered to detect a difference of 0.6 SD in ITG scores (primary outcome) with 80% power and two-sided p value of 0.05 (based on a intracluster coefficient of 0.1 and mean cluster size of two) The analyses were adjusted to take into account the clustering of symptom scores in family groups 53In paid employment Intervention: 54% Comparison: 48% Any other additional potential prognostic factors reported?

A greater proportion of the intervention group was male and had lived with the deceased compared to the comparison group. There were also more parents and fewer children in the intervention group than the comparison group How were the participants recruited? Coroners reported suicide deaths to the research team who then contacted relevant GPs. Participants were recruited through GPs.

Controls were contacted by letter, phone or both two months following completion of the pre-program questionnaire for responses to the \"after\" questionnaire. The first 22 respondents were then classified as the control group; 82% responded within 3 months, the remainder had responded within 6 months Description of delivery Intervention: Reading material from various books and articles was Results Number of participants lost to follow up Intervention: No reports of any loss to follow-up but only individuals who completed the 8 sessions returned questionnaires were included.

Comparisons were made between the groups at T2 and T3 for each of the feelings and the changes between T2 and T3 within each group were examined. P- values were presented for some comparisons although no details of statistical tests employed were reported.

The retrospective baseline data has not been extracted. Only the baseline data prior to commencing the intervention was extracted Anger (towards deceased) Baseline: Intervention vs. visiting int vs. 35%comp); work (40% int vs. 55% comp) ; reviewing pictures (55% int vs. 50% comp); talking with family/friends (85% int vs. 90% comp). Note: All data extrapolated from graphs Were there any baseline differences between the groups? Yes The authors state there were significant differe nces in kinship to the deceased between the two groups, though it was unclear whether the difference was statistically significant. There was a statistically significant difference between groups in the health of the participants since the suicide: 55% of each group stated that their health had remained the same, 33% of those in the intervention group and 41% in the comparison group stated health had got worse and 8% in the intervention group and 5% of the comparison group stated that health had become better (significance level not reported). Answers to the \"before\" questionnaire showed that feelings of grief, shame and guilt were significantly higher for those in the intervention than comparison group (% of participants reporting high and moderate rates of intensity combined): grief=86% vs. 73%, p<0.05; shame the group had helped them; 56% rated 7/7 (very beneficial) 24% rated 5/7 and 10% rated it 4/7. About half stated that there were too few sessions, 41% felt that the number of sessions was \"just right\". A total of 89% of participants stated that they would recommend the programme to others. Suggestions for possible improvements to the sessions included: more structure; more practical advice; more professional input; having a variety of losses in each group - rather than putting people with similar losses together - the details of this allocation was not reported 58How were the participants recruited? Participants were recruited a mixture of self-referral (about 5% in each group), professional referral (around 10-15% in each group) suggestion from a friend (about 17-27% in each group) or other methods Any information reported about the deceased? No Were there any inclusion/exclusion criteria? It appears that only individuals who completed the course and completed the before and after questionnaires (for the intervention group) or who completed the before questionnaires but did not take part in the intervention (for the comparison group) were included 59 Study details Author Kovac (2000)36 Title Writing projects: lessening undergraduates' unique suicidal bereavement Country US Study design RCT How were participants assigned to groups?

They were asked to explore their deepest emotions in relation to their loss (this was intended to be similar to Pennebaker (1989)). They were asked to try and write continuously for the 15 minutes, repeating themselves or trying to get more detailed if they ran out of things to write Comparison: TWC Participants were given different writing instructions each day which asked them to describe their bedroom as precisely and objectively as possible, what they had eaten that day, what they had done that day, what they planned to do that day etc. They were asked to avoid mentioning their emot ions, feelings or opinions. They were asked to try and write continuously for the 15 minutes, repeating themselves or trying to get more detailed if the ran out of things to Results Number of participants lost to follow up Intervention: n=5 Comparison: n=7 Reasons for dropping out Intervention: One participant dropped out of the PWC group immediately following the intervention and 4 did not complete the outcome assessment at 8 weeks (reasons not reported).

No Were there any baseline differences between the groups? There was a statistically significant difference (p=.046) in closeness to loved one (for those completing the pre and post measures only): the mean score for the PWC group indicated a closer relationship.

University undergraduates who had lost a loved one by suicide in say Description of delivery Intervention : Each day, participants received the same writing instructions verbally and in writing. Participants were asked not to discuss their topics with other people in their class as different people were writing about different topics. Writing took place in a small lab room with no other participants present. One researcher, blinded to group allocation met with participants for a few minutes after session 2 and 3 to assess how the writing was going and to encourage the participant to \"get into their writing as much as possible\" because the writing was an integral part of the study. Participants were provided with the contact details of counselling services on campus and in the area.

They also rated 8 items on a 7-point Likert scale (1=not at all to 7 = a great deal): how much their essays were personal, meaningful, severe, revealing of emotions, how much they talked to others, actively held back from talking to others about their essays, how much their essays were still affecting their lives. On all 4 days the PWC group reported their essays were more personal, more meaningful, more revealing of their emotions, more severe, they wanted to talk about their essays more, talked about their essays more and held back from talking about their essays more that the TWC group (p<.001) 62 Study details Author Pfeffer (2002)37 Title Group intervention for children bereaved by the suicide of a relative Country US Study design RCT How were participants assigned to groups? Families were assigned in alternating order to receive the intervention.

The intervention comprised of (1) psychoeducational components: discussing children's concepts of death and its permanence; identifying feelings of grief; defining suicide; discussing why people commit suicide; discussion prevention of children's suicidal urges; enhancing children's skills in problem solving and (2) supportive components: facilitating children's expressions of grief and their identification with positive attributes of the deceased but avoidance of suicidal urges and hopelessness. it was based on theoretical models of attachment (Bowlby, 1980), responses to loss (Ness & Pfeffer, 1990; Parks 1996; Stroebe et al, 1993) and cognitive coping (Lazarus & Folkman, Results Number of participants lost to follow up Intervention: n=7 children (from 3 families) Comparison: n=27 children (from 20 families) Reasons for dropping out Intervention : Dropout occurred after initial assessment whilst waiting to begin intervention. Difficulty keeping the appointments (55%), did not want to talk about the death (45%). Comparison : Families too busy to schedule appointments (60%), did not want to talk about the loss (20%), sought intervention elsewhere (20%). Dropout was significantly higher in comparison group than intervention group (p<0.0001) Any differences between those who dropped out and those who didn't Intervention: Not reported Comparison: Not reported Details of statistical analysis Fisher exact tests and t-tests were used to compare the baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups. Outcome variables to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention were: anxiety (RCMAS); depression (CDI); posttraumatic stress (CPTSRI); social adjustment parents' (BDI). The mean difference between measurements T1 and T2 (approx. 12 weeks apart) was used to indicate intervention efficacy using ANCOVA. Two other measurements were calculated: (T2- T1)/T1 = change relative to initial T1 score; or (T2-T1)/time between assessments = indicator of rate of change per unit time. Multiple children families were controlled using mixed Comments Completion rates: intervention = 82%; comparison = 25% Drop-out rates clearly different across the two groups - much greater loss to follow- up in the no intervention group ANCOVA analysis inappropriate -due to small sample size in control group Participants in the no intervention group were permitted to seek alternative therapy - 20% sought the intervention elsewhere and this was cited as a reason for drop- out, thus potentially contaminating the results 63Hispanic 19% (n=7) Education Intervention: Not reported Comparison: Not reported Any other socioeconomic or cultural data factors reported?

Yes. Children assigned to receive the intervention and were younger than those assigned to no intervention (p<0.02). Children assigned to the intervention had better initial social adjustment than those in the comparison group (p<0.005) Baseline characteristics for the two groups were also reported for only the participants who completed the study: for those who completed the study participants in the intervention group were significantly younger than children in the non intervention group (9.8yrs (SD 3.0) vs 12.2 yrs (3.3) Children retained to the intervention 1984). Parents were helped to understand childhood bereavement, foster children's expressions of grief, discuss the suicide, identify children's morbid reactions, and promote children's emotional and social functioning. Support was provided for parents to ventilate grief. The intervention was documented in an intervention manual (available from the primary author). Other interventions were not received. The intervention was offered separately but simultaneously to parents. Comparison: Did not receive the intervention. Were permitted to seek and receive other interventions from elsewhere, such as pastoral or school counselling or individual psychotherapy. Description of delivery Intervention: Groups of 2-5 children, grouped by age (6-9 yrs,10-12 yrs,13-15 yrs). Siblings were in groups together unless problems identified in discussing concerns in the presence of siblings. Weekly supervision of group leaders and intervention sessions videotaped and rated for adherence to the manual using the therapist performance scale (adequate interrater reliability and internal consistency reported) by a trained evaluator. Inadequate adherence was addressed through discussion with group leaders. All the group leaders were classified as adhering to the manual for each intervention session Comparison: Not applicable effects models. Confounders were defined as variables significantly associated with T1 scores or if the variable at T1 was significantly different between intervention groups. Repeated measures multiple ANOVA performed to assess change over time within groups controlling for initial T1 scores, age and time between T1 and T2.

They mainly attempted to offer a place to express pain, compare experiences, teach new adaptation strategies, overcome isolation, express emotions, understand reactions, regain a sense of life and work through bereavement The main difference between the interventions was the length of treatment: 2 months; 4 months; 6 months or 12 months The 12 month group also aimed to allow the survivors to become a source of support for one another Number of participants in each (closed) group session 2 month group: 5-8 Results Number of participants lost to follow up Participation in the evaluations varied: the proportion of participants retained at T4 compared to baseline were: 2 month group: 52% 4 group: 7% 12 month group: 31% Reasons for dropping out No reasons reported - acknowledged by the authors as a problem Any differences between those who dropped out and those who didn't No details reported Details of statistical analysis The main outcomes were depression (BDI) and grief (Tessier Scale of Grief) No details about any statistical tests were reported Results Beck Depression Inventory: Scores were defined as mild depression (11-16); moderate depression (17-26); severe depression (26+) Comments The results may have two typographical errors; the mean grief scores at T1 and T2 for the 4 month group. These values fall outside of the range of scores (24-155) on the Tessier scale The numbers of participants in each group is very small and loss to follow-up varied, but on average was rather high.

All of the groups started with the participants introducing themselves. Participants then went on to discuss various feelings such as: loss; attempt to understand emotions; to 'draw a line'; to discuss anger, guilt, emotions, shock. Length of treatment 2 month group : Eight 2.5 hour weekly sessions plus one session of follow-up, 1 month after the sessions had finished 4 month group: Eight 2 hour fortnightly sessions plus 3 follow- up sessions that took place 2 months, 4 months and 8 months after the end of the sessions. 6 month group: Eleven 3 hour fortnightly sessions plus 1 follow-up session that took place 8 weeks after the end of the sessions. Participants were also invited to attend an annual commemoration. 12 month group: Seventeen 2.5 hour sessions that were distributed throughout the course of the year. Follow-up was included in the programme, a post-programme service was also offered on a voluntary basis, whereby survivors can take part in open 'self-help' meetings which are held once a month and led by suicide survivors. Length of follow-up T2(n=7):Mean in the original study by Tessier (n=358)- mean 79 (SD 29), range 24- 155 in No formal statistical tests were performed, and the results were discussed narratively. It was noted that the levels of grief remained generally stable over time for each of the groups, whereas the depression scores 69High(n=2),moderate(n=9),low (n=6),little or none (n=8) 4 month group: group: High(n=0),moderate(n=1),low or none (n=10) Length of relationship with deceased (years)- 2 month group: mean 23, range 4-41 4 month group: mean 26, range 3-51 6 month group: mean 15, range 1-41 12 month group: mean 22, range 7-35 The psychopathology (information on childhood, previous psychopathological problems) of the participants was also evaluated (using questions from the epidemiological study, Sant\u00e9 Quebec). In general, the problems reported the most were depression, substance abuse, anxiety and schizophrenia in some cases. It was also reported that between 6 and 13% of participants had lived away from their families for periods of 6 months to 16 years Were there any baseline differences between the groups? It was reported that \"despite the variations [in family history] between the groups, the data suggest that there are more similarities than differences between the participants of the groups\". The number of participants with reported mental health problems is highest in the 4 month group and lowest in the 12 month group. As for loss in childhood, the data do not allow the identification of any real differences Outcomes were measured at 4 different times (over a period which could last over 2 years): baseline (pre-group); immediately after the last support group meeting (post-group); 6 months after the end of the sessions and 12 months after the end of the sessions Implemented by All of the groups were led and facilitated by health professionals (psychologists/nurses etc.) Number of leaders- 2 month group: 2 4 month group: 2 6 month group: 1 or 2 12 month group: 2 Details of professional background No further details reported Specific training to implement intervention Nothing reported Any further details No diminished for each group over time The authors conclude that perhaps the 2 month programme is too short to have a realistic effect, and the programme of 12 months is too long. Programmes of an intermediate length, such as the 4 and 6 month programmes may be more effective However, further research, with more accurate means of measurement and semi-structured interviews, using a control group, is required 70between the groups How were the participants recruited?
