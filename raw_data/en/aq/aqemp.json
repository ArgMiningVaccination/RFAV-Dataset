JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING \u0000 GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 3 Welcome to the Spring 2022 edition of Connections, the annual publication for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department (ECE) of the A. James Clark School of Engineering. As we resumed in-person classes this fall, I know I feel the same sentiment as many: great joy to be back together on campus. As of November 2021, more than 98 percent of faculty, staff, and students of the University of Maryland have been vaccinated, and with masks being mandatory in campus buildings, the COVID transmission rate has been extremely low. While classes and labs are full of students, departmental events are being held in-person but with virtual options to provide flexibility for those who still wish to attend remotely. We are navigating our new hybrid environment, incorporating innovative technologies into education, business operations, and research, and getting used to our new normal. For this issue of Connections, we are pleased to highlight ECE's progress in robotics and autonomous systems, an area that we are planning to significantly grow in the next few years. Robots are transforming the future in many ways, from cloud-connected home robots to drone-use for public security, autonomous vehicles, robots for healthcare, and more. Researchers in ECE are working diligently to advance the field, creating applications and solutions in a number of exciting areas. The new Undergraduate Minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, administered by the Maryland Robotics Center (MRC), part of the Institute for Systems Research (ISR), was launched this fall with great interest from students in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science. In addition, we are thrilled to announce the hiring of two new assistant faculty members who will be joining the department in Fall 2022. These individuals will bring diverse experience and knowledge in the field of machine learning. Dr. Sanghamitra Dutta's research focuses on machine learning, information theory, and statistics with applications to algorithmic fairness, explainability, policy, and law. Dr. Kaiqing Zhang's research interests include machine/reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, game theory, and control theory. ECE is planning to significantly grow its faculty ranks over the next several years in multiple strategic areas. This year, we are conducting faculty searches in computer engineering, microelectronics, cybersecurity, robotics and automation, AI and machine learning, and quantum technology. To address the continually changing landscape of electrical engineering education, the Electrical Engineering program has undergone some major changes. We have completely revamped our EE curriculum, reducing the number of required courses to make room for more senior electives so that students can have more flexibility in focusing on one of several possible specialization tracks. We are also making changes to the Honors Program by creating more experiences for students to fulfill the honors requirements, including adding a \"service learning\" component. Faculty in the department have received many large grants to fund research on exciting areas of importance. The Quantum Technology Center has received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for a variety of projects, including a competitive $5M phase 2 Convergence Accelerator award to develop quantum interconnects for ion trap quantum computers. Prof. Pamela Abshire has received nearly $3M NSF funding to enhance understanding of how the parts of a single neuron contribute to neuronal networks' overall learning and computation abilities. Prof. Min Wu has also received funding from NSF for a new $1.2M grant for AI research into the relationship between ECG and PPG monitoring technologies. Our ECE faculty members have won many prestigious awards this year from both the University and professional societies, with a strong footing in IEEE awards and recognitions. Prof. Min Wu has been elected 2024 President of the IEEE Signal Processing Society; Prof. Yanne Chembo has been elected to the IEEE Photonics Society Board of Governors; Prof. Gang Qu has been named a Fellow of IEEE; Prof. Alireza Khaligh won the prestigious Nagamori Award; Prof. Pamela Abshire was named a Distinguished Scholar-Teacher by UMD; and College Park Prof. and former ECE Chair Rama Chellappa has been named a National Academy Inventor. ECE has also been committed to improving the spaces in which students learn, study, and take their breaks. Specifically, I'd like to give a special mention of appreciation to ECE alumnus Mr. Gary Connor ('73). Mr. Connor has generously invested in the ECE Department's Undergraduate Advising and Mentoring Fund this year, which has made an immediate impact on students in our department, ranging from expanding tutoring and advising programs to providing resources to design a new maker-space undergraduate lab. The time, prowess, and financial support of our alumni, whether personal or through industry sponsorship, are vital to the success of our programs. It is my hope that you will take the opportunity to help ECE in whatever way is most purposeful to you.

I started o at Montgomery College (MC), where I got my Associates Degree in General Studies with a STEM concentration. My hobbies included making YouTube videos about technology and being physically active (going to the gym/sporting activities, etc.). Why did you choose the ESIOT Program? I chose the program because it gave me the opportunity to be a pioneer in a new and emerging eld. There was also the convenience factor, which came from the program being out of the Universities at Shady Grove, which was closer to home. I heard about the program through a seminar at MC. What project have you enjoyed the most thus far in your coursework?There have been a multitude of projects that I have enjoyed working on while in the program. It's dicult to choose because there is a lot of overlap in the program and the projects we do. An example of this would be the project in which we used the MX chip and connected it to the Azure cloud and utilized a machine-learning algorithm to predict the weather. What are you looking forward to this year in the program?This year I am looking forward to my capstone project and taking some of my classes in person. What are your plans after graduation? After graduation, my plan is to get a job in product management/solutions architecture in the STEM eld, and then possibly go on to get my M.B.A. MEET KELVIN QUACOE, SECOND-YEAR ESIOT STUDENTThe Bachelor of Science in Embedded Systems and Internet of Things (ESIOT) is the latest bachelor's degree program oered by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, and the rst undergraduate engineering program to be held at the Universities at Shady Grove in Rockville, Md. The program's curriculum is a combination of relevant topics from electrical and computer engineering, computer science, and networking. It is a two-year program intended for transfer students pursuing a STEM program at any community college in Maryland. The curriculum is unique and provides rigorous training in hardware and software with specializations in networks, cybersecurity, and machine learning. Students develop foundational knowledge in their junior year, including analog circuits, discrete mathematics, computer organization, networks, and microelectronics. Students also learn C, Python, Java, and Verilog coding. Senior-level coursework includes courses on rmware development, real-time operating systems, network security, hardware security, machine learning focused on embedded systems, and a year-long culminating capstone design project. The balance between theory and real-world, hands-on experience rmly grounds students in solid engineering principles that prepare them to pursue exceptional careers in software and hardware development, data analytics, application development, cybersecurity analytics, and more. \"Embedded systems and IoT have been transformative in many facets of our economy,\" says ESIOT Program Director and Professor Romel (Mel) Gomez. \"This includes manufacturing, transportation, building infrastructure, healthcare, logistics, weather prediction, disaster management, agriculture, energy sustainability, intelligent homes, and of course, entertainment, to name a few. Many companies utilize this technology to improve products and services, reduce cost, and expand markets while protecting from malicious cyber threats.\" To learn more about the program, visit shadygrove.ece.umd.edu. CONN ECTIONS SPRING 2022 5 A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGYThe Electrical Engineering program is undergoing a major change. The department is reducing the number of required courses to make room for more 400-level electives so that students get more flexibility in their major, and can pursue more topics that are of interest to them. To do this, most of the 300-level courses are changing to streamline some of the topics. In particular, the 303-313 and 381-382 sequences are each becoming a single course, and ENEE 200 is going to be allowed to satisfy one of the general-ed requirements. Faculty will dene \"tracks\" that will give guidance to students in terms of which 400-level courses they should take. The tracks will also be designed around the new required 300-level courses. In particular, although 303-313 and 381-382 are being consolidated, some of the more advanced topics from these courses will be moved to other courses that could be taken by students who are interested in the corresponding tracks. So, only a core set of topics from these courses will be required of all EE majors. Students who wish to dive more deeply can follow the corresponding track. There will also be a new math course taught by ECE faculty, which will combine dierential equations, linear algebra, and complex variables. This new math course will replace the current 246 course on dierential equations. This new math course will better prepare students for the 300-level ECE courses. These changes will also aect Computer Engineering students who may also take the new ECE math course and the new 300-level courses. Major Updates to the Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Program The department is creating more experiences for students to fulll the honors requirements, in particular adding a \"service learning\" component. For the new Honors Program, students can earn \"participation points\" in three areas: academic preparation, experiential learning, and service learning. The academic preparation area can be fullled by taking either honors (H) courses within the ECE majors, or by taking graduate-level courses. For the experiential learning area, students will complete either an academic or industry research project. For example, students could carry out research as part of an ENEE 499 course. For the service learning area, students will take a new course on service learning and will be given the opportunity to apply topics from the course by participating in one of several service activities. For example, being either a UTF or a tutor in the ECE tutor program. In total, students need to complete four participation points, and the four points need to come from at least two of the three aforementioned areas. Honors Program Completely Revamped 6Robotics: The Road to Innovative Research Programs CONN ECTIONS SPRING 2022featur eSTORY Autonomous Driving Autonomous driving has become one of the most anticipated technologies in both industry and academic research groups. Most of the current eorts in autonomous driving have found success in idealistic conditions such as sparse and homogeneous trac on highways and urban areas. Distinguished University Professor Dinesh Manocha's Geometric Algorithms for Modeling, Motion and Animation (GAMMA) research group is working on advanced autonomous driving research in highly dense and heterogeneous trac conditions that characterize social and psychological aspects of human drivers in uncertain environments. They have developed new techniques for perception, behavior modeling, and navigation in challenging urban environments. They are collaborating with many industry partners and have also released datasets for the research community. Robot Motion Planning and Navigation Manocha's group has also been working on single- and multi-robot planning algorithms. Their earlier work focused on proximity detection algorithms and systems, which are widely used in the research community and industry. They have also developed novel methods for multi-agent collision avoidance using reciprocal velocity obstacles and their extensions. All these methods have been integrated into ROS as well as game engines. Their recent work has focused on developing novel sensor-based navigation algorithms in dense indoor and outdoor environments with uneven terrains and crowded scenarios. The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department has expanded widely in the areas of robotics and autonomous systems. Robots are transforming the future in many ways, from cloud-connected home robots to drone-use for public security, autonomous vehicles, robots for healthcare, and much more. The use of robotics will increase productivity, reduce human error, save time, and prove to be safer to use in many dierent environments and ways. Researchers in the Department are conducting research in several aspects of robotics, and are gaining funding from a variety of organizations for their work. Self-Driving E-Scooters \"E-scooters are envisioned to be a vital part of a new urban mobility model that promises improvements in sustainability, accessibility, and equity over current modalities like cars and buses for short travel distances,\" says Derek Paley, Director of the Maryland Robotics Center. The EPA estimates that eliminating half of U.S. car trips less than one mile would save $575M/year in fuel costs and $900M/year in maintenance and tire replacement. Municipalities in the U.S. and internationally are serviced by scooter operators\u201438.5 million trips were taken on e-scooters in 2018, more than twice as many as the year before\u2014usually with appropriate permitting to enforce best practices concerning safety and etiquette. Large scooter fleets are expensive to maintain and do not guarantee easy access for riders. E-scooters that reposition themselves provide value to both end-users and operators by improving rider experience, increasing scooter usage, decreasing servicing costs, and aiding the regulatory process. Multi-Vehicle Control for Underwater Environment The long-term goal of this project, led by Professor Paley, is to enable teams of autonomous underwater vehicles to coordinate their movements without revealing their positions to an adversary, e.g. by interacting using passive sensing based on visual, hydrodynamic, tactile, and/or acoustic signals. The specific research objective is to apply tools from biology, engineering dynamics, fluid dynamics, and control systems to solve the problem of multi-vehicle control for close-proximity operations in the underwater domain. Derek Paley, director of the Maryland Robotics Center, recruited students to build a self-driving scooter at the University of Maryland. 7During Fall 2021, the University of Maryland began offering a new undergraduate minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS). With automated systems becoming more central to the STEM industries in which engineering and computer science graduates work, robotics has become a \"must-know\" eld. Robotics courses generate long wait lists and a demand for more classes and sections. The new minor is administered by the Maryland Robotics Center (MRC), part of the Institute for Systems Research within the Clark School of Engineering. The MRC currently provides technical direction to the Maryland Applied Graduate Engineering (MAGE) Master of Engineering program in Robotics and will expand its educational oerings with the introduction of the new cross-disciplinary minor. Qualied students in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science are eligible to apply to the program. \"We are pleased to partner with these four departments to oer the new RAS minor for undergraduate students in the participating departments,\" said MRC Director and Professor Derek Paley (AE/ISR). \"Our mission is to advance robotic systems, underlying component technologies, and applications of robotics through research and educational programs that are interdisciplinary in nature and based on a systems approach.\" The RAS minor will teach students about robotics design, control, and programming, as well as integrating robotics and autonomous systems. They will gain practical skills through coursework, group projects, and research, with an emphasis on hands-on experiences. The minor program will also include regular interactions with academic, corporate, and/or governmental leaders in robotics, who will serve as both mentors and professional contacts. Students will have the opportunity to become peer mentors and tutors themselves. An interdisciplinary research team led by the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) and in partnership with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) has entered into a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) worth up to $68M. The agreement brings together a large, diverse collaborative of researchers\u2014leveraging the University System of Maryland's national leadership in engineering, robotics, computer science, operations research, modeling and simulation, and cybersecurity\u2014to drive transformational advances in articial intelligence (AI) and autonomy. The ve-year agreement will accelerate the development and deployment of safe, eective, and resilient capabilities and technologies, from wearable devices to unmanned aircraft, that work intelligently and in cooperation with each other and with human actors across multiple environments. The robust eort encompasses three areas of research thrusts, each supported by a team of faculty, sta, and students. The new collaboration builds on a more than 25-year research partnership between UMD and ARL in AI, autonomy, and modeling and simulation to spur the development of technologies that reduce human workload and risk in complex environments such as the battleeld and search-and-rescue operations. The long-term goal of this cooperative agreement is to enable dual-use capabilities and technologies in uncrewed assets and smart devices that work intelligently in cooperation with each other and human actors across multiple domains. The specic research objectives include science-focused and science-led application of tools from engineering, computer science, operations research, cybersecurity, and robotics to solve the problem of endowing embodied mobile platforms and equipment with the requisite intelligence and autonomy to support high-tempo movement and maneuver, secure logistics, and enable situational awareness in complex environments while reducing human workload and risk.AI and Autonomy for Multi-Agent SystemsNew Undergraduate Minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 8A key challenge for robotics is ensuring safety and resilience in collaborative operation of human-robot teams (e.g. on the manufacturing floor, warehouse settings, maintenance operations), as well as in uncoordinated activity (e.g. humans at or near a crosswalk encountering highly automated cars). In the Intelligent Servosystems Laboratory (ISL), led by Professor P. S. Krishnaprasad, their current work is focused on understanding the problem of human activity in proximity to robots. Mathematical models of such activity are being developed by abstracting knowledge of observed regularities in human movements. The resulting models take the form of dierential equations on matrix Lie groups with control inputs. Just as models built on motion in the rigid motion group are pertinent to robotics, equations evolving on the ane group prove to be appropriate for representing human movement. Some empirical work in ISL along these lines includes measuring trajectory properties associated with human locomotion. Ongoing work has led to new insights into patterns of collectives on the ane group, suggesting applications to teams of multiple (human and robotic) agents. Some aspects of this work are generously supported by Northrop Grumman. Many alumni of ISL are making their mark in projects of national importance. Dr. Philip Twu is a Robotics System Engineer in the Aerial and Orbital Image Analysis Group of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is currently the systems engineer for rover navigation on the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover mission. The rover is designed to detect signs of ancient life and collect samples of rock and regolith (broken rock and soil) for possible return to Earth. It was launched July 30, 2020, and will land February 18, 2021, on the Jezero Crater, Mars. Twu completed his B.S. in both electrical engineering and and computer science at the University of Maryland in 2008, and his Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012. Twu worked in ISL from 2007-2008. CONN ECTIONS SPRING 2022featur eSTORY Safety and Resilience in Collaborative Operation of Human-Robot Teams \"Smellicopter\" Drone used to Detect Chemicals in the Air Researchers from the University of Washington and the University of Maryland associated with the Air Force Center of Excellence on Nature-Inspired Flight Technologies and Ideas (NIFTI) have developed \"Smellicopter,\" an autonomous drone that uses a live antenna from a moth to navigate toward smells. Smellicopter also can sense and avoid obstacles as it travels through the air. The results were recently published in the journal IOP Bioinspiration & Biomimetics. NIFTI, established by the Air Force Oce of Scientic Research in 2015 with $9M in funding, is creating solutions for challenging problems related to small, remotely operated aircraft with ideas based on how animals move, navigate, and use their senses. The Clark School currently has four faculty involved in NIFTI eorts. Professor Pamela Abshire (ECE/ISR) is one of the ve NIFTI leads. She is joined by Professor Nuno Martins (ECE/ISR), Professor Miao Yu (ME/ISR) and ISR-aliated Associate Professor Timothy Horiuchi (ECE). Drones hold great potential for performing tasks in dicult, dangerous places, including search and rescue in unstable structures following a natural disaster or navigating a region with unexploded devices. To assist in these tasks, researchers are developing technology for drones that can sense chemicals in the air. But most articial sensors are not sensitive or fast enough to be able to nd and process specic smells while flying through patchy odor plumes. Smellicopter takes a dierent approach to get around these limitations by incorporating a live antenna from a moth as a sensor. Dr. George Kantor (Ph.D. '99) of Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture, is leading CMU's work in the USDA-NIFA AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA), which is focused on AI and robotics in agriculture. The work is being funded by the National Science Foundation. Kantor worked in ISL during his graduate studies. 9 A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGYThe University of Maryland, already a leader in autonomy and unmanned systems research, is poised for further innovation with the launch of a state-of-the-art facility at the University System of Maryland at Southern Maryland (USMSM). The new Southern Maryland Autonomous Research and Technology (SMART) Building, located in St. Mary's County, includes underwater, air, and land testing facilities that are expected to be utilized widely by researchers at UMD's A. James Clark School of Engineering, the Department of Computer Science, the Institute for Systems Research, the Maryland Robotics Center (MRC), and other departments, centers, and units at UMD. The $86M, 84,000-square- foot building is home to, among other labs and facilities, the Maryland Autonomous Technology Research and Innovation Xploration (MATRIX) Lab, which features an 80' by 60' open air-land lab with an amphibious pool, a hydrology lab featuring a circulating water channel with an 80 cm by 130 cm cross-section, an AR/VR capable research space, roof-top antenna farm, and outdoor ground and air vehicle testing. NEWLY-OPENED SMART BUILDING TO SPUR AUTONOMY RESEARCHRobot Companions For the past few years, Professor Gil Blankenship's research team has been developing robot \"companions\" for the elderly or inrm living at home. The robots are mobile, able to navigate in an enclosed space, and avoid people. All interaction with the robots are via voice command based on the Amazon Alexa system. Each robot is equipped with simple sensors, one or more cameras, and a high performance microcomputer with GPU capabilities. The robots are able to detect falls and report them via a wireless link, and they can report extended inactivity and other indicators of potential problems. They can provide reminders of medications or appointments. More recent versions can provide entertainment such as playing games (chess, Jeopardy) with their owners. Some can even dance with a person. They use video analytics (pose detection and tracking) to assess quality of movement and exercise, even teaching yoga. All robots are \"networked\" and can share information about their owners or other people they encounter in the home. Currently, Prof. Blankenship's students are developing small, fast robots that can collaborate to solve a maze in a \"team.\" The fastest team wins with plans to commercialize these robots in the near future. Foundational and Applied Research in Robotics Prof. John Baras has been leading research on robots, robotic arms, robotic grippers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), ground mobile autonomous robots, and autonomous cars. Foundational aspects of robotics research include trusted autonomy (autonomous systems that can self-monitor execution of tasks, self-correct execution, and self-learn), robots learning tasks, teaching robots tasks, models for human decision making, human-robot collaboration, safe learning, and models and methods for collaborative robotics. Applications include smart manufacturing, sophisticated manipulation tasks by robots, highway trac control and management, urban trac control and management, autonomous vehicle maneuvers (passing a car, changing lanes), collaborative robotics for search and rescue, for surveillance of factories for hazards and failures, for surveillance of agricultural elds, assisted living, and package delivery by autonomous ground and aerial vehicles. The research often utilizes inspiration from biology and physics. In almost all areas, a holistic systems approach is supported by pioneering methods and tool suites for Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Recently there is an eort to integrate model-based methods with data-based methods (i.e. machine learning (ML) and articial intelligence (AI)). The research involves a balanced approach between theory, applications, and hands-on experiments, and tests both via sophisticated simulations as well as with real robots in the lab or in the eld. The research is supported by two state-of-the-art laboratories, which Prof. Baras directs: the Systems Engineering and Integration Laboratory (SEIL), and the Autonomy Robotics and Cognition (ARC) Laboratory. There is a rich program of collaboration with industry and government labs and associated student internships. There is also close collaboration with researchers at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden. 10the 2020-2021 graduating clAss 229Bachelor of Science Degrees were awarded Northrop Grumman Amazon Capital One Microsoft Epic Systems Northrop Grumman JHU Applied Physics Lab (APL) Boeing Leidos NASAemployed or attending graduate school (72% employed, 10% grad school) employed or attending graduate school (69% employed, 11% grad school)TOP EMPLOYERS FOR CE: TOP EMPLOYERS FOR EE:COMPUTER ENGINEERING ELECTRICAL ENGINEERINGin the Fall in the Spring 80%82% Average Starting Salary$92K Average Starting Salary$79K65 16411student NEWS ECE Outstanding Academic Performance Award Zachary Breit ECE Service Award Timothy HendersonDaojun (June) Xu ECE Chair's Award, Electrical Engineering Benjamin HoneckerPratik RathoreBenjamin Seufert ECE Chair's Award, Computer Engineering John HeideMihailo RancicXinyi Shi Center for Minorities in Science and Engineering Service AwardExcel AlaleAshley Henriquez UNDERGRADUATE AWARDS Eleven students were recognized in Spring 2021 for excellence in academics, leadership, and service by the Clark School and ECE Department.

UMD Researchers Create On-Demand Cold Spots to Generate Electromagnetic Cone of Silence In modern society, we are accustomed to having electronic systems that always work, regardless of the conditions. Protection of sensitive electronics to interference through unwanted coupling between components or intentional electromagnetic attack is important to ensure uninterrupted service. However, the environments in which we operate are growing increasingly complex and the electromagnetic spectrum is more congested. Additionally, certain environments such as a passenger cabin on an aircraft or train can act as reverberant cavities, resulting in random fluctuations in signal levels. These eects are dynamic, so preventing signicant performance degradation necessitates an approach that is capable of adapting to changing conditions. An electromagnetic enclosure can be characterized by its scattering parameters, which are voltage to voltage transfer functions dening the behavior of transmission and reflection between inputs and outputs. One method of dynamically changing the scattering parameters is to install a programmable metasurface inside the cavity. A programmable metasurface consists of multiple unit cells, each of which can modify its reflection coecient, allowing the direction of reflected rays to be adjusted on the fly. Researchers in the Wave Chaos Group at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) have used this approach to create on-demand cold spots, or nulls in transmission, eectively generating an electromagnetic cone of silence. Their work, published on December 29, 2021, in Physical Review Research, used a binary tunable metasurface manufactured by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The relationship between commands and cavity scattering parameters is extremely complex, so simple linear techniques fail to converge. The team, led by electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student Benjamin Frazier, developed an ecient stochastic algorithm and experimentally demonstrated the ability to generate cold spots at arbitrary frequencies, with arbitrary bandwidths, and even when driving multiple inputs. \"Chaotic microwave cavities are extremely useful as surrogates to probe the behavior of electromagnetic waves in larger complicated enclosures and are used in many of the research projects being investigated both by our group and collaborators at facilities such as the Naval Research Lab,\" said Frazier. \"The ability to dynamically modify the cavity in a very detailed and controllable manner is a signicant advancement towards harnessing waves as they propagate through these rich scattering environments.\" Other authors of the paper include ECE Professors Thomas M. Antonsen and Edward Ott, and ECE Aliate and Physics Professor Steven M. Anlage.

STUDENT SPOTLIGHT: CATHERINE GAO Wylie Dissertation Fellowship Winners14 CONN ECTIONS SPRING 2022quantum research NEWS Micron-Scale NMR Spectroscopy using Diamond Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a widely used tool for chemical analysis and molecular structure determination. A conventional NMR spectrometer requires sample volumes of roughly a milliliter in order to obtain sucient sensitivity. In a paper published in PRX Quantum, a collaborative team of researchers led by Quantum Technology Center (QTC) Postdoctoral Fellow Dr. Nithya Arunkumar, under the guidance of QTC Director and Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Ronald L. Walsworth, demonstrate a quantum sensing technique using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum defects that improves the sensitivity of a high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, so measurements can be made on sample volumes small enough to contain just a single biological cell. To achieve this advance, the researchers used an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum defects in a diamond chip and utilized a technique called SABRE (signal amplication by reversible exchange) that boosts the attainable NMR signal by hyperpolarizing the nuclear spins in the sample. SABRE-enhanced NV-NMR may become a high-impact tool for biological applications, such as tracking and monitoring the chemical reactions of metabolites in single cells. NV quantum defects in a diamond are an exciting new modality for sensitive magnetic field sensing with high spatial-resolution and operation under ambient conditions, including NMR spectroscopy at small length scales (nanometers to microns). \"By combining the advantages of SABRE with nitrogen-vacancy centers, we have demonstrated the capability to perform high-resolution NMR at the level of a single cell,\" says Dr. Arunkumar. \"This is an important result and has broad applications in both biology and chemistry.\" The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded a $5M, two-year award to a multi-institutional team led by the University of Maryland to develop quantum interconnects for ion trap quantum computers. The team, QuaNeCQT (Quantum Networks to Connect Quantum Technology), is part of the 2020 Cohort's Quantum Technology Track, and one of 10 teams to be selected for a phase 2 award. Team members include Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor and Quantum Technology Center (QTC) Associate Director Edo Waks; Physics Assistant Professor and QTC Fellow Norbert Linke; and Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX) Executive Director and Division of IT Assistant Vice President/CTO Tripti Sinha. Additionally, the team includes the co-PIs of the NSF-funded Engineering Research Center for Quantum Networks (CQN): Dirk Englund of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Saikat Guha of the University of Arizona. This past year, the team has been developing the quantum version of a modem and router that will enable quantum computers to exchange quantum information over kilometer distances. They will deploy this technology in the Mid-Atlantic Region Quantum Internet (MARQI), UMD's regional quantum network footprint. The MARQI network will interconnect quantum computers at UMD, the Army Research Laboratory, MAX, and IonQ, with the potential for signicant future scalability. A quantum network would revolutionize numerous industries that take advantage of quantum computing including computing, banking, medicine, and data analytics. It would also connect multiple small quantum computers to powerful distributed quantum computers that can solve problems that have signicant societal impact. Quantum networks would signicantly increase the user base for quantum computers by providing secure access to end users as well as accuracy of the quantum computation. As quantum technology converges with the internet, a new technology sector would emerge bringing with it the potential for major economic growth by producing rapid technological innovation and creating a large number of new jobs for the future \"quantum workforce,\" just as the emergence of the internet did toward the late 20th century. UMD Wins $5M Phase 2 NSF Convergence Accelerator Award A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING \u0000 GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 15In Fall 2018, University of Maryland, state, and local leaders gathered with donors and supporters to celebrate the groundbreaking of the E.A. Fernandez IDEA (Innovate, Design and Engineer for America) Factory. Opening in early 2022 to students, faculty, and researchers, the IDEA Factory will incorporate open design to enable collaboration between diverse areas of engineering, business, and science. Experts in robotics, quantum technology, rotorcraft, and transportation will work alongside entrepreneurial students, faculty, and partners to inspire creative thinking, new products, and research breakthroughs. The 60,000-square-foot facility is connected to the Jeong H. Kim Engineering Building. With ve floors, the IDEA Factory will include open workspaces for students, dedicated areas for student competition teams, and a new home for UMD's student-run incubator, Startup Shell.It will house the Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center, Robotics Realization Laboratory, Quantum Technology Center, and Maryland Transportation Institute.The $50M project was made possible by private philanthropy supporting Fearless Ideas: The Campaign for Maryland, UMD's $1.5B fundraising campaign. UMD E.A. Fernandez IDEA Factory Set to OpenQTC Awarded $1.5M from DoE for Research on Quantum Diamond Magnetometers QTC has received $1.5M from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for their project titled \"High-Field Quantum Diamond Magnetometers\" in collaboration with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) spin-out commercializing fusion energy. Led by QTC Founding Director Ronald Walsworth and QTC Scientist Dr. Matthew Turner, their project utilizes advancements in quantum sensing with Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to enable diagnostic capabilities in extreme environments necessary for practical commercial fusion device operation and other applications using high magnetic elds. The three-year project is intended to focus on Quantum Information Science (QIS) with applications to fusion and plasma science. The goal of the project is to develop robust magnetometers, based on quantum defects in diamond, that can operate in the intense environment inside a tokamak fusion device. Arrays of high-eld (between 1 and 20 Tesla) magnetometers are necessary for control and performance optimization of fusion plasmas. No existing magnetometers are known to meet the requirements of the extreme radiation, magnetic eld, and temperature environment in a tokamak fusion device. Diamond is known to be robust to extreme radiation in other applications and theoretical estimates indicate that the diamond approach will be sensitive enough for the intended fusion applications. \"The DOE grant will enable experimental validation of the high-eld quantum diamond magnetometers and demonstration of robustness in extreme environments,\" said Walsworth, who is also a Minta Martin Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics. \"I'm pleased that the University of Maryland will be receiving new funding from the Department of Energy for projects in fusion energy sciences,\" said House Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer in the DOE announcement, whose district includes the University of Maryland. \"With this funding, the University of Maryland will help lead critical research on fusion energy, which is vital in our work to combat the climate crisis and move our nation toward cleaner sources of energy. I congratulate the University on this exciting funding and look forward to seeing the research they produce.\" Photo: Eric Kruszewski.A render of the Commonwealth Fusion CONN Laser System for Solid-State-Photonic Hybrid Quantum Systems & Laser and Detection System for Topological Light Sources\" Awarding oces: Air Force Oce of Scientic Research, Oce of Naval Research Dr. Hafezi's research focuses on nanophotonics and quantum optics.

Waks received the award for a \"Multi-Chamber Plasma Etching and Deposition System.\" Plasma processing systems are important research instruments widely used by faculty from a broad range of disciplines for making devices ranging from transistors to quantum circuits to biosensors. This new plasma etching and deposition system will allow faculty from across campus to conduct a wide variety of nanofabrication tasks, while providing indispensable tools for cutting-edge research and student training in many elds of science and engineering. WAKS RECEIVES UMD RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION FUND AWARDElectrical and Computer Engineering Assistant Professor and Quantum Technology Center (QTC) Fellow Cheng Gong, and rst-year Ph.D. students in his group, have recently published two papers related to 2D quantum materials sensors. Their paper, \"Understanding and Optimization of Graphene Gas Sensors,\" published in Applied Physics Letters, demonstrates their use of graphene (2D quantum materials) to sense toxic gas (NO2), with extreme sensitivity, which is the ability to detect one NO2 molecule out of 100 billions of neutral gas molecules background. \"The superior sensitivity results from the 'surface is all' nature of the atomically thin 2D quantum material,\" says Gong. \"Even a single molecule attached to the quantum membrane can cause an appreciable response.\" Their second paper, published in npj 2D Materials and Applications and titled \"Ambient Eect on the Curie Temperatures and Magnetic Domains in Metallic Two-Dimensional Magnets,\" revealed that 2D magnets are sensitive to the ambient (predominantly O2). Gong pioneered the discovery of the rst 2D magnet in 2017, and now steps further to study the interaction of 2D magnets with environments. \"Bulk magnets are robust against the environmental disturbance because the surface interaction stops there and protects the interior, but atomic-thin magnets are super sensitive,\" Gong explains. \"This environmental sensitivity gives us great opportunities to develop magnetoelectric sensors therefrom.\" \"Prof. Gong leveraged quantum materials to detect extremely tiny quantities of airborne molecules,\" says UMD Professor and QTC Founding Director Ronald Walsworth. \"This new capability has wide-ranging technological implications with positive societal benet, from chemical plant safeguarding, to diagnosis of early-stage disease, and avoidance of food spoilage.\" \"Innovative sensors such as those from the Gong Lab could positively impact Army capabilities due to their ability to detect toxic gases,\" says Fredrik Fatemi, Associate QTC Director & Branch Chief for Quantum Sciences, DEVCOM-Army Research Lab.

The NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Robust Quantum Simulation, announced on September 2, 2021, brings together computer scientists, engineers, and physicists from ve academic institutions and the federal government. Funded by a $25M award from NSF, researchers in the UMD-led institute will develop theoretical concepts, design innovative hardware, and provide education and training for a suite of novel simulation devices that can predict and understand quantum phenomena. \"Maintaining and growing our global leadership in quantum science and technology is important for the state of Maryland and a top strategic priority for its flagship campus, the University of Maryland,\" said UMD President Darryll J. Pines. \"The Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Robust Quantum Simulation positions us to tackle grand challenges in quantum information science and quantum computing, and it further elevates our region as the Capital of Quantum.\" Quantum simulation is a fundamental step toward realizing a world where general-purpose quantum computers can transform medicine, break encryption, and revolutionize communications. Andrew Childs, a UMD professor of computer science and co-director of the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS), is the lead principal investigator of the NSF award and will serve as director of the new institute. In addition to Childs, leadership roles in the NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Robust Quantum Simulation will be lled by Ian Spielman from NIST (associate director for research), Mohammad Hafezi from UMD (associate director for education), Gretchen Campbell from NIST (associate director for diversity and inclusion), as well as co-principal investigators Kenneth Brown and Christopher Monroe (Duke), Alicia Koll\u00e1r (UMD), and Je Thompson (Princeton).

Using only the articulatory coordination features of speech, the system can classify depression with an accuracy of 85-90 percent. It also is able to classify schizophrenia that presents with symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations with 89 percent accuracy. The goal is to incorporate this digital health technology system into a smartphone app that patients will nd easy to use between visits to a healthcare professional. They would be encouraged to use the app for their own health, security, and safety. The app would ask the patient questions, then use the articulatory markers present in their speech as they reply to alert their clinician to a worsening condition. A NEW WAY TO MONITOR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ISR Director Ankur Srivastava is the principal investigator for a three-year, $500K National Science Foundation Secure and Trusted Cyberspace award, \"A High Level Synthesis Approach to Logic Obfuscation.\" Use of untrusted foundries for integrated circuit (IC) fabrication has raised piracy and overproduction concerns. Logic/design locking (also known as logic obfuscation) can secure design details from an untrusted fabrication facility by incorporating a locking key that hides the circuit's functional and structural information. Prof. Srivastava's project will develop a system-level methodology to design locked digital circuits that are rendered useless if the attacker uses any incorrect key and are resilient to state-of-the art attacks such as a satisability attack (SAT). SRIVASTAVA WINS NSF FUNDING FOR IC FABRICATION SECURITY Professor Min Wu has received National Science Foundation (NSF) funding to use articial intelligence to develop a heart monitoring method that's as reliable as an electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2014the gold standard used in hospitals and clinics\u2014but as convenient as a device that can be worn at home. \"Explainable Learning of Heart Actions from Pulse to Broaden Cardiovascular Healthcare Access\" is a four-year, $1.2M NSF \"Smart Connected Health\" is collaborating with Assistant Professor Sushant Ranadive (SPH), an expert in cardiovascular physiology and kinesiology. The team is developing an innovative way to understand the relationship between results from an ECG\u2014where electrodes are placed on the patient's chest\u2014and those from a method known as photoplethysmogram (PPG), which measures cardiac activity by monitoring changes in blood volume beneath the skin through a sensor that could be worn on a nger. (While it's currently possible to obtain instant ECG data through a smartwatch or special smartphone attachment, these methods are impractical for long-term monitoring, the researchers said.) However, while PPG is cheaper, more convenient, and more accessible than traditional ECG testing, it provides less direct information on cardiac activity and is not as well understood by researchers or clinicians. The main goal of the NSF-funded project is to compensate for that gap by using AI to reconstruct ECG-quality results with PPG data, said Wu. The research team plans to work closely with Clifton Watt, M.D., a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, to transfer the substantial ECG medical knowledge base to the PPG domain. Using an existing dataset from other researchers, her team has already carried out preliminary studies on a few hundred hospitalized patients. The NSF funding will allow exploration of a wide range of research questions the team hopes will result in a user-friendly self-monitoring system. WU, RANADIVE DEVELOPING ACCURATE, CONVENIENT HOME HEART MONITORING SYSTEM 19 A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING GLENN L. MARTIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Somersaulting Photons In a paper published in the Journal Optica, Professor Howard Milchberg's group demonstrates the surprising result that photons in a vacuum can have orbital angular momentum (OAM) vectors pointing sideways\u2014at 90 degrees to the direction of propagation\u2014a result literally orthogonal to the decades-long expectation that OAM vectors could only point forward or backward. The research team, including graduate student and lead author Scott Hancock, postdoc Sina Zahedpour (EE Ph.D. '17), and Milchberg, did this by generating a donut pulse they dub an \"edge-rst flying donut,\" depicted in the diagram (its more technical name is \"spatio-temporal optical vortex\" or STOV). Here, the donut hole is oriented sideways, and because the rotational circulation now occurs around the ring, the angular momentum vector points at right angles to the plane containing the ring. To prove that this sideways-pointing OAM is associated with individual photons and not just the overall shape of the flying donut, the team sent the pulse through a nonlinear crystal (shown in diagram) to undergo a well-known process called \"second harmonic generation,\" where two red photons are converted into a single blue photon with double the frequency. This reduces the number of photons by a factor of two, which means each blue photon should have twice the sideways-pointing OAM\u2014and this is exactly what the measurements showed. As seen in the diagram, the angular momentum of the flying donut (or STOV)\u2014represented by the red and twice-longer blue arrows\u2014is the composite eect of a swarm of photons somersaulting in lockstep. The angular momentum conservation embodied by somersaulting photons may make STOV beams resistant to breakup by atmospheric turbulence, with potential application to free-space optical communications. In addition, because STOV photons must occur in pulses of light, such pulses could be used to dynamically excite a wide range of materials or to probe them in ways that exploit the OAM and the donut hole. \"STOV pulses could play a big role in nonlinear optics,\" says Milchberg, \"where beams can control the material they propagate in, enabling novel applications in beam focusing, steering, and switching.\" Biological systems\u2014brains, for example\u2014do the same things computers do: they engage in goal-oriented activity. They find, gather, process, structure, and manage information. They solve problems. Networks of neurons in brains are remarkably fast and efficient at solving pattern recognition and classification problems. In fact, they are far better at dealing with challenges like these than the most sophisticated computers. One of the reasons scientists want to better understand how the brain works is so they can develop better algorithms and engineering models to increase the speed and abilities of computers. So far, however, researchers have made only limited progress in understanding what underlies the brain's remarkable capabilities. For example, they do not yet understand the physical mechanisms inside a living neuron and its networked neighbors. Now, more than $2.9M in National Science Foundation funding will help University of Maryland researchers explore the \"rules of life\" of neuronal networks. Professor Pamela Abshire is the principal investigator and Professor Timothy Horiuchi and Professor Ricardo Araneda (biology) are the co-PIs for \"Learning the Rules of Neuronal Learning,\" a five-year grant in NSF's Emerging Frontiers \"Understanding the Rules of Learning\" program. The researchers will bring together recent technological advances in patterning, electrical recording, optical stimulation, and genetic manipulation of neurons to study how to nurture a healthy culture of neurons while continuously observing and stimulating them at fine scale. They hope to uncover how the individual parts of a single neuron contribute to the overall learning and computation of the neural network. The research should have significant implications for the scientific understanding of natural neuronal computation, and would introduce a completely new set of engineering tools for interacting with living neurons and exploring what is computationally possible. The project began Jan. 1, 2022.

Young Wook Kim (ECE Ph.D. '14) is the founder of ProxiHealthcare Inc., which manufactures the new TROMATZ toothbrush. First available in South Korea, the toothbrush employs the bioelectric effect to effectively attack the mouth's plaque and tartar biofilms. It has received FDA and FCC approval in the United States and is available for purchase on Amazon. Bacterial biofilms form in a variety of moist, inaccessible environments\u2014like the mouth\u2014where bacteria can adhere to complex curved surfaces like teeth. Given a little time, bacteria encase themselves in an extracellular matrix, forming biofilm. This matrix offers the bacteria significant protection and makes it easy for them to spread. Dental plaque, and its hardened state, tartar, are types of biofilm. Left unchecked, plaque and tartar contribute to bad breath, gum disease, and eventually the loss of teeth. While we brush our teeth several times a day to remove this film, there is room for improvement in the tools we use. Kim Develops Bioelectric Effect Toothbrushalumni NEWS The A.
